3-> U.S. SENDS OFFICIAL TO WARN SALVADOR ON RIGHTS ABUSES
The Reagan Administration, disturbed about the disappearance of Salvadoran opposition figures last week, has dispatched a high official to San Salvador to press home to the authorities there that the United States will end military aid unless the human rights situation improves. The official, Under Secretary of Defense Fred C. Ikle, left for El Salvador Monday night. He is scheduled to meet the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, and other senior Salvadoran officials after he arrives Wednesday to inform them that the Reagan Administration will meet strong - possibly overwhelming - Congressional opposition to further military aid because of two recent events in San Salvador. One of these is the seizure of about 15 leftists and labor leaders by heavily armed men in civilian dress last week. Under strong pressure from the United States Embassy to find out the whererabouts of the victims, the Defense Ministry in San Salvador said today that eight were in the custody of the armed forces and would be tried as terrorists. But the fate of the seven others remains unclear. Strong Reaction Expected The other issue is the recent failure of two Salvadoran judges to take action against a politically well-connected military officer who had been linked to the killing of two American land reform specialists and a Salvadoran official at the Sheraton Hotel in San Salvador in January 1981. Meanwhile, in Mexico City, El Salvador's guerrilla-led opposition announced that it had proposed negotiations without conditions with the Salvadoran Government aimed at ending the country's civil war. Initial reactions from San Salvador were said to be negative.(Page A8.) Administration officials said Mr. Ikle is expected to make it plain to Salvadoran officials that Congress, once it resumes session late in November, is expected to react strongly to the two cases. 'Lot of Pressure' Noted Beyond this, Administration officials said, President Reagan is scheduled to certify in January that El Salvador has made progress in human rights and economic and political improvements. Such a step, which must take place every six months as a condition for continued military aid to El Salvador, will meet powerful Congressional opposition if the issues are unresolved. One informed Congressional aide said today that ''a lot of pressure'' was being bought to bear on Defense Minister Garcia, who is responsible for all security forces. The aide said that the United States had informed the Salvadoran Government that the recent kidnappings posed ''critical'' difficulties for Administration efforts to prove that human rights were improving. On the killings of the two American land-program consultants, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman, and the Salvadoran head of the redistribution program, Rodolfo Viera, one Administration official said it was ''difficult and vexing'' to attempt to justify the failure of the Salvadoran judicial system to try the two politically connected suspects. ''I don't know how to deal with this in the context of certification,'' the official said. ''The issue is a very serious one for us. What do we do about it?'' 'Crucial Symbolic Issue' Two Salvadoran judges have ruled that there is insufficient evidence against one of the suspects, Lieut. Isidro Lopez Sibrian, although investigations and testimony have linked him to the killings. Another officer implicated in the case, who was attached to the Salvadoran Embassy in Costa Rica, has disappeared in Guatemala. A State Department official said that the case, which has stirred special interest here because the two Americans worked for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., had turned into a ''crucial symbolic issue.'' ''We have told the Salvadorans time and time again how crucial this case is for the Americans,'' the official said. ''What you're seeing now is another example of why that judicial system has collapsed. There's a widely held suspicion that the judges involved have had their families threatened with death.'' The official said that Administration officials had in recent weeks pressed General Garcia, as well as President Magana, to resolve the murder case. But the official added, ''If the night before a decision, someone tells a judge that we know your children and they're dead at noon if you act against a defendant, then no degree of commitment by Magana and Garcia will eliminate the threat.'' ''The question is whether the investigation and court case will continue despite the threats,'' the official said. ---- Military Holding 8 Men SAN SALVADOR, Oct. 26 (AP) -The Salvadoran military has announced it is holding on terrorism charges eight leftist and labor leaders who disappeared last week. Seven others are still missing. ''All are held in a military corps waiting military trial for their participation and organization, and for being leaders of terrorist delinquent groups which have brought pain to the Salvadoran family,'' said a bulletin issued late Monday by the Defense Ministry's press office. The bulletin said all eight had participated in guerrilla groups - five Salvadoran groups are linked as the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front - or in ''political support groups'' of the front. The eight were accused of involvement in the guerrilla campaign of economic sabotage in the three-year-old battle against the United States-supported Government.

4-> 4,500 BUILDINGS TO LOSE RENT SUBSIDIES
About 4,500 apartment houses in New York City will be dropped from rent-stabilization rolls this week because their owners failed to pay dues to the group that represents them, the organization said yesterday. Under the l aw, apartments in these buildings, which account for more than 9 p ercent of those on the group's rolls, would now come under rent co ntrol. In announcing the move, the Rent Stabilization Association forecast that many of these buildings would ultimately be abandoned or, in the case of tax default, would wind up in city ownership, under which rents could be higher than those under stablization. According to Sheldon C. Katz, chairman of the association, rents in the control program would be 20 to 30 percent below those under stabilization, which he said the building owners had already found too low. The city, he said, could charge whatever it wished and often raised rents above stabilization levels to try to put its buildings on a better economic footing. Established in 1969 The Rent Stabilization Association was established under a 1969 city law that required owners of rent-stabilized apartments to belong to it. The dues - $5 an apartment a year - go largely to finance the city's Conciliation and Appeals Board, which rules on disputes over rents. Member buildings have at least six apartments. Mr. Katz said that the situation reflected ''the depth of the city's housing crisis'' and was ''a direct re sult of the failure of regulated rents to keep pace with operating e xpenses.'' ''This couldn't come at a worse time,'' said Daniel W. Joy, a deputy commissioner in the city's office of Housing Preservation and Development, noting that Governor Carey's new budget called for cutting the state appropriation for operating the rent-control program by $1.6 million, to $10.1 million. Maximum-Base Rent He added that the city would have to identify each tenant involved in the removal from stabilization and establish for rent-control purposes a maximum base rent for each apartment. The new rent would be based on real-estate taxes, fuel and other costs. It is likely that the new rent would be below the rent-stabilized level. Some buildings have a mixture of rent-controlled and rentstabilized apartments. The city has about 8,500 residential buildings that have been taken over in tax foreclosures, with about 40,000 occupied units. Anthony B. Gliedman, the city's Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, said these buildings cost the city $30 million a year for fuel and use $60 million in community development funds, offset by rents of only $16 million to $18 million. Much of the cost, he said, is for rehabilitation, such as putting in 250 new heating systems last year. The removals from the association's rolls left its membership at 43,327 buildings containing 886,145 apartments, but Mr. Katz said the group expected to drop 3,700 more buildings in the next few weeks. A privately owned apartment dropped from rent stabilization would legally have to go into the rent-control program, which now covers 250,000 apartments. Mr. Joy suggested that city and association officials check with the owners to see if they were ''aware of the economic consequences'' of their dropping out of the stabilization program. 'A Phased Transfer' He said he hoped the association would make ''a phased transfer'' because otherwise the city would face ''an overwhelming administrative workload.'' Commissioner Gliedman said some ''devastated'' neighborhoods have ''rents established by the market well below those allowed by rent stabilization or rent control.'' Thus, he said, some building owners might no longer consider it worthwhile to belong to a system setting rents that in practice they could not collect. He said he hoped administrative tactics could be worked out so that there would be no substantial diversion of city personnel to set artificial rents when these workers could be dealing with such needs as rent exemptions for low-income elderly people, rent decreases for insufficient services or rent increases for new equipment. Those whose removal from the Rent Stabilization Association was announced yesterday fell into four categories - 2,418 buildings, with 18,000 apartments, which Mr. Katz said were ''marginal'' and no longer able to keep operating under rent stabilization; 1,364 already taken over by the city; 446 ''no longer habitable'' or already demolished or under court order to be vacated, and 272 converted to cooperatives or condominiums or otherwise ineligible. When it was started in 1969, the stabilization program was mainly for apartments built after Feb. 1, 1947, but it later took in apartments that had been under rent control as they were vacated. Apartments built after Jan. 1, 1974, are covered by rent stabilization if they came under some specific benefit such as realestate ta x abatement or rehabilitation loans. Apartments in the state's Mitch ell-Lama program are under separate rent regulation. Higher Rents Sought Mr. Katz's group has called for higher rents than those granted by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. He said he would ''guess that 80 percent or more'' of the buildings dropped ''would never survive as housing'' and most of the others would go into city hands. The association, he said, expects about 10 percent of the rentcontrolled apartments to become vacant each year and come under stabilization. But he said conversions to cooperatives and condominiums were increasing, and ''a lot have been in the pipeline'' that have not yet dropped out of the stabilization program. There are about 20,000 individual owners in the association and they have been paying about $4 million a year in dues, of which $2.5 million has gone to support the Conciliation and Appeals Board.

5-> U.S. CLINCHES DAVIS CUP
John McEnroe is the best doubles player in tennis. Today, teaming with Peter Fleming, he again demonstrated his excellence during a 6-3, 6-4, 9-7 victory over Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte of France that gave the United States an unbeatable 3-0 lead and clinched the Davis Cup. It was the 28th title for the Americans since Dwight Filley Davis donated the first International Lawn Tennis Challenge Trophy in 1900. The 23-year-old McEnroe has played on four of those victorious American squads since 1978, and he ranked this series, with one final day of singles remaining, near the top. ''Each one is different and each one's nice in its own way,'' McEnroe said after today's 2-hour-10-minute match, before a capacity crowd of 14,000 in the Palais des Sports. ''This was one of the best, if not the best, because we beat their team in front of a large crowd and played well, and I played on my worst surface and won the matches. Argentina, when we beat them last year in Cincinnati, was probably the most exciting final I was involved in. This and Argentina were definitely the two biggest.'' Today's victory extended the McEnroe-Fleming unbeaten Davis Cup doubles record to 9-0. They lost only one set in the four matches this year that included India, Sweden and Australia. As the winning team, the Americans will collect $200,000, and members of the French squad will split $100,000. Despite a 4-hour-21-minute singles marathon Friday against Noah that left him aching, McEnroe was the dominant figure on the court today. He never came within a point of losing his serve and served out every set. Even more impressive, of the 11 points that France won in McEnroe's 10 service games, McEnroe did not commit a single error. ''He's an extraordinary player,'' said Jean-Paul Loth, the French captain. ''He's shown us these past few days he's an extraordinary player on all surfaces. The difference is, of course, that he plays extremely well at the important moments. He returns serve real well and we saw today how good he is at the net.'' Arthur Ashe, the American captain, was impressed but not surprised by McEnroe's performance on the slow red-clay court. ''This is normal,'' Ashe said. ''The guy's the most talented player ever to play the game.'' Asked to elaborate on McEnroe's versatility as the world's topranked doubles player on the men's computer, Ashe said: ''He's the best doubles player I've ever seen. He has more shots than anybody, he has more control over his body physically. His hand-eye coordination is probably the best of anybody except Ken Rosewall. He also has great foot-eye coordination, and he can do anything with the ball. ''He can hit it on either side - forehand or backhand. He can hit with topspin. He can hit it flat. He can slice it. He can hit a drop volley. He can put the serve any place. And he has that intangible - true self-confidence. He genuinely believes that he can always raise his game if he has to.'' Leconte Is Still Learning Noah and the 19-year-old Leconte began playing doubles together onlythis year. Leconte, whose style seems to be to hit hard, harder and hardest, still lacks the finesse, touch and consistency that are a requisite for doubles. The Americans broke Leconte's serve on the seventh duece of the fourth game. McEnroe served out the first set from 15-30. The second set went on serve through the first eight games, although McEnroe again had to serve his way out of danger from 15-30 to 3-all. But from 3-4, with Fleming serving at 0-15, the Americans dominated the net, winning crisp volleying exchanges, and swept the last 12 points of the set. French hopes improved after Fleming was broken for the first time in the second game of the third set. Noah saved a break point for 3-0, and McEnroe fell behind, 0-30, in the fourth game. But then McEnroe simply took over, with an assortment of shots and off-speed pace that quieted the air horns, tambourines and rhythmic hand-clapping in the arena. Service winners. Reflex volleys off the hip and shoetops, sometimes from impossible positions. Half-volleys. Stinging, sharply angled forehand cross-court returns that set up easy putaways for Fleming at the net. One subtle tipoff to McEnroe's feel for the ball are his hands. While waiting to receive serve or standing near the net, his hands flick from his shorts to his racquet and back, as if he were finetuning a guitar. The ritual seems to provide a stimulus for McEnroe's incredible racquet control and touch. With Noah serving at 7-all, 30-40, McEnroe drove a forehand pass down the line for the break, backing away from the ball, after his aggressive cross-court backhand return of a first serve that nullified Noah's approach volley. Fleming Plays Second Fiddle Being on the same court with McEnroe has been a plus and minus for the 6-foot-5-inch Fleming, who is trying to regenerate a singles game that once was among the world's top 10 but now has been reduced to qualifying at many tournaments. Fleming and McEnroe work as a team because they complement each other tactically and are genuinely good friends. But Fleming is conscious of his secondary role. ''He played very well today,'' Fleming said, ''but he always plays well, it seems. I can count the number of matches he's played badly on one hand or less. He was very steady. That's why we're a consistently good team. When we play very well, I have to play well. ''The reason we reach so many finals is about 95 percent because of him. He always plays at such a high level. I almost think it's bad probably for me just because I expect him to play that well. And maybe I don't ask as much out of myself as I should.'' McEnroe undoubtedly could have his choice of partners. But he sincerely prefers Fleming, someone he trusts on and off the court. ''He's a perfect guy for me to play with,'' McEnroe said.

8-> ON WITH THE SHOW
MILLBURN THE coincidence of the Paper Mill Playhouse's grand reopening and the first full-scale American production of the long-awaited English musical ''Robert and Elizabeth'' signals a double sense of occasion. Officially proclaimed as the State Theater of New Jersey 10 years ago, the 42-year-old theater was destroyed by a fire in January 1980. Two weeks ago, a gala send-off for the redesigned and rebuilt playhouse was attended by a galaxy of stars who once played the Paper Mill, among them Joan Bennett, Joan Fontaine, Hermione Gingold, Lillian Gish, Helen Hayes and Ginger Rogers. On Nov. 5, the official reopening -with ''Robert and Elizabeth'' - took place. By then, the building costs, initially estimated at $4.5 million, had grown to $5.5 million. Of this amount, $2.2 million came from loans by six New Jersey banks. The rest came from fund raising and the $1.1 million insurance on the old building. According to Jim Thesing, the playhouse's administrative director, $1.7 million of the financing received from the banks has not yet been repaid. In contrast to the old, familiar dark wood, the new playhouse has a red and white brick exterior and is 25 feet shorter and 20 feet wider than its predecessor. Seating capacity has been increased from 972 to 1,190. There are 12 fewer rows in the orchestra, but the same number of seats (850) remain on that level, where an incline was designed to improve sightlines. The mezzanine now includes box seats and a sound control booth, and the second floor houses an art gallery. Also, thanks to a bigger orchestra pit, stage and backstage facilities, the playhouse is now equipped to present such lavish musicals as ''Robert and Elizabeth.'' The production's cost will amount to about $800,000 when the seven-week run ends on Dec. 19. ''The development of new musicals is an important part of our new mission,'' Mr. Thesing explained. For most Americans, ''Robert and Elizabeth'' is a new musical. Rumors long circulated that it was Broadway-bound, but legal entanglements involving the rights prevented an American production until now. Nevertheless, it has been seen in unauthorized summer stock stagings and in amateur streamlined versions across the country. The remainder of the Paper Mill season, which has almost 27,000 subscribers - ''That should rank us as one of the top three theaters in the country,'' Mr. Thesing said - consists of ''You Can't Take It With You'' (Jan. 12-Feb. 6), an unannounced new play (Feb. 9-March 6), ''Detective Story'' (March 9-April 3) and ''Man of LaMancha'' (May 18-June 26). ''A Chorus Line,'' which had been scheduled from April 6 to May 15, has been canceed because the rights to present a musical still running on Broadway were withheld. Another musical will be substituted. Alvin Klein

9-> GROWING UP JAPANESE
TOTTO-CHAN The Little Girl at the Window. By Tetsuko Kuroyanagi. Translated by Dorothy Britton. 195 pp. New York: Kodansha International. $9.95. TETSUKO KUROYANAGI was the kind of child who liked to talk to swallows and street musicians, who asked questions nonstop and had trouble sitting still long enough to hear the answers. Her curiosity got her into trouble at an early age - at 6 she was expelled from elementary school for opening and closing her desk top too often and staring out the window. The young schoolgirl could have grown up with the stigma of expulsion, an outcast from an educational system that in Japan is the path to status and power. But instead her mother took her to a different kind of school, where the principal listened to her chatter with grave interest and assured her that she was ''really a good girl.'' And young Totto-chan - as Tetsuko was called - grew up to be Japan's best-loved television star, the host of three shows with an audience of millions. ''Totto-chan: The Little Girl at the Window'' is the story of Miss Kuroyanagi's unconventional education in Tokyo during World War II and the values it taught her. She attended classes in old railroad cars, went on nature walks, traveled to temple fairs and hot springs and studied subjects in whatever order she pleased. At the center of the school was its founder and principal, Sosaku Kobayashi, whose love and respect for children clearly shaped the lives and outlooks of all who attended his Tomoe School. The school was especially unusual given the repression in wartime Japan. The children learned English at a time when it was labeled the devil's tongue and were spared exposure to the virulent nationalism that was required subject matter in most Japanese schools. Told in a series of anecdotes that are often poignant but never cloying, Miss Kuroyanagi's account of her school days was a Japanese best seller, breaking all previous publishing records by selling more than 5 million copies to date. Her tales of school as a joyous series of adventures contrasted sharply with the rigid, test-oriented education that most Japanese experience. Japanese readers were enraptured and more than a little wistful, and the book sparked a widespread debate within Japan over the Japanese educational system. Although Japanese is an extremely difficult language to read and write, Japan has a 99 percent literacy rate, and her students regularly score higher than their Western counterparts in math and science testing. For this record of achievement, Japanese trade long hours of studying under relentless pressure to succeed at standardized nationwide tests, but some -Miss Kuroyanagi among them - ask whether the system blunts imagination and ignores the special child. As testimony that a flexible alternative school also spurs academic achievement, Miss Kuroyanagi lists the accomplishments of Tomoe's graduates, who include an eminent physicist and East Asia's foremost authority on rare orchids. But as the book makes clear, Tomoe School offered its students far more than academic success. Many of the chapters deal with universal themes that should interest the American reader: how children learn consideration for others, how they react to death, how they treat those who are different from them. It seemed natural for the young Totto-chan to help a handicapped classmate to climb a tree for the first time and to protect him from other children's teasing. Although the book may hold particular interest for Japanese because it implicitly questions their educational system, the stories do not require any special knowledge of Japan. Indeed, they could be tales of any child growing up. Dorothy Britton, who translated the memoir from the Japanese, has taken pains to explain Japanese customs without disrupting the rhythm and pace of the narrative. Tomoe school was destroyed by American B-29 bombers in the 1945 air raids that leveled most of Tokyo, but no hint of bitterness clouds Miss Kuroyanagi's book. She tells of the principal standing among the burning ruins and asking cheerfully what kind of school to build next. The book's title comes from a Japanese expression describing people who have failed - in Japanese terms. Businessmen judged incompetent by a company are assigned seats by the window, away from the center of activity. This book is Miss Kuroyanagi's expression of thanks that she was not relegated to a seat by the window but instead allowed to grow up to be self-confident and successful - even if she did flout convention in the process.

10-> THE POET AT THE CENTER
ROBERT LOWELL A Biography. By Ian Hamilton. Illustrated. 527 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95. THOUGH there were rival claimants, Robert Lowell throned it over American poetry for 20 years. He was determined to be at the center of his age, as he thought Hart Crane had been at the center of the 20's. He dexterously maintained his position during the seedy affluence following World War II, the rebelliousness of the Vietnam generation and the slackness that came after. In the form as well as the subject matter of his poems he registered dissent. His early poems, we now learn, were in free verse. Later, under the influence of new critical theories, he revolted toward strict forms; at this point William Carlos Williams called him ''a tiger behind bars.'' He uncaged himself in ''Life Studies'' and subsequent volumes. In response to internal as well as external challenges, he adopted various strategies. His aim was to make himself a representative man, whose reactions to war, politics, love, family and friends would add up to archetypal completeness. For a man so unlike other men, it was a singular ambition. That he largely achieved it was a triumph. In ''Little Gidding'' Lowell's friend T.S. Eliot declared, ''The whole world is our hospital.'' Ian Hamilton's powerful and affecting portrait of Lowell in this biography confirms such a view. Lowell lived almost two-thirds of his 60-year span in and out of mental hospitals, pill-ridden, electrically shocked, in constant danger of going off again. His friends' plights were, many of them, cognate. At the end of Mr. Hamilton's book, as at the end of a Shakespearean tragedy, the landscape is littered with the dead. Delmore Schwartz, Randall Jarrell, Theodore Roethke and John Berryman, all intimate with Lowell, were cut off before him. Mr. Hamilton, a notable poet and critic, seems almost overwhelmed himself by the repeated anguishes of Lowell's ups and downs over 40 years. In the last sections of the book he allows quotations from letters and interviews with friends of Lowell's to speak for themselves as if his personal intervention was scarcely required. AND yet what is immediately impressive about the book is not the sense of doom which hangs over it from the time that Lowell, still in preparatory school, raised doubts in his parents' minds about his mental stability. It is rather the vitality of the people and their extraordinary cultivation. Anglo-American civilization reaches here a high point of ripeness. At a time when letter-writing is supposed to be out of fashion, these people write copiously and brilliantly to each other. They recriminate, they apologize, they sympathize, they ruminate in extremely subtle ways, they worry over delicacies of thought and emotion that would do credit to any culture. Expressed so well, even anguish loses some of its sting. As Mr. Hamilton makes clear, Lowell embarked upon a career of poetry with full deliberation. At 18 he came under the tutelage of Richard Eberhart at St. Mark's School and proclaimed himself to be a poet. Other young men have done as much but with less awareness that the decision must entail great changes in their lives. After two years at Harvard, of which his cousin Lawrence was president, Lowell decided he needed instruction of a more specifically literary kind. Ford Madox Ford played Virgil and brought him to meet Allen Tate and John Crowe Ransom in Tennessee. When Ransom transferred from Vanderbilt University to Kenyon College in Ohio, Lowell followed him and enrolled there. Ransom as mentor got him to read the classics and philosophy, a regimen that gave him an edge over most of his contemporaries. After graduating first of his class at Kenyon, Lowell went to Louisiana State University on a fellowship to study with Robert Penn Warren and Cleanth Brooks. The metaphysical-symbolist poem, intended to be the perfect artifact, was then the lodestar. Lowell wrote in this mode, though at first with a clotted imagery which augured that it would never altogether suit him. His intimacy with Allen Tate encouraged him to join the Catholic Church, as Tate had done, and it was from the vantage point of a believer that Lowell composed the denunciation of his time which is the subject matter of his first two books. Then he left the church with the ungallant remark that it had ''served its purpose.'' As he said also, the morality of his later verse was much the same. But he continued his education on his own, either with the help of other poets such as William Carlos Williams or Elizabeth Bishop or his sometime pupil W. D. Snodgrass. Mr. Hamilton tells how Lowell had a phase of boning up on Dutch history and literature, and living in Holland, because he felt that Italy was played out as an influence on Anglo-American poets. Yet he never confused pedantry with poetry. As his taste for metaphysical verse flagged, he strove to present feelings that would be ''raw'' rather than ''cooked,'' to use the now famous distinction. At the same time he worked very hard at his poems, as if aware that even steak tartare requires the utmost finesse in preparation. LOWELL'S childhood had been a period of mounting aggression and rebelliousness. His parents quickly became a target. He and his mother loved to argue; his father, a naval officer, did not. Mr. Hamilton wittily describes the father as a ''combination of weak character and strong lineage,'' which was very much the mother's and son's view of him. The poor man seems to have been browbeaten by his wife, and then castigated for being so. This is a point on which Mr. Hamilton might have taken a more independent line, for he recounts at least one incident that allows the ''commander'' a mind and wit of his own. Another schoolboy had said tauntingly to Robert Lowell that if God speaks only to Lowells, as the familiar rhyme said, then God must speak to them in Yiddish. Lowell asked his father about this slur and received this reply: ''Of course God speaks Yiddish. God has promised the Zionists that he will brush up on his Hebrew. He finds it hard work talking the King's English and Beacon Hill British to Bishop Lawrence. You Bostonians want everyone, even God and Calvin Coolidge, to be cold fish and close as clams.'' But Lowell continued to despise his father, for weakness, for whimsy, for conventional morality, and once knocked him down. The next day he apologized, and he continued to apologize and to despise for the rest of his life. As his father's remark implied, the Lowell heritage was not altogether a benefit. While it allowed him to take his significance for granted, it was also something to struggle against. Lowell liked to boast that he was at least partly Jewish, because he had a greatgreat-grandfather named Mordecai Myers. He took pleasure in attacking Boston, as Mr. Hamilton says, with a Boston voice. Even the matter of his first name involved him in forswearing Bobby in favor of Cal. This was a nickname given him by his schoolmates, partly for Caliban, partly for Caligula. He was Caliban because he lurched through experience, an awkward customer prone to beating up other boys. He was Caligula because of something imperious, or as Randall Jarrell termed it, ''Bismarckian.'' On the other hand, he was neither Caliban nor Caligula, but just Cal, aware of his limitations, ready with sympathy, gentle and lovable. His emotions found their outlet tortuously. In 1940, barely out of Kenyon College, he married the novelist Jean Stafford against his parents' will. It was a tempestuous marriage; Lowell was tongued with flame, and she had, as she said when it was over, a tongue like an adder. Once he broke her nose - the very nose that had already been broken when he crashed their car against a stone wall. There were times when Lowell was the prey of chemical charges that he could not control. One might suppose that such a husband would be quickly discarded, but Jean Stafford gave him up most unwillingly. In 1949 he married the novelist and critic Elizabeth Hardwick, by whom he had a daughter, Harriet. Hardwick knew beforehand of his manic-depressive cycles and did her best to cope with them. Unfortunately coping, even for someone of her intelligence and tact, was not always possible. This marriage nevertheless lasted until 1972. Then Lowell married another fiction writer, Caroline Blackwood of England's Guinness family. The strain of his illness was more than she could bear, though she tried hard to put up with it. Lowell was on his way back to Elizabeth Hardwick and their daughter when, on Sept. 12, 1977, he died in a taxi coming from Kennedy Airport. LOWELL'S career also had its public side, usually noble, sometimes foolhardy. As a boy the pugnacious Lowell wrote an essay, ''War: A Justification.'' When World War II broke out, his first impulse was to secure a commission and enlist. He was not accepted. The next one was to declare himself a conscientious objector, and in 1943 he served four months of a year's prison sentence before being paroled. In June 1965 he formally refused an invitation to the White House from President Johnson so as to make clear his opposition to the Vietnam War. Three years later, animated by the same impulse, he accompanied Senator Eugene McCarthy during the latter's unsuccessful bid for the Presidency. He was a liberal, but in 1949 he denounced the director of Yaddo as a Communist, which she was not, and was only restored to liberalism by another hospital stay. Lowell made no pretense of being unblemished or infallible. In ''Last Things, Black Pines at 4 a.m.,'' a late poem that he set great store on, he summed up his sense of himself and his art: Imperfect enough once for all at thirty, in his last days Van Gogh painted as if he were hurling everything he had: clothes, bed and furniture against the door to keep out a robber ... for imperfection is the language of art. Even the best writer in his best lines is incurably imperfect, crying of truth, knowledge, honesty, inspiration he cannot have ... Yet even if imperfection was inevitable, Lowell revised indefatigably. Many awkwardnesses remained, in spite of his efforts, but the gnarled look now seems essential to him. MR. HAMILTON'S book naturally revolves around Lowell's cycles of illness and health, with sometimes the one and sometimes the other dominant. In 1939, when he was 22, his mother consulted the psychiatrist and poet Merrill Moore about him, and through Moore consulted Carl Jung, who, according to Lowell, told his mother that if her son was as she described him, he was an incurable schizophrenic. Scarcely a year passed thereafter without one, two, three or four stays in hospitals. The treatment by electric shocks, Thorazine, lithium and other means was horrific enough. Since these were the dramatic moments of his life, they naturally claim the limelight. But there were other less dramatic things, not only his poetry but his teaching and conversation. He suffered a good deal, but suffering is not the mainspring of his art. Though he liked, as he said in the preface to ''Imitations,'' ''the dark against the grain,'' he could also be funny, funnier than the biographer has leisure to show. The testimony of old friends, on whom Mr. Hamilton naturally relies, is a little misleading, because they had so much time to rehearse their responses to Lowell's behavior. Penetrating as they are, one longs for more casual, unpremeditated glimpses from people who knew him less well and could admire, without solicitude, his wit and his heft with language. ''I am not a cripple,'' he telegraphed to his last wife, and his refusal to be or be considered one is admirable. Ian Hamilton's comments on individual poems and volumes are sharp and acute. He commands an ironic wit and is not afraid to see shortcomings when they are there. Avoiding hero worship, he offers a steady understanding. It would be useful to have his judgment of Lowell's place in American poetry and modern literature, but he clearly believes that this is the moment for close inspection rather than large perspectives. If he does not do everything, it is chiefly because the tale he has to tell, and tells so well, is as complicated as it is compelling.

ARIZONA STATE IS BEATEN, 17-13 TEMPE, Ariz., Nov. 13 (UPI) - Aaron Williams and Jacque Robinson converted two Arizona fumbles into touchdowns tonight to lead Washington to a 17-13 victory. It was the first loss of the season for the Sun Devils, and it came before a crowd of 72,021. Washington, 9-1 over all and 6-1 in the Pacific 10 Conference, can clinch its third consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl with a triumph over Washington State next weekend. Arizona State, 9-1 over all and 5-1 in the conference, could have secured the berth with a victory. Williams made a diving, one-handed catch in the second period for his score and and Robinson rushed 4 yards for the deciding touchdown and a 17-3 lead with 13:19 left in the third period. S.M.U. 34, Texas Tech 27 LUBBOCK, Tex. (AP) - Bobby Leach took an across-the-field lateral and ran 91 yards with 4 seconds to play to give Southern Methodist the victory and at least a tie for the Southwest Conference championship. S.M.U. extended the longest major college victory streak to 14. S.M.U., now 10-0 over all and 7-0 in the conference, seemed destined for a blemish on its record after Ricky Gann's 28-yard field goal with 17 seconds left tied the score for Texas Tech. Blane Smith bobbled the ensuing kickoff at the 10-yard line and dribbled the ball around until the entire Tech kickoff team was nearly upon him. He then snatched the ball, faked a handoff and rifled it across field to Leach, who dashed the distance without being touched. The play took 13 seconds. Arkansas 35, Texas A&M 0 LITTLE ROCK (AP) - Tom Jones, a quarterback who was benched last week, accounted for three touchdowns and set up another with a fourth-down pass completion. The victory set up a Southwest Conference showdown next week in Dallas between the Razorbacks and S.M.U. Arkansas is 8-1 over all and 5-1 in league play. Texas 38, T.C.U. 21 FORT WORTH (AP) - Texas won with Darryl Clark scoring two secondhalf touchdowns in the Southwest Conference game. With Coach F.A. Dry's job reportedly in jeopardy, Texas Christian struck for 18 points and a 21-17 halftime. Texas drove 72 yards in the third period and Clark ran 7 for the decisive touchdown. U.C.L.A. 38, Stanford 35 PASADENA, Calif. (AP) - Tom Ramsey threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score in winning a quarterback duel with John Elway in a Pacific-10 Conference game. A crowd of 78,452 watched Ramsey, who leads the nation in passing efficiency, complete his first eight passes and finished with 19 completions in 27 attempts for 314 yards without an interception. Both of his scoring throws went to Jojo Townsell, on plays of 9 and 4 yards. Elway connected on 29 of his 39 passes for 352 yards and completed 10 in a row late in the game. He was intercepted once. B.Y.U. 58, San Diego St. 8 PROVO, Utah (AP) - Steve Young ran for two touchdowns and passed for two others for Brigham Young. The Cougars, 7-3 over all and 6-1 in conference play are a victory from a seventh consecutive Western Athletic Conference championship. Young, who played three quarters, connected on 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards. He also rushed for 94 yards on 13 carries. Colorado 28, Kansas 3 BOULDER, Colo. (UPI) - Richard Johnson scored four touchdowns and gained more than 200 yards of total offense for Colorado. It was the first Big Eight Conference victory for Bill McCartney, Colorado's coach. Johnson caught three touchdown passes totaling 95 yards, rushed for another score, gained 102 yards on 21 carries and ran back a kickoff 28 yards.

12-> GATEWAY: HALF-FULFILLED DREAM
IT WAS a bold break with a century-old tradition. In 1972, a Congress roused by growing urban unrest voted to lump together an amalgam of obsolete military emplacements, underfinanced state parks and decrepit beachfront facilities around New York Harbor to form America's newest national park: Gateway National Recreation Area. The key concept supporting the outlandish proposal to develop a national park that lacked the overpowering beauty of Yellowstone (established in 1872) or the awesomeness of the Grand Canyon was to bring ''parks to the people'' - to the millions in the Greater New York-New Jersey metropolitan area who would never visit the western parks. Essential to the fulfillment of that promise was a system that would make the 26,000 acres of Gateway accessible to the millions of recreation seekers in the region. Today, 10 years after Gateway was approved by Congress, the park's four units in New Jersey and New York are among the most heavily used in the national park system. However, they are still beyond reach for many more people because of the lack of a viable transportation system. ''If I had to pick one priority for developing Gateway,'' said Hooper Brooks, director of the Gateway Citizens Committee, a group advocating development of the park, ''it would be getting ferry service and proper mass transportation to the park. This would really make Gateway accessible to those in the metropolitan area for whom the concept was originally developed.'' The Gateway National Recreation Area comprises four units: Sandy Hook, several beaches on Staten Island, Breezy Point and Jacob Riis Park in Brooklyn and the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge near John F. Kennedy International Airport. They are scattered around the mouth of Lower New York Bay like nails in a horseshoe, and from the historic lighthouse at Sandy Hook it is possible to see across the seven miles of open water to the towers of the Jacob Riis bathhouse. Last year, Gateway attracted 9.5 million visitors, more than Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon combined. Sandy Hook alone attracted nearly two million visitors in 1981. Those who swam at Sandy Hook's free beaches did not typically travel across country to get there. According to National Park Service officials, most of the park's visitors came from as close as Monmouth and Middlesex Counties. And most -roughly 98 percent of them - came by car. Automobile traffic on Sandy Hook has become as much a fixture of life there as the holly forests or dune formations. Derickson W. Bennett, a member of the Gateway Citizens Committee and executive director of the American Littoral Society, which has its headquarters in one of the old Army buildings at Fort Hancock on the tip of Sandy Hook, explained how, during the summer, the people who work at Sandy Hook have adapted their routines to match the pattern of traffic. ''Everyone who is a veteran automobile driver out here knows the ebbs and flows of the traffic,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''The secret is to get here early or about 1:30 P.M., when everybody is already settled in for the day. If we have a meeting, we schedule it around those times.'' Attempts have been made to encourage mass-transit ridership. Using money appropriated by Congress, the Park Service subsidized a connecting bus link from the Red Bank railroad station to Sandy Hook's beaches from July 4 to Labor Day, 1980. However, old habits die hard. Ridership was so low that the package was discontinued. Previous attempts to get people out of their cars also failed. Direct bus service to Sandy Hook from Newark and Plainfield could not generate enough revenues to break even, and a three-year experiment with a free shuttle bus from the mainland up through the spine of The Hook was canceled in 1981 for lack of interest. Each year, some 450,000 automobiles enter Sandy Hook. William R. Shields, who heads the Park Service staff there, has been on the job for only six weeks, but the future of transportation in the area already has become clear to him. ''Our goal is to make Sandy Hook accessible to more people,'' Mr. Shields said. ''We're not thinking about buses - that's in the longrange planning. Right now, we're just trying to concentrate on the automobile.'' That Sandy Hook was not meant to be used by people in cars is obvious from the layout of the delicate spit of sand jutting into the ocean. Long and narrow, its holly forests and sand dunes have been split in two by the macadam road running from one end to the other. END LEAD GATE - P.U. 1ST & LAST AD 1ST & LAST AD GATE And as if testing the resolve of the Park Service, ocean storms continually pound at the base of Sandy Hook, scraping away the sand and threatening to turn the area into an island. Earlier this year, the battle was almost lost; the four-lane road was wiped out by a storm and a detour of gravel and clay had to be rigged. Congress has provided nearly $7 million this year to rebuild the section of road and restore some of the beaches and parking spaces that washed out with the tide. Park administrators also plan to use a part of that legislation to solve some of their long-range problems with automobiles on The Hook. When Congress appropriated the $7 million, it mandated that the money be paid back through revenues received from a road user's fee assessed against every vehicle entering Sandy Hook. Park officials believe they can structure the fee system to influence how people decide to travel to the park. Kevin B. Tremble, a transportation planner with the Park Service's regional headquarters in New York City, said that the user's fee might be waived for those who arrived before the rush hour and for those who walked or bicycled in. The fees, Mr. Tremble indicated, will most likely be comparable to the vehicle charge of $4 a day at Island Beach State Park on weekends. The fees will probably be put into effect next Memorial Day. Instituting a fee may solve some of the traffic problems at Sandy Hook, but it is not seen as a final resolution to the question of accessibility and overcrowding. Park officials expect any dropoff in attendance caused by the fees to be more than compensated for by the additional visitors willing to pay if it means they will be guaranteed a parking space. Last summer, the gates at Sandy Hook were closed on 22 different occasions because the 5,000 parking spaces were filled. Most of the activity on Sandy Hook takes place at the southern end, fairly close to the park entrance, which adjoins Highlands and Sea Bright. Beaches at the northern tip - those on the ocean side of Fort Hancock -generally are underused because access and facilities are limited. Mr. Shields said that one of his priorities for improving the park's operations would be to funnel more activities to the northern end of The Hook, both to relieve the pressure on the alreadyestablished beaches and to accommodate more visitors. The northern tip of the park - it is occupied by some 80 military buildings at Fort Hancock, as well as a Coast Guard station and the lighthouse - is open to those holding special passes available at the Visitors Center. The center is near the park entrance. Park administrators believe that the fort, which the Army abandoned in the 1960's, has major recreational potential. However, the question yet to be answered is how to pay for the renovation and upkeep of the fort's rundown facilities. Gateway's capital budget has been practically eliminated, and Robert W. McIntosh Jr., superintendent of the recreational area, likened the situation to ''throwing nickels and dimes at a big dollar problem.'' ''I don't expect the big dollar package to come, at least not in this decade,'' he said. ''Consequently, we're looking for other ways in which to do the job.'' The direction in which Mr. McIntosh is searching points to the private sector, which he hopes will participate in a partnership with the Park Service. Under plans now being considered, private interests would become involved in projects such as converting the stately ''officers row'' housing, which faces the bay side of The Hook, into profit-making summer rentals. Other options include establishing conference centers, restaurants and a crafts village. Mr. McIntosh said that realization of the plan could take up to five years. The development of Gateway National Recreation Area has taken longer than envisioned when the park was authorized in 1972. For one, the process of drawing up plans took two years. Then, when the capital projects to unify the park were finalized, financing was shelved because the national economy had started to backslide. Other complications also interfered. For example, primary segments of the Gateway complex are still owned privately or by the military. Fort Wadsworth, which occupies a picturesque plot of Staten Island beachfront just below the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, was to be turned over to the Park Service two years ago. The contract was scuttled shortly before it was supposed to take effect because the Navy Resale Supply Office decided to locate there, and the Army also made plans to house personnel in some of the fort's barracks. The delay prompted the Gateway Citizens Committee and other groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the New York City Parks Council, to bring suit. They charged the Defense Department and the Navy with defying the will of Congress, which had intended, in the original Gateway legislation, that Fort Wadsworth be deeded to the Park Service. One reason the fort is such an important part of Gateway is its potential as a docking facility for water-borne transportation linking the four units of the park. Mr. McIntosh describes ferry service as ''the dream of dreams'' of the Gateway planners, who foresaw the day when visitors would be able to travel easily from one unit of the park to the other on speedy vessels. At times, though, the financial obstacles standing in the way of ferry service have seemed insurmountable, and in 10 years not even a subsidized demonstration project has been attempted. ''I personally believe that it will not happen independently just as a water-borne transportation system for Gateway,'' Mr. McIntosh said. He has frequently said that ferry service for all of Gateway would have to be combined with regular commuter runs from points in New Jersey or Brooklyn to Manhattan. There has been some interest lately in such an arrangement. Arthur E. Imperatore, owner of A-P-A Transport in North Bergen, recently purchased 350 acres of waterfront land along the Hudson River in Weehawken and West New York. Last week, Mr. Imperatore applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission for permission to operate a ferry between the new city he plans to develop on the land and New York City. The permit application was written broadly enough to cover the operation of ancillary service to the Gateway units. ''I'm not looking to rush into this thing, but there is an opportunity,'' Mr. Imperatore said. ''It might be a loser for a while, but if people got used to the idea of traveling down (to Gateway) to facilities that would lend themselves to restaurants and other amenities, it might be that you will see over a period of time totally new recreational habits developed.'' Mr. McIntosh and other administrators admit that Gateway cannot yet keep the promise that it will be accessible to all the people who want to use it. While some have suggested that the four units will never function together and thus should be split to stand as independent parks, others see merit in maintaining the idea of a consolidated Gateway. ''The combined administration of the park presents a unified voice against the threat to any section of the park,'' said Gordon N. Litwin, a Newark attorney who is a member of the Gateway Advisory Commission, a group that reviews the park's operations. Although it has not reached its potential, the park ''is available now,'' Mr. Litwin said. ''The fact that it is one of the most used parks in the nation attests to its availability.'' But he contended that a unified harbor-wide Gateway will be a reality only when ferries make the run from one unit to the other. ''When that happens, the water will become a part of the backyard of the park,'' Mr. Litwin said. ''Land that fronts on the water is, in a sense, endless.''

13-> Q & A; An Expired Abatement
Question: My J-51 tax abatement expired June 30. I have a fiveapartment brownstone on West 91st Street. When I bought it nine years ago, the building was already rented and had been renovated by someone who converted it from a rooming house. For lease renewals, am I under any restrictions regarding rents that I may charge? And what may I charge if an apartment becomes vacant?... I.M.V., Manhattan Answer:In determining what happens to a building when its J-51 abatement expires, it is necessary to look at the status of each apartment as if the building never had the abatement, according to Howard Malatzky, counsel to the Office of Rent and Housing Maintenance. There are different rules covering different periods, the rules are complex and you must find out which ones apply by researching the original status of the units. However, in all but rare cases any building that had fewer than six units in 1974 will not continue under rent stabilization after an abatement ends. This means you may charge any rent you want as leases expire or as the apartments become vacant, according to Gary M. Rosenberg, a partner in Rosenberg and Estis, attorneys for the Community Housing Improvement Program and the Bronx Realty Advisory Board. If you have additional questions, you might check with the Rent Stabilization Association at 944-4700 or the city's Owners Management Assistance Unit at 566-3918. A Sublet Needs Approval Question: I have been living in a rent-controlled apartment for the past 25 years. I am considering buying a cooperative apartment in the city. Is it possible for me to sublet my apartment furnished without my landlord's approval?... R.C., Queens Answer:It is not legal for you to sublet your apartment without your landlord's approval. Your landlord could take action to evict your subtenant. Harry Michelson, general counsel to the Division of Rent Control, says he can think of only one example in which subletting would be permitted in a rentcontrolled apartment and that is if at some time in the past, you signed an agreement with the landlord giving you that right in exchange for an increase in rent. Finding a Lawyer Question: Could you recommend a housing lawyer?... R.R., Manhattan Answer:We cannot recommend lawyers but the Legal Referral Service can. The organization is sponsored by the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the New York County Lawyers Association. The service prefers that you telephone (575-1810) between 10 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. There is no charge for the referral and the lawyer will charge no more than $25 for the first half-hour consultation. Is a 'Flip Charge' Legal? Question: Recently the board of directors of my cooperative passed a ''flip charge'' of 1 percent on all apartment sales in our building and a 10 percent charge for subleasing, payable at the start of the sublease. Is this legal?... B.F., Manhattan. Answer:The answer lies in the bylaws and proprietary leases of your building. Many standard proprietary leases allow the board to institute any fees it needs to run the building, including surcharges for subleases. Mary Ann Rothman, administrator of the Council of New York Cooperatives, says that in the case of a resale or flip fee, a bylaw amendment may be required. If your lease and bylaws are unclear, you should ask a lawyer to check them for you.

14-> SOUND; A GUIDE TO LOW-COST AUDIO
Future anthropologists, taking the measure of our age, may observe that in industrial societies the observation of holidays is usually linked with the preparation of shopping lists. This is quite traditional, and those who take long views recall that, throughout the various phases of social development, ritual often reflects the economic process. At any rate, during the season of Advent, this desk piles up with letters urging me to forgo general topics and discursive comment and come up instead with specific suggestions for listeners planning to treat themselves to new sound gear for Christmas. So, enough of rumination and into the fray of the marketplace. Because of the great number of competitive audio products offering roughly equivalent performance at comparable prices, any list of suggestions is necessarily selective, and our attempt here is to pinpoint components offering better than average value, starting today with the bottom bracket. And, because cost is usually a primary consideration for buyers in this price class, it should be pointed out that the list prices given here are often discounted by retailers. The low-cost equipment cited here is particularly suited for small apartments where power ratings of 20 watts or thereabouts suffice to fill rooms of modest size with music at realistic volume levels. And since output power is one of the costlier ingredients of a sound system, this in itself is a decisive economy factor. Despite the rising popularity of cassettes, the turntable remains a basic program source for most home music systems, and budget-buyers will welcome Dual's decision to put its highly regarded ULM (Ultra Light Mass) tonearm on its lowest-priced turntable, the new Model 505-1, which lists for $130. Another notably well-designed low-cost turntable, the Pioneer PL-2 ($130) employs a carbon-fiber arm for the sake of lightness. Other very good models in this price range include the Kenwood KD-22R ($129), the Onkyo CP-1000A ($125) and the Technics SL-B20 ($125). They all are semi-automatic, which means that the tonearm automatically returns to its resting position at the end of a record, and thanks to their precision bearings and smooth drive motors, virtually no rumble is to be heard, especially when playing through smaller speakers which do not emphasize the lower frequencies where rumble resides. Such turntables might logically be fitted with phono cartridges such as Audio Technica's AT-110E, or Pickering's V-15 Micro IV AME (both listing at $65) or the highly capable and remarkably cheap Grado GCE-1 for $15. Budget buyers naturally gravitate toward receivers (tuner-amplifier combinations) as the electronic center of their systems because they usually offer better dollar value than separate tuners and amplifiers. This is especially true for the current crop of low-cost receivers, some of which incorporate such refinements as digital tuning,formerly found only in more expensive models. A notable case in point is Akai's AA-R22, which delivers 30 watts per channel and lists for $250. Those willing to forgo digital tuning can get otherwise equivalent receivers with conventional tuning dials for even less. For example, Onkyo's TX-11, rated at 20 watts per channel, carries a price tag of $200, as does Hitachi's SR-2001 with a power output of 25 watts per channel. Both use servo-lock tuning systems, which keep the wanted station from drifting out of tune and insure accurate tuning by means of an indicator which lights up when you reach the right spot on the dial. Listeners who like single-touch tuning of their favorite stations can get this feature at the lowest cost in Sony's STR-VX1 ($225) which is rated at 22 watts per channel and combines a servolock slide-dial tuning system with one-touch tuning keys for five preset stations. Among speakers, low-cost choices for the musically astute are likely to include Boston Acoustics' A-40 ($75), the Acoustic Research AR-18S ($90) and the Genesis 1 ($110). Except for a certain reticence in matters of low bass - inevitable in speakers that are small, inexpensive, or both - these models achieve a pleasing overall sound balance and show proper respect for the character of individual instruments and voices. Surprisingly, they even manage to keep orchestral textures quite lucid at moderate volume levels. What's more, they are not power-hungry and will do well with any of the relatively low-powered receivers mentioned above. In the area of cassette decks, even budget models have lately achieved steady pitch - minus the tremulant quiver technically called flutter, which has plagued cheap recorders in the past. The improvement is mainly due to better tape drives that move the tape at a steadier speed. Even a deck listing for as little as $180 - the Sony TC-FX33 - has wow and flutter reduced to 0.05 percent, making it nearly imperceptible. Similarly favorable specifications are to be found on such cassette decks as the Akai CS-F14, the Pioneer CT-4, and Kenwood's KX-5011. They all list for about $200 and definitely deserve a hearing from quality-conscious budget buyers. None of these budget items aspires to the higher reaches of audio technology, but their sound needs no excuse. Listeners to whom sheer sonics are not the predominant element in the experience of music will find them durable sources of pleasure.

15-> NEWARK DRIVE ON TRUANCY CALLED 'BIG SUCCESS'
Classroom attendance has improved by as much as 8 percent since a joint school and police task force began searching for truants in video game arcades, record stores and restaurants last March, officials say. ''It's been a big success so far,'' said Dr. Columbus Salley, the Executive Superintendent of Schools. ''We are definitely seeing that the program is bringing kids back into the schools.'' The program to deal with Newark's chronic truancy problem was initiated last spring in meetings between Dr. Salley and the city's Police Director, Hubert Williams. Dr. Salley said at the time that on any given day, about 25 percent of the 15,000 youngsters in the junior and senior high schools were not in their classrooms, with about 10 percent of those absent without legitimate reason. The 60,000-student district is New Jersey's largest. School counselors had expressed reluctance to seek truants in high-crime areas. Hangouts Checked Dr. Salley suggested that one plainclothes policeman be assigned to each team of two attendance counselors, ''more or less for protection, not law enforcement.'' The result was the task force, believed to be the first such program in the country. The sweep for truants begins each school day at about 10 A.M., when five three-man teams start checking stores and streets known to be youth hangouts. Truants are placed on school buses and taken to a task force center, and school officials and parents are notified. An effort is then made to determine the reason for a student's truancy and to find ways to end it, according to Dr. Salley. ''Many have said that nobody seemed to care,'' Mr. Williams, the Police Director, said. ''This kind of effort demonstrates to the kids that somebody really does care.'' 'Want Them in School' Students picked up for truancy three times are sent to Juvenile Court if behavior is thought to be a problem, officials say. If home life is a source of trouble, they are referred to Family Court. Dr. Salley said, however, that an improved education is the program's only goal. ''It's a plan that's predicated at getting at the root causes of why a student would rather be out of school than in,'' he said. ''We're not trying to lock these kids up. We just want them in school where they can learn something. ''Youngsters can't believe that we're serious about educating them unless we get them back in school. What we're trying to say is: We want you in school. We believe in you. We believe that you can achieve in school.'' Few Repeat Offenders More than 4,500 truants have been picked up since the program began and fewer than 2 percent are repeat offenders, according to Dr. Salley. ''There's been a significant improvement in attendance in the high schools,'' he added. ''Whether they're coming back because they want to learn, or just because they're afraid of getting caught, we'll take it either way. If we get them in school, we can give them an education.'' Officials say attendance is up by as much as 8 percent. Mr. Williams said street crimes -such as robberies, purse snatchings and shoplifting - had dropped by as much as 30 percent in areas in which the task force had concentrated. ''Crime in Newark is down, and this program has had a major impact on that,'' he said. Officials of the Board of Education say they believe the success of the task force will eventually improve the achievement levels of Newark's public school students. ''The effects of truancy and absenteeism are what hurt achievement,'' Dr. Salley said.

17-> STYLE; THE FEAR OF FLYING: ONE ATTEMPT TO CONQUER IT
The voices at the bank of telephones at Logan International Airport in Boston ranged from thrilled to ecstatic. The phrases varied, but what each person was saying in his or her own way to the family back in New York or New Jersey or Connecticut, was ''I did it.'' One might well wonder what they did, what feat could be accomplished, what problem overcome, on a 37-minute New York-Boston flight in weather so calm there was scarcely a bump. But for 32 passengers on a New York Air flight last week, a feat was accomplished and a problem, if not overcome, was considerably eased. For these were men and women who had been afraid of flying and who were on the final lap of a course offered by Fly Without Fear Inc. Some had never been able to get themselves to board a plane. Others had flown infrequently and unwillingly, hearts palpitating, hands clenched and palms sweating. The Most Courageous Thing ''If anyone were to ask me the most courageous thing I've ever done, I'd have to say this was it,'' said Marie Picciano of Crotonon-Hudson, who had never flown before. ''I've never worried about the plane crashing, but I've always been afraid of being closed in. I thought I might get hysterical and bang on the walls, but now I know I won't lose control of myself. I feel like I have accomplished something.'' Mrs. Picciano was accompanied by her son James and her husband, Carmen, both of whom came along solely for moral support. Still, the moment the plane landed she headed for a telephone. ''I spoke to the rest of the family and my grandchildren,'' she said. ''They're thrilled.'' Even after the preflight briefing, given in an unoccupied room at La Guardia Airport by Capt. Charles Patak of New York Air, there was a moment when it seemed as though at least one member of the group would not be on the flight. ''Don't look at me,'' said Marlene Finkelstein as she hung back while others marched determinedly to the plane. Her husband, who, she said, loves to fly, was at her side, silently encouraging. On a few occasions members of Fly Without Fear have actually walked off the plane just before takeoff, and a few have never been able to bring themselves to get on, according to those who run the course. ''She's better than she used to be,'' Miss Finkelstein's husband said. ''She got worked up a month and a half or two months before her last trip. Now she's fine until maybe the last hour before the flight.'' Miss Finkelstein went through the course about three years ago, but, she said, ''if you don't continue to fly your fear returns.'' ''I don't like being suspended at 25,000 feet, that's what it comes down to,'' she added. ''I don't know whether the fear will ever go away completely, but I'll have to cope with it.'' An administrative assistant in marketing for a publishing house, Miss Finkelstein said that she had noticed a difference in the makeup of the group since she attended the course the first time in 1979. ''Then there were mostly housewives,'' she said. ''Now, there are a lot of business people, men and women. It's as though they're coming out of the closet and admitting their fear.'' Carol Gross, and her husband, Herbert, run Fly Without Fear, which was founded in 1969 by her father, the late Nate Cott. The course costs $15 a session, with 10 to 12 consecutive sessions suggested for best results. It is made up of three components. First is education about aviation, which includes a visit to a radar tower and flight simulator and lectures by captains, air traffic controllers and flight attendants. Mrs. Gross described the second component as ''desensitization -small shots of what they are allergic to,'' likening fear of flying to an allergy. This section begins with a meeting at the airport and later progresses to boarding a stationary aircraft and sitting in a plane that simply taxis down the runway. The course eventually reaches the third phase, a short flight. Later many students take four-day weekend flights to the Bahamas or Bermuda. The desensitization section also includes relaxation techniques and lectures from a biofeedback expert and a psychologist. Group support is important. ''It's not misery loves company but strength in numbers,'' Mrs. Gross said. Arnie Magenheim, principal of a Staten Island elementary school, said, ''It helps when you have 30 other people on the plane with the same feelings and fears you have.'' He said he had flown 20 or 30 times but was always apprehensive and because he had not flown in two years his fear had built up. He was pleased at his degree of relaxation on the run to Boston. ''I just phoned home,'' he announced before the return trip to New York. ''My wife told me that my daughter had telephoned from England to ask if I had really gone on the flight.'' 'Learn to Live With Your Fears' ''I can relate to these people because I have fears,'' Captain Patak said. ''I don't like standing on ladders and I can't look down from the Empire State Building. You have to learn to live with your fears.'' Captain Patak, who had lectured the group before, announced during the preflight briefing that he was not going to be flying the plane that night because he had already worked the maximum number of hours allowed by Federal regulations. There was a murmur of disappointment. ''But I'm going to go on the trip with you,'' he said. ''And Capt. Ron Hill, who is flying tonight, has 6,000 to 7,000 hours of DC-9 time and 13,000 hours of flight time. If anyone can do better landings than I can, it's he.'' Some smiles returned to apprehensive faces. Captain Patak also announced that members of the group would be boarded first and that any announcements during the flight that referred to ''the family'' would be directed at them. ''If we address the announcements to the Fly Without Fear group, the other passengers will gawk at you,'' he said. ''When we get to the plane you'll get on board like normal people.'' There was a big laugh. Once on board, while many of the group were still rigid with apprehension, Captain Hill did make an announcement. ''I'd like to extend a special welcome to Charlie's family,'' he said. The group giggled, and there was a noticeable lessening of tension. During the flight some members exchanged quips and cracked jokes - ''so we won't think about where we are,'' said one - and others sat quietly, some relaxed, others gripping the edges of their seats. When it was all over one of the happiest people stepping off the plane at La Guardia was Howard Tune of Keasbey, N.J. Mr. Tune, the manager of a sales office, said he had always been afraid of heights and until five years ago could not even get on a moving stairway without panicking. He had been prompted to try to overcome his fear of flying by a desire to visit his grandfather in Arizona, a close friend in Nevada and a young lady in Seattle. ''I have an incredible feeling of elation,'' Mr. Tune said as he swung out of his seat. ''It's like a curtain has been lifted.''

18-> THEATER: YIDDISH FARCE
THERE is something heartwarmingly familiar for Yiddish theater fans in ''The Showgirl,'' the musical that has opened at Town Hall under the aegis of the Shalom Yiddish Musical Comedy Theater, which is one of the more dedicated and talented preservationist groups in town. Only something familiar? Almost everything is familiar: music, plot, jokes. That's all to the good; Yiddish-theater aficionados tend, like operagoers, to relish the tried and true, with some fresh embellishments. The freshness here derives from the cast headed by the extremely gifted Mary Soreanu, from the attractive and inventive sets by Lydia Pincus-Gani and Abraham Mordoh, and from the stylish direction of Michael Greenstein. This is a turgid story that flashes back and forward, telling of a young woman of pious family who falls for the blarney of a fasttalking no-goodnik, becomes a thief, a drunkard and, finally, a fancy dressmaker with a French name and a sophisticated shop. The Yiddish action is recapped along the way in English. The company is to be congratulated on scrupulously preserving the very essence of what was once the standard popular Second Avenue Yiddish play, compounded of melodrama, comedy, song and dance - not a blend, but an improbable series of events strung on a less likely plot line that stimulates laughter, tears, rhythmic foot-tapping and highly audible sighs. In this case, it is carried out entertainingly. Where else will you catch a Yiddish show that has one scene in a sleazy cabaret with our heroine as chanteuse, in French, yet, and another scene with two capable old hands, Yankele Alperin and Karol Latowicz, resurrecting one of those ancient doctor's-office comic routines that brings Smith and Dale to mind. The blend that does work here is of seasoned, fine Yiddish-theater performers such as Shifra Lehrer, the indefatigable Reizel Bozyk, Michael Michalovic, Karol Feldman, David Ellin, and younger people who have immersed themselves in the tradition, from David Carey, as the romantic lead, Lydia Saxton and Adrian Mandel, to the lively dancers, who are eyecatching. But it is mostly Miss Soreanu's show and, as usual, she does not disappoint those who have become accustomed to seeing her use these plays as a vehicle for her remarkable range of musical and comic styles, from lovely Yiddish staples to show tunes of the era. ''The Showgirl'' has its book written by Samuel Steinberg, original music and lyrics by Nellie Casman and additional music and lyrics by Mr. Alperin and Alexander Lustig. It is performed by an orchestra directed by Renee Solomon, with choreography by Yankele Kaluski. It is a show that will do more than jog your memories; it will set nostalgia at full gallop. Even if you have no such memories, you will be surprised to find how much you can remember here.

19-> FASHION; DRESSING UP AMERICA
Adolfo was in Beverly Hills, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, Fort Worth, Kansas City, Las Vegas, New York, Washington and San Francisco. Dallas, Chicago, New York, Kansas City and Washington (twice) were among Bill Blass's stopovers, too, not to mention Central City, Colo., Houston, Nashville, San Antonio and Philadelphia. Oscar de la Renta made some of the same calls, adding Charlotte, N.C., and New Orleans. And while James Galanos visited fewer cities than is his wont, during a 10-day stay in New York the California-based designer helped to sell more than $400,000 worth of his high-priced merchandise at the Martha specialty store. These four designers, all creators of some of the most expensive clothes made in this country, also are enthusiastic supersalesmen of their own wares. Their personal appearances, at prestigious stores and often in connection with charitable causes, add to the allure of their high price tags. And it is this category of clothes - especially those for evening - that continues to sell well, despite many otherwise disappointing sales figures. It seems an inescapable fact that a large number of women - or their providers - will always spend formidable sums of money to step out in style, no matter the state of the economy. ''I hesitate to say it, because people will think we're lying,'' says Jack Miles, the Los Angeles-based couture buyer for the I. Magnin stores in Southern California. ''But we've had a very good season - in fact business is booming.'' Says Tom Crater, the executive vice president of the Nan Duskin specialty store in Philadelphia, ''Business has been much better for 'after-5 clothes.' Galanos has been dazzling; Blass's evening clothes have been incredible. But it's very good only for clothes that cost over $1,000.'' The peripatetic designers, as well as the stationary merchants, note the results. ''This was our biggest year,'' says Adolfo, whose evening suits retail for an average of $1,200. ''We've sold beyond last year's figures,'' says Galanos, whose prices start at about $2,000 and escalate to $15,000. Talking about Galanos's recent appearance at Martha, the store's president, Lynn Manulis, praises the designer's total involvement. ''His clothes are so exquistely made, with many of them cut on the bias and with all those hand-sewn, beading details,'' she says. ''He was here every morning at 8:30, before the store opened, to check that the clothes were in impeccable condition. He worked with every single customer himself - took measurements and made sketches for alterations that he would follow up personally - he was down on the floor on his knees, pinning up pants and hems.'' Adolfo is another designer known for his intimate involvement in the presentation and selling of his clothes. When he travels, he carries a variety of his Chanellike knitted suits and his fullskirted ball gowns made of satin and velvet, packing and unpacking them himself, even attending to their pressing. And he waits on the customers. ''After a few seasons you get to know most of them,'' he says. ''It becomes a pleasant experience.'' Bill Blass, considered the pioneer of personal appearances in stores, is still energetically crisscrossing the country to promote his dramatic, flash-with-class creations, setting out almost as soon as a collection is designed. He now, however, rarely appears in a store's salon, letting his representatives engage in the actual selling. ''Whenever we go out of town, it is always in connection with a charity benefit show,'' says Blass. ''I've been to so many of these places before that I know the people; they're old friends. I think, to design clothes today, you have to know how your customer lives, what she wears and needs.'' Oscar de la Renta credits Blass with getting him moving. ''Several years ago, Blass told me, 'Hit the road, kid,' '' says de la Renta of his friend and rival designer. Since then, de la Renta has enjoyed considerable success in selling what one store president admiringly calls his ''outrageously feminine'' clothes. ''He's so charming, the women just melt,'' says Blass. It does require a certain resolve to set out on a flurry of personal appearances. As de la Renta says, ''What I hate is the idea of it, but when I get there, I have a wonderful time. Once you cross the Hudson River everyone is so relaxed and so extraordinarily nice.'' And, he adds, there is always the chance of an auxiliary, also profitable, benefit of appearing for a good cause: Women will go out and buy the designer's gowns in honor of the occasion. There are, of course, other designers of expensive evening merchandise whose clothes sell well, with or without their physical presence. ''Pauline Trigere knows her special customer's body, and her clothes are magical for them,'' says Lynn Manulis. Clothes by Mary McFadden and Carolina Herrera are also popular with many women. And Halston rarely visits a store that sells his clothes -to the regret of some merchants, who believe that his looks and grand manner would further increase sales. Interestingly, one of the biggest successes this fall has been achieved by a designer who rarely puts in a store appearance, Geoffrey Beene. Beene's evening clothes -composed of elegant fabrics and laces, beautifully combined into supple silhouettes, and selling for $2,000 and up - have been so popular that they are singled out by numerous merchants. Speaking for the country's largest chain of specialty stores, Ellin Saltzman, the vice president and corporate fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue, says, ''Geoffrey's sales have been bigger than those of most of the other name designers.'' Dawn Mello, the executive vice president of Bergdorf Goodman, agrees: ''It's our No. 1 selling evening collection.'' And Jack Miles of I. Magnin reports ''fantastic'' Beene sales, including 13 outfits to a single customer. Soon the roster of American designers who outfit women in expensive evening clothes will be joined by the sportswear superstar Calvin Klein. Buoyed by the reception of the few evening designs he made this fall - including a black suit with a rhinestone feather embroidered on one lapel, which, at $1,180 each, the Nan Duskin store sold eight of - Klein has gone overboard for spectacular evening wear for spring. There has been some adverse comment by fashion professionals about Klein's ability to compete with the others in the luxe trade, particularly when it comes to workmanship and knowledge of cutting. Yet an educated guess is that the combination of Klein's business acumen, designer flair and individual magnetism will move a good many more of these clothes out of the stores, too.

20-> 'FATHER SERGIUS,' FROM RUSSIA
''Father Sergius,'' the 1978 Russian film that opens today at the Film Forum, is like its title character -sorrowfully handsome, passionate and unworldly. It's Leo Tolstoy's posthumously published novella, adapted and directed by Igor Talankin, about a fearfully self-righteous aristocrat, Prince Stepan Kasatsky (Sergei Bondarchuk), and his lifelong search for spiritual perfection. As a young officer in the service of Czar Nicholas I, the prince is as demanding of others as he is of himself. He places honor above all and, as he says, worships the Czar as a god. On the eve of his marriage to a beautiful, equally young countess, whom he idealizes as an earthly representation of purity, she confesses that she was once the mistress of the Czar. Other ambitious officers might accept this as a kind of blessing, an unexpected advantage at court. Kasatsky, instead, is horrified. He abandons his fiancee, his estate and the worldly life to enter the church. Most of the film is concerned with the efforts of the prince, now Father Sergius, to understand the roots of his behavior, which, he eventually sees, was prompted by anger instead of faith. Still, he has the need to be the best at whatever he does. Over the years, Father Sergius becomes famous as a holy man, a hermit who lives the ascetic life and, at the door of his cave, dispenses wisdom to pilgrims - to the church's satisfaction and financial profit. He finally realizes that this life, too, is as false as the one he gave up as a young man. The Tolstoy text is translated to the screen with almost paragraph-by-paragraph fidelity, which gives the film a curious, uncinematic stateliness. The pacing is deliberate, more at the speed one reads than the way one expects to follow things on the screen. Mr. Bondarchuk is majestic rather than moving, but this is probably inevitable because the furies that are attacking Father Sergius are, with two exceptions, unseen. Only toward the end does Mr. Bondarchuk, one of the most popular Russian directors (''War and Peace'') as well as actors, have an opportunity to dramatize the character in a way the screen understands. Among the members of the supporting cast, the standout is Alla Demidova, who plays the small but important role of Father Sergius's aristocratic, once beautiful cousin, whose life becomes a sort of object lesson for the former prince. ''Father Sergius'' is a film that's entirely at the service of written literature. The Cast FATHER SERGIUS, directed by Igor Talankin; screenplay (Russian, with English subtitles) by Igor Talankin, based on a novel by Tolstoy; photography, Georgi Rerberg and Anatoly Nikolayev; music by Alfred Shnitke; produced by the Mosfilm Studio.

24-> U.S. STEEL HAS BIG LOSS; DIVIDEND HALVED TO 25
The United States Steel Corporation said yesterday that the depressed market for steel had resulted in a third-quarter loss of $82.4 million. The company also cut its dividend in half. That loss was the second largest for any quarter in the company's history and compared with net income of $536.9 million in the 1981 third quarter. Sales, bulging from the acquisition of the Marathon Oil Company, rose to $4.5 billion, from $3.5 billion. The steelmaker, the nation's largest, slashed its quarterly dividend to 25 cents a share, from 50 cents. David Roderick, chairman, said the action was prudent in light of the depressed conditions affecting the steel sector. In yesterday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, U.S. Steel fell 1 5/8 points, to 19. Steel Losses Grew Mr. Roderick said the weak steel market had pushed losses in the steel division to nearly $290 million. The nation's steel mills are operating at only 40 percent of capacity, the lowest rate since the Depression. ''The collapse of the profitable tubular product market, the lowest shipment level in over 40 years and excessive labor costs were major causes'' of the loss, Mr. Roderick said. The only bigger loss ever registered by the company was a $668.9 million deficit in the final quarter of 1979, when the company closed 10 plants and portions of others. The company did not break out earnings from Marathon Oil, but it said in a statement that the oil concern was ''quite profitable.'' The steelmaker acquired Marathon in the first quarter of this year. It paid $3.75 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in guaranteed notes. It said yesterday that it was on target in its program to divest assets and pay debt that resulted from the acquisition. However, some analysts were critical of the divestiture program. ''Look at what they are divesting, some of these things like the barges they were talking positively about a few years ago,'' said Charles Bradford, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. ''It is hard to know whether it is a well thought-out plan or whether they are just selling anything to meet the target.'' So far this year, the company has raised nearly $750 million from the sale of assets, such as an 80 percent interest in its Pittsburgh headquarters and three of its barge lines. Interest costs totaled $202.4 million in the quarter and $474.8 in the first half. Shipments Off 41% U.S. Steel's shipments in the latest quarter fell 41 percent from the 1981 period, to 2.3 million tons. So far this year, shipments have declined 38 percent from the corresponding period of 1981, to 8.2 million tons. ''They did about what I expected. All of these companies are losing about $100 a ton on steel,'' said Peter Marcus, an analyst with Paine Webber Mitchell Hutchins. National Steel reported last week that it lost $95.9 million in the third quarter, Republic Steel had a deficit of $74.6 million and Inland Steel lost $45.1 million. Mr. Roderick said did not expect the market for steel to improve soon. ''Although we have not seen any signs of a recovery in the order book, we are encouraged by the continuing reduction in inflation and by declining interest rates that could spark a modest consumer-led recovery in the fourth quarter or in early l983,'' he said. ''Plant and equipment markets, which account for three-fourths of total steel usage, will not, however, begin to improve that quickly,'' he cautioned. Wheeling-Pittsburgh The Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation reported a loss of $26 million for the third quarter. In the 1981 quarter, it earned $4.1 million, or 80 cents a share. Sales fell 29 percent, to $199.9 million, from $282.9 million. Shipments were down 28 percent, to 364,672 tons. ''The markets for steel are extremely depressed and incoming orders remain weak,'' said Dennis Carney, chairman.

25-> NEW YORKERS MAY PAY MORE, GET LESS
THE news from City Hall is rarely good this time of year, as the onerous need to balance the budget makes it impossible for politicians to carry out the more pleasant tasks of their trade - announcing a new program, a construction project or, albeit infrequently, a cut in taxes. But this year the tidings are downright grim, as was apparent from last week's developments. The budget must be cut, services will go down, taxes will go up - and that's just for starters, Mayor Koch warned. ''I'm not ruling out anything,'' he said time and again. Although the Mayor angrily rejects any suggestion that the city's current difficulties are similar to the infamous ones of 1975, when it turned out the books had been balanced mostly with mirrors, the unusual recent actions of his administration make it clear that the city is facing the most serious problems since the phrase ''fiscal crisis'' became a part of the average New Yorker's vocabulary. The municipal workforce is certain to decline after nearly four years of steady growth, officials say, and the ''essential services'' - police, fire, sanitation and education - will not be spared. Even though Mr. Koch withdrew a plan to speed the decrease through layoffs two days after he announced it, labor union leaders, summoned to City Hall and Gracie Mansion, were impressed enough by what they saw and heard to offer their help. Emerging from sessions where city budget officials presented a bottom line painted red - the deficit is estimated at $325 million this year and $1.2 billion next year - the unionists promised not to fight plans to cut about 4,000 jobs. All they asked, they said, was that, for now, the reduction be arrived at through attrition, not layoffs, and that the city not try to renegotiate the contracts recently agreed to. What the effect will be is not clear. But both sides have laid the groundwork for dirtier streets, fewer cops and larger classes in the public schools. The Mayor and his aides, after lengthy and sometimes heated meetings over the last several weeks, have prepared a ''menu'' of about a dozen taxes that they hope will bring the city $25 million this fiscal year and $200 million in the one that begins July 1. The list is said to include a tax on admissions to concerts, movies and the theater; a doubling of the auto-use tax; an increase in the commuter income tax and a 5 percent rise in the property tax. No one has accused the Koch administration of causing the new fiscal crisis by using gimmicks to meet the day-to-day bills. No one is likely to, because the system of monitors that grew out of the earlier difficulties is still in place and sleight-of-hand accounting would have had to be either overlooked or approved by the State Financial Control Board and the State Comptroller's office. The chances of either turning its back on slipshod practices are considered remote. Indeed, the control board declined to approve the four-year financial plan the city submitted in June, saying the future was riddled with uncertainties because of the then-unknown cost of the labor contract. Similarly, no one has blamed City Hall for the sharp and sudden decline in tax revenues, nor has it been faulted for overestimating them. Although taxes have yielded about $100 million less than predicted, officials say that, if anything, the city has tended in recent years to underestimate how much it would gain from such ''economically sensitive'' levies as the sales and income tax. And there is ample evidence throughout the country that the slump in the economy has been longer and deeper than almost anyone predicted. But all that is not to say that Mr. Koch has escaped criticism entirely. Some accused him of being too generous with city workers, whose new contract calls for raises of up to 16 percent over two years. The cost to the city is $1.45 billion. Members of the Citizens Budget Commission, a private group, and Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which sells bonds for the city, contend that it makes no sense to give raises so far above the inflation rate if the consequences are going to be higher taxes and reduced services. Underlying the debate is the notion that Mr. Koch, in the midst of his failed gubernatorial campaign when the labor deals were negotiated, either wasn't paying attention or agreed to them to garner union support. The Mayor denies that the contracts are anything other than reasonable. In a way, Mr. Koch helped to fuel the debate by appointing Kenneth Lipper as a new Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development earlier this month. Mr. Lipper is an investment banker who headed the Mayor's campaign finance committee. He reportedly took the job only after he was promised some authority over the city budget, which raised speculation about whether Mr. Lipper would have more turf than the other Deputy Mayors, Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Nathan Leventhal. Those and other aspects of Mr. Lipper's arrival, including the likelihood that his office will be the one closest to the Mayor's, have left some of Mr. Koch's top aides uncertain about their standing. Koch-watchers' theories about what it all means are nearly all based on the assumption that the Mayor is angry. But nobody seems to know whether he is angry with his City Hall staff because they presented him with such a severe fiscal problem after the gubernatorial race or whether he is angry because they managed to keep the lid on it while he was away campaigning. Or angry simply because he is still Mayor.

26-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; 'EVITA' CRIES FOR THE RANGERS
MINUTES before the puck is dropped, the most nervous performer in Madison Square Garden makes warbling noises deep in her throat and paces back and forth near the ice. ''The worst fear I have,'' says Patti LuPone, ''is falling on the ice. Nothing could make you look more like a fool than going out to sing the national anthem and falling on your face.'' There are other fears for Miss LuPone and any other singer who tries to master ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' in front of people who believe they have a license to boo. Patti LuPone, who has won the Tony and Drama Desk awards for ''Evita'' and is currently in David Mamet's play, ''Edmond,'' at the Provincetown Playhouse, also worries about starting in a different key from the organist and forgetting the lyrics. The custom of playing the anthem before every sports event - there is no law mandating it - dates back only to World War II. In recent years, as sports merged into show business, many performers came to enjoy strutting their stuff in front of a packed house and a television audience. Some singers try to blend their personal style with the anthem, as Jose Feliciano did, controversially, before a World Series game. Kate Smith's rousing rendition of ''God Bless America'' used to spur the Philadelphia Flyers to almost automatic victory. Patti LuPone had never sung the anthem until she discovered hockey nearly three years ago while she was singing ''Don't Cry for Me, Argentina'' on Broadway. ''I did not do matinees in Evita and I started turning on the television to watch the winter Olympics,'' Miss LuPone recalls. ''I had never seen such fervor in my life. When we won the gold medal, I loved it -the lone trumpet playing 'America the Beautiful.''' The next day she accepted a standing invitation to a Ranger game from Rob and David Ingraham, two cousins she had known growing up in Northport, L.I. When the Garden crowd started chanting ''U-S-A'' in honor of the Olympic victory, she was hooked on hockey. ''I was leading an extremely monastic life during Evita,'' she recalls. ''It took so much out of me to perform, I needed some release. The highlight of my week was to go with Rob and David to Ranger games. It had nothing to do with my profession. I could sit there and just zone out.'' Miss LuPone soon became a regular in Section 27AA, home of Sidthe-LawyerfromQueens - all one word, you understand - and other rabid fans. She proved she belonged the night the pre-game barrage of fish (thrown at the visiting Islanders) began falling into Section 27AA: Miss LuPone charged to the seat of John Ziegler, president of the league, and screamed: ''Do something!'' Another night while somebody struggled through the anthem, Rob Ingraham turned to his friend and said, ''Patti, you can do better than that.'' Ingraham, an adviser to Barry Beck, helped arrange Miss Lupone's debut before a playoff game with the Flyers. ''Toughest opening I ever made,'' she recalls. ''I have a picture of me holding my solar plexus to keep it from vibrating. I was so nervous. I guess I did all right. I can't remember.'' Her latest appearance was for the Edmonton game recently. She arrived an hour early and visited a tiny yellow-brick room in the eaves of the Garden, for a test run with Ashley Miller, the organist. He would later be able to follow her through a small window facing down to the ice. After the test, Miss LuPone chatted nervously with friends. She said '''O Canada' is a beautiful anthem'' but she labelled ''The Star Spangled Banner'' as ''impossible - the range is ridiculous. Our anthem should be 'America the Beautiful' or 'God Bless America.''' Minutes before the game, she kissed the workman who would unfurl the black rubber mat on the ice and she said, ''My hands are sweating.'' She pointed to the Rangers skating in a circle and said: ''Look, a flock of seagulls.'' Several players gave her a thumbs-up signal or a wink and one shot a puck against the plexiglass, a hockey sign of endearment. Was Miss LuPone afraid of forgetting the words, as more than one singer has done? She said: ''I'm an actress, I'm supposed to remember lines. They're also up on the message board in case I need them. I've only blown it once, at a Cosmos game in New Jersey, when I sang, 'whose broad stars and bright stripes.' Don't know why I did it but I did. The fans picked right up on it. In New York, if you make a mistake, they never let you forget.'' Suddenly she was on. She did not slip on the black mat. She clenched her hands once, then gave stirring, straight versions of both anthems. As a sign of respect, the fans held back their cheers until she was nearly finished. ''They kept it down,'' she said proudly as she trooped to her seat. During the game, Miss LuPone was as excited as any fan in 27AA, although less caustic than SidtheLawyerfromQueens, who managed to zing the Oilers for winning and the Rangers for losing. Her biggest complaint was about the fighting: ''Why do they spoil a good game by doing that?'' Miss LuPone clearly enjoyed being part of the glitter of the New York crowd that had come to see Wayne Gretzky and Co. Both Howard Cosell and Dick Enberg were there; Martina Navratilova and Nancy Lieberman had traveled overnight from Texas to see their friend, Gretzky. And David Keith, a friend of Miss LuPone, received many raves for his role as Richard Gere's buddy in the film ''An Officer and a Gentleman.'' Between periods, Miss LuPone and Keith joined Jack Krumpe, the Rangers' president, in a private club. David Merrick, the producer, was also there, and Miss LuPone used the occasion to pitch for a certain role she dearly wants. Later in the game, a clubhouse attendant walked over and delivered a note from Glenn Anderson, a friend of hers on the Oilers. When the Rangers lost, 7-2, Miss Lupone grimaced when several fans said ''Thanks a lot, Patti,'' with mock sarcasm. For Patti LuPone, performer and Ranger fan, being blamed for a loss would be even worse than falling on the ice.

27-> FORDHAM BEATEN, 14-10
Kelly Englebart, a freshman halfback, scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to lead St. Norbert's to a 14-10 victory over Fordham yesterday in the Vince Lombardi Memorial Game at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. Englebart's touchdowns came on runs of 1 yard each as St. Norbert's improved its record to 4-6. Fordham (2-8), which suffered its fourth straight defeat, built a 10-0 lead in the second quarter on Kevin Clyne's 30-yard field goal and Art Troilo's 10-yard sprint into the end zone. Kutztown State 7, C.W. Post 6 -Bill Ludy recovered a fumbled punt in the end zone with 1:16 remaining in the opening half, and John Borso kicked the extra point for the Golden Bears (4-6). Sam Flora kicked field goals of 39 and 23 yards in the second and third quarters for the Pioneers (4-7), who suffered their fourth straight setback. Flora missed a 49-yarder with 11 seconds remaining in the game. Bentley 23, Stony Brook 21 - The Falcons (9-0-1) scored 16 points in the third quarter to advance to the final of the club playoffs sanctioned by the National Collegiate Football Association. Steve Devoe's 65-yard run with an intercepted pass and, Mike Cowles's 1-yard touchdown run and a safety accounted for the third-period comeback. Jorge Taylor made scoring runs of 2 and 1 yards for the Patriots (7-2).

28-> GALLERY VIEW; THREE OFFBEAT SHOWS WITH A CONCEPTUAL BENT
No one can demolish an artist's work with quite as much flair as another artist. There's considerable evidence of this in ''The Destroyed Print,'' a show billed as a ''collaborative artwork'' between Jeff Russell and some 60 other artists at the Pratt Manhattan Center Gallery, 160 Lexington Avenue (at 30th Street, through Dec. 11). On the other hand, it's a show that despite its title deals more with ''con-'' than ''de-''struction, and in the process sets us to marveling once again at the power of art to make something out of nothing. It started like this: Two years ago, Mr. Russell (who now styles himself simply ''Jeff'') had lung problems caused by the sanding process he used in making his metal wall pieces. And at the same time he was brooding over the commercialism that has crept into the creation and marketing of artists' prints. He made a silk-screen print of his own, an arresting full-length view of himself in black and white (he's a ringer for Che Guevara): hand flung up, head tilted to one side, mouth open as if gasping for air, with a blood-red splotch on the front of his T-shirt. Then he decided to send out this message of vulnerability. ''This edition was meant to be destroyed,'' he wrote in a letter conveyed with the print to 100 colleagues, some friends but mostly strangers whose work he admired. ''Please destroy this print and return it with the enclosed postage.'' He also enclosed a button marked ''Nothing,'' as a gift for each artist, and some Xeroxed credentials, including his curriculum vitae, his Chase Visa card and his membership card in the U.S. Parachute Association. A number of the recipients successfully resisted the approach. But the majority, challenged - as artists often are -by the chance to bounce off an idea, took it up. In all, 59 responses came in - several, to be sure, simply enclosing torn fragments of the print in the return envelope. (Those are on display here, too; like any proper Conceptual event, the show is complete in its documentation.) The rest ranged from simple assertions, such as Sol LeWitt's oneliner, ''This print is destroyed,'' to elaborate reinventions, such as Toby Buonagurio's ''R.I.P. Jeff.'' Her wall piece consists of a solemnly kitschy ceramic urn for the ashes of the burned print, emblazoned in gold with the rubric ''R.I.P. Jeff,'' plus a separate ceramic panel holding three photographs of the print-burning process. There are other incinerations by Richard Artschwager, who sent back the ashes in a little plastic box; Tony King, who glued the ashes to a print fragment; David Sharpe, whose double ploy was to use the ashes as a medium to make a drawing of someone (himself?) burning the print, and Frank Owen, whose charred remnant has the outline of a craggy lunar landscape. There are stagey rearrangements of the fragments by, among others, Lucio Pozzi, Peter Hutchinson and Agnes Denes. More than a few artists have recast the print in their very own imagery: Lynda Benglis tore it into strips and hung them artfully on the wall in a Benglis-like sculpture; Robert Schechter fused torn print strips with shards of wood and spray painted the ensemble black in the usual style of his wall constructions; Susan Fortgang covered Jeff's figure with an irregular grid woven of colored papers and print fragments; and, by ingenious cutting and crayoning, William Wiley turned the entire print into a big-eyed Wiley monster. More athletically, Hanne Lauridsen, a Danish performance artist visiting on the West Coast, took the print to the beach, steeped it for a while in the sea, molded the resulting papier mache into a sculptural ball, and sent it back with Polaroids documenting her ''performance.'' The exhibition, refreshing in that it remains Conceptual, producing no ''beautiful objects'' for sale, reminds us, as the critic Kay Larson suggests in her catalogue introduction, of the fascination of 20th-century artists for ''symbolic annihilation,'' such as the demonstrations of the Futurists against art of the past and the Jean Tinguely machine that committed suicide at the Museum of Modern Art in 1960. It also provides some very interesting information on the complex ways in which artists ''process'' their ideas. And on another level, it's a touching statement about ''Jeff,'' his appeal to his peers for affirmation of his existence, and their nourishing response. From time to time there comes in the mail to art worldlings throughout the country a small, mysterious blue ''performance'' booklet put out by a woman with the fresh country name of Ida Applebroog. The booklets repeat, page after page, a deadpan human situation, drawn in the manner of an animation frame, that comments cryptically on such matters as alienation, isolation and the difficulties of communication. In one, an elderly couple hold hands, observing their shadows in what might be a storefront window. The phrase, ''Life is good, isn't it mama?,'' appears on one page as the only text. But mama says nothing. In another booklet, a young couple is seen in a car, he driving, her head on his shoulder. Their laconic conversation -phrases interspersed on pages between the drawings -consists of ''It'll cost you twenty bucks'' and ''I mean it.'' The booklet ends in an Applebroogian leap to the big world out there: two corporate types in a discussion, with the reassuring phrase, ''South Africa appears to be stable.'' Now Miss Applebroog is having a pair of shows in real space: ''Current Events'' at the Ronald Feldman Gallery, 31 Mercer Street (through Dec. 4); and ''Past Events,'' presented by the nonprofit organization Creative Time, in the 19th-century setting of the Great Hall at the New York Chamber of Commerce, 65 Liberty Street (through Dec. 18). The Feldman show consists of a new series of ''Blue Books'' (the title is taken from Robert Welch's ''Blue Book,'' which conveys the principles of the John Birch Society), which with small ''stagings'' - Rhoplex drawings on vellum - make connections between domestic difficulties and those of the world at large. There's also an ''Ocean Parkway'' series - small painted-lead sculptures of people on park benches, and a group of ''Window Pieces,'' also on vellum, which make a voyeur of the viewer, presenting as they do the intimate actions of people observed through windows. At the Chamber of Commerce, however, Miss Applebroog has a lot more fun. She's draped the speaker's rostrum of the ornate fin de siecle Great Hall in white satin, and perched on it a small, castmetal figure of a 19th-century flower girl, in virgin white, outstretched hand proffering posies. Out of her mouth flows a cartoon blurb, addressed to the dignitaries in the ranks of portraits that plaster the walls: ''Gentlemen, America is in trouble.'' Similar cartoon blurbs in proximity to individual portraits give the effect of the ''gentlemen'' responding. ''Isn't capitalism working?'' wonders Frederick H. Ecker, 39th president of the Chamber, a solid burgher wearing glasses and a mustache. ''Show me your belly button,'' demands J. Edward Simmons, 29th president of the Chamber, a worthy with a watch chain across his stomach. ''You have lovely breasts,'' muses Robert McCrea, a 19th-century swell in a white stock and sideburns. And John D. Rockefeller, another vice president of the Chamber, from 1900-04, opines, ''You can never be too white.'' Funny, if slight. She is not the most stinging of gadflies. But it's good to have Ida Applebroog around. Incidentally, when the Chamber's board of trustees met recently, the show came down. For the public, the Chamber is open from Tuesdays (excluding tomorrow) through Fridays, noon to 5:30 P.M. Walk into Leandro Katz's ''The Judas Window,'' a film-and-sculpture installation at the Whitney Museum (Madison Avenue at 75th Street), and you'll ''experience'' various ''visual and structural strategies'' designed to explore how we perceive and interpret film. There's a giant parasol covered with texts from classic adventure books; a hut of black canvas modeled on Thomas A. Edison's ''Black Maria'' film studio, and a slide projection of a carved Mayan foot, which illuminates a sandbox in front of it that bears a real footprint. That's not all. Mr. Katz, a visual artist and filmmaker, has also provided a five-part film loop showing various phases of the moon seen from various distances and interspersed with unrelated titles; a ''Judas Curtain'' of velvet that partially covers the screen, and a display case of 26 handsomely marked shells from a species of Florida tree snail. An alphabet character accompanies each shell, and above the case is a sequence of photographic enlargements keyed to the alphabetized shells. If you figure out the linguistic code, you'll find that the shells spell ''Man on Horseback.'' Artists have been taking film off the screen, its traditional setting, since the 1960's, explains John Hanhardt, curator of film and video at the Whitney, and using it in other contexts, projecting it onto different surfaces such as steam and live bodies; relating it to specially constructed environments and dance or other performances. So ''The Judas Window'' invites us to exchange our traditional notion of film as registering ''an unchanging segment of reality'' for a view of it as a flexible, even mercurial, medium ''that can be read in different ways, depending on its physical placement and esthetic content.'' All very well, but Mr. Katz's installation makes the most boring, didactic and visually undernourished illustration of this thesis that could possibly be imagined. (Through Dec. 5.)

29-> THE CONDUCTOR AS ENDANGERED SPECIES
Someday, if man and all archeological evidence of his existence have managed to escape incineration, cultural historians may look at the last half of this century and wonder how the symphony orchestra conductor could possibly have become extinct at the height of his power and glory. For, improbable though it might seem to us now, when renowned though sometimes modestly gifted conductors can become multimillionaires whose names are clues on television game shows, the chances for their surviving - at least in their traditional role as conduit between audience and composer - look dim. The principal reason their disappearance is likely is that conductors have lost the tight one-to-one connection with living composers that traditionally has provided the performing musician with his reason for existence. The conductor's most important job is to find new music an [ TEXT OMITTED ] Granted, it is entirely possible that the symphony orchestra conductor will survive in any of several roles superficially similar to his present one. But, barring some cultural upheaval still unforeseen, he is fated to play a part profoundly different from that of his predecessors in earlier centuries. Spenglerian thinkers have been suggesting for some time that Western music is entering a period of dormancy or decline, like the classical art of certain ancient civilizations. If that is so, the conductor could become our version of the Kabuki artist, the singer-actor-dancer who has for centuries been entrusted with the duty of preserving a Japanese performance tradition that long ago passed into that shimmering state of stability known as entropy. The conductor would be preserved in a state of suspended animation or, if you prefer, indefinitely postponed death. Already, of course, we have seen the development of a species of theatrically aware maestro whose concert performances are total theater in the great Kabuki manner. Was there a music lover with soul so dead that he could not be caught up in the Dionysian frenzies of Toscanini? Are we not stirred to the depths of our being by Herbert von Karajan's portrayal of the conductor as asceticpriest? Did not the young Leonard Bernstein's rhapsodic and calisthenic ecstasies dramatize the music for audiences attuned to the idea of the symphony concert as ballet? Or, ... well, fill in the name of your own favorite singer-actor-dancer maestro. The Kabuki future for conductors cannot be ruled out. The tradition is already there to build upon. However, the even more dismal idea of the conductor as cultural monster on his way to becoming a fossilized dinosaur is worth considering seriously. On the surface, the conductor has never seemed more invulnerable or more essential to music. His bloated importance is a remarkable case of totemism, difficult to rationalize in terms of his contributions to the living art of music. The control that a von Karajan wields, not only over his own orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, but over a sizable part of the home-entertainment industry through his deep involvement in the record and video-cassette business, has no parallel in the past. Liszt's influence, as conductor and pianist, was remarkable for its time, but it was exercised largely for the benefit of his living friends and associates. Now, the situation is radically different. Celebrity is used to gain further celebrity. Fame is both means and end. A James Levine or a Riccardo Muti or a Zubin Mehta, thanks to television, can easily become known to more people in an evening than heard 1st JUMP CONDUCTORS Liszt conduct in his lifetime. The aim may be nothing higher than to keep a career afloat, but of such modest stuff are podium celebrities of the first rank made in our day. Nothing surprising about that, of course: The distorting effect of runaway technology on the performing arts is a commonplace, though a commonplace we have yet to understand fully or come to grips with. Here and there, throwbacks such as Bernstein or Rafael Kubelik manage to keep a tenuous connection with the creative life by simultaneously juggling the careers of conductor and composer. But they are anachronisms, musical versions of the vermiform appendix. The gulf between virtuoso performer and composer, which within our own century was narrow enough to step across, now yawns like the Grand Canyon. Think for a moment of how the modern virtuoso conductor came to be the potent figure he is, and why. Among many reasons for his rise in esteem, power and wealth is the proliferation of symphony orchestras, worldwide, and the enormous increase in season lengths. In the last 20 years, most leading American orchestras have at least doubled the number of concerts they present, while hundreds of lesser ensembles have sprung up in all parts of the country. Competent conductors are in such demand that they merely have to sit back and wait for the telephone to ring. They can work as much or as little as they choose, and often for fees that would make a brain surgeon blush. The overriding reason for the status of the modern conductor in musical life is the history of his predecessors' close association with leading composers. He is riding on the back of yesterday, and dragging his feet. Until fairly recent decades, that collaboration was anything but unusual. It was taken for granted that a conductor would seek out and champion composers of his own or the previous generation. This was true for conductors of every shade of temperament and talent, not merely for the occasional Liszt, who spent much of his time and energy proselytizing for Wagner, Berlioz and many others among his contemporaries, including more than a few who have fallen through the cracks of history. As a pivotal figure, perhaps we can point to Mendelssohn, who as musical director of Leipzig's Gewandhaus Orchestra was one of Europe's most influential artists in the early decades of the last century. Liszt, when he was music director at Weimar, had begun to insert older music into his programs, but it was Mendelssohn who gave the virtuoso conductor his first significant push toward glory and (thus, if you allow the argument) toward extinction. Mendelssohn therefore stands with one foot on either side of the musical Great Divide. He stirred up considerable controversy by inaugurating the unpopular policy of reviving works of such dead masters as J.S. Bach. It was Mendelssohn's 1829 performance in Berlin of the lost and virtually forgotten ''St. Matthew Passion'' that brought Bach to the attention of the general public and helped put him in the pantheon of dead musical gods. Anton Rubinstein, the Russian pianist and composer, who was born in the same year that Mendelssohn revived the ''St. Matthew Passion,'' caused a stir of his own by presenting a series of ''historical'' recitals whose purpose was to let his listeners prowl about in the past in search of music's great ancestors. And so we had the birth of Music Appreciation, a hitherto-unexplored subject that was soon to develop into a thought-paralyzing diversion for millions. Soon, of course, virtuoso musicians of all sorts were busy digging for bodies in the ruins, an activity that has brought us today to the point of musical necrophilia. Still, though the future was there to be read in the entrails as long ago as 1829, it actually was a long time before conductors and composers lost meaningful contact. In fact, there still are at present a few conductors who make serious efforts to reach out to the contemporary composer. Unfortunately, they tend either to be artists of minor stature or solid musicians whose hold on the musical public is feeble or nonexistent. Even in the fairly recent past, immensely popular conductors of all sorts were in regular contact with the best composers of their day. There were, for instance, conductors of the Tyrannosaurus rex type such as Fritz Reiner, musician-devouring carnivores who once roamed the earth in sizable numbers but now are one with the saber-toothed tiger. Despite their sharp teeth and ready claws, however, these fearsome maestros often managed to be good musical citizens in ways that their meeker, wealthier descendants generally fail to be. Nowadays, the strengthening of musical unionism, perhaps coupled with a rising international concern over human rights, has pulled most of Tyrannosaurus rex's teeth. It has become difficult for a conductor to fire even an obviously incompetent musician, let alone one who merely smiles infuriatingly to himself while the maestro is waving his wand or who combs his hair from north to south rather than from south to north. The day of the mass dismissal is no more, and I suppose only deep-dyed conservatives regret that terribly. Reiner, an infamously harsh taskmaster, would therefore have great difficulty today in fitting into the orchestral picture. That picture is complicated by the fact that certain orchestras, like the London Philharmonic and the Vienna Symphony, are player-owned and player-operated ventures that can hire and fire conductors and managers. So, while the modern virtuoso conductor stands at the height of his fame and apparent eminence, he does not even have the unchallenged artistic control over his own orchestra that disciplinarians of the Reiner generation grew to maturity believing was their divine right. Reiner, nonetheless, stood squarely in the great tradition of his craft. He was musician enough to recognize a composer when he heard one and wise enough to know that his and the composer's bread was buttered on the same side. Throughout his career he not only played the works of his contemporaries Bartok and Strauss but of such minor composers as his fellow-Hungarian Leo Weiner. Like most conductors in any era, he grew less adventurous as he aged, but the works of composers he knew personally and admired remained a cornerstone of his enormous repertory. Perhaps the most famous specimen of Tyrannosaurus rex, Arturo Toscanini, thrived in the same Cretaceous period and is best known today for his performances of the Romantic repertory. However, Toscanini had built a reputation in his youth by conducting not only Wagner and Verdi, whose lives overlapped his own, but also such contemporaries as Puccini, Strauss and Debussy. In old age, of course, he cared almost nothing about new music - from the contemporary American barrel, Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings was just about all he would consent to play. But that was all right: Like Reiner, Toscanini had done his part in his vital youth, when it counted. Another and decidedly milder-mannered species of conductor was, if anything, even more assiduous in cultivating and promoting the living composer. This was a type of leader who tended to treat musicians as sentient beings, perhaps of a slightly lower order than himself, but human beings, nonetheless. These cud-chewing vegetarians did not ordinarily consume orchestra players for breakfast, though when aroused they could maim with a swipe of the tail. A paragon of the type was Bruno Walter, who ruled orchestras by charming and cajoling. Walter served as a conducting acolyte to Mahler in his youth and spent the rest of his career working to put his idol's music into the repertory. This was, for most of the symphony orchestra's history, no more than standard procedure. Think of all those others, whose names will be linked forever with those of the composers they championed. Think of Thomas Beecham, the grandly eccentric baronet whose sway over musicians derived in part from his ability to make them laugh at rehearsals (and sometimes during performances as well). Beecham, however, was a serious artist who struggled until the moment of his death to keep the world aware of his friend Delius. Think of the universally beloved Pierre Monteux, who died at 89 - but only after falling backward off the stand onto his head. Monteux got in on the ground floor with Stravinsky, Debussy and Ravel, and gave the world premieres of ''Le Sacre du Printemps,'' ''Petrushka,'' ''Le Rossignol,'' ''Daphnis et Chloe'' and ''Jeux.'' Think also, in this time of orchestral penance, of Ernest Ansermet (Stravinsky) and Otto Klemperer (Kurt Weill, Mahler, Hindemith, Schoenberg, Janacek). Think of Hans Rosbaud (Schoenberg, Berg and Webern). There is no parallel among today's international stars of the podium for a Serge Koussevitzky, who set himself up as a prophet of young composers and whose name instantly calls to mind his assiduous promoting of such Americans as Leonard Bernstein. In fact, there is really no counterpart today for the young Leonard Bernstein, the conducting pupil of both Koussevitzky and Reiner who took it on himself to champion the music of Aaron Copland, Roy Harris and William Schuman, among others. Leopold Stokowski in his Philadelphia Orchestra days was another, rather more eclectic, Isaiah, an unclassifiable showman whose contribution will not be forgotten even though his flamboyancy and theatricality served to focus at least as much attention on the conductor as on the pieces he championed, such as Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder.'' 2nd Jump CONDUCTORS It is not until the generation that came to maturity after World War I that we begin to find the modern variety of hard-shell, freefloating, self-contained virtuoso emerging. No doubt this was at least partly because in this period composers began to abandon Western music's 700-year traditions of emotional expression in favor of an increasingly systematized atonality and dissonance that audiences simply could not bring themselves to love, no matter how sternly they were lectured by influential esthetic philosophers such as Theodor W. Adorno. And so it was that, with the arrival of career maestros such as Artur Rodzinski and Wilhelm Furtwangler, the umbilical link between conductor and composers began to be broken. The deeper you go into the past, the closer and more indispensable the conductor-composer link becomes: In the 19th century, we see Liszt, Hans Richter and Hermann Levi proselytizing for Wagner; Schumann (although an inept conductor) promoting Brahms and Chopin; Berlioz doing battle for Weber and, of course, for Berlioz. Dig a little further into the past and you arrive at the time when virtually all composers either conducted or played their own music. In the days of Haydn and Mozart, career conductors as such did not exist. Orchestras were still reasonably small and tempos tended to be regular, which made the need for a musical traffic cop unnecessary. Bach, who led remarkably small groups of musicians in his greatest works, probably from the keyboard, espoused not only his own works but those of Buxtehude, Vivaldi and other contemporaries. At the source of it all, long before the two streams began to diverge, we find the man whom musical historians have decided was the ''first conductor'': Jean Baptiste Lully, a composer and orchestra leader who beat time Page 148 on the floor with a staff. He died of blood poisoning in 1687 after hitting himself in the foot. Lully is believed to be the first human to take his life so lightly as to stand before an orchestra and threaten it with a stick. It is some indication of the psychic and financial rewards awaiting the popular conductor that so many musicians want to put themselves in such daily jeopardy. It does not seem possible to place certain and specific blame for the fact that the old composer-conductor association hardly exists anymore at the international virtuoso level. There are a few exceptions, even now. British conductors (as well as foreigners who take up temporary English residence, such as Andre Previn) are expected to work hard for British moderns. The English are extremely good about promoting their own music, especially if it is slow to be accepted on other shores. The young American Dennis Russell Davies has built an international career on befriending the avant-garde, though he does not seem to have settled on any particular hero. Most conductors nowadays, in fact, program a modicum of new music, though with a caution and lack of commitment that experience has taught them is advisable. Over the years, Eugene Ormandy has played a moderate amount of Shostakovich and so, naturally, has the emigre Russian Mstislav Rostropovich. Seiji Ozawa has played works of contemporary Japanese composers as well as of John Cage and Peter Maxwell Davies. George Solti has programmed pieces by Hans Werner Henze, Michael Tippett and Jacob Druckman. No one is saying that conductors do not try, at least sporadically. Still, it most certainly would be stretching things to say that the career of any major conductor now active has been tied up with that of living composers in the inextricable way that Arthur Nikisch's reputation was bound to his pioneering performances of two contemporaries named Bruckner and Tchaikovsky. In fact, conductors who made important careers in the first half of this century without being notably associated with contemporary composers were so rare that few spring to mind: Wilhelm Furtwangler was one such maverick, possibly because he himself was a serious composer, though not a seriously interesting one. In the second-last decade of the 20th century, however, the picture is radically different. If you doubt it, try taking the following completion test. What composer of recent vintage leaps immediately to mind when you think of Herbert von Karajan? Or Riccardo Muti? Or Zubin Mehta? Or Daniel Barenboim? Or Bernard Haitink? Or Carlo Maria Giulini? Or Claudio Abbado? Or Lorin Maazel? Or Klaus Tennstedt? But stop; it gets embarrassing. We really explain nothing by saying that the era of great composers is past and that we are locked into a steady-state situation in which conductors should not be expected to be more than conscientious curators. This is no more than a rationale for the star-struck worship of jet-propelled maestros who have abandoned their historic reason for existence and are cashing in on the great music of the past. Some work hard over long seasons for their money; others cut back their schedules and coast along, perhaps at the advice of tax advisers. But most, I think, are musicians at heart who would have the sense and the grace to admit the embarrassing truth to themselves, if only in the privacy of their New York, Paris or Cote d'Azur condominiums. Symphony orchestras arose in the late 18th century to serve an emerging middle class. Composers such as Mozart and Haydn were happy to abandon their former status as court employees to address that audience as free artists. One lamentable result of this cultural revolution, and one that has not been grappled with successfully, is that over the last two centuries, composers and performers have had to speak to ever-larger communities in ever-larger halls. This is not necessarily a malignant development, though in practice it has certainly cost orchestral music a great deal in emotional range, warmth and immediacy. The symphony repertory, at any rate, is a great, heaving body that is being bled dry. It sorely needs a transfusion, an operation at which conductors can only be the trained assistants. It needs gifted composers who believe it important to speak to the sensitive though sometimes vaguely informed musical audience as well as to the knowing, dedicated group that is drawn to the symphony concert as to an Orphic ritual. It needs composers who are willing to brave the scorn of myopic academicians in hopes of getting in touch with the large community of people in any society at any time who are capable of being moved by emotionally meaningful music. It needs composers who understand how good orchestral music differs from both schoolroom music and experimental music in aim and rhetorical style. It needs composers who are committed to the symphonic tradition and think it possible to speak to audiences who respect the concert experience, even if for their own strange and intellectually indefensible reasons. There is not much chance, however, that new life can be pumped into the symphony orchestra tradition unless there emerges a generation of gifted conductors who recognize that they have been put on history's hit list. Unless a vital connection with composers can be reestablished, their species is probably doomed to sink into the geological mud and fossilize. There may still be celebrities who lead orchestras and become internationally cherished names, like Liz and Dick and Boo and Andrew and Di and Charlie. But there will be no more real conductors. Even now, there are precious few. The richest and the mightiest of the modern maestros are living off their profession's hard-earned capital. Their own financial managers could tell them that that is the road to bankruptcy.

30-> YOUNG LAWYERS: A TASTE OF FAILURE
In high school they worked hard, did well and got into Harvard, Yale and Stanford. There they won honors and tickets to top law schools. Piling on still more academic achievement, they were courted by elite law firms and thronged to Washington to climb the next rung on the ladder of success. Now more and more of them are tasting failure for the first time. Many suddenly find themselves struggling to salvage their once promising careers in what may be the toughest job market the Washington law business has ever seen. ''I have associates who have been passed over for partner at top firms and they sit down in my office and cry,'' said Susan Schneider, a Washington ''headhunter'' whose firm seeks to place young lawyers in new jobs. ''These are people who have never failed at anything.'' Martin A. Kamarck, a partner at the Washington office of Morrison & Foerster, a San Francisco firm, said that the last time the firm let it be known it might have an opening in Washington for an experienced lawyer, ''we got just stellar resumes from people at all the major firms in town.'' A young lawyer who was invited, politely, to leave the large firm where he has worked for several years lamented privately, ''We were always on the fast track and then we suddenly hit a dead end.'' Impact of Reagan Cutbacks The boom years for law firms here have peaked and passed. In the 1970's dozens of big law firms from around the country opened plushly carpeted outposts a few blocks from the White House to compete with established giants such as Covington & Burling. Washington came to rival New York as a mecca for the most talented and ambitious law graduates. Then President Reagan took office and the Washington law boom ended. It wasn't entirely a coincidence. The Administration has cut back sharply on the kinds of regulatory activity and antitrust enforcement that corporations hire Washington lawyers to cope with. Further, Government agencies have slashed the hiring of young lawyers who enforce the regulations. This has combined with the national economic recession to cut down the demand for Washington lawyers at a time when the market was already becoming glutted. Among those hardest hit are scores of highly credentialed, hard working young lawyers in their early 30's who couldn't quite squeeze through the increasingly tight partnership bottleneck at the fancy law firms that once wined and dined them. Others are stuck in Government jobs they have outgrown. Two-Year Job Searches Although few are actually unemployed, many who were once annointed as among the best and the brightest have seen their hopes crushed and their egos bruised. Almost all refuse to talk publicly, lest they make matters even worse, but some confess privately that they are becoming desperate. Many have been looking for new jobs for as long as two years while working in a kind of limbo at firms that have told them they will have to leave sooner or later. ''The thing that tears you down is being told over and over and over again by so many prospective employers that they don't want you,'' said one young lawyer. He added that he had seen more than a dozen headhunters and ''some of them don't even return my phone calls any more.'' He had worked hard, he said, to ''make partner,'' billing clients for more than 90 hours a week while striving to meet deadlines and churn out the paperwork that swelled the profits of his employers. ''The presumption was I would be working every night and at least part of every weekend, and holidays had no meaning,'' he said. He was paid well. Salaries at firms like his range above $60 ,000 for associates seven years out of law school, the state at which some are made partner s while others are told they will have to leave. 'Portable Business' But in the current economic climate the big salaries make it all the harder for lawyers with several years experience to find work elsewhere. Mrs. Schneider, who gets ''20 to 30 resumes a day,'' said she could not place most people more than three years out of law school unless they had specialities that were in demand or ''portable business''; that is, paying clients they can call their own. Most do not. The big law firms in Washington, like those elsewhere, have long been competitive institutions. Even in the expansion years of the 1970's some young lawyers failed to win partnership. What has changed is that a smaller percentage of those who are hired by the big firms go on to become partners, as few as 10 to 20 percent in some cases. Further, those who are weeded out, as well as those who intended to leave, now find it much harder to land jobs elsewhere. There is no longer, as there once seemed to be, a relatively comfortable ''safety net'' of smaller law firms, corporate law departments and Government agencies ready to offer good jobs to those who have not made the cut at the big firms or who have done a short stint in Government. In fact, a few medium-sized and small firms here have lost so much business that they have laid off large numbers of lawyers. While some passed-over young lawyers express bitterness over where they have ended up by following what seemed the surest path to success and playing by the rules, others display the philosophical detachment and analytical precision that made them stars in law school. ''What I did was follow the path of least resistance,'' one woman said rather cheerily. ''I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and all that stuff, and I was one of the few people who liked law school. I just figured I'd go to Washington to the firm with the best reputation, and they fell all over me. I thought, well, this is easy, and I just kept floating along. I always thought there has got to be a market for talented, upbeat people with good professional training. Maybe I was too naive.''

32-> U.S. HISTORIC SITES IN CITY GUARDING AGAINST THEFTS
The burglars who broke into Theodore Roosevelt's birthplace last year were probably young, very ordinary thieves who entered the brownstone on Manhattan's East Side looking for objects they could steal easily and sell quickly, authorities say. The burglars came to the home three times, and Federal officials say that each time they made off with pieces of Roosevelt's past - from a small bronze statue he had loved as a child to guns he had carried as a young man. Now, the officials who manage the birthplace - a national historic site at 28 East 20th Street - say they are not only upgrading the security system in the home, but they also have removed some historic items from public display and have requested that an armed guard be assigned to the site. ''It's a very sad commentary, but these historic sites are not immune to the crimes that plague the city itself,'' said Duane R. Pearson, superintendent of the five national historic sites in Manhattan operated by the National Park Service. But he stressed that the problems at the Roosevelt site were part of a growing pattern of crime in the parks, historic sites and memorials managed by the National Park Service, which is part of the Department of the Interior. The Manhattan sites are the Roosevelt birthplace, Federal Hall National Memorial, Grant's Tomb, the Hamilton Grange and Castle Clinton. Mr. Pearson said Federal park officials in Manhattan had been forced to deal with everything from drug dealers on the steps of Federal Hall on Wall Street - where George Washington was inaugurated as the first President of the United States - to vandals who have broken into Castle Clinton in Battery Park to carry out a ritual involving the killing of chickens. Mr. Pearson said the Park Service has been preparing for the 125th anniversary of Roosevelt's birth next year by improving the security system at the four-story brownstone with devices ranging from periphery alarms to motion detectors. ''When crimes started to rise generally, they spilled into our parks and memorials, and we were just totally unprepared to cope with them,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''Now, every national park has trained at least one law officer,'' he said, adding that the managers of the historic sites are doing the same. Law Enforcement Training ''Here in Manhattan,'' he said, ''we've trained four law enforcement people in the last two years. Before that, we had none.'' Mr. Pearson noted that he has requested that a fifth employee be trained and assigned to guard the Roosevelt home, the birthplace of the only President born in New York City. The guards, Mr. Pearson said, are Park Service employees who have completed intensive law enforcement training, the same given to Federal drug agents and border patrol guards. After their training, they carry .38-caliber handguns, handcuffs and Chemical Mace, he said, even though they often double as site guides or even ticket sellers. ''Once, we would hire someone with a good public-speaking manner and a solid background in history, but now, that wouldn't be enough,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''Today, we want somebody with some law enforcement background, or at least someone who has that potential.'' Complaints From Tourists ''Before we got our law enforcement people - who are usually divided between Federal Hall and Castle Clinton - we were getting complaints from families who had come from other parts of the country and from foreign visitors,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''Imagine what they thought when they saw people sitting around the steps of Federal Hall drinking beer, smoking joints and hawking drugs.'' While the problems are still there, he said, ''we seem to be controlling them better.'' At Castle Clinton, the old fort in Battery Park, sneak thieves inside were escaping with little pieces of the past - from a soldier's coat to a military shaving mug - while drug sellers plied their trade outside. ''We added alarms to Castle Clinton last year, and with the guard, we've really reduced our problems there,'' Mr. Pearson said. ''But we still have problems there. We've found evidence that somebody has broken in there several times for some kind of ritual. They have left chicken parts and some blood.'' Grant's Tomb, at Riverside Park and 122d Street on the Upper West Side, has an almost unsolvable graffiti problem, Mr. Pearson conceded. And the Grange, which has been closed for renovation, has not yet been reopened to the public. Cleared for Renovation Vandals have broken into the Grange, at Convent Avenue and 141st Street, several times in the last year or so, he said, but it had been cleared for the renovation work, so there was little damage. Federal Hall, a nationally recognized landmark, has another worrisome problem - sexual encounters sometimes take place in an exhibit room there. Mr. Pearson said guards had to ''break up'' such incidents ''once or twice a month.'' While the Roosevelt home retains almost all of its collection of memorabilia - from the former President's christening gown to family furniture placed just as it was in his childhood - a dozen gold and silver objects have been removed by officials from displays, as well as all of his guns. ''We think the burglars were tempted by the guns and the gold and silver - items they could sell quickly - so those are what we have removed,'' said Diane Jung, the site manager. The thieves took a Winchester rifle with ''TR'' engraved on its fancy stock, a .32-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver and a .38-caliber Colt revolver, none of which have been recovered. A Rebuilt Brownstone The birthplace is a charming brownstone that has been completely rebuilt and fully furnished with historic pieces. Mr. Pearson said the thieves escaped with several gold and silver commemorative pieces presented to Roosevelt, as well the three guns, which were worth ''several hundred thousand dollars.'' Among the gold and silver objects taken and not recovered were a three-inch, 24-karat gold place card, which had been crafted for the dinner that followed the Russo-Japanese peace agreement, and the tray to an antique silver tea and coffee service, Miss Jung said. One burglary, which occurred at night, resulted in a broken window, she said. Windows Now Kept Shut Miss Jung said the police believe the other two were daylight burglaries in which an agile, probably youthful, thief climbed in through a second-story window, which had been opened to catch a summer breeze. ''There is no air-conditioning in the house, and it can get very stuffy,'' Mr. Pearson explained. ''Now, though, the windows are kept shut.'' According to Miss Jung, some of the items that visitors will not see because they have been removed for security reasons are ''the Winchester rife T.R. was carrying'' when he learned that President William McKinley had been shot and that he would become President, and a rifle that was part of Roosevelt's equipment when he led the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American War. ''It's really a shame,'' Mr. Pearson said, ''because Roosevelt was extremely proud of his weapons - he bought some of the best and had others given to him.''

33-> LETTERS TO THE LONG ISLAND EDITOR; Education Program for Deaf Infants
Because the excellent article ''Deaf Students in a Hearing World'' (Oct. 17) focused on mandatory education for deaf children from the age of 3, readers may not have realized that there is an educational program for hearing-impaired children below 3. The Cleary School's Deaf Infant Program (state-funded and free to parents) emphasizes parent-child communication and the development of language during those first three years so crucial to learning. In both home visits and classroom sessions, parents learn how to help their infant to use residual hearing, to lip -read and to develop speech. Parents concerned about their young child's hearing can call the Cleary Deaf Child Center in Lake Ronkonkoma for more information. CAROLYN VEATCH Graduate Student, Deaf Education Adlephi University

34-> No From the P.L.O.
The P.L.O.'s rejection of President Reagan's proposal for Arab-Israeli negotiations only proves the adage that those who make a bad war cannot make a good peace. After decades of futile but costly violence, culminating in the Lebanon debacle, the Palestine Liberation Organization seems totally incapable of turning a frustrated nationalism into constructive political action. After apparently heated debate and contrary to the counsel of many Arab governments, the P.L.O.'s Central Council still refuses to recognize the reality of Israel and lays claim to all its land for a state that the P.L.O. alone would run. It is hard to believe that this really represents the views of the scattered four million Palestinians, who have never been democratically consulted about such leadership. The Council, egged on by Syria, condemns even Yasir Arafat for his discussion of a Jordan-Palestine confederation with King Hussein, as envisioned by President Reagan. That leaves Mr. Arafat without a credible mandate and makes irrelevant his energetic efforts to have the United States deal with him. If defeat in Lebanon, the futility of Soviet and Arab support and the dispersal of its guerrilla forces cannot rouse the P.L.O. from its fantasies and shake its commitment to violence, there is, sad to say, only one remaining source of pressure: the relentless absorption by Israel of the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.3 million Palestinians can still make a plausible territorial claim. Those who recognize these Palestinians' right to a large measure of self-government and seek to promote at least an interim settlement of the conflict - notably the United States - have declared themselves willing to resist the pace of Israeli settlement if diplomacy is given a chance. But the P.L.O.'s reasserted extremism turns that proposition on its head. Let reality now sink in. If those who claim Palestinian leadership cannot contemplate coexistence and persist in preventing King Hussein and the residents of the West Bank from negotiating a true peace with Israel, then even this territory will soon be out of reach. It sometimes seems as if these self-styled leaders prefer conditions that produce more Palestinian refugees and misery - and some more recruits for their desperate terror armies - to effective political action. Theirs has been a pathetic history of clamoring at every stage for what they could have easily had one or two wars earlier. They have thus encouraged extremism in Israel and perpetuated a tragic cycle of fear. President Reagan is left with no alternative except to hang his sensible proposals high above the Middle East and let more favorably disposed Arab leaders recognize that time is not on their side. If they truly fear Israel's urge to expand, let them offer it a fair peace. If they truly quake before the P.L.O. extremists, let them use their considerable power to promote Palestinian leaders of a different spirit.

''The fact is that whether from frustration, disillusionment, boredom or impatience, American society in recent years has shown a strong tendency to devalue education. We must do everything to restore education to its place in the hierarchy of national values that we as educators know it deserves if the other values of the nation are to be preserved, revitalized and transmitted to future generations.'' - George H.

The Millstone II nuclear power plant automatically shut down Friday because of a signal in the reactor's protective system, a Northeast Utilities spokesman said today. The plant shut down at 4:58 P.M. after electronic noise from a switch in a water circuit caused the alarm to sound, said Anthony Nericcio, the spokesman. There was no release of radioactive material, he said. Mr. Nericcio said that the plant was returned to 25 percent power this evening, but that full power would not be restored until Sunday night at the earliest.

41-> VERBAL SCORES RISE IN CITY; THOSE FOR MATH DIP
Scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test by students in New York City's public high schools increased this year in the verbal section and declined in the mathematics section, ending up more than 35 points below the national averages in each category, according to figures released yesterday by the Board of Education. Students in the city averaged 388 in the verbal part of the test and 427 in the mathematics part, compared with the national averages of 426 and 467. The decline in the mathematics section in New York City was four points, while the rise in the verbal section was also four points. ''The instructional program here has focused on basic competencies and at the same time on increasing the number of students taking Regents classes and participating in advanced placement classes,'' said Nathan Quinones, executive director of the school system's Division of High Schools. ''Perhaps the rising S.A.T. scores reflect both the division's emphases and a change in student attitude toward increasing academic class loads,'' Mr. Quinones added. In the last two years the Scholastic Aptitude Test scores in the city's public high schools have been rising at a faster rate than those in the rest of the country. The scores nationally in the test, which is used by colleges in their admission process, increased this year in both the verbal and mathematics sections for the first time in two decades, but in New York City they went up last year. New York City's scores in the last two years have risen in the verbal part of the examination by a total of 11 points, while the national average has improved by two points. Even with this year's four-point drop in the mathematics section, New York City's scores for that part of the test have gone up by eight points in two years. The national average for math in the same period increased by one point. Authorities across the country have theorized that a major reason for falling test scores has been the tendency of high school students to substitute less demanding elective courses for the main academic courses in mathematics, science, English, social studies and foreign languages. Big Cities Tend to Lag The verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test deals with vocabulary, grammar and an understanding of language. The mathematics section includes problems in algebra, geometry, statistics and other basic areas of the subject. Both parts of the test use multiple-choice questions. Historically test scores for students in big cities, which have larger concentrations of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, have lagged behind those for the country at large. Students in New York City displayed their greatest strength in the achievement examinations that are administered in individual subjects in conjunction with the Scholastic Aptitude Test. The average scores by students in the city this year exceeded those throughout the country in eight subjects: biology, chemistry, Spanish, French, American history, European history and mathematics levels I and II. 'Substantial Improvement' ''We continue to show substantial improvement on the achievement tests,'' Mr. Quinones said. For each of three achievement tests - mathematics level I, Spanish and European history - the scores in New York City toppped the national averages by more than 30 points. The College Entrance Examination Board, sponsorer of the Scholastic Aptitude Test, stated in an announcement on Oct. 13 that the scores of minority students in recent years had risen at a faster rate than those of white students, though a gap of 100 points separates whites from blacks on each of the two sections of the examination. Mr. Quinones pointed out that students from minority groups accounted for 57.6 percent of those taking the Scholastic Aptitude Test in New York City, but that minority students made up only 18.3 percent of those taking the examination throughout the country.

45-> CRITIC'S CHOICE
JAZZ A celebration of the music of Thelonious Sphere Monk - started when a quartet of musicians calling themselves Sphere recorded an album of Mr. Monk's compositions last February - is continuing this week at Lush Life, Thompson and Bleecker Streets, where Sphere is playing for five days beginning Wednesday. The celebration has been intermittent as the four musicians who make up Sphere - Charlie Rouse, tenor saxophone, Kenny Barron, piano, Buster Williams, bass, and Ben Riley, drums - go off on other musical assignments between engagements as Sphere. But the group brings an unusually intimate knowledge of Mr. Monk's music to its performances. Charlie Rouse was the saxophonist in the Monk quartet for 11 years and Mr. Riley played with the pianistcomposer for almost five years. The unity of Sphere as a group is underlined by the joint experience of Mr. Barron, Mr. Williams and Mr. Riley as three quarters of a quartet led by the bassist Ron Carter during the late 1970's. The goal of Sphere is not merely to be a copy of Mr. Monk's quartet. While they keep Mr. Monk's repertory before the public, the four musicians are also building a group musical personality and adding new compositions of their own to their book. The result is an ongoing musical development that is founded on one of the sturdiest creative and stylistic sources in contemporary jazz. John S. Wilson

46-> EXPERIMENT IS OUT, CONCERN IS IN
THE BEST AMERICAN SHORT STORIES 1982 Selected from U.S. and Canadian Magazines. Edited by John Gardner with Shannon Ravenel. 374pp. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. $14.95. JOHN GARDNER'S selection of stories for this volume was probably his last literary work before his death in a motorcycle accident in September. The novelist's 10-page introduction to the collection, outspoken and discursive, invites immediate response and even disagreement, for he faced frankly the fact that literary choice is always in part a matter of taste. ''I like'' and ''I don't like'' - these phrases appear without apology. ''A new seriousness'' is the major trend Gardner found in current North American fiction. At a time when the quality of our life sags and declines, he went on, fiction responds by standing up straight, minding its traditions, being strong. Experimental writing is out, he notes; so are the ''chroniclers of manners,'' including, for Gardner, such names as Updike, Cheever, O'Hara and their resemblers. How does the ''new seriousness'' find expression? Not so much in political involvement, though some of that is present, but ''in serious personal concern'' - in other words, a frank engagement with life, a refusal of irony. So prepared, we enter the reading of 20 stories, covering, certainly, a wide variety of person, place and theme. Gardner never favored The New Yorker story - too elegant (he mistrusts elegance); ''all knife-flash, no blood.'' Thus only one New Yorker story has gotten in, largely because his wife insisted on it - Mary Robison's ''Coach,'' polished and disturbing. Some may take pleasure in, others may be irritated by the fact that most writers included are not well known, if known at all. Seventeen of the 20 stories appeared in literary reviews, quarterlies and little magazines, suggesting that this is where the action is shaping up. The lead-off story is ''Cathedral'' by Raymond Carver. As in other stories of his, we move from point to point, over carefully detailed surfaces, until force accumulates and we are borne along fast, this time to a revelation of the awesome ''seeing'' of the blind. The Joyce Carol Oates story, ''Theft,'' which stands like a formidable structure at the end, explores the intense, odd relationship of two college girls, exposing how people steal everything from fountain pens to souls. The characters are not pleasant - we have got used to that in much of Miss Oates's work. It is her special skill to keep us reading about them anyway, for the avidity and turmoil of the college years are relentlessly evoked. Between these two remarkable pieces lies a hinterland of 18 stories written by men and women in equal numbers. Exploring among them, the reader will probably find himself, like me, making an anthology of his own. A favorite of mine, for instance, is ''Lamb Says'' by Rosanne Coggeshall. An eccentric little Georgia boy, aged 4, can read all of the Encyclopedia Britannica, the works of Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson and Sir Walter Scott, to name a few, but has yet to speak a word. Enter an equally offbeat little female cousin who sees no one but imaginary playmates from England. Gardner found the story lifelike except for ''the impossible central character.'' Being Southern, I myself had no trouble with the boy: Miss Coggeshall doubtless knows him, he is probably her favorite nephew. This story is hardly an example of Gardner's ''new seriousness'': It sounds more like old-fashioned fun to me. OTHER stories, however, bear out the editor's thesis. One, ''Prize Tomatoes,'' by Anne F. Rosner, shows us a man trying to discover his own soul: A widower, retired and aging, once suicidal, gropes toward life by following the dim light within himself, being faithful to that until it becomes a glowing radiance. This writer should be watched. ''Shelter the Pilgrim'' by Fred Licht takes us to Berlin on the eve of World War II, but the story could exist in any setting. A Jewish family, out of religious duty, invites a retarded orphan boy into its home. At first bored, then awkwardly aware, next receptive, the members of the family finally come to see and revere qualities in him they do not have themselves. ''The Courtship of Widow Sobcek'' by Joanna Higgins is fresh and lovely, exactly right, miserable setting and all. Love, like roses, sometimes springs up in dismal places: Miss Higgins makes us believe that it has happened here. This story is a volunteer. In William Hauptman's ''Good Rockin' Tonight'' we once again hear the voice of the ''good ole boy,'' this one a middle-aged gynecologist in a North Texas town whose brother Bubba - wouldn't you know? -turns into the best Elvis imitator in the country. We've heard all this crazy stuff before, but it works again, and though the conclusion - you cain't go back to the past - is no more profound than a good ole boy ever is, we still must thank Mr. Hauptman for the ride. THERE are four stories in this volume so gruesome they can hardly be read. In one, a woman cuts the head off a decaying horse with a butcher knife to have it tested for rabies, the horse having bitten her daughter and died. In another, a woman in despair over a brutal love douches herself with sulphuric acid. A third story reveals a dead old woman in a tenement, her body a host for rats and maggots. The fourth is simply a series of sketches graphically describing German atrocities in World War II. Gardner professed that his highest admiration went to this last selection; he admitted in the introduction that it is not really a story, adding, ''but these days who cares?'' - a remark that left me gasping, as all the rest of the time he seemed to be saying that he cared, and everyone else ought to care, about real stories. A much finer story about the last war is included - ''Coming Over'' by Edith Milton - in which a boatload of refugees from Europe is crossing to the States. Young girls, some fresh from places like Dachau, are learning to kiss sailors and dance and find pretty clothes. There is a boy dying of an arthritic disease after five years of hiding in a damp Dutch cellar. When he puts aside his crutches to clasp the hands of the girl who tells this touching story, the reader catches, indirectly, the dull, impersonal horror that war is. This is fiction. In his freewheeling book, ''On Moral Fiction,'' John Gardner said clearly that writers must hold ''the middle earth'' for fiction, evoking a Norse legend about the struggle of gods and men against the trolls of outer darkness. One of the many reasons for regretting the loss of this good writer is that we will not be able to talk the matter over with him, to let him instruct us in his reasons for these few troll-like choices.

47-> Richardson Fined $1,500
The National Basketball Association has fined Michael Ray Richardson $1,500 and Rick Robey $1,250 for an incident of violence during an exhibition game at Madison Square Garden Oct.16. Robey, of the Boston Celtics, was fined for striking Richardson, who then played for the Knicks. Richardson was fined for retaliating by throwing the ball at Robey, throwing punches at him, not immediately leaving the court on being ejected and having to be restrained while trying to go after Robey a second time. Richardson was sent to Golden State last Friday in the trade that brought Bernard King to the Knicks, but he has still not joined the Warriors. He has reportedly told the club that he wants to renegotiate his contract, which is estimated at $1.2 million over three years. The Warriors say they have no intention of renegotiating and may suspend him.

48-> CONNECTICUT JOURNAL
THE political disagreements and tensions of the past were nowhere in sight last Tuesday night as Democratic State Representatives held their first caucus to elect leaders for the new legislative session, which will convene Jan. 5. Amid handshakes and hugs, the outgoing Speaker of the House, Ernest N. Abate of Stamford, presided over the caucus in the Hall of the House for the last time. Mr. Abate gave up his legislative seat in his unsuccessful drive to challenge Governor O'Neill for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination last summer. The caucus usually meets in closed session to pick its leaders, but apparently because it was all harmony this time, no one bothered to chase out the reporters and spectators. Irving J. Stolberg, a 12-year legislative veteran from New Haven, was quickly elected the new Speaker and vowed to listen to legislators on all sides of the issues. To underscore the unity theme, Timothy J. Moynihan of East Hartford nominated Mr. Stolberg. Mr. Moynihan had considered running for the Speaker's post but abandoned the idea after determining that Mr. Stolberg had the votes. It was the culmination of a long quest by Mr. Stolberg for a leadership post. Four years ago he lost an election for majority leader by two votes to John G. Groppo of Winsted. Mr. Groppo, who was re-elected majority leader for another term Tuesday night without opposition, had remained loyal to Mr. O'Neill in all the legislative infighting earlier this year between the O'Neill and the Abate forces. Mr. Groppo told the caucus that while he and Mr. Abate had their differences, it had been a pleasure to work with Mr. Abate. In a decade when video games seem to offer children more challenge and fascination than the stories of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Washington Irving, Connecticut's ''Teacher of the Year'' for 1983 issued a warning as he accepted the honor recently, in a ceremony at the State Education Department in Hartford. ''We cannot become robots in an age of robotics,'' said 38-year-old LeRoy E. Hay of Vernon, an English teacher at Manchester High School in Manchester. Mr. Hay was selected as Connecticut's representative in a nationwide teacher competition sponsored by the National Council of Chief State School Officers, Encyclopedia Britannica and Good Housekeeping magazine. With high-technology industries growing in Connecticut and the nation, Mr. Hay said, ''There's a great demand to add more to our science and math'' in the public school systems. But he added that ''our humanity comes from all the rest of our education - the arts, music and social sciences.'' ''The greatest danger of all is dehumanizing public education,'' said Mr. Hay, remarking that it is the task of the teachers ''to make sure that doesn't happen.'' Describing himself as ''an optimist,'' Mr. Hay, who has been in the Manchester school system for 15 years, said today's teachers are fully capable of guiding students through what he called ''the turmoil and frustration'' as education is redefined to fit the needs of a society geared to advanced technology. As for his own teaching style, Mr. Hay said he runs a ''very informal classroom, but it's a classroom filled with respect; because learning can only take place when we have an environment of respect.'' State Commissioner of Education Mark R. Shedd said Mr. Hay was chosen ''as a symbol of all the state's talented and dedicated teachers, and represents the professionalism and caring of his colleagues.'' ''Education is in an age of change,'' said Mr. Hay. ''It doesn't frighten me - it excites me.''

49-> NEW JERSEY JOURNAL
THE Bergen County community of New Milford (population: 16,876) is rapidly becoming New Jersey's version of ''the mouse that roared.'' Its school board is taking on the New Jersey School Boards Association because the local board believes that freedom of speech at public meetings is a right, not a privilege. The New Milford board amended its bylaws in January 1979 to permit the public to speak at regular meetings on any agenda item. In June 1981, it amended them again to let the public speak at the board's work sessions. The board's vice president, 22-year-old Kevin Kellenberger, then proposed that the state association make similar guarantees on a statewide level, and New Milford submitted a resolution to that effect to the association. However, the idea was rejected. In a letter to the New Milford board, the association cited ''general opposition'' to ''unwarranted state mandates,'' ''occasions when the privilege of public participation has been abused'' and the ''inflexibility'' of a mandatory period for public participation. In addition, the state association said, local boards ''must retain the right to regulate'' public meetings ''in the manner they see fit.'' However, it admitted that ''allowing some participation at school-board meetings is necessary for good public relations.'' Mr. Kellenberger, who recently was re-elected to his second term on the New Milford board, said in an interview that he planned to ask other school districts in New Jersey to support the resolution and that he would present it for a vote at a meeting of statewide school-board members in New Brunswick on Dec. 4. ''The state board seems to have the idea that the resolution would make local boards lose control over sessions,'' Mr. Kellenberger said. But each district should make its own determination, he asserted, adding: ''We want to make sure that divergent viewpoints will be equally represented.'' According to Mr. Kellenberger, the current law, ''by allowing people to selectively deny public input, permits a local board to continue to be voted into office and keep the minority viewpoint silent.'' ''Freedom of speech for individuals'' is more important than home rule, he said, ''and the only way to insure that is by a statewide rule.'' As for ''good public relations,'' Mr. Kellenberger said: ''I think that, as the schools belong to the people, we should be listening to them - not just for good public relations, but because we want to get their input.'' The Division of Youth and Family Services, the state-mandated agency of the Department of Human Services that protects children's needs, is undergoing major upheavals. Its director, Bernice Manshel, has resigned, effective Dec. 10. She has been the agency's fifth director since it was created in 1973, serving under Commissioners Ann Klein and Timothy Carden in Gov. Brendan T. Byrne's administration. The current Commissioner, George Albanese, was appointed by Governor Kean last March. Larry Lockhart, special assistant to Commissioner Albanese, said he ''didn't want to interpret Bernice's decision to resign as due to the change in administration and reorganization of the department.'' However, Mrs. Manshel said that ''a new administration may have different ideas of how things should be run.'' ''People coming in have that prerogative, she said, adding: ''I'm trying to leave in a ladylike and responsible way.'' Federal cutbacks of $4.9 million this year have meant the elimination of 336 employees, five state-operated day-care centers and a number of contracted services to private day-care centers. Despite this, several new programs were implemented. These include linking up community-based programs to provide help to troubled families, and specific goal- and time-oriented plans for children in foster and residential care to ensure their return to their own homes or placement in an adoptive situation, rather than their lingering in foster care. Linda Wood, executive director of the Association for Children of New Jersey, a child advocacy group, commended Mrs. Manshel for ''demonstrating her concern and commitment to the needs of New Jersey's children by taking a number of important steps to improve services.'' However, the new administration has been conducting an in-depth study of the Division of Youth and Family Services, an inquiry sparked by recent deaths of children under the division's care. The division is required to oversee youngsters in abuse, neglect or problem-family situations; these number about 43,000 a year, according to Mrs. Manshel. Commissioner Albanese presented preliminary findings of the study and plans for restructuring the agency to Governor Kean several weeks ago. According to Mr. Albanese, ''the Governor has asked for the (final) report as soon as possible and is anxiously awaiting the results.'' The results, which were to be given to Mr. Kean late last week, should be made public early this week. The comprehensive study of the division will include findings and recommendations on staffing, organization, policy, procedure, training, financing and communications. Another study is being set up within the next week by Assemblyman George J. Otlowski, Democrat of Perth Amboy, who heads the Assembly's Corrections, Health and Human Services Committee. Mr. Otlowski said the hearings would be ''very comprehensive - to determine if legislation is needed to deal with this problem.'' Mr. Otlowski said that he would seek testimony from Commissioner Albanese, Mrs. Manshel and private associations concerned with children. He also said that he planned to discuss with State Senator Richard J. Codey, Democrat of West Orange, the possibility of holding joint Senate-Assembly hearings on legislation concerning children's services. The African Art Museum of the Society of African Missions, some of whose artifacts date to the seventh century, has long been a landmark in Tenafly. However, the museum's Educational Outreach Program, which will bring African and African-American cultures to the community, is brand-new. Joan Waite of Teaneck, recently appointed the museum's educational director, calls it ''education in the broader sense, showing the continuity between African cultures and African-American cultures in the U.S. - that is, how the heritage developed.'' The educational program will reach out to church groups, Scouts, library study groups, the elderly and hospital groups. Much of the focus, however, will be on developing programs integrating African cultures into school curriculums. How the program works is twofold: First, Mrs. Waite takes the ''museum to the class'' in the form of a presentation on African cultures. Then, the students visit the museum for a first-hand look at the artistic representation of some of the cultures they have been been discussing in class. Already in gear are programs at Dwight-Englewood School, a private school in Englewood; Bogert Elementary School in Upper Saddle River and Hackensack Middle School. In Englewood, programs also are in the planning stages in elementary and middle public schools. And in Teaneck, the emphasis will begin in the third grade, since a new curriculum dealing with African studies has recently been developed at that level. The 95,000 elderly citizens of Ocean County will no longer have to strain to keep an eye on what's happening. The county's Deppartment of Parks and Recreation has come out with a large-type quarterly calendar of events. The 6,000 copies of the 11-page newsletter, which is printed in 18-point bold type, were distributed re- cently in senior-citizen centers and villages in the county. The publication is geared not only toward the elderly - who make up a third of the county's population - but also toward elementary-school children. The large type is easier for children just learning to read, said Don O'Rourke, the county's public information director. And it is the aged and children, according to Mr. O'Rourke, who are most likely to take advantage of the events listed by the Parks and Recreation Department. Thse include trips, activities in the libraries and concerts. ''We expected enthusiasm,'' Mr. O'Rourke said, ''but the response from the seniors is that you'd think we gave them a Christmas present.'' The publication may be the first of its kind in the country, according to the National Association of Counties, a nationwide lobbying group. Another publication that is the only one of its kind in the state - Jersey Woman magazine - will celebrate its fourth anniversary in January. The magazine is staffed, sold and, for the most part, written by women. (It does include an occasional column by a man entitled ''A View From the Minority.'') Jersey Woman's executive editor, Louise Bonnicelli, began the Burlington County-based magazine because, she says, she ''felt the need for a creative outlet for women in New Jersey.'' ''There is a lot of talent here,'' she added, ''but there was no local outlet.'' The bimonthly, which is published in Marlton, jumped from an initial circulation of 2,000 to 24,000, with approximately 40 percent in subscriptions, 30 percent in newsstand sales and 30 percent in free distribution to doctors' offices and beauty salons. To celebrate its birthday, the publication has put out a 1983 appointment book for New Jersey women.

CORNELL DEFEATS YALE BY 26-20 NEW HAVEN, Nov. 6 (AP) - Derrick Harmon, a junior tailback, scored two touchdowns, one on a 66-yard run, and rushed for 136 yards to lead Cornell to a 26-20 victory over Yale in an Ivy League game today. Cornell's first triumph in the league this season ended Yale's chances of repeating as the league champion. Yale, 3-5 over all and 2-3 in the league, shared the title with Dartmouth last season. Cornell is 2-6 and 1-4. Also scoring two touchdowns each were Mark Miller, the Cornell fullback, and Paul Andrie, the Yale tailback. Miller scored twice on 1-yard runs, and Andrie scored on runs of 21 and 26 yards. After 9 minutes 58 seconds were played, Miller scored his first touchdown and the extra-point attempt failing. Yale went ahead, 7-6, after Andrie's 21-yard run. Cornell then capitalized on a 3-yard punt by Yale to score at 7:31 of the second quarter. With the drive starting on Yale's 18, Harmon took a pitch at the 12 and scored. After another missed extra point, Cornell led, 12-7. Harvard 24, Holy Cross 17 WORCESTER, Mass. (UPI) -Mike Ernst scored on a 4-yard run with 19 seconds and accounted for all but 13 yards in the game-winning, 45-yard drive. It was set up by the defensive back John Dailey's second interception of the game. The Harvard secondary made four interceptions in the nonconference game and has had 16 in the last three games. The quarterback Don Allard and the running back Mike Granger ran for touchdowns with Allard becoming the first Harvard back to rush for more than 100 yards in a game this season. Jim Villanueva added a 35-yard field goal for Harvard, which is 6-2 over all. Holy Cross, which was ranked seventh nationally in Division I-AA, got two touchdowns from the quarterback Pete Muldoon and a 25-yard field goal from Tony Melink. Holy Cross is now 7-2 and trying for a Division I-AA playoff spot. Dailey's interception gave Harvard the ball at the Holy Cross 45 with 1:43 remaining. Allard flipped a screen pass to Ernst for a 23-yard gain and two plays later, Allard rolled 13 yards on a keeper to the Holy Cross 4. Ernst scored on the next play by diving over right tackle for his first touchdown of the season. Lafayette 47, Princeton 37 PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) - The tailback Nick Kowgios ran for a record 269 yards and scored four times to lead Lafayette (5-3) in the nonconference game. The Leopards scored the first four touchdowns and never trailed in the first meeting between the schools since 1953. Kowgios, a junior from Yonkers, broke the Lafayette single-game rushing record of 256 yards set in 1927 by Jack O'Reilly against Lehigh. Trailing by 26-0, Princeton (3-5) scored with 5:28 left in the half on Brent Woods's 8-yard pass to Kevin Guthrie. Woods then helped to cut the deficit to 26-23 with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Farris Curry and a 35-yarder to Guthrie. Woods continued to pressure Lafayette, as he threw a 9-yard scoring pass to Brad Urschel that made the score 33-29.

52-> MEDIEVAL COWBOYS
Knights really did clank along the roads of Europe in the Middle Ages, armed not to the teeth, but to the tops of their heads-cowboys to be sure, but with a mythic power that springs from their romantic ideals, their deliberate search for violent and heroic encounters', their sense of brotherhood, their commitment to vows as binding as those of religion, and their total freedom from the normal rules of society. Julek Heller and five other artists bring medieval European knights to life in paintings and drawings in this book; and Deirdre Headon skilfully retells the quests of the most famous ones. The book's heroes are taken from tales of King Arthur, along with a few strangers to Arthurian legend-Roland, El cid and Siegfried. But those great French, Spanish and German knights do not seem foreign in this context, and they illustrate aspects of knighthood the Arthurian tales obscure. Miss Headon's literary talent is extraordinary. These tales are known in many different medieval vesions and languages, from which it is difficult to extract a clear narrative. Her reconstructions are fresh, vigorous and faithful to the old texts but without the repetitions so common in medieval stories. A few, her version of the Sir Tristram story for example, are outstanding achievements in good storytelling. Introducing young people to the immense literature on knighthood presents a problem: Because there were real knights, and even the most romantic legends refer not only to the ideal but also to the real, one has to understand them on several levels. Miss Headon and these artists have solved the problem intelligently. Between tales of the knights, they have inserted 22 brief essays on the culture of knighthood - the sword and its use, armor, castles, sieges, flaconry, heraldry, courtly love, the Holy Grail and the crusades. The information is impeccable and vivid, giving the reader an impression of the excitement, pain, absurdity and gracefulness of knightly ideals and reality. The illustrations are magnificent. A few pencil sketches are pale, but the romantic color prints have the right tone. Galahad in his red and white robes is the handsome hero of girls' dreams and boys' ambitions. Roland's final battle is all fresh, metals, sword and gnashing horses' teeth. Lancelot spearing a green dragon is the perfect white knight. Fafnir the dragon slain by Siegfried, is red, clawed and as malevolent a beast as nightmare ever bred. In some pictures one color dominates to create startling effects: A golden Siegfried on a golden horse is pure splendor; the Green Knight who challenges Sir Gawain glows, terrifying and gorgeous, and a black dragon boat taking King Arthur's body to Avalon in a red sunset is hunting. One small objection: I wish that when American publishers buy the rights for a British book, they would change spellings to American style. "Armour" is clear enough, but a youn American might be puzzled when told that one order of knights went into banking and its members were the first people to use "cheques." But, what the heque! This is a fine book, entertaining and instructive, one an early teen-ager might learn from for a long time. It is expensive, but it could be a fine gift for the right person.

53-> LETTERS; LET'S NOT KNOCK A STRONG U.S. DOLLAR
To the Editor: In his Op-Ed article of Nov. 8, Walter Mondale expressed alarm over the strength of the U.S. dollar, calling it detrimental to exports and our general economic well-being. His criticism was one-sided: a strong dollar brings many benefits. It provides a reservoir of value, reduces the cost of imports (especially oil), benefits Americans traveling and investing abroad and attracts investments and deposits from foreigners. Over time, a strong dollar reflects a strong economy; certainly these benefits outweigh the disadvantages of a weak dollar. Moreover, a strong dollar is not necessarily detrimental to exports. A strong German mark did not hurt rising exports for West Germany during the 1960's and 1970's. A weak British pound did not materially help British exports. Quality, innovation, reliable deliveries and understanding of foreign markets will determine the direction of our exports in the future, more so than the dollar exchange rate. Mr. Mondale's eagerness to criticize the Reagan Administration reveals his economics as politically motivated. The American dollar has stayed strong despite the substantial drop in U.S. interest rates since last June. This is the first time since World War II that the two have not moved in tandem. All this speaks well for the image that people around the world have of the American economic and political environment. EDWARD A. JONES, New York, Nov. 8, 1982

54-> STRAIN ON STUDENT AID; News Analysis
During the 1950's American colleges and universities agreed on a system in which the distribution of scholarship aid to students would be based on financial need. This week, as college admissions directors, high school guidance counselors and others gathered at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel for the annual forum of the College Board, it was evident that, for the first time since it was put in place, this system is now facing serious strains. A combination of financial problems and increased competition for students has posed new ethical and social issues ranging from how to make the best use of limited scholarship funds to how American higher education will be organized in the years to come. Most of these issues are rooted in the fact that financial aid is becoming an increasingly scarce commodity. During the 1960's and 70's, the cost of a college education rose steadily, but new forms of Federal financial assistance more than kept pace with these inflationary pressures. In 1978, for example, the guaranteed student loan program was opened to all college students regardless of family circumstances. A Reversal of Trend This trend has now been abruptly reversed. The cost of education continues to rise, but the recession has cut into the funds that families can put into their children's education. And Congress, prodded by the Reagan Administration, has set out to curb Federal financial assistance as a matter both of economic necessity and political principle. The result is that, for the first time in recent memory, the need for financial assistance far outstrips the funds available. The problems this poses for colleges and universities in deciding how to allocate the aid they do have were demonstrated last spring when Wesleyan University, which has traditionally chosen its freshmen without reference to whether they needed financial aid, was modifying this ''need blind'' policy. Henceforth, the college said, it would budget as much as it could for scholarship aid and would hope - but no longer guarantee - that it would be enough to meet the needs of the students it wanted. Perhaps ironically, the $5 million that Wesleyan budgeted for aid this year was enough to sustain its need-blind policies. A Hollow Gesture? No one would argue that a college without the resources to sustain a need-blind policy should try to have one, but how such a college then handles aid applicants is a matter of growing controversy. Wesleyan has taken the position that to offer admission but no money to a student who needs financial assistance is a hollow gesture. Thus, if its financial aid budget ever turns out to be inadequate to meet the needs of some students it wants to admit, it plans to deny admission to those students and to fill their places with students who can pay. Others, however, argue that it is fairer in such cases to follow an ''admit deny'' policy; that is, to tell such students that they can attend the school but that they will be denied financial aid and will have to come up with the money on their own. The basic argument here is that students often have resources at their disposal, such as grandparents willing to help with their college education, that are not known to the college - or even to the student. Richard Haines, the director of admissions at Lafayette College, which follows such a policy, said about 20 percent of the students who are admitted but denied financial aid end up coming anyway. ''They also turn out to have the same graduation rate as other students,'' he added. More 'Straightforward' Willis J. Stetson, director of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania, argues that an admit-deny system is more ''straightforward'' because ''the student who is denied admission because of financial need knows that this is the reason.'' Karl M. Furstenberg, the dean of admissions at Wesleyan, however, questioned whether such a policy might not produce a group of ''second class'' students. ''The admit-deny students might be there, but they may have to work so much that they will really have a different kind of experience,'' he said. Another set of ethical issues revolves around new choices in priorities faced by college presidents. The financial aid budgets of most private colleges are now rising not only in absolute terms but also as a percentage of overall expenses. This year, for example, Wesleyan increased its financial aid spending by $750,000, to $5 million, or one-eighth of its entire budget. This means that student aid is now competing head on with other needs -even with faculty salaries - to an extent that it never did. One possible consequence is that many colleges will reduce their commitment to financial aid - and thus to the goal of open access to higher education for disadvantaged students - on the ground that it is a luxury that they can no longer afford. ''The neo-conservative rhetoric is there to get colleges off the hook,'' said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard College. ''We can say that we were liberals in a liberal era, but now things are different.'' Controversial Rhethoric Most of the better colleges and universities will presumably make efforts to resist any pulling back from a commitment to open access to higher education, but it was evident at the College Board forum that even the rhetoric by which they try to do this is becoming controversial. During one heated panel discussion, Mr. Botstein argued that maintaining a diverse student body was not only a matter of altruism but also of sheer self-interest. ''It's the only way of maintaining an academically strong student body and, consequently, of keeping a first-rate faculty,'' he said. Still other issues flow from the possible redistribution of students throughout the various sectors of American higher education. There is evidence, for example, that a growing number of academically able middle-class students who in the past would have gone to private colleges are, for financial reasons, looking to public universities. This raises the possibility that the entire system could become polarized, with wealthy students, along with a few subsidized poor ones, filling the best institutions of both the private and public sectors, and the overwhelming majority of disadvantaged students being relegated to lesser public institutions.

55-> CORNELL FOILS PENN IN BID FOR TITLE, 23-0
Cornell spoiled Penn's efforts to take the Ivy League title outright tonight and sent Coach Bob Blackman to retirement with tears of happiness. The Big Red upset the Quakers, 23-0, with a slashing ground attack that left Penn in a three-way tie for Ivy honors with Harvard and Dartmouth, which had won their final games in the afternoon. The three had 5-2 records in the league; Penn finished 7-3 over all. From six defeats in a row, Cornell roared back with its fourth straight victory and a 3-4 mark in the Ivy League. It was more than coincidence that the Big Red resurgence began with the return of Derrick Harmon. Today the running back from Bayside High in Queens scored two touchdowns and accounted for 179 yards. A chance observer might have thought that Cornell had just won the Rose Bowl game as Blackman was carried off the field by his jubilant charges in the rain and darkness of Schoellkopf Field. Champagne for the Winners He carried a bottle of champagne that someone had thrust at him to mark his retirement after 34 years as a college coach. He coached six years at Cornell and 16 at Dartmouth for 97 victories, making him the most successful coach in Ivy history. Among active major-college coaches going into this season, Blackman was second only to Bear Bryant in victories with 164. ''I'm so overcome with emotion right now,'' he said, ''I can't talk. Needless to say, it's a game I will remember the rest of my life. ''A lot of people - some right here in this town - gave up on this team this year.'' ''But right now,'' he went on, ''we have without question the two best tailbacks in the Ivy League in Harmon and Tony Baker. Yet, we went the first half of the season without either one.'' The tone for the game was set, he said, when Gordie Little made a good hit on Penn's Glenn Shagena receiving the opening kickoff. Offensive Line Effective Cornell's offensive line was particularly effective, slashing holes for Harmon to sprint through. After Bill Goldy put Cornell ahead with a 37-yard field goal in the first quarter, Harmon bulled through on 2- and 3-yard touchdown plays in the second and fourth quarters after drives of 49 and 70 yards. Cornell put the game out of reach at 10:04 of the last quarter with a touchdown pass from Jeff Hammond to Steve Garrison that evolved from a fake field-goal attempt. With that play, Hammond completed his 11th of 13 passes for 127 yards. Penn's only serious thrust was thwarted by Scott Walter. The 5-foot-8-inch defender tackled Gary Vura as he headed round right end from the Cornell 4-yard-line for what appeared to be an easy touchdown in the second period. ''He's too small to be in a varsity football game,'' said Blackman, admiring Walter's ability. Walter also made a key interception in the fourth period of a Vura pass intended for Jeff Schulte. By that time Cornell was leading by 16-0 and the Penn defenders were weary from their efforts to stop the Big Red machine. No Shortage of Emotion There was no shortage of either energy or emotion as Blackman, who is 64 years old, appeared for the last time in the locker room as coach. ''I've already told as many of them as I could that I love them,'' he said. ''And that's not an exaggeration. I remember years ago, after one of the first Super Bowl games, people asked Vince Lombardi, who was supposed to be a hard-nosed guy, what made the Packers so different, and he said 'love'.'' Blackman said that he hoped to remain active in Cornell's football program. He said he would now sit in the stands and second-guess ''my friends,'' the other football coaches. As for his wife, Kay, she admitted that she would miss the excitement. ''You can't be around football for 34 years and not miss it,'' she said.

57-> MEDIAN PRICE OF JERSEY HOME SAID TO HAVE TRIPLED SINCE '70
The median price of a home in New Jersey nearly tripled between 1970 and 1980, according to figures released by the Census Bureau. The figures showed the median price of a house in the state rose from $23,400 in 1970 to $60,200 a decade later. The median price for a house in 1980 ranged from a high of more than $200,000 in Alpine and Saddle River, both in Bergen County, to $15,700 in Camden. Other low prices were in Downe Township in Cumberland County, $19,600; Penns Grove in Salem County, $23,000, and Bridgeton in Cumberland County, $22,400. ''The trend in housing values, nationwide, is mainly upward, and that's mostly due to inflation,'' said Charles Crowley, a spokesman for the New Jersey State Data Center. ''New Jersey's higher than the national average, but that was the way it was in 1970.'' Housing Stock Rose 16 Percent New Jersey's housing stock grew by 16 percent during the decade, but population rose by only 2 percent, he added. The average number of persons living in one housing unit in New Jersey fell during the decade, from 3.17 in 1970 to 2.84 in 1980. The trend followed the national average, which dropped from 3.11 persons to 2.75 over 10 years. ''Generally speaking, we're going in the same direction as the country, but we're getting there slower,'' Mr. Crowley said. ''And housing costs, like income, tend to be higher in New Jersey.'' Rental rates in the state increased by 104 percent during the same period. The monthly rate jumped to $226 in 1980 from $111 in 1970. The median ranged from more than $500 a month in Alpine to $109 a month in Downe Township. Housing Units Up 16.1 Percent The number of housing units also rose, by 16.1 percent, in the latest census. Between 1970 and 1980, the number of homes occupied by their owners increased 17 percent, from 1,349,815 in 1970 to 1,579,827 in 1980. The number of homes occupied by renters increased 11.6 percent, from 868,367 to 968,767. Those figures show that owners lived in 62 percent of the occupied homes in the state in 1980, while owners lived in 60.9 percent of the housing units a decade earlier. The national average went up to 64.4 percent from 62.9 percent. The number of single-family dwellings ranged from 99 percent in Ocean Township to 6.7 percent in Hoboken.

59-> MUSIC; GIVE THE COMPOSER A BREAK
In the pop-music world they used to call it ''jazzing the classics.'' One of George Gershwin's early piano pieces, for instance, was ''Ragging the Traumerei.'' John Scott Trotter, a band leader, made a pretty penny or two out of ''In an 18th Century Drawing Room,'' a direct steal from the first movement of Mozart's Piano Sonata in C (K. 545), but with a tick-tocky accompaniment. The common practice was to borrow a good tune, disguise it as much as possible in Tin Pan Alley clothes and try not to act embarrassed when some tune detective pointed out that it was taken directly from Chopin (''I'm Always Chasing Rainbows'') or Tchaikovsky (''Tonight We Love''). Serious musicians and serious listeners sneered at these stolen classics, but the composers tended to be unpretentious about their recreations. Gershwin, you will note, did not call his piece ''Traumerei,'' or pass it off as the work of Robert Schumann. Similarly, the director of the 1954 movie ''Carmen Jones,'' which used some Bizet music in conjunction with a libretto by Oscar Hammerstein II, did not advertise itself as George Bizet's ''Carmen.'' It was, frankly and plainly, meant as a gloss on the opera. In the past, the person who felt impelled to jazz, rag or otherwise transfigure the classics had the grace to present the results as his own work. When ''Blossom Time'' hit Broadway, it was not represented as Schubert or even as a reinterpretation of Schubert, some of whose tunes it borrowed and pruned down to the bark, but as an operetta by Sigmund Romberg. Nowadays, however, we are asked to take seriously a school of opera directors who do not seem to recognize any difference between interpretation and felonious assault. James Helme Sutcliffe reports in the October issue of Opera magazine on two typical examples of the currently sanctioned approach - to be polite, let's call it violating the classics. In a Hamburg production by Achim Freyer of ''The Magic Flute,'' Tamino turned up as ''a Japanese schoolboy in shorttrousered suit, bobby socks and tennis shoes.'' His face was painted white, with black arched eyebrows and apple-red cheek spots. Monostatos, the Moor, and his slaves were blue instead of black. The other characters were costumed and made up just as crazily, with no regard to the opera's libretto, while the music was played quite straight. The same director's production of Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice'' in Berlin put Orpheus in baggy pants and tennis shoes and Euridice in a red dress with a waist-length orange wig. Mr. Sutcliffe calls the style ''punk opera'' and mentions that one Berlin critic, while calling the staging a work of genius, thought Gluck's music was out of place in such surroundings. Perhaps it was the production that was out of place, not the score. What to do about the incongruous music in such weirdly trendy productions, however, hardly seems to bother the new-wave directors, some of whom can neither read nor follow a score. They ignore the clash of styles between, say, a Mozart aria and an imitation Jackson Pollock backdrop. From the reviews I gather that the recent production of ''The Coronation of Poppea,'' staged at a New York disco with the music scored for rock ensemble, was a strange though entertaining hybrid: Monteverdi in disco drag. Probably it was as much fun to see as last summer's ''Parsifal'' at Bayreuth, which was directed in typically high-handed style by Gotz Friedrich, a student of Walter Felsenstein at the East Berlin Komische Oper. Just for starters, the set was laid on its side so that as the audience looked at the stage it saw the roof where the backstage wall should be. Glenn Loney, reporting on the production in the Performing Arts Journal, conjectures that the director intended ''to emphasize the skewing of time and space and the varied way one looks at reality.'' No doubt he succeeded. Still, Mr. Loney felt, ''Some modern touches, such as Titurel singing from his sarcophagus over closed-circuit TV and Flower Maidens who looked like fugitives from a 1923 tea-dance at the Plaza Hotel, seemed self-defeating. Klingsor worked his evil magic from a control panel that was worthy of 'Star Trek.' Such topical gimmicks weren't helpful in illuminating the mystery that is 'Parsifal'.'' Illuminating the mysteries that lie at the heart of masterpieces does not often seem to be the goal of the avant-garde opera director. He rarely seems to be aiming higher than at giggle-producing novelty and bizarre sensation. Hans Jurgen Syberberg, who directed the film ''Our Hitler,'' has produced a ''Parsifal'' for television that is scheduled to turn up in New York soon. Filmed on the Bayreuth stage, it is entirely performed, according to Mr. Loney, on ''an immense death mask of Wagner, lying flat and serving as a playing surface. Unfortunately, only Wagner's forehead, eyeballs and nose - rather cuttingly arched - were playable, limiting the space avaliable.'' Now, I agree that ''Parsifal'' is a strange work, but that strange? The question in too many new productions nowadays is where the line between innovative staging and chic claptrap can be drawn. I am willing - just barely - to entertain the possibility that ''Rigoletto'' can be legitimately transmuted into a Mafia melodrama in 20th-century Manhattan, as Jonathan Miller recently did in Basle. But it should be obvious that in such an interpretation so much of the original plot and dialogue would have to be changed or ignored that Mr. Miller must have come perilously near to creating another opera altogether. His ''Godfather'' interpretation could have little connection with the Victor Hugo story and Verdi's 19th-century music would necessarily clash with the mid-20th-century milieu that was overlaid on it. In Mr. Miller's ''Rigoletto,'' for instance, ''La Donna e Mobile'' is sung to a juke-box accompaniment. Perhaps it works, but isn't such a ''Rigoletto'' approaching the point where it is no longer Verdi's at all, but something that should be identified as, perhaps, ''A Rigoletto Fantasy,'' by Verdi-Miller? An important and entirely praiseworthy step in this direction was taken last season in Paris, where Peter Brook staged his own musical version of ''Carmen,'' using some of Bizet's music but stripping down the action to what he felt was its dramatic essence. Mr. Brook did not present this compressed version as Bizet's ''Carmen,'' but as a work of his own entitled ''La Tragedie de Carmen.'' The score was condensed by Marius Constant and arranged for 14 instruments. Many strange things happened musically, such as a Habanera accompanied solely by kettle drums and a Card Scene accompanied solely by viola. It would not be possible to confuse the result with Bizet's ''Carmen.'' All this strikes me as an honest, imaginative way to deal with the problem of rethinking an opera masterpiece without debasing the original. Why, in fact, are modern opera directors so modest about taking credit for their clever inventions? Surely it can't be simply that they feel the need to identify their work with an old accepted brand name. If I devise a zany staging for Wagner, for instance, shouldn't I receive full credit for its ingenuities? Why should I need to share billing with the composer? In fact, things are beginning to change in that regard. The opera world already refers, for instance, to the Bayreuth cycle in 1976 as the ''Chereau Ring,'' tacitly recognizing that the director, Patrice Chereau, was more responsible than Wagner for what was presented on the stage. The next step, it seems to me, should be to legitimize the director's role and, in so doing, lift some of the onus from the poor composer himself. Zurich recently saw a ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' that was set in modern times on a resort beach with Ferrando as a baseball player and Fiordiligi as a women's libber in blue stockings and steel-rimmed glasses. An inspired idea? Possibly, but the only way such a scenario could be made palatable would be for the director to come right out and admit that he is not satisfied to simply reinterpret what Mozart and da Ponte had in mind when they created this timeless tragicomedy. Wouldn't it make much more sense to present the production as ''Variation on a Theme of Mozart,'' or ''Amadeus ex Machina,'' or some such, rather than as ''Cosi Fan Tutte''? There is nothing, I think, more reprehensible than an opera production that treats not only the libretto but the work's basic style as disposable features, while pretending to keep the composer's score intact. The fact is that in any important opera, its music, words and historical setting are impossible to cut apart without a serious loss of blood. One solution, of course, has often been resorted to throughout musical history: a person who is overwhelmed by the need to say something in an operatic idiom can write his own opera, and perhaps produce it. I have absolutely no quarrel with the composers and directors of such rock-oriented works as ''Tommy'' or ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' who had legitimate operatic ideas and pursued them in legitimate, if artistically limited, ways. I do quarrel, however, with the director who wants to give me a ''Don Giovanni'' set in California during the Gold Rush, or a ''Samson et Dalila'' in which Arnold Schwarzenegger mimes the part of an impotent Olympic weightlifter who tears down a gymnasium out of frustrated love for Jane Fonda. Come to think of it, I'd like to amend that: I don't want anything to do with a Gold Rush ''Don Giovanni,'' but I might just learn to love the music of Saint-Saens as accompaniment to a Fonda workout session. If any director is planning such a tour de force, I hope he will clearly label it as a fantasy and not call it ''Samson et Dalila.'' How about ''Samson and Jane Meet the Nautilus Machine''?

61-> PEKING APPROVES DEAL WITH SQUIBB
The Squibb Corporation said yesterday that it had received final approval for a joint venture with China to make and market pharmaceutical products in that country. Michael W. Percopo, president of Squibb International, who said that he spent two and a half years negotiating the deal and made at least 10 trips to China, stated: ''We will share the profits equally and sell under the Squibb label.'' He added that each of the partners, Squibb and a Chinese Government organization called the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industrial Corporation, will provide the equivalent of $1 million in capital. To this will be added another $6 million borrowed by the partners. The money will be used to build a plant outside Shanghai in an area called the Ming Hong district. Some will also be spent to import machinery from the United States. The Japanese already have announced a joint venture involving hospital medications, and several American companies, including Avon Products Inc. and the Coca-Cola Company, also have pacts with the Chinese. 'A Great Potential' ''We view the Chinese market as offering a great potential, and the Chinese definitely have a great need for our products,'' Mr. Percopo said. Products that will initially be manufactured in Shanghai include Cephradine, an antibiotic; Corguard, used in cases of angina and hypertension, and Capoten, used for hypertension. Vitamins also will be manufactured in the plant, he said, along with, eventually, a full range of Squibb products. The new venture, which will have five Chinese directors and five directors named by Squibb, will be called Sino-American Shanghai Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd. The board will name a Chinese director as chairman, and Mr. Percopo will serve as vice chairman and president, along with continuing his presidency of Squibb International. Mr. Percopo added that the agreement consists of a 15-year contract that can be renewed by the partners.

62-> Nets Unable to Maintain Poise
Len Elmore is 30 years old, and one of the elders on the youthful Nets. Thus, he often has a more thoughtful view of what is happening to the team than many of his teammates. But after most games, he is often off by himself, for he is rarely the star performer on any night. But when the chaos settles, his opinion is usually the most valued. That was the scene in the locker room after the Nets had lost to the Suns, 110-99, on Friday night in Phoenix. As other Nets discussed the loss, Elmore sat in the corner, dressing slowly. For the third consecutive game in the exhausting road swing through six cities, the Nets had failed to hold a lead. And for the second straight game, it cost them a victory. They won only two of the six games, and they will play only one home game this week before traveling for two more games, in Washington and Atlanta. Against the Suns, the Nets trailed by 16 points early in the contest, but they rallied to trail by only 57-52 at the half. Then they overtook the Suns, just as they had done to the SuperSonics in Seattle on the previous Sunday when they halted the Sonics' 12-game victory streak. Suns Wipe Out Lead The Nets played aggressively on both ends of the floor against the Suns, and had a 6-point lead midway through the third period. But the improved Suns stormed back and went on to an easy victory behind a nearly flawless performance by Walter Davis. Davis led all scorers with 29 points, hitting on 13 of 19 field-goal attempts. Elmore, who lost his job as starting center to Darryl Dawkins this season, said this type of defeat was typical of a group of young players who have yet to become familiar with each other. ''We have to develop some type of killer instinct,'' Elmore said. ''When we get a lead, we have to realize what got us there. They'll often come back, but you've got to be able to weather that onslaught.'' Foots Walker, the Nets' captain, agreed, but he also added that the team had showed some improvement on the trip. ''We're doing what we're supposed to now,'' Walker said. ''Helping out on defense, and getting back on the break. But there's a big difference in a veteran team and a young team. Later in the season, we'll win these games. But for now, we're not a very good team down the stretch.'' Although he is only 26, Dawkins is a veteran of seven professional seasons. He said the Nets' victory over the Sonics proved that ''we can play together.'' But he also said there was more to be achieved. ''We, as starters, have got to become more familiar with our roles,'' he said. ''That makes it easier for the next guy coming in to do his job. As of now, we all seem lost sometimes.'' Elmore Cites Pressure Elmore says that preseason expectations, and the pressure the players are placing on themselves in trying to live up to those expectations, are at the heart of the Nets' problems. ''I know I'm guilty of it,'' he says. ''When I go in, I want so badly for us to do well that I press, too. It's a real anxiety. You don't want to make a mistake, because you don't want to hurt the team. Maybe it's not all that bad. It shows, at least, that everybody cares.'' The Nets, at 7-9, know that they are not doing what was expected of them. ''We're not Philadephia, Boston or Los Angeles, teams that have played up to that potential and know what it feels like,'' Elmore said. ''We haven't found that feeling yet.'' ''But I maintain,'' he added, ''that we will be there at the end.''

65-> AS THE STAGE TURNS AT THE MALL
PARAMUS PRODUCERS committed to developing new plays would hardly be expected to stage a Neil Simon comedy - and a negligible one at that. For Fourstar Productions, however, that seems to be the surest route to survival. The production company, which signed a six-month lease with Playhouse on the Mall last June, was formed to try out new plays with commercial potential. Its first attempt, ''Fool of Hearts'' a twocharacter comedy by Gus Kalkkonen that was presented for three weeks last month, was a critical and commercial failure. When announcement of the next play, ''Young Bucks'' by John Kunik, was made, few tickets were sold. As a result, the producers canceled ''Young Bucks,'' which calls for a cast of 11 and deals with themes of competition and maturity, and settled for Mr. Simon's safe threecharacter, lightweight comedy. Will ''The Star-Spangled Girl,'' which runs through next Saturday, give Fourstar Productions a new lease on life? Will its lease with the Playhouse be renewed? In response soap-opera-style questions it may be apt to say: Tune in next month to find out. Indeed, the company's soap opera associations are considerable. One of its purposes is to provide stage acting - real acting - opportunities to actors who are gainfully employed on television in the daytime, but who claim that their ''first love'' is theater. The success or failure of the Simon play will help to resolve yet another question: Does the public want to pay $10 to $17 to see familiar faces -which are seen free of charge at home - in an unfamiliar context? For a time, the answer seemed to be a resounding yes. For openers last August, Fourstar Productions presented a series of audienceparticipation shows under the collective title, ''Talk Back to the Stars,'' in which actors identified with such soap operas as ''General Hospital'' and ''All My Children'' appeared to promote the playhouse's coming attractions. ''Talk Back to the Stars,'' which was priced at $4 and $6 a ticket, did well. So did a musical variety show in September. Then came the first new play (''Fool of Hearts'') and disaster at the box office. Fourstar Productions consists of George Mead, a director; Steven Smith, a writer-producer; Beth verDorn, a theater administrator, and her husband, Jerry verDorn, an actor currently appearing as Ross Marler on the television soap ''Guiding Light.'' Mr. verDorn is one of the three actors in ''The Star-Spangled Girl,'' which also stars Michael Tylo, known for his role as Quint McCord in ''Guiding Light,'' and Colleen Zenk, who has been playing Barbara Stenbeck in ''As the World Turns'' for four years. (It is customary to refer to soap opera ''stars'' in tandem with the characters they play, so total is the association. This implies that they lack their own identity as actors, and those involved in Fourstar Productions want to change that.) The producers, who live in Manhattan, chose the playhouse here because its nearness to New York City was expected to attract actors in ''daytime soaps.'' Furthermore, according to Mr. Mead, ''we believed there would be a chemistry between soap stars and shopping malls.'' With the failure of their first two attempts to present new works, and the artistic compromise that the selection of Mr. Simon's play represents, Mr. Mead expressed the fear that ''we're neither fish nor fowl.'' ''We have a group of real theater people who want a chance to get beyond the soaps, and we'd like to find a way to finance new scripts and make an impact on the commercial theater,'' he said. ''It's too expensive to do that in New York, and it's impractical to do it on the road, and so we wanted to establish an audience here and use the theater as a testing ground.'' For the 20-year-old, 636-seat playhouse, the success of Fourstar Productions could be a turnaround. For 12 years, Robert Ludlum, the novelist, operated Playhouse on the Mall as a theater specializing in what Mr. Mead calls ''boffo attractions.'' These included such stars as Alan Alda, Carol Channing, Rock Hudson and Ann Miller. After Mr. Ludlum left, the theater floundered, according to Mr. Mead. ''An actor I knew in the Center Stage company, which previously played here, said, 'We're going downhill, but you should see the theater,' '' Mr. Mead said. ''We felt that if we brought recognizable actors in new plays, we would do well. There are a lot of malls around, but we're the only real theater in one, and now we wonder whether there's a future for us here.'' In the sphere of Neil Simon comedies, ''The Star-Spangled Girl'' is near the nadir. In 1966, when the play eked out a seven-month run on Broadway, it was Mr. Simon's feeble concession to the sensibility of the intellectual protest movement, while keeping a solid foothold in Middle America. Andy and Norman who, we are told, graduated in first and second place in their class at Dartmouth, are publishing a politically controversial magazine called ''Fallout'' in a small San Francisco apartment. Norman is writing all the articles, which have such titles as ''Twenty-Seven Ways to Burn Your Draft Card,'' under 14 pseudonyms and Andy is editing them. Enter Sophie Rauschmeyer, the vacuous all-American girl next door. To Norman, she's ''one of God's creations made during His best period.'' He goes through her garbage, cleans her house and makes himself otherwise obnoxious. It follows that she falls for Andy, and Andy, who has called her a ''corn-fed mini-mouse,'' does not resist. The play has a few characteristically snappy Simon one-liners, but mostly they're limp indeed. The one sustained gag - Andy's attempts to ward off the landlady's phone calls (she wants his body or the rent) - is tiresome. Mr. Mead, the director, keeps all this uneventful foolishness moving along deftly, creating capital fun with whatever visual gags can be realized or concocted. The entrances of Mr. verDorn (Andy), Mr. Tylo (Norman) and Miss Zenk (Sophie) - all reportedly recognizable from their soap opera television appearances - were greeted with ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' from a sparse but appeciative audience. Making something substantial or comic of such frustrating roles is a test case for actors. These passed, if not with honors, but the play's original stars - Anthony Perkins, Richard Benjamin and Connie Stevens - did no more honorably. Mr. Mead, however, deserves extra credit for making something out of very nearly nothing. Light and Lively THE STAR-SPANGLED GIRL, by Neil Simon. Di- rected by George Mead. Scenery by Carl A.

66-> MUSIC; A NEW HALL IS OPENING
KING DAVID, according to the poet Stephen Vincent Benet, ''worshipped the Lord in a tuneful carol,'' thereby anticipating the twin purposes of the new Sommer Center for Worship and the Performing Arts, which opens today on the Bronxville campus of Concordia College. ''We consider it a significant step forward for the school and the community,'' said Concordia's president, Dr. Ralph Schultz. ''Our music program has grown so rapidly over the last 15 years or so that we needed a new facility desperately. This is a beauty, and should give our students a tremendous learning advantage.'' ''It's an absolutely gorgeous, knockout auditorium,'' agreed James Harwood, who conducts Concordia's band and student jazz ensemble. And Thomas Schmidt, another faculty musician, who will be serving as concert manager for the center, added: ''We hope to build this into a major cultural headquarters in Westchester.'' Constructed at a cost of about $2.5 million, the hall is brick-andoak paneled, with a sliding wood partition that enables the room to be used for programs seating 300, or opened up to accommodate audiences of twice that number. On a recent day, workmen were installing the last panels; but preliminary soundings, Dr. Schultz said, indicated that the hall will have bright acoustics. The public is invited to the dedication service and concert this afternoon at 3 o'clock, and later to attend the various student, faculty and guest performer recitals that should keep the Sommer Center well-used this inaugural season. The major recital series begins Saturday at 8 P.M. as the Arden Trio plays Haydn, Beethoven and Dvorak, then continues next year with visits from the An die Musik ensemble, the pianist Richard Goode and the Consorte of Musicke. The flutist Susan Deaver and the violinist Dorothy Happell, both faculty artists at Concordia, will be among the dozen or more performers appearing in a separate music series, and many other jazz, instrumental and choral programs are scheduled. There is no admission charge for today's dedication ceremony; most of the other recitals do involve a fee, with the elderly and subscription discounts available. For more information, call the college during business hours at 337-9300. The county's halls of learning often provide comfortable settings for fine music. Today, for instance, one can also attend a 3 P.M. benefit recital by the soprano Renata Scotto for and at the Ursuline School in New Rochelle. Tickets are $15 for general admission or $25 for reserved seats. It's not often we get to hear the renowned Metropolitan Opera diva in recital. The friends of the Hoff-Barthelson School in Scarsdale, on the other hand, seem to have done their fund-raising in advance because they are presenting the Chamber Arts Trio in a free concert there tonight at 8 o'clock. The fine players of the ensemble are the violinist Carol Stein Amado, the cellist Barbara Stein Mallow (twin daughters of the renowned violist Lilian Fuchs) and the Hoff-Barthelson pianist Albert Lotto. The program includes trios of Schubert and Beethoven. Another benefit recital, this one for the Bennett Conservatory of Music, brings the gifted young pianist Edward Auer to play Beethoven, Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Debussy at the Croton-Harmon High School this Saturday at 8:30 P.M. (for reservations call 271-4825). A week from Saturday, on Nov. 20, the Ossining High School will be the performing site for an 8:30 P.M. concert by the Aeolian Chamber Players (271-4657). Meanwhile, there are almost always good musical reasons to head over to the Performing Arts Center at the State University of New York at Purchase. This week they include the jazz wizardry of the pianist Billy Taylor on Friday, as well as the immacualte artistry of the Tokyo String Quartet playing Haydn, Mendelssohn and Schubert the following evening. Two student ensembles are performing next week - the Purchase Symphony Winds under Donald MacCourt on Nov. 18 and the Symphony Strings conducted by Yuval Waldman on the 19th - and the Ohio Ballet comes for an evening of dance on Nov. 20. All the concerts start at 8 P.M.; for ticket information, call the box office at 253-5900. The public libraries also offer enticements to the music lover. At the Chappaqua Library, for instance, one can enjoy the Changing Times Tap Dancing Company, which adds a touch of jazz to the old hard-shoe routines this afternoon at 4:30, or the excellent young players of the Mendelssohn String Quartet offering music by Beethoven, Ives and their namesake a week from this afternoon at the same hour (238-3594). The Manhattan String Quartet (which, incidentally, has a performance tonight at 7 o'clock at Wainwright House in Rye) gives a free children's concert next Sunday at 3 P.M., in the Tarrytown Library (631-2189); a half-hour later, the Ossining Public Library begins its free Sunday afternoon music series with an appearance by the Pandean Wind Quintet (241-2416). Finally, brief word of several other unusual music events in the county: The International Fall Festival is continuing apace at the Paramount Center for the Performing Arts in Peekskill with a program of ''Kabuki and Koto'' -classical dances, drama and instrumental music of Japan - today at 3 P.M., and a fullystaged production of the Japanese folk opera ''Yuzuru'' Saturday evening at 8 (739-2333). The Manhattan Musical Ensemble is presenting vocal duos, trios and quartets at 4 P.M. today in Tarrytown's Christ Church; the Purchase Music Ensemble, with members of the Laurentian String Quartet as guest artists, has scheduled music by seven Westchester composers for its 8 P.M. concert Tuesday at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck (949-8308); and the Amherst Saxaphone Quartet blends jazz and the classics at their Hudson River Museum recital starting at 3 P.M. next Sunday. (963-4550). b

67-> Evils of Racing Immature Horses
To the Sports Editor: I am writing in response to Dr. James Belden's article on thoroughbred racing injuries (''Why, Racing Fans Ask, Must Horses Be Destroyed?'', The New York Times, Oct. 31). There is a cause at the root of the problem of leg fractures in race horses, a cause that the public is carefully shielded from and is never publicized. That cause is that the thoroughbreds begin racing well before they have finished the growth process and, quite simply their bone material is insufficiently developed to stand up to the immense strain put upon it by racing. A horse does not finish growing and maturing until between the ages of 4 and 5. The rhetorical response is, naturally, ''Why then, don't they let the horses grow up before they start racing them? (They start them between the ages of 1 year and 9 months, and 2.) The answer is, of course, money. Breeders and owners, despite the tremendous tax benefits of raising race horses, want, and have historically wanted, to turn their money around - fast. The young race horses are looked on as money-making properties. And, racing is a BIG money business. The growing and training time is shortened to make money faster. Despite the low rate of injuries and the laudable progress in surgical methods for repair, mentioned by Dr. Belden, no one knows about the young thoroughbreds injured in too-early training, or in the progression of races run before they make the big time. The practice of racing immature horses has gone on for a long time. The public asks why the injuries? Let's complete the story. Racing won't change unless an informed public demands it. NANCY T.

68-> Miss Day Has Nuptials
Catherine Theodora Day, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Aristides A. Day of Stamford, Conn., was married yesterday to Bruno Bertocci, son of Mr. and Mrs. Ugo Bertocci of Rockville, Md. The Rev. Robert G.

73-> MORGAN PACES ROMP BY BERGEN CATHOLIC
Mike Morgan, the state's leading scorer, scored four touchdowns to increase his point total to 132 and send Bergen Catholic (7-0) to a 47-6 victory over Teaneck (2-4) in Oradell. Morgan scored on runs of 7 and 9 yards, on a 30-yard pass from Tom DeGasperis and a 49-yard punt return. He has 22 touchdowns this season. DeGasperis replaced Bob Murray, the starting quarterback, who separated his shoulder in the first half, and threw 44 yards to Bob Donfield for his first touchdown. Yon Choi, a senior fullback, ran for a touchdown and the two extra points in the closing minutes and lifted Wallington (6-1) to an 8-7 victory over Ridgefield yesterday in Ridgefield. Ridgefield (3-4) recovered a fumble in the third period, drove 38 yards and scored on John Mecca's 6-yard pass to Rick Corpion. Jim Karcz kicked the extra point. Wallington picked up a blocked punt on the Ridgefield 35 and scored three plays later on Choi's 3-yard run and the ensuing conversion run. Luke Iovine, a senior quarterback, completed a touchdown pass to Joe Valentine in the second quarter and Montclair held on for a 6-0 victory over Clifton in Montclair. Montclair (6-0) drove 47 yards in four plays and scored on Iovine's 8-yard strike with 18 seconds remaining in the half. Clifton (2-4-1) drove to the Montclair 6 in the third quarter, but Ray Puryear intercepted the ball. Robert Cancelliere, a senior halfback, ran for two touchdowns to guide Belleville (6-1) past Bloomfield, 21-6, in Belleville. Cancelliere recovered a fumble on the Bloomfield 26 and ran the ball into the end zone on the next play for a 6-0 lead in the second quarter. He also scorted in the third on a 4-yard run. John Borrello burst 1 yard in the second period for Belleville's second touchdown. Tyrone Taylor ran 14 yards for Bloomfield's touchdown in the fourth quarter. Bloomfield is 2-5. Mark Lisa, the backup quarterback, came off the bench and threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter to give Butler (7-0) a 14-10 victory over Kinnelon (1-6) in Kinnelon. Kinnelon had taken a 10-0 lead on Mike Snell's 35-yard field goal in the first quarter and Scott Ferrara's 2-yard touchdown plunge in the fourth. Lisa, however, threw passes of 30 yards to Gary Geiger and 26 yards to Mike Gagg for touchdowns. He also ran for the 2 points after the first score. Caldwell (6-0) scored twice in the second quarter on its way to a 20-0 blanking of Millburn (1-6) in West Caldwell. Caldwell converted an interception and recovery of a bad snap on a punt into touchdowns by Tom Martin (2 yards) and Jeff Tino (10 yards). In the fourth quarter, Jeff Durr hit Tim Lorenzo with a 26-yard scoring pass. Unbeaten Ramsey earned its seventh victory, 16-7 over Glen Rock, at Ramsey. Andy Murray took a 12-yard pass from Todd MacGlashan for a first-period touchdown and, in the third period, kicked a 32-yard field goal. Ted Gunther and Nick Piersos each scored on short yardage, and Jim Fedynich kicked 2 extra points in the second quarter to send Park Ridge (7-0) to a 14-8 victory over Becton (3-4) in East Rutherford. Brian Moen caught passes for a touchdown and the decisive 2 extra points in the fourth quarter and provided Pompton Lakes (6-0) with an 8-7 victory over Hawthorne (5-2) in Hawthorne. Summit, led by Dan Ambrose and Leroy Horn, beat Wayne Valley, 42-16, in Wayne. Summit (6-1) took a 29-0 halftime lead when Ambrose ran 8 yards for a touchdown and hit Devin Arkison with a 63-yard touchdown pass and when Horn scored on a 4-yard burst and an 85-yard punt return. Larry Rodgers found Robert Grafton with a 56-yard scoring pass as Snyder (6-2) beat Paterson Kennedy, 6-0, in Paterson. The touchdown drive consumed 96 yards after a long punt by Paterson Kennedy (2-3-2). Greg Stevens led the Snyder rushers with 124 yards on 12 carries. River Dell, which had lost four and tied one in five previous games, staged a major upset when it ousted Northern Highlands from the ranks of unbeaten, 15-14, in Allendale. With eight minutes left in the game, Ken McGovern scored on an 13-yard run, and then threw a 2-point conversion pass to Mike Soffel for the winning points. Northern Highlands, which had won six games, couldn't protect a 14-0 halftime lead.

76-> The Importance Of a Playmaker
To the Sports Editor: I found Dave DeBusschere's comments about the Knicks' need for a point guard (''Knicks Hedge on Point Guard,'' The New York Times, Oct. 26) very interesting. DeBusschere asks a simple question: ''Why do you need a point guard?'' He then cites several examples of successful National Basketball Association teams that had two guards who shared the ball almost equally: Monroe and Frazier with the Knicks; West and Goodrich with the Lakers, and Ray Williams and Michael Ray Richardson with the Knick team that won 50 games just two seasons ago. While DeBusschere may be correct when he states that people get carried away with labels, the need for a point guard has not diminished in recent years. In fact, the full-court pressure, run and jump tactics and half-court traps that are part of the defensive arsenals of most successful N.B.A. teams have increased the need for a point guard. Perhaps we can draw a parallel with professional football. The successful teams have quarterbacks who can read the defenses at the line of scrimmage, pick apart the secondary and punish safety blitzes with touchdown bombs. The role of the point guard in professional basketball is much the same. He, too, must be able to read the defenses and react to basketball's ''blitzes'' - the variety of pressure defenses that are thrown at him during the course of a game. And while DeBusschere states that ''ball handlers don't need to score,'' they should have the ability to score in order to keep their defensive men occupied so they cannot help out on the primary scorers. During the summer of 1980, I served as a consultant to the Egyptian Basketball Federation in Cairo. As we do in the United States, the Egyptians put labels on their basketball positions. Their backcourt players are referred to as the ''playmaker'' and ''assistant playmaker.'' I find that to be descriptive of most backcourts at just about any level of basketball. There is usually a primary ball handler and a secondary ball handler. Basically, that is true of each of the backcourt combinations cited by DeBusschere. But significantly each of those combinations had two players capable of handling the playmaking responsibilties for their team. The Knicks' problem is that they must either develop or acquire at least one such player. EDWARD M. KRINSKY Westbury, L.I.

77-> MAGNETIC DEVICE LIFTS HOPES FOR DIAGNOSIS WITHOUT X-RAY
Radiologists say they have developed another revolutionary technique for medical diagnosis that they expect to perform significantly better and more safely than the advanced X-rays that overtook the field only a decade ago. Instead of using X-rays, the new diagnostic device produces pictures that are based on the responses of atomic nuclei in a magnetic field. The device, called nuclear magnetic resonance, or N.M.R., produces images of internal tissues that are similar to the computerized, cross-sectional X-ray pictures made by the so-called CAT scanners. Although it has not yet been established as completely risk-free, the new method appears to be far safer than established diagnostic techniques that depend on X-rays, injected contrast solutions and radioactivity. Studies also indicate that the new technique will yield sharper pictures and show more distinctions than CAT scanners. Wider Use Is Expected So far, the radiologists say, the new technique has been used primarily in experimental testing on animals. But the scientists note that three major hospitals in the United States and others in England are already using the new technique on patients. They say that recent developments in the field seem to have insured that use of the technique will be expanded, and they foresee great potential for the device. The new developments have prompted some institutions to reconsider plans to purchase the expensive CAT scanners, according to Dr. Leon Kaufman, director of the University of California's Radiologic Imaging Laboratory here. And nearly all the major producers of CAT scanners are now switching their concentration to the development of the new device. One manufacturer, the General Electric Company, estimates that the worldwide market for N.M.R. scanners will grow tenfold in the next five years, to $740 million, while the CAT scanner market will decline. CAT stands for computerized axial tomography. How widespread the use of the new devices will be in medium-size or small hospitals or clinics is a matter of some question because, like CAT scanners, the new divces are costly. The price of the smallest commercial unit is about $800,000, and the Diasonics unit used here sells for $1.5 million. "Ironically," Dr. Kaufman said, "the acceptance of million-dollar CAT scanners paved the way for the equally expensive N.M.R. imagers." Though long considered too costly to be practicable, the N.M.R. scanners are already commercially available and were once expected to displace their radiation-based predecessors eventually as the leading technique for seeing inside the human body. Yet less than two years ago, Dr. Kaufman said, those working with nuclear magnetic imagers were "generally ignored, maybe even laughed at." Dr. Kaufman and others said brain scans done with the experimental imager here were far more detailed than those form the best CAT scanners. Without injecting anything into the body or exposing patients to radiation, as required by currently available imaging techniques, the new device's pictures clearly show blood vessels and contours of brain tissue and distinguish between different types of soft tissues. Whether body scans will also be improved with the new device is still a matter of argument, but Dr. Kaufman said the prototype N.M.R. machines were already at least as good as third-generation CAT scanners and would probably improve. New Information About Body Dr. Ronald Evens, head of radiology at the Mallinckrodt Institude of Washinton University in St. Louis, cautioned that because the experimentation with the new technique and the actual use of it were still in the early stages, it was too soon to describe or predict its full potential. But he said the device now "in fact gives us new information about the body, about its chemical structure." "For the first time," he said, "I can get an image of proton density in the body, for example, and of how those protons are influenced by other chemicals around them. The excitement is that this can give me a new important level of diagnosis." Growing excitement aobut the new technique is apparent as the Radiological Society of North America opens its annual meeting today in Chicago, where more than two dozen research reports will be presented. Investigators exploring the devices will describes experiments on such questions as their ability to distinguish between benign and malignant breast tumors; to detech abnormalities of the heart attacks, strokes and tiny lesions of the kidneys; to examine the spinal column and disks, and to evaluate how cancerous tumors are responding to therapy, all without known risk to patients. Nuclear magnetic imaging may also be used to detect atherosclerotic plaques in large blood vessels, to determine the health effects of bypass grafts and prospective donor kidneys, to detect the lesions of multiple sclerosis and to determine their response to therapy, and to measure the effectiveness of treatments for heart disease, all without subjecting patients to hazardous injections of dyes or to X-rays. Dr. Kaufman's institution is one of three in this country now using the new technique in examinations of patients. The others are the Cleveland Clinic (working at the nearby Technicare facility) and the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. To date, the largest number of human studies have been done in England, where pioneering research first suggested the scope of the new technique's clinical potential. Advantages of New Method Unlike CAT scans, N.M.R. can show structure as well as function, Dr. Kaufman said. It is capable of distinguishing normal from adnormal tissue, even when the abnorality does not change the size or shape of the affected organ. Images can be made at any angle through the body and threedimensional information can be obtained with one measurement. N.M.R. can show blood vessels without the use of hazardous contrast materials, which can cause adverse reactions in some patients. It is far more specific than CAT scans in depicting different types of tissues. And repeated scans can be done without the CAT scan's risk of excessive radiation. That means, doctors may be able to monitor the progress of therapy or the progression of a chronic disease by taking as many scans as often as they wish without danger to the patient. For this reason, Dr. Kaufman said he expected the new technique to raise a serious ethical question in medical care: "We will have only a cost-benefit, not a risk-benefit ratio to consider. We won't be able to argue people out of having an N.M.R. examiniation because of potential hazards." Dr. Kaufman, a physicist, and Dr. Lawrence Crooks, an electrical engineer, assisted by a large team, buildt their own nuclear magnetic machine, with which they are said to be doing "the most advanced N.M.R. imaging research" in the country, according to the technical magazine Diagnostic Imaging. Their device uses the most powerful magnetic field currently employed in imaging research, 3.5 kilogauss, 4,000 times greater than the magnetic field of the earth. "We've done more than 20,000 images of rats, and more than 10,000 images in patients," Dr. Kaufman said. "We didn't want to rush into clinical studies when te equipment was changing so rapidly. Our image quality has improved more than tenfold in a year. It would have been a waste to study patients with the earlier versions." Patients Enter Machine Although his seven years of work with the technique is finally coming to fruition, Dr. Kaufman is concerned about the "feverish state of activity" now in the N.M.R. field. "Fever is not conducive to good science," he said. "Hundreds of careful animal studies can get lost when a researcher shows one picture of a human patient, which may be nowhere as revelaing." As in a CAT scan, the patient being examined by N.M.R. lies on a table that slides into the cylindrical device. The imager is turned on and a picture of a "slice" thorugh the body is generated on a television screen. A typical examination now takes four to eight minutes, thought the time is expected to decrease while the number of slices increases with further technological improvements. The equipment here can produce 15 images of the head in 6.5 minutes, which is faster than a CAT scanner operates. The new technique is based on the fact that certain atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen ions, act like tiny bar magnets. They align in one direction when placed in a static magnetic field. Energy in the range of radio waves can cause them to realign the other way. When the imposed radio frequency is removed, they flip back and emit radio waves that are characteristic of the substance and its environment. The same substance with different surroundings would emit a different signal. The N.M.R. imager uses a cylindrical magnet (the one here is a superconducting magnet in which the electromagnetic coils approach a temperature of absolute zero) that surrounds that patient. The plane of the desired image is selected electronically. Radio waves are then turned on, causing the machine to purr like a car engine. When the radio energy is turned off, an antenna imbedded in a plastic hood picks up the radio signals emitted by the body tissues and transmits them to a computer, which analyzes them and depicts the result in pictorial form on a screen. The computer can also analyze the speed at which the nuclei return to their original alignment, giving further information about the environment and chemical makeup of the tissue. Another type of N.M.R. imager uses a nonsuperconducting magnet, which is less expensive but provides more limited information. Motion Doesn't Distort Image The nuclear magnetic technique involves no moving parts and the image it generates is not distorted by motion. Thus, a patient does not have to hold his breath while being examined, and movement of internal organs does not cause blurring. Present equipment produces pictures with a spactial resolution ( a measure of the cripsness of the picture) of 1.7 millimeters, which is comparable to everyday CAT scanners. Dr. Kaufman said his laboratory planned to improve resolution to half a milimeter. Before its potential for medical diagnosis was discovered, nuclear magnetic resonance was used for decades by chemists to analyze uniform samples of solids and liquids. Its potential as a medical tool was first suggested a decade ago by Dr. Raymond Damadian, professor of medicine at Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York in Brooklyn. The theoretical basis for the current N.M.R. imaging techniques was out lines in 1973 by Dr. Paul Lautebur of the New York State University's campus in Stoney Brook, L.I. Despite its many apparent advantages, N.M.R. imaging does have problems. One is its large size and the need to keep it in a place that protects it from extraneous radio signals and substances that contain magnetic iron. Any object with magnetic iron, such as a scredriver, can beocme a flying missile in the powerful magnet's vicinity. People with pacemakers, for example, could not be examined by the new device. Until more is known about possible hazards, pregnant women are also being exluded. The technique does not produce good pictures of bone, but it will show where bone has been infiltrated by soft tissue, such as a bone tumor. Dr. Kaufman predicts that N.M.R. imagers will be introduced much more slowly than CAT scanners were. "We're trying to generate a machine that won't go into planned obsolescence," Dr. Kaufman said. "We hope to be able to make improvements primarily by changing the software and possibly with minor hardware updates. Medical equipment should not be like a car that is replaced by a new model in a few years."

80-> AT 70, SOLTI MAY BE READY TO DELIVER HIS BEST
International careers in music today are increasingly defined by recordings. Artists must still tour, but their reputation among classical-music cognoscenti, and from there eventually to the public at large, is made more than anything else by their recordings - the tangible documents of their artistry, which can be heard and reheard, over and over again. No one better illustrates that proposition than Georg Solti. Mr. Solti came to international prominence in 1959 with his English Decca (American London) recording of Wagner's ''Das Rheingold.'' This was a landmark both for its production techniques and sound - Donner's hammer blow and thunderclap were the favorite demonstration effects for hi-fi cultists for years - and for its very existence, as the beginning of the first studio-recorded ''Ring of the Nibelung.'' Since then, Mr. Solti has gone on to become one of the most admired conductors of our time. He is as well known in Chicago and New York today for his rapturously received concerts with the Chicago Symphony as for his recordings. But his work in the recording studio remains central to his annual schedule, and many of his programs in Chicago and elsewhere are planned to fill gaps in his discography. By now, he has become such a star that he confers prestige on his record company, rather than the other way around. Today, record companies have become desperately eager to promote their conductorstars - and, it seems, to flatter their egos. Deutsche Grammophon, for instance, has been assiduous in propagating the Herbert von Karajan cult in Germany and the world. And last year, German Teldec issued a 10-box, 203-LP limited-run ''Solti Edition'' of all the records Mr. Solti had made for the company. Now, in honor of Mr. Solti's 70th birthday - which took place on Oct. 21 - the Decca-Teldec-London combine has issued four new digital Solti albums, recorded with the three orchestras with which Mr. Solti has been most closely associated during the past two decades. The four releases are Mozart's ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' (LDR 74001) (four disks) and Haydn's Symphonies Nos. 102 and 103 (LDR 71070) with the London Philharmonic, Haydn's ''The Creation'' (LDR 72011) with the Chicago Symphony and Schubert's Symphony No. 9 (LDR 71057) with the Vienna Philharmonic. Even if one has rushed out to buy the 203-disk set, which is available here as an import, one can still add these to one's collection without fear of duplication, since they postdate the ''Solti Edition.'' Mr. Solti is known for fierce, fire-and-brimstone aggressiveness, but that reputation is only partially deserved. In fact, his performances are often oddly stolid and lacking in tensile, phraseto-phrase strength. The result has been, perhaps paradoxically, some rather successful Solti Mozart opera recordings (''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' ''Don Giovanni,'' ''Die Zauberflote'') - cool, understated but also elegantly controlled and unrhetorical. His new ''Figaro'' is a fine performance, too, opulently cast in its principal roles. But it is also too plain, too tense, too harddriven for this most warmly humanistic of Mozart's operas. The standout vocal performance is that of Kiri Te Kanawa as a womanly, affecting, technically commanding Countess. All the women are first-rate, in fact, with Frederica von Stade as the hypersensitive, sensuous Cherubino and Lucia Popp as a bell-clear Susanna. The principal men are Thomas Allen as the Count and Samuel Ramey as Figaro. Their voices are individual, of course. But Mr. Ramey's baritonal bass and Mr. Allen's hefty baritone sound enough alike to rob the casting of the ideal contrast. The two main comic parts, Basilio and Bartolo, are taken by singers, Robert Tear and Kurt Moll, who underplay the humor in comparison to their rivals on other versions. Of those competing stereo sets, the by-now venerable but still superb Erich Kleiber version on London with Lisa Della Casa and Cesare Siepi remains preferable to Mr. Solti's, and the albums conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini, Karl Bohm and Colin Davis are also worthy of consideration. As might be expected, Mr. Solti is more successful with the blunt vigor and hearty classicism of Haydn (he is also a superb Brahmsian, for similar reasons). Mr. Solti's pairing of the these two ''London'' symphonies is a fine one, marked again by dry but effective work from the London Philharmonic. ''The Creation'' is better still. Here the Chicago Symphony makes - or is recorded with - an altgether richer, fuller sound than the London orchestra. And Mr. Solti also has Margaret Hillis's wonderful Chicago Symphony Chorus. The soloists, too, are admirable, particularly Norma Burrowes as a fresh, full-voiced Gabriel. Rudiger Wohlers's sweet tenor makes a fine Uriel, James Morris is the sonorous Raphael, and Adam and Eve are sung by Sylvia Greenberg and Siegmund Nimsgern. Both ''The Creation'' and especially the Haydn symphonies have been so often recorded that it is nearly impossible to label one as ''the best''; personal taste becomes the paramount factor in any such judgment. But Mr. Solti's ''Creation'' surely stands near the top of the list - it has no obvious superiors - and while his symphonies disk may lack the vivacity and wit of some other versions, its earnest directness makes it very winning. The Symphony No. 9 in C, Schubert's great symphonic epic, is another score with manifold recordings - 19 others in the current domestic catalogue - but again Mr. Solti's version ranks very high. The Vienna Philharmonic's unique warmth of tone and suitability for this idiom enlivens Mr. Solti's conducting. But that conducting, again, is itself handsomely achieved. Schubert is another composer who benefits from Mr. Solti's firm sense of overall structure, regularity of pulse and determined unsentimentality. The oddity of this recording is Mr. Solti's decision to take the last-movement exposition repeat, complete with its galloping little transitional passage back to the beginning of the movement that one hardly ever hears. Whether one really needs or wants such comprehensiveness can be debated; Mr. Solti also offers the eminently dispensable arias of Marcellina and Basilio in the fourth act of ''Figaro.'' Textual matters aside, these Haydn and Schubert recordings are attractive work by a conductor in his full maturity; indeed, Mr. Solti in his 70's may be ready to offer us his best recorded work so far. If he does, Teldec may need to prepare a 300-disk ''Solti Edition'' for his 80th birthday.

81-> ROADBLOCK TO PULLOUT: LEBANON-ISRAEL BORDER PACT; News Analysis
The principal political message that President Amin Gemayel left with President Reagan was that Lebanon could not afford to become another Egypt by signing a formal document of any kind with Israel, Lebanese and American officials said today. In describing Mr. Gemayel's talks on Tuesday, the American officials said Mr. Reagan was not unsympathetic to the Lebanese leader's effort to keep his Government at a distance from the Israelis while not provoking the Israelis to the degree that they refused to withdraw their forces from southern Lebanon. A senior Lebanese diplomat said today that Mr. Reagan had gone as far as to tell Mr. Gemayel that he wanted him to retain his ''Arab credentials.'' The Americans recognize that the Lebanese will need billions of dollars in reconstruction aid from Saudi Arabia and the political good will of Syria to be able to take advantage of the new situation in Lebanon and regain control over their country for the first time in seven years. The Danger of a Signed Pact The Lebanese could jeopardize their future by signing an accord - even one limited to security arrangements -with Israel, American officials said. The Lebanese diplomat said Mr. Gemayel was in no position to run the risk of being ostracized in the Arab world as President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt was in 1979. When Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel was here last week, he said Israel was insisting on a formal, signed document with Lebanon, preferably a peace treaty, but at the minimum a ''security agreement'' on keeping southern Lebanon free of guerrillas who could threaten Israel's northern borders. The United States believes that a Lebanese peace treaty with Israel is possible, but only in the context of further progress toward an overall Middle East peace agreement. Arab Leaders to Meet Reagan An Arab League delegation, led by King Hassan II of Morocco, who arrived today, plans to discuss various peace proposals with Mr. Reagan. But nothing is likely to happen until the Lebanon situation is straightend out, officials said. The Administration is still talking of a target date of the end of the year for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces. But Administration officials said today that the obstacles to achieving a Lebanese solution were formidable. It is still too soon, however, to be utterly gloomy, one official said. Mr. Shultz is to report to Mr. Shamir on Thursday morning about the talks with Mr. Gemayel. The Americans want to find out how much the Israelis want security measures in southern Lebanon - something the United States believes is feasible - and how much they want a formal, written agreement - something that would be much more difficult to obtain. At the moment, Israelis say the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin wants both ironclad security arrangements and a formal, written document between Lebanon and Israel. A Sign of Appreciation Mr. Begin is said to want a formal document to show that the Lebanese Government is appreciative of the Israeli invasion because it broke the power of the P.L.O. and Syria in Lebanon. He is also said to want Lebanon to show that it is willing to follow Egypt's example and normalize relations with Israel. State Department officials said they viewed the Israeli position as only an opening maximum demand that would be modified in coming weeks. The hope is that the United States can persuade the Israelis to be satisfied with security arrangements that are not necessarily accompanied by a signed accord. Another problem is that Syria does not want to withdraw its 30,000 troops in Lebanon under a timetable with Israel. They want Israel to leave first because they consider the Israelis the invaders, an American official said. While the Syrians are demanding that the Israelis leave first, the Israelis want the P.L.O. to go first, followed by simultaneous Israeli and Syrian withdrawals. 'A Sparse Pine Tree' ''Everyone wants a Christmas tree laden with presents for withdrawal,'' one American official said. ''We would like to see a sparse pine tree without any adornments.'' In the pragmatic United States view, there should be a general agreement on withdrawal, with the Americans' negotiating an acceptable timetable and security considerations. White House officials said Mr. Reagan was very impressed by the 40-year old Mr. Gemayel, who is 32 years his junior. In their meeting, Mr. Gemayel appealed to Mr. Reagan for the United States to ''stay deeeply involved'' in all the discussions leading to the withdrawal of forces from Lebanon, one official said. Mr. Reagan reportedly assured him that the United States ''would indeed stay the course in playing a very active role.'' American officials said they sympathized with Mr. Gemayel's efforts to maintain ties with the Arab world - a necessity if Syria is to withdraw willingly - and to avoid worsening relations with Israel to the point where the Israelis refuse to leave. Occupiers or Liberators? But the thrust of Mr. Gemayel's policies, at least as they were made known here and at the United Nations, has not been well received by the Israelis. The Israelis feel he is trying to portray them as occupiers instead of as the liberators they see themselves. The Lebanese problem is inevitably connected to the overall peace efforts being pursued by the Administration. The Arab League delegation is scheduled to meet with Mr. Reagan on Friday to discuss the Middle East plan that the President made public on Sept. 1 and to explain the results of the recent conference of Arab leaders in Fez, Morocco. At the Fez talks, the Arabs repeated their demands for Israeli withdrawal from all lands captured in the 1967 war, but they seemed to suggest that Israel might be recognized by the Arabs. U.S. Seeking Peace Talks American officials do not expect too much from the meeting on Friday, but they hope to make it clear to the Arabs that the United States is less interested in formal, written positions than in all sides' agreeing to sit down and negotiate. Progress on the long-term issues involved in achieving peace in the Middle East has been stalled by the Lebanon problem, a senior American official said today. Until there is an agreement on how the withdrawal of all foreign troops will be achieved, Egypt will not resume the Camp David talks with Israel and the United States on Palestinian self-rule, which is still the heart of the Reagan Middle East plan. Until there is an accord on Lebanon, Jordan is also unlikely to make a move to join the discussions. American officials also acknowledge that to achieve the withdrawal of all Israeli, Syrian and P.L.O. forces from Lebanon the number and the scope of the American marines in Lebanon may have to be expanded. Mr. Gemayel, during his visit to Washington, requested an increase in the size and scope of the three-nation peacekeeping force. No official is now willing to say when the marines will be withdrawn. They certainly will remain in Lebanon until the last of the foreign forces are pulled out, but the Lebanese also want them to stay until their own army is rebuilt and enlarged. This is a politically sensitive issue because Mr. Reagan said when the marines were sent to Lebanon last month that they would be there only for ''a limited period.'' The Lebanese insist their army is too small and poorly equipped to provide security buffers, not only in southern Lebanon, where the Israelis are, but in the east and north, where the Syrians and the P.L.O. are. The Americans would have preferred the United Nations to asssume the peacekeeping role in Lebanon. But they now assert that a combination of United Nations forces, Lebanese troops and members of the American-French-Italian force will probably have to be dispersed around the country.

84-> MUSEUM IN BOSTON ASKING PUBLIC AID
The Museum of Transportation is turning to the public for help in putting off a bank sale of $1.3 million worth of the museum's antique fire engines, cars, trucks, bicycles and carriages. ''The only recourse we have is if there is enough public support, and interest and concern expressed by the bank, we will be able to reopen negotiations,'' said Lydia Kowalski, the director of the museum, which has been closed since May 17 and owes two banks $720,000 for construction and operating costs. Judge Rudolph F. Pierce of the Suffolk Superior Court refused Wednesday to block the sale of antique vehicles, including a fire engine owned by Arthur Fiedler, the late conductor of the Boston Pops, which had been put up as collateral on the loan. Judge Pierce said he hoped the banks, the First National Bank of Boston and Shawmut Bank of Boston, and the museum could work out the debt payments outside court. Bank's Intentions Cited But the museum director said that a First National loan officer gave her a letter Wednesday telling her of the banks' intentions to mark the items for collateral on Monday before putting them up for sale. ''I have every indication from the bank that they are going to go ahead with the sale of the collection,'' she said. Wayne J. Taylor, a spokesman for the First National Bank, said: ''We have no wish to repossess - auction off - those classic automobiles. However, for almost a year we've had no payment on the loan. It is the banks' intent to take possession of the collateral. We do not want to close down the Museum of Transportation. We'd like to get them back in business.'' He added that the bank did not consider negotiations closed. The museum director said that in order to pay part of the debt the museum planned to sell its portion of a renovated waterfront building, where, in June 1979, it moved with the Children's Museum. Immediate Repayment Sought But two weeks ago, she said, the First National Bank said it was not satisfied with the progress the museum was making to repay the loans and wanted an immediate repayment plan. She said the museum now planned to use the money from the sale of the building ''to salvage as much of the collection as we can,'' should the holdings go on the auction block. Included among the $1.3 million collateral are 13 turn-of-thecentury cars, horse-drawn vehicles, several fire engines donated by Mr. Fiedler, vehicles once owned by a diplomat, Larz Anderson, and bicycles, tool collections and a library. The value of the museum's total collection has been estimated at $3.2 million. ''The American Association of Museums is observing this whole proceeding,'' the director said. ''This is a precedent-establishing action that could endanger other museums.''

A mother and her 13-year-old son were killed early yesterday in a two-alarm fire at their Brooklyn home that also left two firefighters injured, authorities said. A Fire Department spokesman said the 45-year-old mother, Helen Patton, and her son, Kolemba, were found dead from burns in separate bedrooms on the fourth floor of the family's four-story brownstone at 358 Jefferson Avenue, between Throop and Tompkins Avenues. The woman's husband and another son were able to flee unharmed, the spokesman said.

86-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
A Teddy Comes Home H e was the only American President born in New York City and tomorrow, on the 124th anniversary of his birth, the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace at 28 East 20th Street will finally have a teddy bear to call its own. The national historic site, a 1923 reconstruction of the brownstone where T.R. spent his first 15 years, is a museum of memorabilia. But its only version of the toy inspired by his popularity - and by a 1902 newspaper cartoon - has been on loan from the Museum of the City of New York. Yesterday, at a breakfast meeting that looked rather like a children's birthday party, a new 12-inch bear sat in the center of the table. It was a re-creation of a 1904 teddy bear from Steiff, the 102-year-old German maker of stuffed animals. On all fours, it almost shambled - less cuddly and plushy than later models, with longer front legs (or is it arms?), bigger paws, hairier fur pelt and a true bear-back hump. The bear's prototype is in the new Margaret Woodbury Strong Museum in Rochester. It was one of 30,000 playthings among the 300,000 objects of the 1830-1930 era collected by Mrs. Strong. Alerted by a curator, Hans-Otto Steiff, current head of the company, went to Rochester for a look and took it home to copy for his current teddy bear line. He handed over one of the first replicas to Diane Jung, manager of the Roosevelt Historic Site - who hopes to keep it out of a glass case, a touchable teddy bear for the school classes who visit.

87-> MANITOBA LOBBYING AGAINST U.S. WATER PLAN
The Government of this province has begun an intense lobbying campaign in Washington aimed at halting a longplanned irrigation project for North Dakota. People here believe that the project threatens fish, fishermen and fish-eating Indian tribes of Manitoba. Using direct appeals that have irritated United States diplomats, the Manitobans are trying to recruit members of Congress and have them vote down an appropriation bill that has to be approved by Dec. 15 if work on the project is to continue. The project, the Garrison Diversion, which would take water from the Garrison reservoir in northwestern North Dakota and channel it through lakes and streams to the parched central third of the state. The conflict pits the virtually unanimous sentiment of North Dakotans against the equally solid views of people on this side of the border. The issue has been mounting ever since the idea was raised in 1944. According to proponents in North Dakota, the project is a perfectly safe plan that fulfills a promise made when the Garrison dam was built 35 years ago to protect states downstream from regular flooding. They feel the Government is obliged to redeem the sacrifices made when lakes formed by the dam covered half a million acres of fertile bottom lands. On the Canadian side the perspective is very different. Opposition has grown sharply since 1969 when naturalists began asking what might happen when the diverted water drained into Manitoba's rivers and lakes. The problem, they said, is that two river systems, while close to each other, have developed as self-enclosed entities, with the North Dakota waters draining through the Missouri and Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico and the Manitoba waters flowing north to Hudson Bay. ''The two systems are on opposite sides of the continental divide, and act as if they were on opposite slopes of a peaked roof,'' said Claudia Engel, head of the Garrison Focal Office, which the Government set up to mobilize and inform Manitobans of what North Dakota is doing to advance the project and what Canada is doing to thwart it. Since the two systems are distinct, different species of fish evolved in their respective waters. People here contend that the Garrison project would mingle the waters that nature has kept apart and that commercially valueless fish from the American system, such as rainbow smelt, gizzard shad and Utah chub, would compete for food and soon overwhelm the native whitefish, walleye and sauger that support Manitoba's extensive fish industry. In addition, they say, tourism would suffer and Indians who depend on the fish would be deprived of a major protein source. In 1977 these points were weighed by a joint commission first established under a 1909 treaty between Canada and the United States to deal with disputes on boundary waters. The panel recommended that because a ''fish screen cannot with any certainty prevent biota and disease transfers which would cause severe and irreversible damage to the ecosystem and, in particular, to the commercial and sport fisheries in Canada, those portions of the Garrison Diversion unit which could affect waters flowing into Canada not be built at this time.'' In the meantime, the Audubon Society had obtained an order to bar construction during the Carter Administration. The order has since been lifted and work on several pumping stations and canals has begun in accordance with a scaled-down version of the project that North Dakotans believe accommodates the commission's concerns. Homer M. Engelhorn, manager of the Garrison Diversion Conservancy district, says Canadian qualms are misplaced. ''We think we can show them how the water from Garrison Diversion will be of great benefit to Manitoba through freshening its streams,'' said Mr. Engelhorn, who lives in Carrington, N.D.

89-> Ramada Debt Is Restructured
Ramada Inns said its lenders had agreed to restructure their existing debt agreement with the company, subject to final execution of documents. The agreement was disclosed in testimony to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission by Thomas E. Martin, the company's chief financial officer. The new agreement, which will carry an interest rate of 110 percent of the prime rate, calls for a new schedule on the principal payments for Ramada's $110 million loan on its Atlantic City Tropicana hotel and casino, which opened late last year, and for a separate, threeyear revolving credit facility for up to $90 million. The revolving credit portion would include up to $40 million to assist the company with its seasonal working capital needs over this fall and winter, Ramada said. Ramada's current agreement with its lenders requires the payment of $70 million in principal in January 1984. The revised agreement will spread out the payments while also extending the term of the loan. Ramada's current agreement with its lenders requires the payment

91-> On Mexico
To the Business Editor: ''Mexico's Cambridge Connection'' (Oct.24), your presentation of the Cambridge economists' analysis of that economy and our role in policy formation, was seriously misleading in some ways. We were, indeed, in favour of economic expansion to industrialize the country, to create jobs, but not at any cost or regardless of the circumstances. In a series of papers over the last three years, we argued that the Mexican economic expansion, under the existing liberalized trade and payments policies, was unviable, as it was generating increasing balance of payments disequilibria. The main issue dividing the Central Bank and Treasury economists, and ourselves was that of devaluation. The former favored devaluation basically on the ground that the Mexican rate of inflation was much greater than the American rate. We argued instead that devaluation would not be a suitable instrument for dealing with the external imbalance, as its impact on that imbalance, large or small, would manifest itself only with a considerable time lag; however, a devaluation would immediately lead to inflation, financial instability, further devaluation, etc. It gives us no pleasure to record that this is much the sequence of events which actually occurred between February and September 1982, following the floating of the peso. In our view, the economy by 1980 was so overheated and the external financial position was so serious that in order to protect the achievements and prospects of the real economy (i.e., jobs and production), immediate and direct action in the form of strict controls over imports was absolutely essential. In the event, such controls were adopted in the second half of 1981, but they were both too late and insufficient, given the economic circumstances. We were economic advisers at the Ministry of Natural Resources and Industry. Monetary and fiscal policy, as elsewhere in the world, is entirely the responsibility of the Central Bank and the Treasury, not of the Ministry of Industry. Our Ministry was concerned with industrial policy, commercial policy (as it affected industry) and with long-term oil policy. To the extent that macroeconomic policy affected industrial development, the Ministry commented on these issues. Setting a limit on oil exports, and the decision not to join GATT, were among the two major achievements of the Ministry over the last six years. As Mexico is an open society, there have always been foreign economic advisers at the Central Bank, the Treasury and elsewhere. The role of the Cambridge economists at the Industry Ministry was similar. We helped provide a rather different policy perspective on the Mexican economy to that of the orthodox economists. We were not experimenting on the Mexican economy with dangerous new ideas and hypotheses. The Cambridge intellectual influence, such as it was, derived from the fact that our analyses were in accord with the best traditions of Latin American economics (i.e., the structuralist school) as well as with policies which had successfully been pursued in Mexico itself in the past. Our contribution was to help make these ideas more precise, to translate them into quantifiable and policy terms. In the present crisis of the Mexican and the world economy, we have no doubt that these ideas - control over imports and foreign exchange, and the central role of government in promoting economy activity - are all the more essential for meeting the basic needs and aspirations of the Mexican people.

93-> MAN PLEADS GUILTY TO 6 MURDERS; SAYS KILLING 'MAKES ME HAPPY'
A 21-year-old man pleaded guilty yesterday to six murders, and told the judge that killing ''makes me happy.'' The murderer, David Bullock of Manhattan, smiled and occasionally chuckled as he described the murders to Justice Burton B. Roberts during a two-hour proceeding in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. ''It's fun,'' the soft-spoken defendant told the judge, who said he planned to sentence him on Nov. 29 to a term that ''guarantees you never get out of jail as long as you shall live.'' Mr. Bullock, arrested Jan. 14, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison on each of six counts of second-degree murder. Killer Describes His Killings Mr. Bullock told of shooting James Weber, 42, an actor and performer in the Light Opera of Manhattan, last Dec. 5 in Central Park. Only hours before he was killed, Mr. Weber, who lived at 559 West 123d Street, had appeared in a leading role of a production of Victor Herbert's ''Babes in Toyland'' at the 74th Street Playhouse on the East Side. Mr. Bullock also described the murder on Dec. 15 of Stephen Glenn Hassell, 29, a partner in the investment concern of Hassell & Levi Company, who was killed in his combination office and apartment overloooking the South Street Seaport. ''I just put the pillow over his head and shot him,'' Mr. Bullock said. When the judge asked why, he replied, ''No particular reason, something to amuse myself.'' Mr. Bullock, who told the judge he worked as a prostitute, said Mr. Hassell had picked him up and taken him to his apartment. Last Dec. 13, Mr. Bullock said, he met a prostitute named Edwina Atkins and ''told her about the body in Central Park.'' ''She laughed in my face,'' Mr. Bullock said. He said he and Miss Atkins, 23, went to her apartment, had sexual relations and then he ''put a pillow over her head and shot her'' because ''she knew too much.'' He added that he set a fire in the apartment before he left. Mr. Bullock also admitted killing Herberto Morales, 50, at Mr. Morales's apartment in Manhattan last Dec. 22. Mr. Bullock said he and Mr. Morales returned to the apartment after a Christmas party, when Mr. Morales ''started messing with the Christmas tree, telling me how nice the Christmas tree was, so I shot him.'' ''It was in the Christmas spirit,'' he said of the killing. ''It makes me happy.'' Mr. Bullock said he killed Michael Winley, 29, his roommate, and dumped his body in the Harlem River because ''he crossed me too many times.'' Mr. Bullock said that on Jan. 4, using a sawed-off shotgun, he killed Eric Michael Fuller, 28, in what the police said was a robbery attempt in Mount Morris Park. He used a .38 pistol in the other shootings.

94-> HIS LIFE SPARED IN 3 KILLINGS, HE TELLS OF MORE
Gerald Eugene Stano, already serving time in prison for six murders, is continuing to confess additional killings of women and girls, according to the authorities here. By the end of last month, the police said they had Mr. Stano's written confessions to 32 murders in Florida and two in New Jersey. In October he admitted strangling, stabbing or shooting to death 25 victims, all female, in central Florida from 1973 to 1979. Mr. Stano, who is 31 years old, has been interviewed by Pennsylvania police officers who are seeking information on six slayings in their state. Mr. Stano, 31 years old, has ''informally'' confessed those killings, according to Detective Sgt. Paul B. Crow of Daytona Beach. Sergeant Crow, who has been listening to the confessions almost daily for three months, said psychologists had told him Mr. Stano had killed more people than he has yet admitted. Mr. Stano's attorney concurs. Of the Florida victims, Sergeant Crow has said, one was a high school cheerleader and most of the others were prostitutes or hitchhikers. None was sexually assaulted, he said. Details Said to Be Extensive To date, Mr. Stano, a former cook, has confessed more killings than John Wayne Gacy, who was convicted of 33 murders in the Chicago area in 1980. In each of the Florida and New Jersey cases, Sergeant Crow said, Mr. Stano has provided extensive details on his victims and the circumstances of their deaths. Mr. Stano was convicted of three murders in Volusia County, Fla., on Sept. 2, 1981. Confessions in three others were read into his record. By negotiated arrangement, he was spared the electric chair but given a minimum of 75 years in state prison. In August, the sergeant said, Mr. Stano told him he was ready to talk about other killings. Since the latest three-month round of confessions began, new indictments against him have been handed up in two other Florida counties. 'It Doesn't Bother Him at All' Psychologists have tried for almost three years, since Mr. Stano began confessing, to determine why he killed people and why he talked freely about the killings. ''It doesn't bother him at all to give you the grisly details,'' Sergeant Crow said. The sources of his trouble, the police and psychologists said, are apparently a marriage that ended in divorce as well as bad relationships with young women in high school and with the family that adopted him when he was an infant. ''If father had spent more time with me,'' one psychologist quoted him as saying, ''I probably wouldn't be in the situation I'm in now.'' In a confession recorded in a courtroom, Mr. Stano said he had left the body of a Daytona Beach woman near the home of his younger adoptive brother, adding, ''I figured that maybe I could get back at him.'' He has said he kills women because he gets angry at them. A motel maid, Nancy Hurd, was strangled, he said, because ''she started to sound like my future wife,'' at the time he was engaged to marry, ''bitching, bitching, bitching, and I wasn't about to take it from anybody. I just can't stand a bitchy chick.'' Escape From Prison Routine Mr. Stano said he was confessing because it was ''high time that everything came out in the open.'' Sergeant Crow and a psychologist, Dr. Ann McMillan, have another explanation. They say Mr. Stano has realized that confessing draws continued attention to him and provides an escape from prison routine. ''Once he was assured of not getting the electric chair and convicted,'' Dr. McMillan said, ''the confessions would be the only way left to build his ego.'' However, Mr. Stano is not exempt from further prosecution. Sergeant Crow said Mr. Stano enjoyed talking about the killings and that to gain his trust he had persuaded the prisoner that he was sympathetic.

96-> MAILBOX; Still Rooting For Doug Kotar
To the Sports Editor: I am writing in response to Ira Berkow's article on Doug Kotar (''Doug Kotar Is Back Home With His Family,'' The New York Times, Nov. 14). As a devoted Giants fan, the tragic illness of one of its family hurts me deeply. Because I am only 20 years of age, the Giant teams that I have rooted for are not comprised of Gifford, Webster, and Huff, but of Fredrickson, Mendenhall, Carson, and Kotar. These were not the greatest of Giant years. It was not until last season that I had seen the Giants participate in any kind of postseason play. Because of this, it was the little things that the Giants did which made the fans of this era happy. One of these ''things'' was the play of Doug Kotar. His determined, hard-nosed play lightened many of Sunday's losses. After reading Mr. Berkow's article, I see that these characteristics are part of his personality, not just on the football field but off it as well. It is easily seen why he is respected so much by his teammates, management, and fans. It is good to see the support being given to him now because Doug Kotar is deserving of it. We envy the courage and strength that he has. I can only wish the best for him and his family. They will certainly be a part of my prayers. TONY BIBBO West Point, N.Y.

97-> HEADLINERS; The Best Bad News
You don't have to be an economic forecaster to know that the $5,000 Theodore S. Silbert Award is a tidy windfall, but you do have to be one to get it. In fact, you have to be the best of the 40 prognosticators who sit on the Blue Chip Economic Indicators Panel. Which, it was announced last week, Charles B. Reeder was this year. Mr. Reeder, the chief economist for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, was judged to have come closest to Government statistics on unemployment, the gross national product and inflation over a period of three years beginning in 1979. He was the second winner of the annual award. Next year, incidentally, Mr. Reeder sees the prime rate falling to 8 percent.

98-> History Lesson
To The Business Editor: In ''The Economist as Preacher'' (Oct. 24), Prof. George J. Stigler makes the point that we know more about history through the educated classes. No doubt they knew how to express themselves. The mass of mankind was, and is, inarticulate. However, history teaches us that the inarticulate masses once in a while express their views and feelings quite forcibly. I doubt if they were always as pleased with their lot as Professor Stigler would have us believe. I refer him to the Gracchi; Rome at the time of Julius Caesar; the peasant revolt at the time of Luther; the French Revolution; the Russian Revolution, to name a few incidents. As far as the intellectuals are concerned, perhaps Professor Stigler should get a copy of August Bebel's memoirs. He was born in the military barracks of Cologne and never went to school past his 14th year. Perhaps he might also read up on some American trade union leaders such as Gompers. The lower classes who came to this country over the centuries did not come here because of the economic regime of laissez-faire capitalism but because they were oppressed in their own country. They did not know what laissez-faire capitalism meant. For that matter, it might be interesting to know how the black ghettos feel about laissez-faire capitalism.

99-> INWOOD
Depending upon the sort of New Yorker one is talking to, Inwood is either where Columbia University plays its football games, or it is the area that lies below the south anchor of the Henry Hudson Bridge, or it is ultima Thule on the A train. In all cases, it is the narrow northern tip of Manhattan, and it is emblematic of change that today midtown cab drivers know where it is and do not stubbornly insist that Payson Avenue or Cumming Street or Indian Road is across the river in Riverdale. The traditional rejection of the reality that Inwood is part of Manhattan probably stems from the state of mind depicted in the W.P.A. Guide to New York City, published in the 1930's. It said that Inwood's ''rivers and hills insulate a suburban community that is as separate an entity as any in Manhattan.'' A minor symbol of Inwood's wider window to the south is the recent opening of a carrot-cake bakery on Broadway at 214th Street not far from the Gallo Auto Body Shop. The arrival of trendy carrot cake among the rugelach, black-and-whites and jelly doughnuts favored in old Inwood supports the belief that some new people are filtering in, looking for reasonably priced pleasant places to live, where commutation is not a day's work. Inwood fits its name: It lies north of Washington Heights and Fort Washington, claiming a short strip in the Broadway valley between; it is two-fifths greenbelt, with park filling its northern and western borders along the Harlem and Hudson Rivers. The grounds, trees and gardens of Columbia's Baker Field on the north flow into Manhattan's only primeval park, Inwood Hill, at the Harlem-Hudson confluence. This seamlessly joins Isham Park, once the Isham Estate, whose gatehouse below on Broadway, in a typical piece of Inwood adaptation, now shelters the Gallo shop. The southern end of Inwood Hill Park meets Fort Tryon Park at Dyckman Street. Inwood's spine is Broadway, and the elevated line of the No. 1 local of the Broadway-Seventh Avenue IRT joins it at 218th Street. The A train of the Independent line ends underground at 207th Street, which, like Dyckman Street, is a main cross street for the area. By either line, the trip to midtown Manhattan takes about 45 minutes. Inwood now also has a stop at 207th Street for the $2.50 East Side express bus run by Liberty Lines. Just north of the 218th Street intersection is an area the Presbyterian Hospital is considering as the site for a new 300-bed community hospital. Presbyterian Hospital now shares a medical center with Columbia at 168th Street, and one possible site would be the eastern end of Baker Field. Another is on the east side of Broadway, but this would require street closing. Although change is clearly afoot, Inwood retains many of the characteristics it had when it was intensively developed in the 30's. Before that, it had been unfolding much as expected by Frederick Law Olmsted and his partner, J. James R. Croes, who in a plan submitted in 1876, envisioned it as a residential neighborhood for ''fairly comfortable people.'' Some of the comfortable buildings of earlier times, still bearing faint letters offering ''steam heat and hot water'' and other amenities, are in trouble now. At least two old buildings are being rehabilitated privately and others bear plaques noting rehabilitation with tax aid. But the low-rise and light density character persists. Tucked among the low rises are one-and two-family houses with trees and tiny yards. The neighborhood bubbles with children and schools: Good Shepherd and St. Jude's Roman Catholic elementary schools, the Northeastern Academy of the Seventh Day Adventists, St. Matthew's Lutheran School and a public elementary school and junior high school keep the buses full and the pizzerias busy. For all its suburban quality, Inwood is not homogenous. On the east side of 10th Avenue, it is a transport hub and provides some necessary and gritty services for the greater city. Auto wreckers and repair shops adjoin bars. Gas stations abound, although some have folded. An ancient brick barn for city buses sprawls on Broadway. Much of the Harlem River shoreline on the east is filled with a Con Edison generating station and subway yards. A kennel and a pet crematory sit next to an auto laundry. One result is that the area is more active around the clock than a suburb. After shifts, workers emerge from the end of the IND line, and this means coffee shops keep late hours. Bars that are drowsing at 10 P.M. sometimes are swinging by midnight. And the supermarket that replaced the Miramar swimming pool on 207th Street operates 24 hours a day. It may be this mechanical heart that holds gentrification at bay. Residential Inwood is still mostly a rental area, save for its private houses, a cluster of Mitchell-Lama limited-profit co-ops at the southern end and Park Terrace Gardens near Isham Park. And it is likely to stay a rental area, in the view of Paul Maslin, who with his partners is an owner and manager at Nehring Brothers, an established upper Manhattan brokerage. Noting rents of $170 and $300 that sounded more like the 1960's than the 1980's, Mr. Maslin said they were so low that none of the tenants would want to to buy their apartments, especially since the maintenance would then be higher than the rent. And at such rents, he went on, few are likely to move out either. Indeed, the area has few vacancies and many residents represent the third generation of their families to live on the same street, and even in the same building. INWOOD'S few private houses turn over seldom, and then usually q uickly. Joseph H. Green, a broker active in upper Manhattan, said t hat some of the better one-@ and two-family houses could bring $ 160,000 in today's market. The neighborhood has some architectural treasures. Dyckman House, Manhattan's surviving 18th century farmhouse, is a city museum set upon a rise over Broadway. Some of its old family objects were lost in a trade with Boscobel, another Dyckman home up the Hudson, but children never fail to be amazed on finding that the setting is part of the house: The wall along the interior stair is one of Inwood's many bare granite outcroppings. West of the farmhouse, the apartment houses of Seaman Avenue, Beak Street and Payson Avenue are sprinkled with gems of Art Deco doorways, modernistic fire escapes and courtyards with fountains. Inwood has two grave lacks. It lacks adequate off-street parking space in an auto-owning neighborhood and, although it has a Chinese restaurant and ormica-tabled eating places, it has no midtown-class restaurant. Assemblyman John Brian Murtaugh worries about the latter problem a lot. ''If I could just get the O'Neals interested,'' he said. ''Otherwise, we really have everything.'' For the Lions, a Road Show to '84 At the Brown game Saturday, Columbia College's Lions will give their last roar in Baker Field for quite a while. A gift of $3 million this year from Lawrence A. Wien, an alumnus with $2 billion in real-estate holdings, has provided a good part of the money needed to rebuild the venerated but decrepit wood stadium in concrete. To allow the construction, Columbia's football team will play an entire season on the road next fall. Columbia expects to begin dismantling the 54-year-old green grandstands before spring. So much of the bleachers had rotted and suffered fires that far fewer than 15,000 of the stadium's 32,000 original seats are open for use. The rest have been demolished or fenced off for safety. The university, whose main campus is 100 blocks south, on 116th Street and Broadway, is aiming at getting the Lions back home by the 1984 season. The new Baker Field will bring a bonanza for the city as a whole: an eight-lane 400-meter track with a synthethic surface. Now, the city's only major outdoor site for track and field events is Downing Stadium on Randalls Island, which is also dilapidated. The addition of a track will reduce the permanent seating capacity of Baker Field to 20,000, but this should not be a problem since the maximum attendance at recent Columbia games has been 11,000. ''It will be not just for Columbia but for New York City,'' Kevin DeMarrais, the school's director of sports information, said. ''We hope to attract major championship meets from high schools on up.'' The ornamental iron gates at the foot of Seaman Avenue that give drivers and walkers a vista of the field and Riverdale beyond will be salvaged, Columbia says, but shifted eastward along 218th Street.

100-> HEADLINERS; Prime's Time
British officials would probably love to be able to say that painstaking spycraft helped them ferret out Geoffrey Arthur Prime, who sold secrets to Moscow for a decade. But the fact is, Mr. Prime's wife squealed on him. At his sentencing last week - he got 35 years for doing ''incalculable harm'' to British and allied security - his lawyer described him as a ''desperately lonely, sexually inadequate social misfit'' who had turned to molesting adolescent girls (he got three years for that). He recently confessed the sex crimes to his wife, also mentioning that he had spied for the Soviet Union while working as a translator at a top secret Government listening post in the 1970's. Mrs. Prime told all, and Mr. Prime, confronted, confessed.

101-> SELF-INTEREST CRUCIAL TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST
To the Editor: The Columbia Business School graduate student gets no more than a C (or maybe a D+) for his essay on corporate responsibility (''What a Corporation Owes Its Shareholders,'' letter Oct. 27). But he is wrong when he suggests that a private corporation can fulfill its public responsibility in a free society by pursuing seriously goals other than the long-run self-interest of its owners. He errs in failing to distinguish between a quick grab for maximum gains over a short period and the steady growth of profitability over the long haul. Short-run maximization of profit often comes a cropper; long-run optimization of profit is the only legitimate way in which a corporation can satisfy its social function. Unless a corporation consistently earns a competitive return on its invested capital, it will not attract the funds required to satisfy the needs of the consumers, employees and communities about which Mr. Brewer is so concerned. Indeed, the genius of the enterprise system lies in the fact that unfet-tered interplay between self-interested competitors produces the optimal allocation of scarce resources, and hence the greatest wealth and welfare for all.

102-> LIBEL LAWYER SAYS PENTHOUSE RULING AIDS WRITERS
A Federal appeals court ruling that an article in Penthouse magazine about the sexual activities of a beauty contestant was not libelous was described yesterday by a leading lawyer in First Amendment law as ''extremely significant.'' ''If this case had stood, the impact on parody and satire would have been devastating,'' said the lawyer, Dan Paul, of the Miami firm of Paul & Thomson. ''There wouldn't have been any more Jonathan Swifts without serious risk of liability.'' The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in a 2-to-1 decision Friday in Denver, overturned a $12.5 million libel award to Kim Pring, who was Miss Wyoming in 1978. The majority opinion, written by Chief Judge Oliver Seth and concurred in by Judge James K. Logan, held that, while the article was ''gross, unpleasant and crude,'' it was ''a complete fantasy'' and could not possibly refer to a living person. Dissent on Factual Content The dissenting judge, Jean Breitenstein, said he disagreed that the article was pure fantasy protected by the First Amendment since the story contained both fact and fiction. The fictionalized article, written by Philip Cioffari, a professor at William Paterson College in New Jersey, appeared in the August 1979 issue of Penthouse. It depicted certain on-stage sexual activities of a Miss Wyoming contestant at a Miss America beauty pageant. Miss Pring's lawsuit argued that she had been ridiculed and subjected to lewd and profane telephone calls and other incidents after publication of the article in Penthouse. Mr. Paul said he thought the Denver ruling would ''clear the air and restore a proper balance'' under the First Amendment that publishers, authors and lawyers felt had been seriously threatened by a contrary ruling in another important libel case in Caifornia three years ago. Important of Appeals Cited Furthermore, Mr. Paul said, ''it shows the importance of adequate appellate review of jury verdicts'' in First Amendment cases. Both cases concerned the First Amendment question of how far an author can go in creating fictional characters and events out of reallife persons and situations. The earlier case involved Gwen Davis Mitchell, author of ''Touching,'' and her publisher, Doubleday & Company, who were sued by Paul Bindrim, a California psychologist. He contended that he was the real-life model for her fictional character who was engaged in nude encounter therapy methods. A California jury upheld his contention that he had been defamed and awarded him $75,000. The United States Supreme Court declined to review the case, prompting Townsend Hoopes, president of the Association of American Publishers, to express concern that the California court's award and the Supreme Court's refusal to reconsider were ''bound to influence other courts.'' Mr. Paul emphasized that the Denver ruling was particularly important, when measured against the earlier case, because it resulted from appellate review. A Federal court jury in Cheyenne initially had awarded Miss Pring $26.5 million. But Federal District Judge Clarence A. Brimmer later reduced the award to $12.5 million. Miss Pring's lawyer, Gerald Spence, of the firm of Spence, Moriarity & Schuster in Jackson, Wyo., was attending a conference on the law and the communications media yesterday in Princeton, N.J., and could not be reached for comment on whether there would be an appeal to the highest court.

103-> RACE FOR CONGRESS IS VIGOROUS ON L.I.
John LeBoutillier, the freshman Republican Congressman from Long Island whose occasional jabs at his Washington colleagues have brought him national attention, was complaining the other night that he was not as well known at home as he would like. ''I'm doing all right, but I could be doing better,'' the 28-yearold Representative told a group of wealthy supporters at a fundraising reception in Manhattan. ''Two-thirds of the district is brand new. They don't know me.'' His Democratic challenger, Robert Mrazek, faces a similar, but more acute, version of the recognition problem. Mr. Mrazek, the minority leader of the Suffolk County Legislature, is popular in the Suffolk portion of the substantially redrawn Third Congressional District. But he concedes that he still needs to spread his message in the district's Nassau County section, which makes up 55 percent of it. Not on Committee's List The 36-year-old Mr. Mrazek, considered a long shot but ''classy candidate'' by the Democratic National Committee, is not on a list of six Democratic challengers the committee believes can unseat freshmen Republicans in Congress, according to Ann Lewis, the committee's political director. But Mr. Mrazek, who so far has received only $2,500 from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is hoping that Republicans in the district are irritated enough by what he calls Mr. LeBoutillier's ''eccentricities'' to vote against the incumbent on Nov. 2. Mr. LeBoutillier has referred to the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, as ''big, fat and out of control.'' He has also described the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Charles H. Percy, Republican of Illinois, as a ''wimp.'' Mr. Mrazek believes that the Right-to-Life candidate, Richard G. Bohner, will take a significant number of votes away from Mr. LeBoutillier, who also has the Conservative Party endorsement. Mr. Mrazek is careful not to paint himself as a doctrinaire Democrat. ''My philosophy is not a party philosophy,'' he said. ''I'm not a company boy.'' The new district has 105,000 registered Republicans, 77,000 Democrats and 40,000 independents. The Role of Television Mr. LeBoutillier says that money will make the difference in this election. ''Because of this party we will have enough money for the TV we need.'' he told some supporters, including the actor Charlton Heston, who were at the Union League Club in Manhattan to hear President Reagan answer questions from them on closed-circuit television. ''I am a great believer in TV winning campaigns.'' Mr. LeBoutillier's campaign picked up $50,000 at the $1,000-aticket event. The Congressman said he had already spent $70,000 on television time and would spend an additional $150,000 in the last 10 days of the campaign. A total of $350,000 will be spent on the campaign, according to Christian N. Braunlich, the Congressman's administrative aide. Both campaigns have been the beneficiaries of political action committee money, but it has come from different ends of the ideological spectrum. Mr. LeBoutillier has received money from the National Rifle Association, the Fund for a Conservative Majority and the National Conservative Political Action Committee. Labor union political action committees, including the United Automobile Workers, the Communications Workers of America and the National Education Association, have each given near the maximum $10,000 contribution to Mr. Mrazek. Mr. Mrazek, who expects to top $200,000 in his fund raising, has no plans for television advertising. He is spending the bulk of his funds on radio commercials. A 'Polar Prison' In one of them, Mr. Mrazek ridicules a television advertisement by Mr. LeBoutillier in which he suggests shipping hardened criminals to a ''polar prison'' in Alaska. ''Fantasy island,'' says Mr. Mrazek. In another radio commercial, Mr. Mrazek questions the legality of a $227,800 loan that Mr. LeBoutillier made to his 1980 election campaign. Mr. Mrazek has lodged a formal complaint with the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, asking it to investigate the loan. The Federal Election Commission, at Mr. Mrazek's request, is also looking into the origin of the loan. Mr. LeBoutillier contends that the money came from his father's estate. Mr. Mrazek questions Mr. LeBoutillier's claim and points out that the money was not listed in the Congressman's personal disclosure form filed before the 1980 election. Of the ''polar prison'' proposal - a concept that Mr. LeBoutillier says he stole from Barry Gray, the radio personality - the Congressman said it was a plan that contrasted with a proposal by Mr. Mrazek. ''Bob wants to build new prisons here in Suffolk County,'' Mr. LeBoutillier said. ''I don't agree with that. They'll get out.'' The Nuclear-Freeze Issue Mr. Mrazek presents himself as a supporter of a nuclear weapons freeze, saying that he led the drive to get the nuclear-freeze question on the Suffolk County ballot. But he has yet to make a radio commercial publicizing the position. The Council for a Livable World has selected Mr. LeBoutillier as one of their ''Doomsday Dozen,'' a group of Congressmen who they say have voted consistently for a buildup of nuclear arsenals. Mr. LeBoutillier voted on the House floor against the resolution calling for an immediate mutually verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons by the United States and the Soviet Union, but he says he is for ''all nuclear-freeze resolutions.''

104-> Grand Jury Runs Up A $1,188 Dinner Tab
Twenty-two members of a grand jury ran up a dinner bill of $1,188.58 by feasting on escargot, filet mignon and baked alaska at Antoine's, one of the city's most luxurious restaurants. The City Council is not happy about the bill, but the members of the Orleans Parish grand jury feel it is their just desserts. The total for the evening out last month included a bar tab of $258 and a 15 percent tip of $155. The bill, which averaged almost $54 a person, was presented at a council hearing Wednesday on the city's operating budget. Appearing at the hearing, Terry Alarcon, the First Assistant District Attorney, said his office usually selected restaurants where grand jurors dined. But lately the jurors themselves have been picking the places where they will eat, he said, adding that they feel entitled to a good meal because they work several hours each day with no financial compensation. Among those restaurants selected were Antoine's, Brennan's and Commander's Palace, among the most prestigious dining spots in the city.

105-> HISTORY LESSON
To The Business Editor: Professor Stigler claims that we know nothing about the attitudes of the lower classes in the past toward laissez-faire capitalism. (He seems to be thinking especialy of 18th century Europe.) Nevertheless, he considers it likely that they thought highly of it. In fact, he is wrong on both counts. Historians now know a great deal about the economic opinions of lower-class people during those years when capitalism was increasingly triumphant - that is, during the 17th and 18th centuries. Most of this knowledge comes from studies of plebeian riots, rebellions and collective protests. For while these people's views were seldom of much interest to the various ruling classes, their sentiments could not be completely disregarded when ''public order'' was threatened. And what were these views? They were, of course, diverse. However, a central, persistent strand of popular opinion was clearly a hostility to laissez-faire capitalism. The lower classes constantly demanded ''just prices'' in the marketplace and minimum wages in the workplace. They resisted the movement toward agrarian capitalism and the loss of ''common'' rights. They sought to enforce restraints on employers. They made insistent demands that the public authorities take firm action to regulate economic affairs and to constrain the ''freedom'' of market forces. Rather than welcoming capitalism, most of them were, if not continually hostile to the emerging market economy, certainly sceptical, often critical and generally unenthusiastic.

108-> ABOUT BOOKS AND AUTHORS
Revise, Redact, Rewrite AN author's first draft often is remarkably dissimilar from the finished product, and even the reworked manuscript an author submits to a publisher sometimes bears only passing resemblance to what finally appears between covers. For example: - When Milan Kundera's ''The Joke'' first appeared in a British edition in the 1960's, the publisher had altered the order of its chapters and omitted many passages. After the author protested in a letter to The Times Literary Supplement, the publisher apologized and authorized a paperback edition that restored the proper order. But a subsequent American edition of the British translation was, according to the author, ''even more simplified, more powerless.'' A new version of the novel, recently published by Harper & Row and described in these pages by Irving Howe as ''a brilliant, flawed book,'' represents what the author says is ''the first valid and authentic version of a book that tells of rape and has itself so often been violated.'' - Virginia Woolf's first novel went through many revisions before it was published in 1915. The New York Public Library recently published ''Melymbrosia,'' the earliest recoverable full version of that first novel, ''The Voyage Out,'' reconstructed from the typescripts and manuscripts in the library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature. ''Melymbrosia'' demonstrates Woolf's changing and sometimes contradictory views about women, life and love, and Louise A. DeSalvo, the new edition's editor, observes that the cumulative differences between the two versions ''reveal the two texts to be very different novels.'' - When Dorothy Langley's manuscript ''Swamp Angel'' was accepted for publication in 1944, the publisher required such heavy revisions that the novel became essentially another book with another title: ''Wait for Mrs. Willard.'' Academy Press of Chicago recently published the original version under its original title, which refers to people who lived in rural isolation in southeastern Missouri in the 1920's. In the introduction, Helen Bugbee, Miss Langley's literary executor, writes: ''Though she lived to regret having compromised to get her first novel published ... (in) 'Swamp Angel' Miss Langley more than made up for her early compromise.'' Advice on Selling Out COMPROMISE was also on the mind of Dwight Macdonald, writing in the autumn issue of the literary quarterly Grand Street. Saying that he has written in his own style on subjects of his own choice except for the seven years that he toiled as a writer for Fortune magazine, Mr. Macdonald concludes his brief article (''Notes on Selling Out'') with the following tale: ''In the old days a magazine called Liberty used to run every week a one-page 1,000-word short story for which it paid $1,000. My late friend Delmore Schwartz needed $1,000 very badly then, as always. He had written some highly praised stories - 'In Dreams Begin Responsibilities' was one. So he tried, twice, to sell out and write a piece of junk that Liberty would crown with a $1,000 check; both times he failed. Moral: You have to be sincere to Sell Out; it's like making money - if your heart's not in it, the customer, or editor, sees through the imposture.'' The Power of Words IN his preface to Volume III of ''A Supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary,'' to be published in the United States Dec. 2, the editor, R.W. Burchfield, expresses his attitude toward such modish words as ''ongoing,'' ''relevant,'' ''viable'' and ''hopefully.'' ''If you are tempted,'' he writes, ''to fulminate against them, or to feel uneasy about them, bear in mind that the English language has been in the hands of linguistic conservatives and linguistic radicals for more than 1,000 years and that, far from bleeding to death from past crudities and past wounds, it can be used with majesty and power, free of all fault, by our greatest writers.''

109-> IOWA OFFERS HART LESSONS FOR 1984
Senator Gary Hart was offered several lessons about running for President when he arrived here Sunday for his sixth visit this year. The first lesson was not to campaign in Iowa in December without a topcoat. The Colorado Democrat, wearing a pin-stripe suit and thin cotton shirt, was greeted by a frigid prairie wind that shot the snowflakes along like fat, wet bullets. Other lessons were that Iowans, who are among the most politically jaded citizens of the Republic, do a lot of window shopping when it comes to potential Presidential candidates and they do not mind asking blunt questions. The 250 Democrats who convened at the Za-Ga-Zig Shrine Temple here included some Hart supporters, some fans of former Vice President Walter F. Mondale and former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida, and some downcast followers of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who wanted to know what Mr. Hart made of Mr. Kennedy's withdrawal from the race for the Democratic nomination. In fact, that was the first inquiry put to him. 'A Little Practice' ''I thought you would never ask,'' said Mr. Hart. ''Since this is about the 300th time in the last four days that question has been asked, I've had a little practice on it.'' Mr. Hart asserted, rather combatively, that he would have continued his exploratory campaign whatever Mr. Kennedy did. Then, showing his eagerness to absorb the Kennedy constituency, he observed that only a few Democratic senators had avoided the ''shameful'' stampede to help pass President Reagan's economic policies. ''Two national Democrats voted against every aspect of Reaganomics,'' he said. ''Ted Kennedy was one and I was the other.'' So goes the political discourse in a state that endures something approaching a permanent campaign. The delegate selection caucuses, set for Feb. 27, 1984, will kick off the national campaign year, just as the Iowa caucuses opened the political calendars of 1976 and 1980. Some Iowans complain that exaggerated attention is paid to the candidates' standings in the state. But they also brave snow showers to see novice Presidential candidates like Mr. Hart, who must start their visits two or three years ahead of time if they want to loft themselves into contention from Iowa, as President Carter did in 1976. This year hardly a week has passed since early summer without a visit from at least one Presidential candidate. Pushes 'Fresh Ideas' For Mr. Hart, Iowa assumed even greater importance with Mr. Kennedy's exit. The 45-year-old Coloradan now has a chance to use the state as a test market for an ideology that, Mr. Hart said, makes him the only Democrat offering ''fresh ideas.'' The Senator has linked the traditional Democratic social agenda with a hybrid economics that envisions an enterpreneurial private economy guided by an ''activist Government.'' Similarly, Mr. Hart's military policy calls for both a muscular military force and the aggressive pursuit of nuclear arms control treaties. With Mr. Kennedy out, Mr. Hart said in an interview, his ideas can get more attention and the way is clear for a new generation of Democrats to take over the party. To Mr. Hart, Democrats who came into the party as followers of George McGovern in 1972 are the generation of the future. Mr. Hart managed Mr. McGovern's Presidential campaign, an experience that he said left him convinced that ''traditional liberalism is bankrupt.'' Since he went to the Senate in 1975, Mr. Hart has used his service on the Armed Services Committee and his advocacy of updated military tactics to counterbalance his reputation as an antiwar McGovern liberal. But his Iowa strategy calls for the kind of grass-roots political organizing that Mr. Hart learned in his McGovern years. Getting the Jump Mr. Hart got the jump on his competitors last month by hiring Bill Romjue, a Carter campaign organizer, to open an office here. He has also hired Matthew Wanning, an Iowan with Kennedy ties, as a national fund raiser. But Mr. Hart's organizational lead is temporary. Edward Campbell, a former state party chairman, plans to open a Mondale office next week, and Mr. Askew recently hired Maria Menne, a state Democratic party employee, to work for him. So, by the time the January snows are deep, Iowans will also be getting a blizzard of Presidential campaign activity, 22 months before Election Day. Mr. Romjue said that turning out the 50,000 or so Democrats needed to carry the approximately 2,500 precinct caucuses would cost about $750,000 and require several hundred campaign workers. That is why the early start is essential, he said. Mr. Hart says he considers himself to be in third place behind Mr. Mondale and Senator John Glenn of Ohio. The Hart campaign is trying to popularize the notion that the Democratic campaign will narrow down to those three and that Mr. Hart could pop to the lead as the thinking person's candidate on a triad of issues: economic growth, energy and military reform. A Bit of Charisma Because the concept of charisma is so shopworn, Mr. Hart's associates are slow to admit that they are also counting heavily on his face and manner. Some women here said they found him handsome. As national politicians go, he is also funny, possessing a dry wit and the ability to provoke laughter with a Groucho-like flexing of the eyebrows.

110-> NICARAGUA EASES RULES ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT
In an effort to improve Nicaragua's business image, Joaquin Cuadra, Nicaragua's Minister of Finance, outlined new foreign investment rules yesterday. He described them as more favorable to foreign companies than the investment policies of the regime of Gen. Anastasio Somoza Debayle. The new rules, which Mr. Cuadra discussed in an interview in New York, are the first formal set of guidelines from the Sandinist Government for new foreign investment since the Sandinists seized power in 1979 with the ouster of the Somoza family. Mr. Cuadra said that foreign investors would be allowed to own 100 percent of any operations they established in the country - in contrast to Mr. Somoza's policy of taking a 50 percent share - and would be permitted to repatriate profits. Most of the Sandinist leaders are Marxists. Their decision to give foreign investors so much leeway, despite their views, came in recognition, Mr. Cuadra said, that foreign investment was necessary to help the country's international payments account, bring in technology and jobs. Foreign investment in Nicaragua did not exceed $300 million even under the Somoza family, which had close ties with the United States. Since the Sandinist victory, some companies have been nationalized either because they were operating in areas that the Sandinists said were reserved for state exploitation - principally natural resources - or because they were accused by the Sandinists of pulling out assets. Some other foreign companies have withdrawn from Nicaragua. The most recent was Standard Fruit, a division of Castle & Cooke of Hawaii, which withdrew unexpectedly a month ago with the explanation that a weak banana market forced retrenchment. Mr. Cuadra came to New York this week to make the first public announcement of the investment rules at an appearance today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Because the Reagan Administration opposes the Sandinist Government, Nicaragua has been excluded from the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which is the Administration's principal effort to attract investment to Central America and the Caribbean. ''Even with the liberal investment laws,'' United States companies will be reluctant to invest in Nicaragua ''until there is some political stability,'' said George Gellert, chairman of Atalanta, a New York-based food importing company that has had a shrimp operation in Nicaragua for several years. He said the investment climate was ''a little scary, with the Cuban and Russian influence'' in Nicaragua. In a further effort to improve its business image, Luis Enrique Figueroa, the president of Nicaragua's central bank, is scheduled to arrive in New York today to meet with bankers. His mission, according to Mr. Cuadra, is to reassure American banks that the Government will not seek to negotiate a postponement of payments on its $3.1 billion in private and public foreign debt, as some rumors have suggested, and that it will make a payment due this week of about $40 million, representing interest owed on the debt. An earlier payment of $36 million in interest was made on schedule. Mr. Cuadra also said that the Sandinist Government and Asarco Inc., a mining and chemical company based in New York, had reached an agreement connected with the Government's takeover of the company's Nicaraguan operations in 1979. The agreement, which Mr. Cuadra said would be signed today, provides for the Nicaraguan Government to pay Asarco $3.7 million, plus interest, for gold and silver the Government took from the company. In addition, the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration the tax claims by the Nicaraguan Government against the company and the company's claim to be paid for the nationalized assets. An effort to reach Asarco officials by telephone for confirmation of Mr. Cuadra's statement was unsuccessful. Little Investment So Far Foreign investment has always been ''very minimal'' in Nicaragua, according to the 64-year-old Mr. Cuadra, who was the lawyer for a major Nicaraguan business association before the Sandinist defeat of General Somoza in 1979. While he was in power, General Somoza received a stake, usually 50 percent, of any foreign operation in Nicaragua, Mr. Gellert of Atalanta and others have said. The half interest of Atalanta's Nicaragua shrimp operation that was owned by General Somoza is now owned by the Sandinists, Mr. Gellert said. The major foreign investment in Nicaragua today is an Exxon refinery in Managua, the capital. According to Mr. Cuadra, General Somoza gave foreign companies the right to repatriate all their profits, but there was no guarantee that the foreign currencies needed to effect the repatriation would be available. Mr. Cuadra said the Sandinist Government, on the other hand, would permit foreign investors the right to exchange a negotiated percentage of their profits for foreign currencies held by the central bank at the official exchange rate, which is now 10 cordobas to the dollar. The rest of the company's profits can be repatriated through the parallel market, which is now at 28 to the dollar, he added. As for Nicaragua's desire for bank loans, Mr. Cuadra said his Government wanted foreign banks to provide a $30 million line to finance trade, and added that one goal of Mr. Figueroa's visit was a ''normalization of commercial relations'' with American banks. Since coming to power, the Sandinists have received only a limited amount of short-term financing from foreign banks, but now will seek medium- and long-term financing, according to Mr. Cuadra. When General Somoza fled the country, Nicaragua's public and private debt totaled about $1.6 billion, about half of which was owed to commercial banks, according to Richard Weinert of the Manhattanbased Leslie, Weinert & Yohai Inc., Nicaragua's financial advisers. Since then, the Sandinists have negotiated additional foreign credits, mostly from Government entities.

111-> New Tylenol Packages Shipped to Stores in Northeast
The first tamper-resistant packages of Tylenol capsules have been shipped to 120 supermarkets in the Northeast, according to a spokesman for the Supermarkets General chain. After the deaths of seven people in the Chicago area were linked to cyanide-laced capsules of Extra-Strength Tylenol in late September, Extra-Strength and Regular-Strength capsules were recalled by Johnson & Johnson. The new packages of Extra-Strength Tylenol were sent Monday to 120 Pathmark stores of Supermarkets General in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Delaware, the chain's spokesman, Robert Wunderly, said today. Officials at the McNeil Consumer Products Company, which makes the pain reliever, and at Johnson & Johnson, the parent concern, which is based here, said they would know by Friday how consumers were responding.

112-> VIKINGS YEARNING FOR THE COLD
There no longer will be a weather advantage or disadvantage when the Jets and the Minnesota Vikings meet in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday. Instead, the teams will play in climate-controlled weather under a fiberglass dome in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. In the Decembers of Minnesota winters, from 1967 to 1981, the Bud Grant-coached Vikings posted a 13-3 won-lost record. For Grant, who spends offseasons on a lake in northern Wisconsin, coming in from the cold is not something to be happy about. The 55-year-old coach said he believed the change had cost him an edge that had taken many years, and many frozen experiences, to accumulate. ''Our image has changed as drastically as anyone's could have,'' he said by telephone today. ''Before, when we played outdoors, we felt it would have to be defense and strategy. But moving inside, it's lessened what I have to do.'' They Even Practice Indoors He even complained that the Vikings had built an indoor practice facility. ''Any stadium built today will be a domed stadium,'' he said. ''It's what I have to live with as a coach, and if I'm going to be a coach, I'll just have to do it. The people who are the survivors have to get used to it.'' He sounded as if he and his team had fallen apart since moving indoors. Instead, the Vikings are unbeaten in four games at the dome. They have won three of their last four over all, including last Sunday's 34-31 victory over the Lions. ''I think that cold weather was intimidating to the teams coming in,'' said Marion Barber, a Jet fullback who attended the University of Minnesota and still lives in Minneapolis. ''It was always a plus factor for the home team, especially at this time of the year.'' Grant recalled the cold with warm feelings, saying: ''I would like to play outdoors. It's my experience. Weather was always a factor in coaching decisions - on kicking and other factors. There are some situations in cold weather that don't go by the book. You can make decisions in the cold that aren't by the book. But indoors you can do things on a percentage basis. I feel there are fewer decisions when you're coaching indoors.'' The coach, who was born in Wisconsin, played football at Minnesota and basketball for two seasons with the professional Minneapolis Lakers. He coached Winnipeg in the Canadian League for 10 years before returning in 1967 to Minnesota, where he established the tradition of winning there in December. ''I don't think there were people who wanted to play us here,'' said Ahmad Rashad, the wide receiver. ''All you hear about Minnesota is ice and cold. All anyone thought about was that, instead of trying to put points on the scoreboard. We lost that edge once we moved into the dome.'' Rashad, who has more receptions than anyone else in the N.F.L. since he joined the Vikings from Seattle in 1976, was expected to miss the Jets' game because of three broken bones in his back. ---- Klecko's Limitations When Joe Klecko is ready to return, it is unlikely that the all-pro defensive end will be able to play a full game, said Joe Reese, the Jets' trainer. Klecko is eligible to return for the final regularseason game at Kansas City on Jan. 2. ''If everything continues to go well, I'd list him next Monday as doubtful, giving him a 25 percent chance of playing,'' Reese said. ''No one should be under a misconception that he'll play every down, even if we went to the Super Bowl.'' Klecko will resume workouts with the team Monday. Marty Lyons, the right tackle, is likely to play after having left last Sunday's game at Miami with a pulled hamstring.

113-> Savings Unit Outflow
Withdrawals exceeded deposits at the nation's savings banks by $1.4 billion in November, a record ''net deposit outflow'' for that month, the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks said yesterday. The loss followed an $1.8 billion outflow in October. The previous record loss for November was $1.1 billion in 1981. Savings banks and other thrift units have been struggling under the level of interest rates and regulation, which have raised their cost of money above what they receive in interest on mortgages made years earlier, and from competition from the higher-interest bearing money market accounts. But last week thrift units and commercial banks were allowed to start their own money market accounts without interest ceilings, and George Hanc, the association's chief economist, said deposits seemed to improve. After $900 million of interest was credited to depositors' accounts in November, the overall decrease in the savings banks' deposits was $500 million, the report said. Deposits at savings banks totaled about $151.6 billion at the end of November, up $2.4 billion from a year earlier. Total assets of the industry stood at $172.2 billion, down from $175.3 billion in November 1981.

115-> VIDEO CASSETTES SOOTHE THE PSYCHE
THERE are deserts at dawn and Hawaiian palms, meandering rivers and floating swans. These placid scenes, and a variety of other nature vignettes, are available on 30- and 60-minute color video cassettes designed to induce relaxation and, as ''moving paintings,'' to complement home decor. Natural motion in the land and sea settings supplies the programs' only activity. Some of the recordings, which are shown on a video cassette deck connected to a television set, are accompanied solely by nature's sounds; others have nondescript music for a lulling effect. First used in hospitals to help soothe patients, the tapes join a number of so-called environmental records and audio cassettes - furnishing, for example, the sounds of surf or wildlife -that have been produced to calm listeners, facilitate meditation or, in some instances, mask noise. For home use most of the tranquilizing videotapes are intended to play unobtrusively in the background rather than be watched. ''These programs are designed to turn your living room into a spot you've visited or would like to see,'' said Jim Spencer, president of Environmental Video Inc., a West Coast concern. It offers a series of 60-minute tapes, each showing six 10-minute scenes, including a country barn to which a seemingly indefatigable flock of blackbirds has been attracted. Marketers expect the calming cassettes, costing $35 to $50 each, to become popular items with the growing sale of large flat-screen, wall-hung television sets. One 30-minute tape, produced by the Candle Corporation, a maker of computer software, focuses on a tankful of tropical fish. The idea came from a study by the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine, which has found a dramatic reduction in the heart rate and blood pressure of dental patients watching an aquarium. The production director, Wade Evans, reports that Candle's mesmerizing ''Video Fish'' tape has been found effective in preparing nursery-school youngsters for nap time. Viewing taped nature scenes can be particularly beneficial to the hospitalized, patient surveys indicate. For example, Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, which transmits the recordings to patients' rooms eight hours a day, reports that the ''Video Wallpaper'' series on 30-minute cassettes is especially soothing to chemotherapy patients who feel too ill to watch regular programs. The forerunner of video tranquilizers, environmental audio disks and tapes priced at $9 to $10 each, seek to soothe with stressrelieving sounds. To help create a mood, Audio Fidelity Records' ''Ambience Two'' generates the sound of a crackling fire in a New Jersey beach house and the haunting ''Night on a Wilderness Lake,'' from the ''Solitudes'' series distributed by the Moss Music Group, features frogs, crickets and a pack of howling timber wolves. Companies are developing calming video cassettes, such as abstract art designs, Western ghost towns and hypnotic relaxation exercises. There is also talk of transmitting peaceful nature scenes on cable television as a sort of esthetically pleasing moving test patterns. However, some experts feel that recorded tranquilizers used in homes may do more harm than good. ''If they reduce human communication,'' said a New York family therapist, Dr. Sonya Rhodes, ''then the technology would be just as distracting as television shows and video games. Most people I see who have problems communicating keep the TV set on in the background during dinner.'' Dr. Arthur H. Green, an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, considers environmental programming possibly useful in meditation but, otherwise, an ''irrelevant kind of selfstimulation.'' Therapists note too that rather than relaxing, recordings can excite. Nonetheless, companies are betting that the programs will become part of a permanent home electronic library. Said Roy Kamen of Nebulae Productions, creators of ''Video Wallpaper'': ''We've found that people play the tapes over and over again. You can just throw them on when you want to mellow out.'' While audio programs are available at most retail record outlets, video cassettes can be purchased only from producers. Sources include these: Candle Corporation, 10880 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 2404, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024. $35 for VHS or Beta cas- settes and $50 for three-quarter-inch cassettes, not including postage.

116-> THE CITY; School of Arts Is Made Landmark
The School of the Performing Arts in the theater district was granted landmark status Tuesday night by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Students of the 88-year-old high school, at 120 West 46th Street, have included Al Pacino, Liza Minnelli and Eliot Feld. The school was the inspiration for the film and television series ''Fame.'' The students and faculty members are scheduled to move in 1984 to new Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and the Arts, at Amsterdam Avenue and 65th Street. Carol Brownell, a spokesman for the Board of Education, said the board would try to find a ''consistent and appropriate'' use for the 46th Street building. The commission also designated as a landmark the interior of Morris High School, on 166th Street and Boston Road in the Bronx.

117-> TV NOTEBOOK; WEIGHING ANCHORS AND NEWBURGERS
The secret is out. All suspicions are confirmed. ''Newswatch,'' the new book by Av Westin, executive producer at ABC News, makes clear that the part played by the network anchors in determining the makeup of a given evening's news show is measurably less than that of the show's producers, directors, writers, editors, camera crew and technicians, not to mention the correspondents in the field. The anchor's contribution lies somewhere between the girl with the clipboard and the boy who goes for coffee. Why then so much attention to whether Dan Rather wears a sweater or whether Roger Mudd respects Tom Brokaw? It's packaging, of course - or, in Mr. Westin's more positive phrase, ''charisma and credibility,'' by which he means Walter Cronkite. Since on any given evening, the news is the news, viewer loyalty is determined in large part by whether one is attracted to or put off by the master of the revels. The viewers' choices, taken together, translate into ratings, which translate into advertiser dollars. The only surprising thing about this situation is how decorous the networks are in promoting their news stars. At a time when makers of nasal decongestants, paper products and hamburgers are derogating the competition, CBS, NBC and ABC continue to abide by old boys' rules - never an unkind word in public for the other fellows. But suppose that instead of being so genteel, they offered viewers a dose of candid comparison advertising. Does Dan Rather serve up as meaty a newsburger as Frank Reynolds? Can Max Robinson absorb as many details in 22 minutes and 30 seconds as Roger Mudd? Does Peter Jennings clear the ear-and-eye passages as thoroughly as Tom Brokaw? Such tests would at last give the consumer some basis for a choice. If you are bent on knowing what a network executive means when he exhorts a producer of sitcoms to add a ''hook'' or a ''blow'' or a ''button'' to a show or to give it more ''heat'' or ''topspin'' or ''pipe,'' watch the CBS Report ''Don't Touch That Dial.'' It offers several major producers and executives talking to and about each other and about the shows that fill prime time. The producers complain that their creative juices are being damned up by the networks. Barney Rosenzweig complains, ''You make it to their order, and then they reject you.'' ''I failed by doing what they asked me to do.'' The show in question was an aspiring sitcom called ''Modesty Blaise,'' one of the many efforts which falter along the way each season. One can understand that a producer might be driven to blame the network - and the network to blame the producer. Gary Goldberg, producer of ''Family Ties,'' has no word of thanks to the network bigwigs for helping to make his show a success and putting him on the path to Leisure Village. Instead, he laments their indifference to matters such as characterization. It is Mr. Goldberg who introduces Morley Safer, the interviewer on ''Don't Touch That Dial,'' to the executive lingo. Their zingy words refer to the elements in a show designed to keep a viewer from switching channels. For example, ''topspin'' is what propels us into the next scene; ''heat'' is dramatic tension''; ''pipe'' is the history of the characters; ''blow'' or ''button'' refers to the joke that every character must make as he exits. (Yes, in case you hadn't noticed, no one is permitted to leave a room in a sitcom without uttering a line that activates the laugh track.) Producers and executives seem agreed on one point at least - there is a difference between ''good trash'' and ''bad trash.'' None of them admits to having anything to do with ''bad trash,'' but they are all proud of ''good trash.'' This, Fred Silverman, who has had his programming triumphs and failures at all three networks, explains to Mr. Safer is ''an excellent execution of what producers set out to do.'' That definition calls to mind Edmund Wilson's comment that what is fatal to a writer is to be brilliant at a disgraceful job. The network chiefs, sensitive to criticism yet reluctant to offend anyone, especially the operators of their affiliated stations, where quality is measured exclusively in advertising dollars, take a familiar tack. P. Donald (Bud) Grant, president of CBS Entertainment, justifies his network's programming as many executives have before him: ''It's what the public in the final analysis chooses.'' He is quick to express his satisfaction ''that television is as good as it is.'' All parties concerned are soft - at least before the camera - on the audience. Even Mr. Safer conveys the feeling, common to critics of television, that something is being put over on the populace. Often, critics appear to believe that the networks are force-feeding us junk food despite our craving for wholesome fare, chock-full of nutrients for brain and spirit. The truth, I fear, is far simpler, if less pleasant to those who cannot bear to utter an unkind word about The American People. Bad taste is always in style. The executives who say that they are giving the public what they believe it wants are only stating the obvious. (CBS's Grant expresses special pride in ''Dallas'' because ''it has provided so much entertainment for so many people.'') Any other intention would be perverse, and unlikely to advance an executive's career. These days, as network audiences appear to be shrinking, critics may be tempted to rejoice that America is at last wearying of trash, whether of the good or bad variety. Alas, that is unmerited flattery. It is just as possible that the quality of some network shows is too high; maybe it has to be lowered to hang onto those departing viewers. The salvation of the networks may be even trashier trash. Is ''60 Minutes'' a news program, or is it some other species of television? In his new book, ''Media Unbound,'' Stephan Lesher, a print journalist, takes a harsh view of the popular CBS production. He cites instances of some elements of a story being omitted while others were played up to produce stronger indictments. In 1976, for example, a segment focused on a woman who was allegedly injured by the drugs prescribed for her by her doctor. The doctor, who was not given an opportunity to respond, was later cleared of wrongdoing by official investigators. CBS issued an apology. Mr. Lesher is not the first to charge that the nation's most watched, and eminently watchable news program, if it be a news program, sometimes takes liberties with its materials. But the dietdoctor episode is not typical; the gifted producers of ''60 Minutes'' are by no means bent on practicing deception week after week. Not at all. Their problem is that in order to fashion a strong story out of a complicated series of facts, they must do some ''shaping.'' What gives rise to charges of unfairness is the manner in which they line up the facts, or some of them, for maximum impact. It would be a pity to inhibit the ''60 Minutes'' investigators by placing constraints on the way they put together their often fascinating segments, or to ask the inimitable Mike Wallace to control his instincts and go gently at a seeming culprit. As Mr. Wallace himself puts it in ''Business and the Press,'' a CBS special, ''You're not really concerned about whether he is going to squirm or not squirm.'' Mr. Wallace might add that you don't win an audience of 40 or 50 million without somebody squirming. What to do? Happily, a solution is at hand that should satisfy all parties, especially people who like truth in advertising. Instead of promoting ''60 Minutes'' as a news program, simply call it something else. The answer, as Mr. Lesher makes plain, is staring us in the face, like one of the culprits caught by the ''60 Minutes'' camera. Label the hour docudrama.

118-> STATE APPROVES FINANCIAL PLAN REVISED BY CITY
The State Financial Control Board yesterday approved New York City's four-year financial plan, but warned that many obstacles remained on the city's path to full fiscal health. The unanimous vote for the plan, which covers the fiscal years 1983 through 1986, followed months of wrangling over whether the Koch administration had a balanced budget for this year and a reasonable chance of balancing the next three budgets. Twice before - in June and November - the Control Board declined to give its approval. The final document reflects changes of about $1.5 billion from the plan the city adopted last June, with the changes required to cover projected deficits of that amount over the next 18 months. The deficits were attributed to the cost of the city's contract with its unions, slumping tax revenues and a loss of $300 million in anticipated state aid. Koch Calls It 'Tough Program' ''This is a tough program,'' said Mayor Koch, one of seven board members, ''tough for city workers, for city residents and for those who will be asked to carry an additional tax burden.'' The changes, which cover the remaining six months in fiscal 1983 and all of fiscal 1984, call for the most drastic reductions in the city's workforce since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. Unless the city gets increased aid, about 6,600 workers are scheduled to be laid off next spring and summer and 11,000 vacant jobs are to remain unfilled before June 1984. The reduced workforce makes up a large part of the $700 million that Mayor Koch hopes to save by reducing agency spending. The plan also relies on $22 million more through new and increased taxes this year and $300 million next year. The Mayor's ''menu'' of 14 taxes are aimed at wine, cigarettes, automobiles, real estate, corporate income, commuter earnings and theater and movie tickets. About $500 million more of the deficit was covered by changes in pension formulas, debt-service payments and the use of cash reserves. Members of the Board In addition to the Mayor, the board members are Governor Carey, who is chairman; City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan and three public members appointed by Mr. Carey. Stanley S. Shuman, one of the three public members, read a statement expressing the concern of all three that the city's longterm fiscal health was in jeopardy because of what he called the state's failure to provide sufficient aid. The two other public members are G.G. Michelson and Leopold P. Oberst. Mr. Carey replied that anyone seeking help from the state should realize that the state had serious budget problems of its own. He, in turn, said the Federal Government should do more. The approval of the plan ended the effort to balance the city's fiscal year 1983 budget of $15.5 billion that began in May.

121-> A 'DIMINISHED' SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE
The special post-election session of the Senate presented a spectacle of protracted and irritable confrontation that the nation has not seen in the World's Greatest Deliberative Body in many years. The leader of the Republican majority, Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, characterized it as ''a trial by fire, a trial by ordeal.'' A small band of conservative Republicans, filibustering against an increase in the Federal tax on gasoline, tested the patience of their colleagues. At one point, Senator Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, himself a conservative Republican, said he had rarely seen a ''more obdurate and obnoxious performance.'' Earlier this year, Mr. Baker asked two former Senators, James B. Pearson, a Republican who represented Kansas from 1962 through 1978, and Abraham A. Ribicoff, a Democrat who represented Connecticut from 1963 through 1980, to study how the Senate does its business and to recommend possible changes in its rules and procedures. The two do not expect to finish their work until next June. But Mr. Pearson, who divides his time between a Washington law office and a farm in Kansas, shared some of his observations in an interview in the closing hours of the special session. Q. How has Congress changed since you were a member? A. I think that fundamentally, in the last few years, a lot of people have been running for the House and the Senate as sort of a protest against the institution, and when they get to Washington, they don't have very much respect for the institution they have joined, or perhaps for the people who are already there. In any event, it's a matter of deep divisions on an ideological plane. And that's really sort of unusual for the Senate in the last few years. Most people have criticized Congressional bodies for being too apt to compromise. I think in the last few years, that spirit of compromise has been diminished. It just isn't there. The best way to put it is that the old Marquis of Queensberry attitude of courtesy and accommodation apparently is gone. Particularly in the Senate, where you have the enormous freedoms that you have, it leads to a rather chaotic situation which is exemplified, I suppose, in its worst form in this lame-duck session. Q. In your day, you had filibusters. Were they different? A. They were in a way. They were filibusters, but they were conducted on a gentlemanly plane. In the debate on the 1964 Civil Rights Act, people like Dick Russell felt very deeply about that legislation, and they filibustered and they responded to their own constituents and their own consciences. But when cloture was invoked, they accepted the will of the majority and left the field of battle in good grace and in good humor. They don't do that any more. I think on both sides of the ideological spectrum, the fight continues and the rules are used not so much for the insurance of an orderly conduct of business, but used primarily in the most negative way to stop all action. There's a great negative feeling there, that the business of the Congress is to keep anything from happening, rather than seeking some sort of a program of accomplishment. That's the impression I get, that it's pretty much every man for himself. Q. Are you optimistic about improvements? A. If the leadership, with all the power they have, do not now understand what's wrong and haven't got the clout to make the changes, why, I don't think a couple of retired former Senators can have a great deal of influence. I think the conduct of the Senate relates more to the character and the motivations of the people there than to the rules and procedures, whatever they may be. These are fundamentally the same rules and procedures that the Senate a decade and two decades ago operated under. I think Howard Baker is serious about it and terribly concerned about it, and I think he's as good a majority leader as I've seen in the last two or three decades. Q. Do the problems of the Senate reflect a breakdown of shared values in the country at large? A. I really don't know. One has to assume, if you believe a little bit of the system, that senators are representative of the places where they came from. If you're going to accept a representative kind of government, and fail to accept the idea that the people there are representative, it's a paradox. There's a sense of deep frustration in the country. It comes out of recession more than anything else. The idea that mom and pop and all the kids are getting up every morning, worrying what the United States Senate is going to do, that's nonsense. They are worried about things that happen every day. The casual look that they give to the Congress is one which doesn't inspire a great deal of confidence these days. Q. Does the privilege of unlimited debate require more selfrestraint? A. Every essence of freedom requires a certain restraint. And the idea of the cloture-of-a-filibuster rule is first, that while a minority has to be protected, the majority must some day prevail, and second, while there is a right of free debate, there is also a right of making a decision at some time. All rules and all laws are limitations. The greater the freedom involved, the greater responsibility for some sort of restraint. The orderly conduct of the Senate and the productive proceedings of the Senate lie not so much in rules and regulations, but in the character and the motives of the people who are there. Q. It sounds as if you are fearful that a change in rules and procedures may not be enough to restore the comity that once prevailed in the Senate. A. I think that's right. Robert Pear

123-> STOCKS OFF 10.85 AFTER LATE SALES
Late selling pressure sent the Dow Jones industrial average down sharply yesterday with some of the blue-chip, energy and technology issues posting the largest losses. Until the final hour of trading, the Dow had moved within a very narrow range, as many investors awaited the Federal Reserve Board's report on the nation's money supply figures and a possible cut in the discount rate. The blue-chip barometer, up 0.74 at 3 P.M., fell 10.85 points, to 1,021.25. For the week, the average fell 18.67. After the close of trading, the Federal Reserve reported a slight drop of $100 million in the basic money supply for the most recent reporting week. A few minutes later it announced the long-awaited cut in the discount rate, to 9 percent from 9 1/2 percent. The failure of the Fed to cut the discount rate earlier this week was largely responsible for the market's weakness on Monday and Tuesday, when the Dow tumbled almost 32 points, analysts said. Lower interest rates increase the attractiveness of stocks as an investment in comparison with fixed-income securities. However, Michael Metz, vice president of Oppenheimer & Company, noted that the discount rate cut yesterday might not be enough to keep stock prices higher ''without some concurrent signs of a strengthening in the economy.'' In the overall market yesterday, stocks that fell in price on the New York Stock Exchange outscored stocks that advanced by 862 to 722. Turnover on the Big Board contracted to 70.3 million shares, from 77.6 million the day before, as institutional interest continued to slacken. Institutional investors, who have been mainly responsible for the 250-point advance in the Dow since mid-August, have recently cashed in some of their profits, or have stayed on the sidelines, or have become more selective in their buying. Robert Grossmann, portfolio strategist of Cantor, Fitzgerald & Company, said, ''The market should generally decline over the next week or so.'' He predicted that some of the stocks that make up the Dow and that spearheaded the market's recent advance would be the main casualties. Among the bigger losers in the blue-chip group yesterday were American Express, which lost 1 5/8 points, to 66 7/8, and Merck, off 1 1/4, to 83. In the energy category, Getty fell 2 7/8 points, to 47 5/8; Superior Oil 1 1/4, to 26 3/4; Union Oil 1 5/8, to 27 3/8, and Standard of Indiana 1 3/8, to 38. The hardest-hit issues among the technology stocks included Teledyne, down 3, to 129 3/4, and Digital Equipment, off 2 7/8, to 101 1/8. One of the best gainers was Stokely-Van Camp, which rose 3 1/2, to 48. The company is discussing a buy-out proposal of $50 a share with a group headed by the company's chairman. Schering-Plough, which was heavily traded, fell 1 1/2, to 40 3/4, after gaining 5 3/8 points on Thursday. Several analysts issued buy signals on Schering's stock Thursday, speculating that it might be the first company to introduce a marketable interferon-based product. Masonite advanced 2 3/8, to 46, in active trading. The company said it knew of no reason for the stock's rise. Masonite is a leading producer of hardboard and fiberboard. Another gainer was Emhart, which added 1 3/4, to 44 3/4. On Thursday the stock rose 1 1/2 after directors increased the quarterly dividend to 65 cents a share, from 60 cents. On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index advanced 1.39, to 334.16. Fay's Drug Company was up 1 5/8 points, to 22 1/2, after its board split the common stock 2 for 1. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq composite index gained 0.13, to 229.41.

125-> FISHING-BOAT RULES MAY BE STIFFENED
THE sinking of the 47-foot fishing boat Joan La-Rie III off Point Pleasant three weeks ago with the loss of eight lives is leading the Coast Guard to restudy its safety regulations and has caused concern among fishing boat captains. The Coast Guard has a regulation requiring fishing boat skippers, before they leave the dock, to make either a public announcement regarding safety procedures or to have prominently displayed placards describing such measures. Most captains choose to put up placards rather than make a public announcement. The Coast Guard is considering making the announcement mandatory, as it is on airliners, in which passengers must be given public instruction about exits, the use of oxygen masks and the location and use of lifesaving equipment. ''That is a distinct possibility,'' said Capt. Ronald C. Pickup, chairman of the four-member Marine Board of Investigation, which is looking into the Joan La-Rie III tragedy. Fourteen survivors, who had clung to debris of the stricken vessel for almost an hour and a half, were plucked from the sea by Coast Guard helicopters or picked up by a lifeboat from a Brazilian freighter. The fishing boat captain, Charles H. Housley, 55 years old, of Ridgewood, who was a mathematics teacher at River Dell High School; his mate and six passengers drowned. Five bodies were recovered almost immediately, and a sixth body was found floating about 10 miles off the coast on Wednesday. Two bodies are still missing. Lieut. Comdr. London L. Steverson, the senior investigating officer who served as the recorder for the panel, said that the six passengers and two crewmen who died when the boat capsized in rough seas could have been saved if they had been wearing life jackets. ''The boat captains are following the letter of the law, but the spirit of the law is not being observed,'' Commander Steverson said. ''Many captains are merely posting copies of the Coast Guard's emergency checkoff procedures. I don't think that was what was anticipated when the regulations were promulgated.'' Many of the fishing boat skippers who attended the seven days of hearings into the sinking were concerned that the Coast Guard would force them to make public announcements and to demonstrate the donning of life jackets before they left the dock. They said that this would frighten away novice fishermen - men, women and children who are vacationing at the Shore and decide to try their luck. Asked about the questions being raised by the fishing boat captains, Captain Pickup suggested that their concerns were unfounded. ''Airlines do it after making some announcement, using words like 'in the unlikely event of an incident,' and it hasn't hurt them,'' Captain Pickup said. The fishing boat captains responded that the airline stewardesses made the announcement once the plane had either taken off or taxied away from the terminal, thereby making the passengers a captive audience. ''If we did that before we left the dock, a lot of people would just pack up and get off,'' said one boat captain. The investigation board will convene in Washington this week to study the 65 exhibits, including a 45-minute videotape of the sunken vessel, and to go over the 1,200 pages of testimony from 11 of the survivors and others linked in some way to the boat. Although a final decision on the cause of the sinking will not be forthcoming for about six months, the investigators from the Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board have been able to elicit testimony as to the probable cause. One of the survivors, John Sullivan, testified that he was standing at the stern as the boat turned to head for her berth at Ken's Landing in Point Pleasant when a large wave broke over the vessel, drenching him and washing two other men overboard. ''That wave had to be 10 feet or better,'' said Commmander Steverson in assessing the possible cause of the sinking. ''While it would have swamped the boat, it should not have sunk it. The boat should have stayed afloat for about two hours. It must have had water already below decks.'' William I. Hammarstrom, the builder of the wooden boat, which was covered with fiberglass, had testified that the vessel was sturdy and that there must have been a lot of water in the bilges for her to capsize when the wave struck.

126-> TEXAS PRISON CASE LAWYERS TO GET $1.71 MILLION IN FEES
A Federal district judge in Texas ordered the state today to pay $1.71 million in fees and expenses to the attorneys for prisoners who won a lawsuit challenging conditions in the state prison system, the nation's largest. The fees, awarded by Judge William Wayne Justice of Tyler, Tex., to William Bennett Turner of San Francisco and other lawyers representing a statewide class of prisoners, were the biggest ever in any lawsuit brought primarily under the civil rights laws, according to legal experts. The fees were more than double the largest fees previously awarded in a prison conditions case. The judge's action drew an immediate denunciation from the Texas Attorney General, Mark White, the Governor-elect, who has strenuously opposed the prison litigation. He said that Judge Justice ''has again fallen into error with an excessive award,'' which he promised to appeal. Case Spanned a Decade The size of the award reflects the view that the decade-long lawsuit, involving more than 30,000 inmates in 22 institutions, was ''unprecedented in its scope and complexity,'' as Judge Justice put it. The judge was also unusually generous in upholding almost all aspects of the fee application. But he asserted in his 58-page opinion that the time and expense the state had invested in its defense of the lawsuit ''dwarfs the time spent by plaintiffs' counsel,'' and that much larger fees had been awarded in antitrust and other business lawsuits that were no more complex than the prison case. Large fee awards to lawyers representing plaintiffs in civil rights, environmental and other lawsuits against state and Federal Governments have increasingly become the focus of political controversy. The Reagan Administration is preparing legislation to sharply limit the judicial power to award fees to lawyers who prevail in suits against governmental units, according to an article to be published in the next edition of The National Law Journal. Fee awards to prevailing plaintiffs in various kinds of cases are now authorized by the civil rights laws and dozens of other Federal statutes for the purpose of encouraging lawsuits that Congress deemed to serve the public interest. Judge Justice, long a favorite of civil rights lawyers and a nemesis of state officials, has presided over the prison case since 1972. In 1980, he found that conditions throughout the system amounted to unconstitutional ''cruel and unusual punishment'' and issued a sweeping prison-reform decree. His central holding that the conditions were unconstitutional and some of his remedial orders were upheld, while other particularly costly remedial orders were reversed in June by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Judge Justice specified in his latest opinion, dated Wednesday and filed today in Federal District Court in Houston, that the total of $1,662,683 in attorneys' fees and $51,844 in expenses were to be divided between Mr. Turner, the chief counsel, 11 other lawyers, one large law firm and assorted paralegals and law clerks. He said the lawyers had employed unusual skill and dedication, in a ''complicated and unprecedented'' case, to win a ''priceless'' victory for prisoners that ''should dramatically alter'' the overcrowding and brutality he had found to pervade the prison system. The judge praised Mr. Turner, a San Francisco lawyer whom he awarded more than $700,000, at $300 an hour, as ''probably the foremost practitioner in the field of prisoners' rights in this nation.'' He computed the fees by multiplying the number of hours of work each lawyer had documented, discounted by 5 percent to allow for possible duplication of efforts, by hourly rates ranging from $150 for Mr. Turner to $75 for ''inexperienced or subordinate attorneys.'' The judge then doubled the fees, on the ground that the attorneys ''have privately enforced crucial social objectives which might otherwise be ignored,'' and had worked for years without any assurance of compensation because of the risk that they would lose the case.

128-> EX-PHILADELPHIA AIDE MOVES TO GRAB MAYORAL CONTEST SPOTLIGHT
The plot is thickening in the Philadelphia mayoralty play. Always a colorful production, its drama has been heightened this year by the antics, maneuvers, soliloquies, harangues, asides and dialogues of the players, including some who are still in the wings. The formal action opened Tuesday, when Thomas A. Leonard, the City Controller, who has gained attention with a series of critical audits of city agencies, resigned and announced he was entering the 1983 Democratic mayoral primary in May. As such announcements go, his was something of a show-stopper. He made a verbal frontal assault on his expected opposition, and his remarks ignited a predictable rage in one of his most formidable prospective opponents, former Mayor Frank L. Rizzo, who had just taken one step forward and a half-step back in announcing his own candidacy. Jockeying for Position People who follow politics here see the two as jockeying for position against another prospective candidate, W. Wilson Goode, a top administrative official under Mayor William J. Green. A fourth possible entry, a popular district attorney who would also be a formidable candidate, is silently weighing his decision. At a news conference, Mr. Leonard called Mr. Rizzo's eight years as Mayor, which ended in 1979, ''a divisive period'' that ''divided race against race.'' And he said Mr. Goode might not be up to the political demands of running for office or governing the city. Mr. Leonard's jump into the race is considered by some politicians here to be an attempt to deter Mr. Rizzo from running in the primary. One local political analyst called it the start of ''a nasty, highstakes game of chicken'' with Mr. Rizzo. ''He's playing chicken with the wrong guy,'' Mr. Rizzo thundered in an interview with The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''Frank Rizzo has played chicken with guys with guns,'' he added, alluding to his career on the police force before he was elected Mayor. ''He has a better chance of going to the moon than getting me out of the primary.'' Later in the week Mr. Rizzo seemed to have decided his best strategy might be to ignore Mr. Leonard. In a telephone interview, the 62-year-old former Mayor declined to discuss Mr. Leonard. No Announcement by Rizzo That may be because Mr. Rizzo has not formally announced his candidacy, though he has made his intentions clear enough. Some political analysts here believe Mr. Leonard's announcement may have been precipitated by Mr. Rizzo's statement to a reporter last week that ''I'm going into the Democratic primary, and I'll win.'' Early this week, before Mr. Leonard's announcement, Mr. Rizzo backed away from that statement, however, telling a local reporter: ''I don't think that's what I meant. I'll have an announcement to make in a couple of weeks.'' Mr. Rizzo, a colorful Mayor who ran a law-and-order administration, left office in a city divided between devoted supporters, many of them business leaders, and equally outspoken opponents, many of them blacks. For the last year he has kept his loyalists' hopes alive with increasing public appearances, still looking as fit as he did on a night often recalled here when, as police commissioner, he left a formal dinner and rushed to a crime scene with a nightstick thrust through his cummerbund. He has often hinted of a re-entry into politics. He attended a cocktail party for about 80 members of his fundraising committee this week and he was clearly pleased by the results, later saying, ''It felt good to be back in the swing.'' His finance chairman, William Batoff, left the party with $279,000 in checks and $215,000 in pledges. ''Those are checks in hand,'' said Mr. Batoff, who was Pennsylvania finance chairman for President Carter's last campaign. ''And those pledges are guaranteed.'' Another fund-raising party is scheduled for Dec. 8. ''We're in this to stay,'' said Martin Weinberg, manager of the unofficial campaign. Mr. Leonard is equally adamant, saying, ''I'm in the race, and I'm in it to stay.'' He said his decision on the timing of his announcement came about partly as the result of the success his friends had in quickly raising $150,000 for his campaign. Leonard Once on Rizzo Slate Mr. Leonard, 36, entered electoral politics on the Rizzo slate in 1975, becoming Register of Wills, and followed that with a race for controller. Mr. Leonard said in a telephone interview that while controller he ''issued over 350 reports on ways to improve operations of city agencies,'' including a recent report assailing the spending habits of the municipal court system. While Mr. Leonard was attacking Mr. Rizzo, and being alternately attacked and ignored in return, the man who some of their supporters fear could defeat both in a three-way race was biding his time. ''I'll announce my decision on or about Dec. 2,'' said Mr. Goode, city managing director, who last week announced his resignation, effective Nov. 30. ''If I run I'll win.'' Black Discounts Race as Factor Mr. Goode who is black, discounted race as a deciding factor, although nearly 40 percent of the population is black in this heavily Democratic city. ''If I run,'' he said, ''my candidacy will transcend race. My administration of city agencies has shown that I treat all people the same. People know that.'' He added that if he ran he expected support from Mayor Green, who has said he will not seek re-election. Mr. Green has said nothing else and was too busy, his aides said, to return a phone call on the subject. Meanwhile, the fourth potential Democratic candidate, District Attorney Edward G. Rendell, is ''wrestling with a decision'' this weekend, according to an aide. Mr. Rendell has told friends he made a mistake in turning down a chance to run for governor in the last election, and they say he is concerned that he might repeat the error if he chooses not to run for mayor. On the other hand, the friends say, he is worried that he might alienate his black friends if he runs and they perceive him as a spoiler, preventing Mr. Goode from becoming the first black to be elected mayor of Philadelphia. Most political insiders here say that he will again say ''no'' to those who are urging him to run.

129-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Cribbs Will Play
A holdout that began when the Buffalo Bills went to training camp last summer ended yesterday when Joe Cribbs, the star running back, met with Coach Chuck Knox and then said at a news conference that he was returning even though ''nothing has been settled.'' Cribbs, whom the Bills drafted out of Auburn in 1980, rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of his first two pro seasons. Then he sat out the entire exhibition schedule this year, and the two games before the beginning of the player strike, in an effort to renegotiate his contract, which does not expire until after next season. ''Nothing has been settled,'' he said yesterday, ''and right now nothing looks like it's going to be settled. I've talked it over with people and my family, and I intend to come back and play the remainder of the season out and hope to work something out next year. If not, I'll play out my contract and take my services someplace else.'' Although he has not played or practiced with the team in almost a year, Cribbs said he expected to be ready for Sunday's home game against Miami, adding: ''I'm in as good a shape as the rest of the guys in the league.''

130-> GOVERNORS TO ASK CONGRESS TO CURB ARMS SPENDING
The nation's governors will ask Congress to curb military spending unless a strong case can be made for the increases sought by President Reagan, the National Governors Association decided Friday. The executive committee of the association made the recommendation on military spending after the outgoing Governor of Georgia, George Busbee, warned that governors might have to become fully involved in Federal budget battles, including such issues as what to do about Social Security, or they might find their states' finances ruined. The committee voted to ''support slowed real growth in defense expenditures unless a strong national case can be made for an increase in the projected growth rate.'' Real growth takes account of inflation. A staff recommendation that the governors seek a 5 percent ceiling on real growth in the military budget was rejected. Gov. Richard A. Snelling of Vermont, a Republican, said the governors should support slower growth in military spending unless Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger could explain why an expected 11 percent increase was necessary. Tenneseean Opposes Involvement Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, opposed involvement in military questions, saying: ''How do we know anything about that? We're governors of states. I think we should run for the Senate if want to get that specific.'' Governor Busbee, a Democrat and a former chairman of the association, said states were caught in a crossfire between President Reagan's ''new federalism,'' which would transfer responsibilities to the states, and record budget deficits, which have meant cutting Federal aid to states. While new federalism proposes providing funds and eventually relinquishing Federal tax sources to the states, Mr. Busbee and other state officials argue that the actual result has been the transfer of responsibilities to the states without the money to pay for them. ''If current trends continue without major modification, by the end of this decade the Federal Government will have abandoned to the states not only most of the functions now performed and financed jointly through Federal-state programs, but also virtually every other previously Federal function other than national defense and the mailing of benefit checks to the aged, blind and disabled and their doctors, and to veterans and retired Federal employees,'' Mr. Busbee said. Looking at 1984 Budget The recommendations were prepared for the executive committee, which is building a strategy for governors in connection with the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1984. The association's chairman, Gov. Scott M. Matheson of Utah, a Democrat, has been one of the leading exponents of the view that the new federalism cannot be separated from the Federal budgeting process. The next full meeting of the association will be in Washington shortly after President Reagan presents the 1984 budget in January. Mr. Busbee suggested that the governors take a more active role in the final development of that budget. Although he did not mention Social Security or any other of the so-called entitlement programs, Mr. Busbee said the governors must be prepared to seek to rein in such programs and to prod Congress to do the same. Entitlement programs are geared to cost-of-living increases and are generally outside the annual budgeting process. ''Unless Congress and the Administration begin to take on the politically difficult task of controlling 'uncontrollable' programs, or raise additional revenues, Federal assistance to states and localities is in very real danger of being 'squeezed' out of existence, as a simple matter of budgetary arithmetic,'' he said. He said Federal aid to states and localities was already expected to decline by 30 percent from 1977 to 1985. And he said such grants would be the first to go unless Congress got control of other areas of the budget.

131-> SETBACKS AT SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Much of the Southern Pacific Company's 13,740 miles of rail runs through areas of the Sun Belt that have exploded in growth over the last several years. Thus, with grain and coal traffic growing rapidly throughout the region, the railroad's tonnage should have grown rapidly, too. But it didn't. In fact, most of the new rail business generated in the West was picked up by such rivals as the Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern. And today the Southern Pacific, despite its advantageous location, is beset by major problems. Hurt by Recession The railroad has been hard-pressed by the recession, with traffic of auto parts and lumber and forest products down 25 percent to 30 percent. In the third quarter, the Southern Pacific had a pretax loss of $5.6 million, in contrast to a profit of $7.1 million in the third quarter last year. For the first nine months of this year, its net income plunged 40.2 percent. And last month, the railroad decided that it could no longer accommodate the capital investment needs of its profitable, fast-growing communications subsidiaries, one of which operates the Sprint telephone network, and decided to sell them to the GTE Corporation for $750 million. But chief among the company's worries, perhaps, is the competitive pressure it will feel if the recent merger of the Union Pacific with the Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific survives a court challenge and becomes reality. That combination, Southern Pacific says, could cost it $100 million a year in lost revenue. Missed Opportunities To some analysts, the Southern Pacific's recent history is a string of missed opportunities. Management, they say, has not been aggressive enough, and its diversifications have sometimes been badly timed. They also say that the railroad's 66-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, B.F. Biaggini, who has headed the company since 1976, has tended not to delegate authority, sometimes causing ambitious executives to leave. Mr. Biaggini, who went to work for the railroad in 1936 as a civil engineer, does not feel he has stifled his executive talent. But he says he does believe in ''centralized management - I want to know what's going on.'' In any event, Mr. Biaggini is optimistic about the railroad's future. He says it is ready to develop its natural resources and expand its activities in real estate. Lagging in Development Some analysts are less hopeful, based on the company's recent performance, that it will meet its problems effectively. Richard Fisher, the railroad analyst for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, gave as an instance of Southern Pacific's poor timing the company's acquisition in 1979 of Ticor, a Los Angeles-based financial services concern whose main business is selling mortgage insurance. The acquisition came just before the housing industry went into a steep decline. From pretax earnings of $26.4 million in 1980, the subsidiary's net income dropped to $10.9 million last year. In the third quarter this year, Ticor broke even, compared with income of $2.1 million in the 1981 period. Other analysts note that while the railroad is rich in land, owning 3.7 million acres in the Southwest with mineral rights on another million acres, it has made only a modest effort to develop its holdings. The Union Pacific, on the other hand, decided a decade ago to develop its natural resources and now derives about 60 percent of its earnings from these divisions, compared with 40 percent from its railroad. The Southern Pacific derives one-third of its pretax earnings from natural resources and about 40 percent from its railroad. The Southern Pacific has limited most of its activity to leasing its gas and mineral properties to others. Only last year, it began the exploration and production of energy by reorganizing its subsidiary, the Bravo Oil Company, into a development company. 'Luck of the Draw' Mr. Fisher noted, however, that much of the success of Southern Pacific's competitors in this field was ''the luck of the draw.'' ''The land grants of the Union Pacific happen to have been in areas where there were significant discoveries of oil and gas,'' he said, ''while Southern Pacific did not have the good fortune to have gas and oil fields on its land grants.'' Nevertheless, Mr. Biaggini said during a recent interview in his New York office, the company plans to become more aggressive in developing its natural resources. But first, he said, it had to get the $750 million from GTE for the Sprint system, which he said would not be available until about mid-1983. There are still major obstacles to completion of the sale. The transaction, now under Federal review, is being challenged by MCI Communications. Mr. Biaggini said the company had decided to sell its communications subsidiaries - the Southern Pacific Communications Company and the Southern Pacific Satellite Company -because the next step in their development, the building of research and manufacturing plants, would have demanded large amounts of capital. Capital Projects Whether Southern Pacific will pursue an ambitious drilling and exploration program on its land has not been decided, Mr. Biaggini said. Its Southern Pacifc Land Company subsidiary has formed a joint venture with the Bishopsgate Coal Corporation to begin to develop coal reserves in Utah. The other major area of spending, Mr. Biaggini said, would be expansion of Southern Pacific's extensive real estate projects. The company has already built several office buildings in downtown San Francisco. It also owns such projects as the Hilton Hotel in New Orleans and the Pacific Design Center in Los Angeles. The company's most ambitious project so far, announced last month, is the Mission Bay development in San Francisco, which is to be built on 195 acres of prime property. John F. Kawa, a railroad analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said, however, that such an investment project would not bring quick results, and quick results are what Southern Pacific needs. And Mr. Biaggini, while optimistic over the long term, concedes that if the merger of the Union Pacific with the Western Pacific and Missouri Pacific goes through, his railroad will be put under considerable pressure.

132-> ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY OPENS CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT BRANCH
The Environmental Protection Agency has opened its own criminal enforcement division, and 17 new investigators have been hired for the operation. They have joined four investigators who already work for the agency. The new operation will allow the agency to start its own investigations into potential breaches of environmental regulations, officials said. The 17 new enforcement officers were placed in the field offices around the country last month.

133-> IN THE ARTS: CRITICS' CHOICES
ART What should a new museum in Brooklyn mount but - a show about Brooklyn! The new center, in Boylan Hall on Brooklyn College's Flatbush campus, is called the Museum of the Borough of Brooklyn, and its concern is Brooklyn's rich ''visual and cultural history.'' Its first exhibition - in celebration of the centennials of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Fiorello LaGuardia - is ''Brooklyn Themes: Art in the Years of Roosevelt and La Guardia'' (through Dec. 7): paintings, prints and photographs produced by artists during and after the Great Depression. It was a bad time for Brooklyn and the country, and some artists, such as Chaim Gross in his portrayal of squatters on the Brooklyn waterfront, reacted to the troubles they saw around them. Others, working for one of the alphabet agencies started under Roosevelt's New Deal, turned out art for government buildings (a ''modernist'' mural by Stuart Davis, ''Waterfront Forms,'' 1936 - now lost -was painted under such auspices for the room at Boylan Hall in which the new museum is located). Still others, such as Edward Hopper - whose tenementscape, ''From Williamsburg Bridge,'' appears in this show - recorded realistically the structure and events of the daily world. As a theme for artists, Brooklyn was foolproof. Other contributors to this lively show include Raphael Soyer, Reginald Marsh, Guy Pene du Bois, Berenice Abbott, and many lesserknowns. Grace Glueck

135-> IRAN EXPECTED TO ATTACK SOON ON TWO FRONTS
Signs are multiplying that the Iranian forces poised at two sectors on their country's frontier with Iraq are preparing for a renewal of offensive action, according to intelligence analysts in Washington and in NATO capitals. The consensus is that the Iranians will attack simultaneously on the front facing Basra, where they were repulsed in July, and in the mountainous area around Mandali, 80 miles northeast of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital, where the last offensive ended on Oct. 10. On Monday an Iraqi diplomat in Copenhagen asserted that Iraqi forces would employ a new and powerful secret weapon against the Iranians if they mounted a new offensive. Salah Ali Fathi, the charge d'affaires at Iraq's embassy, said the weapon was designed to kill hundreds of thousands of troops, and asked for the world's forgiveness and understanding. The announcement mystified Western intelligence sources. Mr. Fathi refused to disclose the character of the weapon but said it was neither nuclear nor chemical. He added that it was produced by a Western country and has not been banned by international arms conventions. He did not mention biological weapons, but one expert pointed out that these, if they were used, could hardly be expected to kill hundreds of thousands of enemy troops. One British expert on the Arab world suggested that Mr. Fathi's announcement might have been a form of psychological weapon intended to deter an Iranian offensive that, the diplomat predicted, would begin yesterday. Reports from the two fronts reaching Western defense and intelligence establishments spoke of no more than desultory fighting yesterday. Whatever lies behind Mr. Fathi's statement, the consensus is that a simultaneous two-front offensive would severely strain Iraq's military resources. Aside from one army, the equivalent of an American corps in strength, deployed south of Baghdad and two understrength brigades in the Kirkuk-Mosul oilfields to the north, President Saddam Hussein's ground forces are all deployed in the areas where the attacks are likely to come. Iraq's edge lies in its air force. Used sparingly against strategic targets, it has achieved air superiority over the Basra and Mandali battlefields against minimal Iranian opposition. The Soviet Union, Iraq's principal supplier of arms, reduced shipments early in the Gulf war. However, there have been signs recently that new Soviet aircraft are arriving. These may be an installment of the 150 Soviet fighters, MIG-23's, MIG-25's and MIG-27's, that have been on order. Should Iranian attacks develop simultaneously on both fronts, intelligence officers said, this may reflect a compromise between the regular army and the revolutionary guards over strategy. In debates last week in Teheran, the regular army is said to have argued for concentration of all forces on the Basra front. ---- Teheran Gives New Date for Vote BEIRUT, Lebanon, Oct. 26 (AP) -The Iranian election of a special commission to choose a successor to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the 83-year-old leader of the Islamic Government, will be held on Dec. 10, the Teheran radio said today. The state-run radio, monitored in Beirut, said men and women 16 years and older would be eligible to vote. Iranian sources said the assembly would consist of about 60 members. They said it was unclear whether a single successor or a committee of successors would be chosen. The successor or successors would not take over until Ayatollah Khomeini officially leaves office. Last week a Teheran broadcast quoted Iran's Interior Minister as saying that the voting would be held on Nov. 12. Today's broadcast gave no explanation for the apparent change.

136-> U.N. WORKING OUT A RESOLUTION ON LESOTHO RAID
The Security Council began drafting a resolution today to condemn South Africa for its raid last week on Lesotho. King Moshoeshoe II, ruler of the landlocked nation, which is surrounded by South Africa, appealed tonight to the Council to restrain South Africa from ''pursuing a strategy of naked terrorism against a whole subcontinent.'' The King, 44 years old, said his country had been subjected to ''a murderous attack'' because it grants asylum to political refugees from Pretoria's rule. ''A completely unacceptable demand'' has been made on Lesotho to abandon this policy, he said. He appealed to the Council members ''who have influence over the rulers in Pretoria to exert pressure on South Africa to desist from its present policies of wholesale destruction and terrorism.'' African diplomats said the King was seeking a gesture of political support, but a resolution that would not punish South Africa with a cutoff of trade. Lesotho's economy is too heavily dependent on Pretoria for firmer action. In a predawn raid last Thursday, South Africa sent five helicopters to Maseru, Lesotho's capital. The force attacked residences and killed 42 people. Pretoria said it was striking at members of the outlawed African National Congress, the principal resistance movement to the white-dominated Government. Pretoria Cites Sabotage Plans South African diplomats at the United Nations contend that their Government had learned that some of the people they attacked had planned to embark on sabotage and terrorist raids across the border. Officials in Lesotho described the victims as refugees and insisted that their country banned terrorists. The Security Council is not expected to adopt a resolution until later in the week, and negotiations were under way today over how strong a text would be acceptable. The six third-world members initially drafted stern language that could open the way for a trade boycott against Pretoria. The key section ''strongly condemns South Africa for its act of unprovoked and premeditated aggression against Lesotho.'' The use of the word ''aggression'' is critical. Aggression is outlawed by the United Nations Charter, which provides for sanctions against those who commit it. The United States, Britain and France have approved an embargo on the sale of arms to South Africa but until now have opposed any other boycott. Western diplomats said Washington and London were attempting to eliminate ''aggression'' from the text to insure that the sanctions question could not be raised. In addition, the United States was said to want to delete the word ''unprovoked,'' arguing that it was a one-sided judgment of the attack. A tentative compromise was reached later in the day. The critical section now ''strongly condemns'' South Africa's ''aggressive act.'' By limiting the denunciation to a specific act, diplomats said, Pretoria will be better protected from any attempt to call for sanctions. Awkward Position for Lesotho Lesotho, where genuine power lies with the Prime Minister, Leabua Jonathan, is in an awkward position. On the one hand it wants the Council to adopt tough words, but it cannot afford any suggestion that it break off trade with South Africa. As many as one-quarter of Lesotho's workers cross its western frontier to work on the farms and in the gold mines of the Orange Free State, a South African province. In addition, the bulk of Lesotho's trade is with Pretoria. Moreover, as African diplomats conceded, a Council resolution without the support of the United States and Britain would carry little weight in South Africa. Hence Lesotho, which comes to the Council as a victim, finds itself on the same side of nations seeking to soften condemnation of the aggressor.

138-> UNRELENTING REBELS BEFOG THE 'PEACE' IN COLOMBIA
The suburban setting did not look like a place one would go looking for a leftist rebel. Two young girls in white communion dresses skipped down the street past well-tended lawns and two-story homes, and a delivery boy was busy at the corner tying a boxed pizza to the back of his scooter. In a driveway midway along the block, a man in sneakers and blue jeans helped his 2-year-old daughter right herself on top of wildly disobedient roller skates. Here, it developed, was the insurgent, 41-year-old Carlos Duplat Sanjuan, home from prison because of a broad amnesty proposed by Colombia's new President, Belisario Betancur. The scene would most likely have pleased Mr. Betancur, who has argued for the reconciliation of the Colombian ''family'' after generations of bloody clashes between the Government and guerrilla groups. But a conversation with Mr. Duplat would only provide the new populist leader with more of the disabusing talk he and his ambitions plans for the country have been encountering as he enters his fifth month in office. Armistice Is Demanded Mr. Duplat's M-19 group, the best known of the four major guerrilla organizations here, has responded to Mr. Betancur's amnesty call with demands of its own. It is asking for a six-month armistice and a national ''dialogue'' involving its leader, Jaime Bateman Cayon, Mr. Betancur and representatives of other institutions in the country. The reaction of the M-19 rebels has struck many Colombians as a betrayal since during the formulation of the law they had indicated their enthusiasm for it. The Nobel Prize-winning Colombian novelist, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who sympathizes with their cause, has denounced their attitude as one serving publicity rather than peace. ''Belisario is clearly a man of good intentions,'' Mr. Duplat said, referring to the President as most Colombian's do by his first name. ''But he can't think that by just sitting down and deciding to do good works that things are going to get better. It just isn't that way. Bateman could come to Bogota and dramatically turn himself in to Belisario, but it wouldn't do the country any good at all. We don't have such illusions.'' Illusions are what many Colombians are now reluctantly beginning to think their popular new President may have. Mr. Betancur has made a great impression on his countrymen by publicity-getting actions reducing his office's pomp and distance from the people. Even the man he beat for the presidency in the May election, former President Alfonso Lopez Michelson, concedes as much. ''There have been deep changes in Colombian society, and we in politics were not accompanying them,'' he said in an interview in his Liberal Party office. ''There has been a sexual revolution, rich people dressed like poor ones and social status isn't recognized anymore, but we in politics continue to live a patrician life.'' The doubts about the future are emerging as Mr. Betancur moves from symbolic acts like opening the ornate presidential palace to the public on Sundays to the violent and resistent realities of Colombian life. A ''Banquet for Peace'' that he summoned lost much of its impact because of the guerrilla reaction to his amnesty and the political assassination in Bogota two days earlier of a well-known woman who had headed the Government's community action department. A new rightwing vigilante group called Death to Kidnappers that sends its intended victims funeral wreaths and invites them to their own burials continues operating unchecked. He made a dramatic appeal for expanding the role of Congress in Colombian political life and then was forced into a confrontation with the lawmakers when they translated his call into a demand for a 110 percent pay raise. He moved to withdraw Colombia from its previous strict compatibility with the United States, proposing its admission into the movement of nations proclaiming nonalignment and delivering a blunt lecture to President Reagan here eight days ago on Colombia's disagreements with American policy. But some commentators are now pointing out the inconsistency of this independent stance with Mr. Betancur's pleas for more American investment and aid from international lending agencies. Other doubters are wondering how he can square his highly publicized proposals for low-cost housing with no down payment and university education for all high school graduates with his pledges to hold down the growth of the deficit and reduce inflation from its present 25 percent to 14 percent. Mr. Betancur has succeeded impressively in raising Colombian hopes, an accomplishment that carries with it the specter of deep disillusionment if they are not delivered upon. His predecessor, Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala, also sponsored an amnesty, but its restrictiveness and Mr. Turbay's diminished popularity doomed it. Only 20 of Colombia's estimated 4,000 to 6,000 guerrillas ended up accepting its terms. Amnesty for Rebels One of the broader aspects of Mr. Betancur's proposal was to allow the freeing of some 350 rebels in prison, and it was under this provision that Mr. Duplat gained his liberty a week ago. Also released were Carlos Toledo Plata, a founder of the M-19 group, and Rosemberg Pabon Pabon, known as Comandante Uno for his having conducted the two-month seizure of the Dominican Embassy in Bogota in 1981. Since there is no requirement under the Betancur amnesty to turn oneself in formally, there is no record of how many rebels have acted on it. The rough estimate thus far is 150. Mr. Duplat, a theater director and film maker as well as an M-19 official, had served four years of a 17-year sentence for having participated in the kidnappings of an ambassador, a businessman and a Colombian executive of Texaco who later died during an attack by security forces on a ''people's prison.'' Sitting in the living room of his mother's house, filled with china objects, vases of fresh flowers and primitive art works, Mr. Duplat said he doubted he and his rebel companions would be able to achieve their goals ''peacefully.'' He listed those objectives as making Colombia independent from ''North American imperialism'' and multinational companies, producing ''social justice'' and a fairer distribution of wealth and establishing a democracy in which there is ''greater participation by all sectors of the community.'' He said the M-19 would have to develop ''an army capable of confronting the Government's army.'' The armed forces, who play an active role in Colombian political decisions, had been cooperating with Mr. Betancur's amnesty, though they are known to be skeptical of its outcome. A foreign diplomat speculated on their reaction as men now coming out of prison end up back in the field fighting soldiers again. ''I can tell you one thing for sure,'' he said. ''There will be a lot less prisoners in the future.''

139-> F.D.A. Clears Squibb Drug
The Squibb Corporation said the Food and Drug Administraion had approved the use of Squibb's Capoten brand of the drug captopril to treat heart failure. The company said it was the first oral drug approved in the United States for heart failure since diuretics were introduced more than 20 years ago. The approval, the company said, permits the drug to be marketed more widely. The agency had authorized the use of the drug in 1981 for cases in which all other treatment had failed. The drug is also used in some countries to treat hypertension. ''This is excellent news for Squibb,'' said Dr. Kenneth H. Rabin, Squibb's director of United States public affairs. ''We believe that we were able to demonstrate quite clearly to the F.D.A. that there was substantial improvement in the life style of many heart failure patients'' treated with Capoten. George N. Wright, pharmaceutical analyst with the First Manhattan Company, said last year: ''This drug means everything to Squibb.'' Yesterday, Squibb closed at 45, up 1 1/8, on the New York Stock Exchange.

142-> THE CITY; Man Shot to Death At Party at N.Y.U.
One young man was shot dead and another was critically wounded late last night when two Chinatown gangs clashed at a Thanksgiving party being held in a residential hall at New York University, according to the police. The two victims, who were not immediately identified, were shot shortly before 11 P.M. when members of the two gangs, the Ghost Shadows and the Flying Dragons, tried to enter the party, being held in an activities room in the Weinstein Center for Student Living at 5 University Place, a police spokesman said. The spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, said ''over 100 people'' were at the party. The dead man, who was a member of the Ghost Shadows and was believed to be in his late teens or early 20's, was killed instantly by a bullet through his head, the sergeant said. The wounded man, also a nonstudent, was taken to St. Vincent's Hospital in critical condition, the sergeant said. The hospital reported that he was still in surgery at 2 o'clock this morning.

Ann Jones Wood was maid of honor for her sister. Austin C. Starkey was best man for his brother. The bride, a telecommunications analyst, graduated from the Agnes Irwin School and the University of Pennsylvania. Her father is director of the department of medicine of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia and professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Mrs. Starkey is a granddaughter of Mrs. James Edwin Wood Jr. of Charlottesville, Va.; the late Dr. Wood, head of cardiology and professor of medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, and Mrs. Ernest Duncan Jones of Charlottesville. Mr. Starkey, a corporate-bond analyst at Salomon Bros. in New York, graduated from the Lawrenceville School and Lake Forest College. His father was co-founder and partner of the Starkey Farms Company, vegetable grower in Pennsylvania and Maryland. The bridegroom is a grandson of the late William Paul Starkey, president and part owner of the Harrisburg Steel Company, now a unit of Harsco Inc. in Camp Hill, Pa.

148-> THE 'REAL CREAM' COMES TO HOSPITAL GALA
ANY party at which Brooke Astor, Happy Rockefeller, Mildred Hilson, Douglas Dillon, Henry Kissinger, William S. Paley, Kitty Carlisle Hart, Dru Heinz and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are seated at the same table has to rate high in the New York social firmament. And that was just one of the star-studded tables at Monday night's benefit at the Waldorf-Astoria for the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Other groups included Andy, Ogden, Mary and Howard Phipps; Mary, Laurance, Alexandra and Rodman Rockefeller; Enid Haupt; John L. Loeb; Nancy Pierrepont; Douglas Auchincloss; Annette and Samuel Reed, and Pamela and Roswell Gilpatric. It was, according to a longtime observer of the social scene, ''the real cream - what the Met used to be when it was 'it'.'' But there were also a goodly number of the glittery party crowd, including such familiar names as Bill Blass, Fran,coise and Oscar de la Renta, Anne and Dean Johnson, Mica and Ahmet Ertegun and Nan Kempner. Raquel Welch discussed politics and economics with her dinner partner, Walter B. Wriston of Citibank. And there was more than one doctor in the house; there were dozens, from the hospital, the medical center and Cornell Medical School. Mrs. Astor and Mr. Wriston, co-chairmen of the event, got just about everyone they knew to participate. Who could say no? Even those who didn't take tables (which ranged from $10,000 to $5,000 to $2,500) sent in contributions. As a result, the party was sold out by early November, assuring the medical center of more than $1 million. The evening itself was underwritten by an anonymous donor, to the tune of $150,000. During the cocktail reception, Mrs. Astor, in pearls, diamonds and black ruffles, sang Christmas carols with the Cornell Medical College Chorus, in operating room greens. Mary Phipps told Fern Denney about having her wallet picked from her purse, and Fern Denney reminded Felicia Blum, ''We're both going to be 50 next year, and I'm going to make a lot of noise about it.'' When the guests entered the ballroom, they were serenaded by the Cornell Univesity Glee Club, which had been bused down for the event, then bused right back to Ithaca with box suppers so they could face a week of exams. Mrs. Astor had suggested that the party have a holiday theme, so the organizers - Marilyn Evins, Charlotte Ford and George Trescher - had the Grand Ballroom decorated with two 20-foot-tall Christmas trees and set the tables with red cloths and centerpieces of holly, pine cones and tall white candles. The menu was a traditional Christmas dinner of roast goose with lingonberries, acorn squash and plum pudding with hard sauce. But the highlight of the evening for most of the 1,300 guests seemed to be the after-dinner entertainment. It was called ''Cabaret!'' and was emceed by Mr. Fairbanks. It, too, was a starstudded affair. Kitty Carlisle Hart sang Cole Porter's ''The Physician,'' which brought forth chuckles from the physicians present. Mr. Fairbanks did a speak-sing rendition of ''September Song,'' and Brian Bedford read from Charles Dickens's ''A Christmas Carol.'' There were songs by Karen Akers and Clemma Dale, tap dancing by Honi Coles and the Copasetics, plus jugglers and a trampoline act from the Big Apple Circus. The show closed with more Christmas carols by the medical college chorus - now in white interns' jackets.

149-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; Making Yourself Heard Without Losing Your Voice
F rantic days on Wall Street mean shouting matches for floor traders. The New York Futures Exchange has had enough of them since May -when it began trading futures contracts on stock prices - to bring on an epidemic of chronic laryngitis. So yesterday, after six clamorous hours in the pit, five brokers were on their backs on the office floor at Financial Futures Execution Services, Inc., lifting phone books with their stomachs and inhaling-exhaling through sipping straws. Linda Gates, an actress and New York University drama coach, gives them a weekly lesson in breath control and voice production. ''Basically, it's learning how to yell and scream without killing our vocal cords but still make our voices dominant over the other 150 in the trading pit - an advantage over everybody,'' said Ira Haupt 2d, a company partner who thought up the class and is part of it. When his two top floor brokers couldn't talk, Mr. Haupt said, ''in three weeks it cost me $15,000 to $20,000.'' Miss Gates spent a day in the pit. She said it was ''like actors trying to project on stage but with a milling crowd and an incredible din - I never heard so many voices croaking away.'' Already, Mr. Haupt said, his brokers have got their voices back. ''They're smiling every morning and they don't have to not talk to their wives at home.''

150-> NEBRASKA VOTERS IN RESTIVE MOOD ON EVE OF PRESIDENT'S CAMPAIGN VISIT
The recession has finally arrived in this normally prosperous, usually optimistic corner of Nebraska, bringing with it a vague uneasiness and growing doubts that a quick recovery is anywhere in sight. This has turned the race for the Second Congressional District seat into the nearest thing Nebraska has to a referendum on President Reagan's policies. It has also given Richard Fellman, the Democratic challenger, a much better chance than he was earlier given against Representative Hal Daub, a conservative, supply-side Republican who is aligning himself firmly and happily with the President. Although Omaha's unemployment rate is well below the national rate of 10.1 percent, it has jumped to 7.1 percent from 6.6 percent in the past month. In addition, farm income, on which Omaha's industries depend, has been dropping to one of the lowest levels since the Depression. However, despite this spreading unemployment and the economic downturn in what is normally a bustling season, there were no signs here of a big swing of normally conservative voters to the Democrats, and Mr. Reagan will campaign in this area Thursday in an effort to see that there is not. People Blaming Politicians ''Everyone is beginning to feel the recession to some degree and it's a worrying thing for us all,'' said Al Veys, one of Omaha's largest independent grocers. ''People here do blame this on the politicians. But we don't know whether either side has the answer. And we're beginning to wonder if any of them can straighten things out soon.'' By most pre-election soundings, Gov. Charles Thone, a conservative Republican, is in trouble against the challenge of Bob Kerrey, a flamboyant young Democrat who has never run for office before. But this contest is being fought over personalities and state financing and taxation issues that have plagued the stolid Mr. Thone for the past two years. Senator Edward Zorinsky, a conservative Democrat who often votes with the Republicans, appears at this stage to be an easy winner. Representative Douglas K. Bereuter, the Republican incumbent in the First Congressional District, has only token opposition and Virginia Smith, the veteran Republican incumbent in the only other district, has no opponent at all. Neighbors Being Laid Off In suburban Bellevue, Joe and Patty Jeanette, who were guests at a real estate company reception at which Mr. Daub spoke, appeared to reflect the attitude of many Nebraskans. ''This is normally a great area to live in and we're not used to any of this,'' Mr. Jeanette, a Bellevue police detective, said. ''We're secure ourselves. But some of our neighbors have been laid off and we are starting to feel very uncomfortable about the slowdown.'' Ann Hoff, the wife of a construction supervisor for a fast-food chain, said she did not think the recession had hurt Mr. Reagan's standing in Omaha. ''People sure aren't happy about things, though we don't think either one of those Congressional candidates or any other politician can do much about it very soon,'' she said between frames at her neighborhood bowling alley. ''We're going to have to get out of this ourselves.'' But at the gate of the Union Pacific Railroad's huge repair yards, where shivering workers were hurrying home through the season's first wet snowfall, resentment toward the President and his Republican supporters was palpable. Calls Vote a Mistake Leo Firman, who has spent 30 years in the Union Pacific stock supply room, said that like many of his fellow workers, he had voted for Mr. Reagan in 1980, as well as for Mr. Daub. ''We wanted a change then,'' he said. ''But that was a big mistake. The President has turned his back on people on people like us. He has cut out a lot of social things, like he didn't care what they meant to us, and Daub has gone right with him.Now they are saying they may have to cut the Social Security down and I can tell you this won't go around here.'' Mr. Fellman, a low-keyed Omaha lawyer who is a former State Senator, was hoping this anger would cause Omaha's labor contingent, which makes up more than a third of the district's voters, to come out in full force against Mr. Daub. He has repeatedly attacked Mr. Daub for supporting the President's cuts in the nonmilitary budget, asserting these were votes to cut Social Security, reduce college loans, and endanger the Medicare program. Denies Social Security Charge Mr. Daub, a solemn, intense young businessman, readily defends Mr. Reagan's call for patience and angrily denies he would support any basic changes in Social Security benefits. ''The people in this district know we have to make some reforms in the way Social Security is financed and in some of the fringe sections,'' he said. ''Our people here are willing to give us a chance to make the President's program work. It's nonsense for anyone to claim the Republicans have abandoned the unemployed. I wake worrying about them every night, seven nights a week.'' Mr. Fellman started off far behind Mr. Daub, who beat him easily in the 1980 race. But the latest poll taken by The Omaha World-Herald showed him closing to within 5 points of the incumbent. ''I think you'll see a lot of retirees and a lot of blue-collar workers are going to go out and vote for Fellman,'' Mr. Veys said. ''A lot of the people in the middle income and upper income brackets are most likely to stay with Mr. Daub. This election is going to be decided on how big a turnout labor can get on Election Day.''

152-> G.B. KISTIAKOWSKY IS DEAD AT 82; BOMB PIONEER SOUGHT NUCLEAR BAN
Dr. George B. Kistiakowsky, who worked on the developing the first atomic bomb and later became a leading advocate of banning nuclear weapons, died today at home at the age of 82, Harvard University announced. Dr. Kistiakowsky, the Abbott and James Lawrence Professor of Chemistry at Harvard, had been ill with cancer, but no cause of death was announced. After witnessing the first nuclear bomb explosion at Alamagordo, N.M., on July 16, 1945, he was quoted as saying: ''I am sure that at the end of the world - in the last millisecond of the Earth's existence - the last human will see what we saw.'' Science Adviser to Eisenhower He served as science adviser to President Eisenhower from July 1959 to the end of the President's term, in 1961. He served on the advisory board to the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1962 to 1969 but quit as a foreign policy adviser in 1967 in a dispute with the Administration of President Johnson over the Vietnam War. He was chairman of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington and Boston-based group seeking to reduce the danger of nuclear war through arms control. Dr. Kistiakowsky was sharply critical of President Reagan's foreign policy, saying that the President ''has this one idea fixed: that we must stand up to the Soviet Union.'' Dr. Kistiakowski was born Nov. 18, 1900, in Kiev in the Ukraine. His father was a law professor. After education in private schools, he became a soldier in the anti-Communist White Russian Army after the Leninist revolution. He fled the Soviet Union and studied at the University of Berlin, where he earned his Ph.D. He came to the United States in the 1926 and was naturalized in 1933. He joined Harvard in 1930, after four years at Princeton University, and became professor of chemistry in 1938. He was chairman of the department from 1947 to 1950 and became professor emeritus in 1971. He became a division chief in the National Defense Research Committee in World War II. James B. Conant, a president of Harvard who was also a chemist, persuaded him to become chief of the explosives division at Los Alamos, N.M., during the development of the atom bomb in 1944-46. Designed Atom Bomb Detonation Dr. Kistiakowsky designed the arrangement of conventional explosives needed to detonate the atom bomb. For his work, he received the President's Medal of Merit. He once showed the medal to officials in his hometown of Lincoln, Mass., after they questioned his qualifications to dynamite tree stumps on his property. He is survived by his wife, Elaine, and a daughter, Vera Fischer, by a former wife, Hildegard Moebius, from whom he was divorced in 1942. Services will be private, according to friends of the family.

155-> Deere Drops 78 Percent; Bombardier Posts Profit
Deere & Company said yesterday that net income in its fourth fiscal quarter plunged 78 percent because of the badly depressed farm equipment business. The company, the world's largest maker of farm equipment as well as an important producer of construction machinery, held out little hope for an improvement in the current fiscal year. The company, based in Moline, Ill., said net income in the three months ended Oct. 31 fell to $12.1 million, or 18 cents a share, from $55.3 million, or 82 cents a share, in the 1981 quarter. Sales dropped to $1.15 billion from $1.43 billion. Deere said the outlook for the fiscal year 1983 ''is not encouraging.'' It cited, as one factor, the poor prospects for recovery in the North American farm equipment market in light of the bountiful 1982 harvest, which has applied further downward pressure on already low crop prices. In an effort to cut back dealers' receivables, the company said that it is currently scheduling 1983 production at some 18 percent below 1982 levels. Deere said that these reductions would ''exert extremely severe pressure on operating results.'' For all of the fiscal year 1982, Deere reported net income of $52.9 million, or 78 cents a share, down 79 percent from $251 million, or $3.79 a share, earned in the fiscal year 1981. Sales fell to $4.61 billion from $5.45 billion. The company added that its 1982 worldwide production was down 20 percent from 1981 as a result of lower retail demand. Worldwide farm and consumer product sales in 1982 dropped 14 percent, to $4 billion, Deere said. Industrial equipment sales tumbled 26 percent, to $575 million, it added. The company said that pretax foreign exchange gains amounted to $46.9 million in 1982, contrasted with gains of $61.8 million in 1981. In the fourth quarter, foreign exchange gains were $10.7 million as opposed to a loss of $10.8 million in the 1981 quarter. Bombardier Bombardier Inc., a Montreal-based maker of mass transit and recreational equipment, said yesterday that it earned $2.63 million, or 48 cents a share, in its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $3.2 million a year earlier. Sales climbed to $178.3 million from $131.5 million. The concern has overcome a heavy exposure in the depressed snowmobile business to emerge as a strong presence in the market for mass transit equipment. Bombardier also said that it had received a deposit from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of New York on a contract to supply 825 subway cars. The order raises the company's backlog to $1.35 billion.

156-> Heinz's Net Up 7.2% in Quarter
The H.J. Heinz Company said today that its profit rose to $54.4 million, or $1.14 a share, in the fiscal second quarter, ended Oct. 27, up 7.2 percent from $50.8 million, or $1.08 a share, in the corresponding period of 1981. Sales of the food producer rose one-tenth of 1 percent, to $956.1 million, from $954.9 million. For the half, net income increased 4.3 percent, to $109.7 million, or $2.31 a share, Heinz said, and sales were up 2.8 percent, to $1.87 billion. Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, president and chief executive officer, said results were ''noteworthy,'' given the worldwide economic climate. He said the company was in position to achieve favorable results for the full fiscal year. Converting the sales of foreign affiliates into the strong United States dollar hurt the sales figures for the quarter and half, Heinz said.

157-> BETTER WAY TO GET 'U.S. CONTENT' INTO CARS
To the Editor: Your Dec. 14 editorial ''The Job-Killer Bill'' raises the type of questions about local-content legislation that may temper the enthusiasm of some who might otherwise support it. v. hile Congress is unlikely to adopt this proposed ''remedy'' this year, the controversy will continue until some solution is found to the problems of high unemployment and underutilized plants in the automotive industry. One alternative, the Parts Purchase Incentive Plan, merits close attention. The plan would make two-way automotive trade mutually beneficial, put idle plants and employees back to work and more than pay for itself in added tax revenues and transfer-payment savings. This program is being advanced by the Automotive Parts and Accessories Association and the six allied automotive trade associations that make up the Automotive Products Export Council. The proposal would fortify current duty incentives which allow foreign-based auto makers to deduct the value of U.S. content in vehicles before the import duty is applied. To do so, the plan would offer credits against the duty owed - a dollar of credit for each dollar of U.S. content purchased. Instead of using deductions to cut the amount to be taxed, the plan cuts the tax, or duty, itself - a greatly enhanced incentive to buy American. Another advantage over current law is that the plan would base an auto maker's duty credits on the total amount of parts purchased, with no stricture that the parts re-enter the U.S. Participating manufacturers could use our parts worldwide, helping American suppliers to crack the lucrative world market. This plan would benefit automotive trade across the board. Auto makers seeking the duty savings would select only the most reliable products at the best price. As U.S. suppliers vie for the export sales, they will grow even more competitive and efficient. Export volume will assure the economies of scale that result in better prices. Whether a car is manufactured in Japan or in Detroit, the American car buyer will benefit from the intense supplier competition. Consumers purchasing replacement parts for domestic or imported vehicles benefit as well. Export sales of equipment for new vehicles and replacement parts and accessories translate into greater use of plants and thousands of jobs for American auto workers. Rather than restricting trade, the plan would advance free trade incentives to all countries with manufacturers wishing to participate. U.S. manufacturers could gain access to many markets theretofore closed. Far from repelling any nation's products, this alternative would open foreign markets while keeping ours open. The Parts Purchase Incentive Plan is a viable and responsible approach to helping the U.S. automotive industry help itself. JULIAN C. MORRIS President, Automotive Parts and Accessories Association Lanham, Md., Dec. 15, 1982

The Budget People Get in the Spirit A fter six weeks of wrangling with the city's budget people, the Financial Control Board was finally ready last night to give its blessing to the latest financial plan. By the end of the struggle, the City Budget Director, Alair Townsend, felt the need Tuesday to send a meaningful gift to the man who watches over her shoulder, Comer Coppie, the board's executive director. She settled on ''a truly menacing cactus,'' describing it as ''a foot and a half tall, tremendously ugly with big spiny things and rather plump.'' Yesterday Mr. Coppie, who is suddenly being called ''Cactus Jack'' by co-workers, had a gift for Miss Townsend. It was a Dr. Seuss story entitled ''Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?'' The story is about the town of Hawtch-Hawtch, where one Hawtch-Hawtcher's job is to watch the ''lazy town bee,'' for, says Dr. Seuss, ''A bee that is watched will work harder, you see.'' But when the bee does not work hard enough, another Hawtch-Hawtcher is assigned to watch the bee watcher. Soon all of Hawtch-Hawtch is watching a watcher while only the bee is working. As for his cactus, Mr. Coppie offered a different opinion of its beauty. ''It's pleasant, as cactuses go,'' he said.

162-> M.T.A. FARES SAVED WITH A SURCHARGE ON TAX ON PROFITS
The New York State Legislature tonight passed a tax surcharge on corporate profits to subsidize mass transit. It is intended to prevent fare increases on subways, buses and commuter rail lines for the next 12 months. The measure passed in the Senate, 46 to 10, after a brief debate marked by complaints about service to riders. It passed in the Assembly a few moments later, 80 to 46. The agreement on the tax was reached this afternoon in a meeting of Governor Carey, Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo and the legislative leaders. Mr. Carey was expected to sign the bill shortly. Immediately after the vote tonight, the two houses adjourned a special session that had wrestled with the issue for the last two weeks. Earlier Warnings by Ravitch ''The fare is saved,'' said Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He had issued repeated warnings of fare increases if the Legislature did not act. The new tax is in the form of a surcharge on four categories of taxes based on corporate profits, but it covers only profits earned in the 12 counties served by the M.T.A. For each of the taxes - on banks, insurance companies, utilities and other corporations -a different formula is used to compute profits earned in the region. The tax would be set at 18 percent of taxes paid the first year and 17 percent the second year, and it would automatically expire at the end of two years. It is expected to provide $270 million each year to help subsidize the M.T.A., private bus lines and the Staten Island Ferry. After the meeting this afternoon with Governor-elect Cuomo and the legislative leaders, Governor Carey flew to New York City, to preside over a meeting of the State Financial Control Board. The control board unanimously approved the city's four-year financial plan, but warned that New York still faced difficulties. (Page B1.) With the agreement in Albany, the M.T.A. board met this afternoon at its headquarters in Manhattan and unanimously approved a budget for next year that would hold fares for bus, subway and commuter lines at their present levels through December 1983. ''In this business, a year of certainty is good news,'' Mr. Ravitch said. Arthur G. Perfall, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said that a twotoken limit imposed on sales of bus and subway tokens would be lifted tonight and that new monthly commuter tickets would go on sale Thursday. In the legislative debate, the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, called the tax the ''least-worse tax'' and the ''only workable solution.'' ''The only thing that could be said is that it has a good purpose,'' he added. As the legislators voted, they repeatedly attacked the M.T.A. and called for its reorganization. Governor-elect Cuomo also favors abolishing the M.T.A. ''Let no one think,'' said the Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, Democrat of Manhattan, ''that we - Democrats or Repubicans - are in the least bit satisfied with the job they are doing. We are tired of being patient.'' In his last speech in the legislature, Senator Christopher J. Mega, a Brooklyn Republican who was defeated for re-election, said, ''There are people in the city of New York who wouldn't ride the subways if you reduced the fare.'' Senator Linda Winikow, Democrat of Spring Valley, and Assemblyman Thomas P. Morahan, Republican of New City, said they would pursue legislation to have Rockland County removed from the M.T.A. region. ''This bill will inhibit growth in the state, and especially in our region,'' Mr. Morahan said. The agreement in Albany followed three weeks of deadlocked discussions over how to close a $300 million deficit in the M.T.A. budget. Of the new tax revenues, $135 million will go to the New York City Transit Authority and $95 million to the commuter railroads. The M.T.A. expects the balance to come from new operating subsidies in Federal legislation that would impose a 5-cent increase in the Federal gasoline tax. The new state legislation also provides $4.4 million for the Staten Island Ferry and $34.1 million to private bus lines. Much of the M.T.A.'s budget problem had been caused by the failure of taxes imposed last year on oil companies to raise as much money as expected, and Democrats favored a new tax on business. The Assembly, dominated by Democrats, passed a payroll tax last week. Proposed by Anderson Republicans in the Senate passed a sales tax, instead, and also considered a surcharge on the personal income tax. But on Tuesday night, Mr. Anderson proposed the new corporate-profits tax. After studying it overnight, Democrats agreed. Business groups had lobbied heavily against the payroll tax, and Democrats said the new business tax proposed by Senator Anderson was a victory for them. ''If we ever had proposed this,'' Mr. Ohrenstein said, ''it would have been shot down. It's like Nixon going to China - only Warren Anderson could propose this.'' Business groups also angrily attacked the corporate-tax surcharge. But a key business lobbyist spoke to Senator Anderson on Tuesday night and agreed to let the tax go through, if the Legislature dropped plans for a payroll tax. 'Lesser of Two Evils' The lobbyist, Raymond T. Schuler, president of the New York State Business Council, picked the surcharge as ''the lesser of two evils,'' according to a staff member of the council, Edmund Perry. ''The surcharge is certainly detrimental to business development,'' he said. ''But we believe it is more manageable to repeal the surcharge than it will ever be to repeal the payroll tax.'' He said the new tax would not create ''dramatic and immediate changes'' in businesses in the M.T.A. region, but the levy might make it harder to attract new industry. ''It is a signal to business and certainly will be a factor that they will consider. Morton Getman, a lobbyist for New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the new tax would ''have a devastating impact on profitable companies.'' ''The damange that this will do cannot be repaired,'' he said. Mayor Koch learned of the agreement in a telephone call from Governor Carey to a restaurant in Manhattan where the Mayor was having lunch. He said he supported the agreement with ''no hedges.'' Reimposition of Higher Rates ''I accept and concur and will support it, because it will save the fare,'' he said. The tax indirectly reimposes higher corporate tax rates that hade been reduced during the last few years. Both Governor Carey and Senate Republicans took credit for cutting taxes, and both support the new surcharge. The surcharge will take effect for corporate fiscal years beginning after Jan. 1, 1982, and continue for two years. The biggest tax affected is the 10 percent corporation franchise tax imposed on general business corporations; the franchise tax raises about $1 billion a year. The formula to compute the share of profits from the region is based on a similar formula used in New York City to compute its corporate income taxes. It is based on the local share of sales, payroll and capital. A manufacturing company with headquarters in Rochester that pays a state franchise tax of $100,000 a year and has 50 percent of its sales, payroll and capital investments in the M.T.A. region would, according to Senate fiscal aides, pay an 18 percent surcharge on $50,000, or the 50 percent of its state tax. It would owe $9,000. City and Suburban Counties The surcharge on bank taxes is based on deposits, payrolls, receipts and property of branches in the region. The @insurance-tax surcharge is based on a ratio of wages paid and premiums earned in the region compared with the rest of the state. The surcharge on the corporation and utilities tax is based on a ratio of gross earnings in the region, compared with the entire tax. The 12-county M.T.A. region takes in the five boroughs of New York City and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Orange and Dutchess Counties. Senator Mary B. Goodhue, Republican of Mount Kisco, voted against the tax. She said, ''There are companies who are paying millions and millions in taxes and will not benefit one iota.'' In the Assembly, all but two Democrats in the chamber - I. William Bianchi Jr. of East Patchogue, L.I., and George J. Hochbreuckner of Port Jefferson Station, L.I., voted yes. All but two Republicans - John M. Perone of Port Chester and Robert A. Straniere of Staten Island - voted no.

164-> DAMAGES ARE HARD TO RECOUP
WHETHER you are a landlord or a homeowner, there are risks with t enants that cannot be avoided. Even if you carefully select your t enant, even if you check and double check all references, even if y ou rent to a friend, you may still wind up with a damaged property. The repair bills will certainly make you angry and probably will make you question your own judgment about people. And there are only a few practical steps you can take to lessen your losses: You can demand a security deposit; you can set the rent high enough to cover excessive wear or malicious carelessness; you can sue and you can write off part of the loss as a tax deduction. But each of these steps has limitations. Most tenants are fine people and the your chances of renting to someone who is deliberately destructive are small. Brokers often say that they have no problem with 90 to 95 percent of the people to whom they rent. But a lot depends on how a landlord or homeowner defines a ''problem.'' The fastidious housekeeper who rents his home for a year or two while he works abroad may be enraged to come back and find stained carpets or a beloved rose garden destroyed by the tenant's terrier. Others may not be troubled even by holes in the walls, since sheetrock is relatively cheap. Virtually every landlord asks for a security deposit to cover damages. A month's rent is the norm. Landlords prefer two months, but many tenants resist such a large deposit. Anyone trying to sublet a rent-stablized apartment in New York City is limited by law: The deposit can be only one-month's rent, but if the apartment is furnished a fee of 10 percent can be added to the rent to compensate for damages to the furniture. Because of a recent court decision, the 10 percent fee may be changed to allow those with very expensive furniture to charge more. At the moment, however, the rule is no more than 10 percent. But no matter how large the deposit, tenants often avoid responsibility for damages by not paying the rent for the last month or months of their lease. They tell their landlords to use the security deposit for the rent, and, even though this is illegal, there is little the landlords can do about it. Eugene Sheridan, who owns a real-estate firm in Chappaqua, N.Y., says you can avoid this dilemma by making sure the lease has a clause saying the security deposit cannot be used as the last month's rent. ''If they don't make the last month's rent, we are on their doorsteps,'' he said. ''We could take them to court, but I've never had to do it, and I'm 23 years in the real-estate business.'' Other professionals say that tenants use the security deposit as the last month's rent even when the lease specifically forbids it. Moreover, the amount of money involved is usually not worth a court battle. Some cooperative boards demand a security deposit for the building when an apartment is leased. Warren Regent of the Darwood Management Company Inc. said that some Manhattan cooperatives demand that as much as $1,000 be put in escrow to cover possible damages to the building or elevators when a tenant moves in. The shareholder pays the deposit to the corporation and then charges the tenant what the board has demanded. On occasion, problems have arisen with the building's deposit, Mr. Regent said, but not often. ''Subtenants are so carefully scrutizied by the cooperative boards,'' he said, ''that you don't have too many problems.'' Mr. Regent said in the system he prefers, the tenant's deposit is put in escrow only for a matter of days while the tenant is moving in. Later, when the tenant moves out, the tenant must again put a deposit in escrow. EDWARD BECKEMEIER, an insurance expert, said that insurance against m alicious damage to the house by a tenant was usually not available. H e is the national manager of property and allied lines for the G eneral Adjustment Bureau, one of the largest independent insurance a djustment firms in the country. If a tenant held a raucous party in the house and damaged something, normally the only recourse of the owner would be to sue the tenant, Mr. Beckemeier said. Vincent Beck, a lawyer in Suffolk County who specializes in real estate, suggests that landlords require tenants get their own insurance policy covering liability and damage. The cost to the tenant, said Mr. Beck, is often about $90 a year. Mr. Beck added that he has never seen an insurance policy that covers a landlord against damage by a tenant, ''and my wife is an insurance broker.'' Pegging the rent high enough to cover wear and tear and even more serious damage may be an appealing idea to someone renting his home, but it is not always possible. Rents are determined by the market, and if you ask for a rent much higher than the rent on comparable houses or apartments, you may not find a tenant. Moreover, if you are subletting a rent-stabilized apartment, you may not raise the rent. As stated above, a tenant can charge a subtenant a 10 percent furniture fee. But if the apartment is unfurnished, the tenant cannot charge the subtenant an extra penny. However, the law allows a landlord - not the tenant - to collect additional rent from a subtenant in some cirmcumstances. A subtenant may be required to pay up to an additional 15 percent to the landlord, depending on when the the prime tenant's original lease was signed. Suing should be regarded as a last resort recourse because it can be expensive and time consuming. Many owners add up the repair bills for damages done by a tenant, compare the total with what a suit might cost and find that they are better off absorbing their losses. But if the damages are large and expensive to correct, a suit may be the only way to recoup at least part of the cost. But even then, there may be problems. If the tenant moves to a distant city or abroad, you may not be able to find him. For smaller losses, you could handle the case yourself in Small Claims Court. In New Jersey and Connecticut, there is a $1,000 limit in Small Claims Court, compared to $1,500 in New York. It will probably take at least six weeks, perhaps six months to get a resolution. When all else fails, you can cut your losses by claiming a tax deduction. The Internal Revenue Service allows deductions for all repairs on a rental property. But you don't get back dollar for dollar. If you are in the 40 percent bracket, you can get back only 40 cents of every dollar your lose.

165-> FRANCE'S NEW INDUSTRIAL POLICY
PARIS T he French Socialists don't use the word, recession, when they talk about the nation's struggling economy. Instead they speak of la crise, the crisis, a word that implies a challenge that can be overcome. And to overcome it, the 18-month-old Socialist Government of President Francois Mitterrand has unveiled in recent weeks its new industrial strategy, a huge investment program to be led by France's enlarged nationalized industrial sector. The aim is to build a powerful group of world class French companies and, in the process, to give a lift to the nation's entire economy. The hope: That a major commitment to industrial investment will ultimately allow France to run a more independent economic policy and to grow fast even if its neighboring industrial countries are in a slump. The Mitterrand Government tried to achieve that feat during its first year in office. It boosted wages and take-home pay to stimulate consumption in the midst of a severe European recession. But instead of generating a boom for domestic producers, the stimulus generated a wave of demand for foreign goods, which plunged France's trade account into deep deficit, causing two franc devaluations and widespread disappointment. Now, however, the Socialists are taking a new tack. The consumer is being held down with a new austerity program and industry is being force-fed funds to invest. The strategy, with its focus on nationalization and planning sounds new, enlightened and Socialist - and for Mr. Mitterrand it is. But in a fundamental way, the new industrial policy is old, very French and liable to prove dangerously protectionist. Already the Socialists are throwing up import barriers to protect the industries they are lavishing so much public money on, particularly electronics. The initiative is stirring fears in Europe and the United States that the Socialists are moving back toward traditional French policies of subsidizing domestic industries and barricading them against foreign competitors. ''Our obese state would do better to manage the things it is responsible for instead of trying to increase its sphere of influence,'' said Pierre Mehaignerie, a former minister in the Government that was defeated last year by Mr. Mitterrand. ''The Government is basically trying to pick industrial winners,'' says Francois Duchene of Britain's Sussex University Institute for European Studies. ''There is a big dose of 'more of the same.' '' But Industry Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the major architect of the Socialists' new strategy, says such criticism misses the point. ''There is a lot that is traditional about our approach and that is a strength,'' he said recently. But the fast-talking bureaucrat, who is widely thought to see himself as a future prime minister or even president, insists that the new strategy is far more ambitious than anything that went before. ''Another 10 years like the last and France's existence will be jeopardized by its loss of industry,'' said Mr. Chevenement. ''We are reversing a decade of industrial decline.'' There is another thread of history that runs through France's latest economic experiment. Despite the nationalization of the country's 11 largest industrial groups and virtually all of its banks since Mr. Mitterrand took office in June 1981, the command structure of the French economy remains much the same as it was. French Governments have always been able to tell industry and banks what to do, thanks to the carrots and sticks at their command and to France's unique educational system that spreads a web of like-minded technocrats throughout business and government. The network is made up of individuals who went to the same elite schools, know one another and cooperate instinctively. Thus, the men entrusted with France's new state sector by the Socialists are essentially no different from those who would have run these companies and banks under a right-wing government. The majority are former civil servants - from an elite group known as Inspecteurs des Finances - and most are graduates of the prestiguous Ecole Nationale d'Administration and the Polytechnique. At St. Gobain-Pont-a Mousson, the large diversified French manufacturer that was nationalized last year, one of this breed, Roger Fauroux, was left in charge. Jean-Pierre Brunet, the new head of Compagnie General d'Electricite, was French Ambassador to Bonn and Tokyo in earlier, non-Socialist Governments. George Besse, the new chief of the French chemical giant, Pechiney Uguine Kuhlmann, is a Polytechnique graduate who worked before for the state-owned Atomic Energy Commissariat. In banking the tale is similar. Jean-Yves Haberer, a former top civil servant in the Finance Ministry has taken over Paribas, the large investment bank. Jacques Wahl, former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing's right-hand aide and a former inspecteur de finance, is No. 2 at the newly-nationalized Banque Nationale de Paris. Such elitism runs counter to the socialist tenet of egalitarianism. But so does another major element of the Government's new economic program: the severe clampdown on wages and social programs that began this summer and is still intensifying. Earlier this month, with unemployment at 8 1/4 percent and heading higher, the Government cut benefits for the jobless. Wages and prices have been frozen for the last three months. Although the freeze is being lifted now, the Government plans to maintain strict controls long into the future. The President's advisers say there is no other way. The temporary bout of austerity is designed to cut inflation from its pre-freeze 14 percent rate to single digits and to reduce the nation's trade deficit so that a politically disastrous third devaluation of the franc can be avoided. ''France must align its growth rate with that of its neighbors,'' says Finance Minister Jacques Delors, reflecting the Government's lowered horizons. Eventually, says Louis Gallois, director general of the Industry Ministry, France hopes to be able to run a 1 to 2 percent growth differential over West Germany. In the 40's and 50's France managed to outperform its neighbors. But the relatively large shift of labor from farm to city that made that differential possible has long since stopped. LAST year the Socialists pumped $2.09 billion into the state sector -which now includes 25 percent of the country's competitive industry. This year another $2.51 billion will go for such investment, followed by $3.76 billion in 1983. Meanwhile plans call for private industry to be systematically restructured branch by branch and showered with new assistance and subsidies. While the nationalized industries are being cast in the role of economic locomotive, the Socialists have promised a wholesale restructuring of private industry as well. They reject any notion that modern industrialized countries should surrender basic industries like steel, textiles and footwear to lower cost third-world producers. ''There are no condemned industries, only out of date technologies,'' Mr. Chevenement is fond of arguing. Modernization plans have already been prepared for a number of troubled sectors, including the machine tool and toy industries, and plans are in the works for furniture and automobiles. Government research outlays will be raised sharply and new subsidies offered, including cheap electricity for aluminum makers. French businessmen are being exhorted to join in a patriotic campaign to ''reconquer the domestic market'' from foreign suppliers. But such ambitious plans must still be tested in reality. At the same time as they strive to modernize these industries, the Socialists, worried about their political flanks, are pressing executives not to fire more workers. France's labor force continues to grow by around 200,000 a year, despite 1.9 million unemployed. As a result, nationalized companies are already under heavy political pressure to maintain employment just when the Government's investment drive should be making them slimmer and more efficient. PLENTY of eyebrows were raised in February 1981 when President Mitterrand signed the nationalization bill, pledging that ''the autonomy of decision making and action of the newly nationalized companies must be total.'' Only days later the so-called autonomous banks were being ordered to put up millions of dollars of loans to save jobs in France's trouble-plagued steel industry - just as previous administrations had regularly arm-twisted the banks into financing privately held companies in trouble. ''France will soon lose the art of banking,'' laments an executive of a nationalized bank. ''We'll just have civil servants obeying orders.'' In fact, the newly nationalized companies President Mitterrand hopes to turn into national champions are almost all deep in the red and heavily indebted. Virtually all the new aid allocated to them so far will go toward covering losses, effectively leaving new investment to be financed by futher borrowing. The money for the new investment outlays will come partly from the Government, partly from the banks it owns and partly from the pockets of the public. Individuals are to be encouraged under a still unpublished law to invest directly in the nation's industrial sector rather than in such traditional havens for French savings as gold and real estate. Mr. Chevenement, a former leftist in the party who is moving fast toward the center, is trying to secure long-term funding for his ambitious industrial policy through a new law that would obligate the Government to devote 3 percent of France's gross national product to industrial investment, thus effectively freeing him from financial dependence on the Finance Ministry. The plan, say some critics, threatens to strain domestic money markets, keeping interest rates high and increasing the foreign borrowing and indebtedness substantially. To keep next year's budget deficit down to 3 percent of the economy's expected gross national product, the Government has already decided that it itself cannot finance all the new investment it hoped to finance in 1983. Where the additional funds will come from remains uncertain. A sharp political controversy is already brewing over the growth of France's foreign debt under the Socialists. Using information supplied to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with a $100 million Government-guaranteed loan by the Caisse Nationale des Telephones, Le Monde recently calculated that France's total foreign currency debt has nearly doubled, to $45 billion, since the Socialists came to power. Finance Minister Jacques Delors replied testily that all nations keep such figures secret and said the newspaper's revelation had ''political overtones.'' At the current rate of borrowing, of some $10 billion to $15 billion a year, France's total foreign debt could reach about $90 billion in three years, equal to Brazil's. ''Is this not dangerous in a world characterized by over-indebtedness?'' asked Paul Fabra, the paper's respected financial editor. FRANCE FIGHTSVIDEO SARACENS POITIERS In the year 732, a French warrior lord named Charles Martel - or Charles the Hammer - defeated the advancing Saracen armies at Poitiers in eastern France, thus turning back the Muslim tide that had already swept up from North Africa through Portugal and Spain. More than 1,000 years later, President Francois Mitterrand is fighting the second Battle of Poitiers. But this time the enemy is Japan, and the French are trying to save their stills-embryonic video recorder industry from being obliterated by foreign competition. Since Oct.26, France has required all importers of Japanese video recorders to clear their consignments through customs at an understaffed customs depot here in Poitiers, a pleasant but out-ofthe-way country town 210 miles southwest of Paris. The intended result: long delays for dealers in securing supplies and growing fears of a shortage for the peak Christmas shopping rush. The Socialists have decided to develop the French video recorder industry, but they know that will take time and hope to make life difficult for Japan and other foreign competitors in the meanwhile. The French move against Japanese video recorders is only one of a number of new obstacles that the Socialists have recently put in the way of importers as they try to right a yawning trade deficit and buy time for their industry to ''reconquer the domestic market.'' The country of origin of all foreign products must be clearly written on them. And in future, the French customs will only process documents written in French. The French moves are being contested before the GATT in Geneva and the European Common Market's Court of Justice by France's trading partners, who say that they breach free-trade pledges. Japanese video manufacturers have been publishing full-page advertisements in the French press saying, ''We are not Saracens.'' Pierre Galliot, the director of the Poitiers customs depot, said he was even challenged by a confused Japanese reporter, trying to remember history, who asked him, ''Who do you think you are, Marthe Chartel?'' But many other Western Governments fear these new French harasments against imports could be the thin end of a protectionist wedge that the French Socialists may thrust deeper into the postwar open trading system.

166-> LEON GOLDFARB
Leon Goldfarb, a successful plaintiff in a suit that charged that a provision of the Social Security Act unconstitionally discriminated on the basis of sex, died Sunday at a nursing home in Rockville, Md., after a long illness. He was 77 years old. Mr. Goldfarb, who formerly lived in Jamaica, Queens, had been a manager at the Army Pictorial Center in Long Island City, and, as a Federal employee, had paid no Social Security taxes. His wife, Hannah, however, had worked for 25 years as a secretary in public schools in Brooklyn and Queens and had paid the taxes. In 1974, he challenged the requirement that to qualify for survivor benefits a widower had to have been receiving at least half his support from his wife at the time she died. On March 3, 1977, the United States Supreme Court, ruling 5 to 4 in Mr. Goldfarb's favor, found that provision of the Social Security Act to be unconstitutional. Mr. Goldfarb is survived by a son, Donald Goldfarb of Manhattan; a daughter, Linda Roberts of Darnestown, Md., four sisters, Perl Barkan, Alice Simon and Ruth Kempner, all of Brooklyn, and Hilda Fidel of Queens, and four grandchildren.

167-> Florida Faculty Asked For Review of Football
The president of the University of Florida, Robert Q. Marston, said today that he had asked his faculty committee on intercollegiate athletics to look into reports of possible recruiting violations in the football program. Marston said he made the request after reading newspaper reports that an assistant coach had offered inducements to a relative and a friend of a player who was being sought by the university. The Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel reported Friday that Pat Moons, a place-kicker for St. Thomas Aquinas High in Fort Lauderdale, said he had talked with an N.C.A.A. investigator four times about recruiting practices at Florida. The N.C.A.A., however, has not initiated an official investigation of Florida, officials said. The report came just three days after Coach Charley Pell of Florida called for a ''blue-ribbon committee'' to inspect his program. The coach's call came in the wake of reports that nearly 20 percent of the violations that drew a stiff N.C.A.A. penalty for Clemson University occurred while Pell was the Tigers' coach.

169-> MARTIN DISMISSED BY OAKLAND A's AFTER 3 SEASONS AS MANAGER
Billy Martin, who has managed five teams in the American League, was dismissed by the Oakland A's today. A statement released by Roy Eisenhardt, the A's president, said the club did not blame Martin for the team's fifth-place finish this season after leading the team to the Western Division title the year before but added that he thought a change was necessary for the good of the A's. There were indications that Martin, who has been negotiating with other American League teams for managerial positions, appeared to have departed amicably. The 54-year-old Martin had three years remaining on his contract with the A's. Talks With Yankees, Indians Martin's attorney, Eddie Sapir, has spoken in recent weeks to George Steinbrenner, principal owner of the Yankees, and Gabe Paul, president of the Cleveland Indians. Paul, who was president of the Yankees when Martin managed them for the first time, has been pursuing Martin vigorously, but he said tonight that Mike Ferraro, the Yankees' first-base boach, is also under consideration. According to a friend of Martin, the Yankees - a team he managed twice - would be Martin's first choice. ''I think he would go back,'' the friend said. In Cleveland, Phil Seghi, the Indians' general manager, said the dismissal by the A's would not affect his club's talks with Martin. ''It's big news, but I don't think it's going to affect our position. We'll just keep talking with him.'' Sapir said that Martin was on a hunting trip and was ''in no hurry to do anything.'' In a statement issued by Sapir today, Martin expressed appreciation to Eisenhardt and Walter Haas, the A's principal owner. From First to Fifth Martin led the A's to the American League Western Division championship in 1981, his second year with the club, but the club fell to fifth place this season with a 68-94 record. Martin began his career as a manager with the Minnesota Twins in 1969. He took the Twins and the Detroit Tigers to divisional titles and, after leading the Texas Rangers to a strong second-place finish in 1974, returned to the Yankees in 1975. He took the Yankees to the World Series in 1976 and 1977. But Martin had several run-ins with Steinbrenner and resigned under pressure midway through the 1978 season. Steinbrenner rehired Martin late in the 1979 season before letting him go again at the end of the year. Eisenhardt's statement said the club has ''no immediate plans to announce a successor.'' Among the possibilities reported today included John McNamara, a former manager of the A's and the Cincinnati Reds; and Jim Fregosi, former manager of the California Angels. Hint of a Return Martin was also director of player development for Oakland, and Eisenhardt said in a letter to Martin: ''Hopefully you may return to this organization someday in an advisory capacity when the time is right.'' In the letter, Eisenhardt said, in part, that he stressed the club's ''respect for his professionalism,'' but added: ''One must recognize the inevitability of change as a solution for difficult circumstances even when no party may seek or want that change.'' ''The club does not attribute the fifth-place finish this year to a failure on your part,'' Eisenhardt wrote. ''It resulted from a combination of circumstances beyond anyone's control. The challenge now is to reverse the results of last year (season) and achieve the long-term stability which underlies the club's ownership philosophy.'' The A's said that Martin's No.1 uniform would not be reissued under current ownership.

170-> Cut in College's Aid Imperils The Antioch Literary Review
The Antioch Review, a prestigious literary journal published since 1941, may fold because of money problems, its editor says. The quarterly has been stricken from the Antioch College budget as part of the college's effort to erase a deficit. Robert Fogarty, the editor, said the action left the publication with a ''50-50'' chance of survival. Its national circulation is 4,000 copies. ''There's no literary magazine in the United States that does not have a subsidy,'' Mr. Fogarty said. ''They cannot exist.'' The Review originally was to receive $20,000 of its $60,000 operating budget from the college, a smaller amount than in recent years, but enough to meet expenses, Mr. Fogarty said.

174-> Disney Approves Hiring Plan
Blacks and members of other minority groups trying to get jobs in the film industry will receive a helping hand from Walt Disney Productions, which announced a series of actions to be taken after 10 months of talks with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The agreement, announced Friday, came after Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the N.A.A.C.P., said the organization would select a major film studio for possible boycotts to improve the role of minority groups, both in front of and behind the cameras. Mr. Hooks did not identify the selected studio, but he said talks were planned with all major companies and warned that if a selected studio remained ''nonresponsive'' the organization would consider actions ranging from boycotts to bringing pressure through the Federal Communications Commission to achieve its goals. Under the agreement between the N.A.A.C.P. and Disney, the company said it would exert influence to bring about increased use of blacks in the creation, production and performance of films. Other goals mentioned in the agreement include promotion of blacks and members of other minority groups into senior management positions, black representation on the board of directors and purchase of more goods from black-owned businesses.

175-> DEATH AND MEMORY
By an odd coincidence, the Soviet Government announced the death of Leonid Brezhnev on Armistice Day, when the allied nations pause to remember that over 50 million people were killed in the two world wars of this century. The symbolism of the day is worth noting, for whatever else may be said against him, Mr. Brezhnev never seems to have forgotten this simple appalling fact, and even when he was drifting into the shadows at the end of his life, he was still muttering vaguely about the importance of avoiding a third world war. His actions over the 18 years of his dictatorship, of course, were quite different. He was a tyrant, but unlike Stalin, he was not a monster. He kept the Soviet people in a tunnel, like the tunnel in Afghanistan, and at the slightest thump of danger, sealed it off. Also, he extended Soviet power into Africa, Central America, the Mediterranean, most of the oceans of the world - and even into outer space, as all great nations tend to expand. In addition, he produced the Brezhnev doctrine in Czechoslovakia - all Communist states must fight against any external or internal threat to any one of them - and proved that he meant it by trying to stamp out freedom in Poland. Yet throughout his years as leader of the Soviet Union, something in Mr. Brezhnev's memory about the carnage of the two world wars made him avoid a direct military confrontation with the United States. Now there's a changing of the guard in Moscow and the question is how the allies in general and President Reagan in particular should deal with Yuri V. Andropov, the new General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party. Here in Germany, the view is that we should be calm but quick. The death of Mr. Brezhnev has been coming on for years, officials here say. Increasingly, it was clear when Mr. Brezhnev was in Bonn, that he was in charge only at the beginning of meetings, and thereafter left all questions to Foreign Secretary Gromyko or other aides. Prime Minister Gandhi of India had this same impression during her recent visit to Moscow, and her view of Mr. Brezhnev's rapidly declining health was passed onto Prime Minister Thatcher in London. So the assumption here in Germany, at least, is that the transition from Mr. Brezhnev to some sort of collective leadership under Mr. Andropov has been going on for a long time, and there is now a chance for a new beginning. Former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt of Germany said in a talk here today that a great deal would depend on President Reagan's approach to Mr. Andropov. He welcomed the President's funeral statement and hoped that the United States would move quickly now to try to break the present stalemate on nuclear arms control and East-West trade, but he thought Mr. Reagan's refusal to go to the Brezhnev funeral was unfortunate. It would have been awkward, Mr. Schmidt conceded, since the new German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, was scheduled to meet President Reagan in Washington on the day of Mr. Brezhnev's funeral. ''But opportunities are few and symbols are important in politics,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''You can't make a policy with the Russians by reading the press and diplomatic cables. They always leave out the human thing, and it would be wrong to forget that human pride and sensitivity are important at the top in Moscow, as elsewhere.'' The intention here is not to speak sentimentally about the dead Mr. Brezhnev or even hopefully about his successor. Mr. Andropov has been the main cop in the Soviet Union for almost a generation, and it's fair to assume that he was not picked for the K.G.B. job because of his love for human rights or moral philosophy. He helped amputate Finland and save Hungary for the Communist system, and he has never set foot in the West. It would be fair to assume, therefore, that Mr. Andropov was chosen because the Soviet Union has been in an economic mess for years and needs new men and energies to bring the country into the modern world. Mr. Schmidt, out of office now and watching the falling leaves outside his office window here, spoke of his regrets. The chances are, he said, things wouldn't have changed much if we had reached out to Mr. Brezhnev more than we did. The problem is that we'll never know and may go through the same process with Mr. Andropov. There is, however, the consoling thought that the new General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, having measured the economic statistics against his military budget, might, like President Reagan, begin to think that there must be some better way to run a government. Also, Mr. Andropov is now 68 and rather frail. Like Mr. Brezhnev, he may also have his memories of the ghastly tragedy of the two world wars.

176-> NEW YORK; It's Time To Share The Pain
Two messages kept leaping out at me as I leafed through the 103 pages of Mayor Koch's latest budget and four-year fiscal plan. One was that, no matter how experienced we New York Cityites have become at adjusting to shrunken services and tax pain, these new cuts in basic services are going to be visible in many instances and they are going to hurt. The other message that nagged at me was a question: Has the state government in Albany - which is crying poverty and therefore inability to help straitened localities - done as much as the city in paring waste and fat from its payroll and budget? The answer would seem to be no. It is one of Governor-elect Cuomo's toughest challenges as he prepares to take office. First the city. As one turns the pages of the financial plan at random, the losses - wrapped in such cotton-batting phrases as ''Productivity and Management Improvements'' and ''Cost Containment'' - seem profuse and starkly real. An item in the Fire Department under ''civilian workforce reduction'': ''Attrition will be generated in those areas not essential to basic support services directly related to fire operations.'' Does this mean that these 50 jobs to be erased were never essential? Maybe a few of them were less than crucial, but what it really means is that much of the useful work those 50 people did in the past will not get done now, and the Fire Department will probably not run as well. If we are not yet cutting into bone, surely we have hit gristle. The Sanitation Department: Manpower reduction is to be achieved through ''a re-estimate of the number of uniformed personnel required to deliver current service levels.'' This language, translated, means that the department, like all others, is being asked to provide the same services with fewer resources. In the real world, that is largely impossible - so the city streets are going to get dirtier. And the Sanitation Commissioner, Norman Steisel, has, in laudable candor, admitted this. Some items in the budget give the bad news in no-frills language. Environmental Protection: ''Reduction in personnel in the Bureau of Water Supply will mean a lessening of preventive maintenance efforts ... and a cutback in evening repair efforts. There will be some increase in the response time to complaints about water main breaks and leaks.'' If this worries you, buy an inflatable raft. And so on and so on goes the slasher's knife through hospitals and libraries and housing and parks. There is no pretending that the quality of life will not be affected here. The only question is how much. Mayor Koch is trying to limit the damage, and he needs all the help he can get - from the public-employee unions, from private industry and from community groups. Not only are the Mayor's options and resources very narrow, but some of the budget-balancing projections he uses for productivity savings and state aid could turn out to be will-o'-the-wisps. Which brings us to the issue of what the state can and will do for this city and other localities. State officials and politicians say their budget gaps are as bad as, if not worse than, the city's and, in their poor-mouthing, have told us to expect little or nothing from Albany in increased assistance. They may be able to demonstrate that their budget gaps are real, but what they have not demonstrated is the willingness to make the state payroll and budget as lean as Mr. Koch has made the city's. In 1975, the year our fiscal crisis came to a head, the city had around 300,000 people on its payroll; that figure has been reduced by more than a third - to 190,000 - and is going lower. The difference in Albany is that in 1975 the state had about 190,000 employees and it still has 190,000 employees. Albany types will give you all kinds of governmentese reasons why there have to be 190,000 people working for the state or why the state mental hospital system has to have a larger budget now than it did before it dumped three-quarters of its patients onto the streets of New York and other cities and towns. But the plain truth is that the fiscal sacrifices are not being equitably shared. Albany bureaucrats will also tell you privately that one major obstacle to payroll-cutting is the power of the unions that represent state employees, principally the Civil Service Employees Association. That's what used to be said about New York City public-employee unions - who have long since accepted their share of the financial responsibility, which has meant sub-inflation contracts and the bailout of the city with union pension funds. Is there any reason why state unions should not shoulder the same burdens? If we're all in the same boat - as our leaders are fond of saying - both ends of the craft ought to be leaking equally. Before the state government can plead poverty convincingly this year, it must persuade us that its feet are just as wet as ours.

177-> NICARAGUA FEARS REBEL ATTACK
Nicaragua's Deputy Foreign Minister said today that the Sandinist leadership expected attacks from Honduras in the next few weeks from forces associated with the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle. The White House, meanwhile, underscored the importance of Honduras to the Administration by announcing that President Reagan had added that nation to his trip to Latin America. Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Reagan had accepted an invitation from President Roberto Suazo Cordova to visit Honduras Dec. 4. Mr. Speakes said the stopover in the capital of Tegucigalpa would not add another day to the trip, which begins Nov. 30. Mr. Reagan will also visit Brazil, Colombia and Costa Rica, where he will confer with El Salvador's Provisional President, Alvaro Magana. The Nicaraguan Deputy Foreign Minister, Victor Hugh Tinoco, who is attending the current meeting of the Organization of American States, also said that the postponement by Nicaragua of a purchase of Sovietmade MIG warplanes was designed to show the United States and other nations that the Sandinists wanted ''to work for peace.'' ''We seek only arms necessary for defense,'' Mr. Tinoco said at a breakfast meeting with reporters in the Nicaraguan Embassy. Mr. Tinoco said his Government expected a step-up in clandestine anti-Sandinist military activity from Honduras in the next few weeks. He said the possible attacks would seek to disrupt the start of harvesting of Nicaragua's major coffee crop in December, an important source of currency for the Government. The Deputy Foreign Minister estimated that there were 5,000 rebels aligned with the deposed Somoza Government on the Nicaragua-Honduras border. He said Nicaraguan security forces totaled 100,000. Other Nicaraguan officials have said that Miskito Indians who fled into Honduras earlier this year form a large part of the exile force.

178-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Vatican Shelter?
The news report last Feb. 21 said the Vatican would begin building ''a $1.6 million bomb shelter in June to protect its library collection against nuclear attack.'' It quoted the head of the Vatican Library, the Rev. Alfons Stickler, as saying the underground shelter - 18 feet deep - would be in the library courtyard at Vatican City. ''It is a misunderstanding about the bomb shelter,'' says Father Stickler. ''It is not a bomb shelter, but only an underground book storage for the manuscripts and incunabula.'' The incunabula - books printed before 1501 A.D. - now number 800,000, he says, and there are also 70,000 rare manuscripts. There is no longer space or proper temperature and humidity controls to store the collection in the library, he notes. He expects the underground area to be finished in July. ''It would be impossible for us to construct an antinuclear bomb shelter,'' Father Stickler says, ''because it's absolutely too expensive and we would have to dig down too far.''

180-> OBITUARY; James Allen, 75, Dies; Was Northrop Official
James Allen, a public relations specialist who retired as a vice president of the Northrop Corporation in 1974, died Nov. 9 in the Van Nuys Hospital in Los Angeles. He was 75 years old and lived in Beverly Hills. Mr. Allen was born in New York City and graduated from City College and the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. He worked as an information officer for the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Office of War Information before holding a series of similar posts in private industry. He joined Northrop in 1952 and later, as vice president and assistant to Northrop's chief executive, Thomas V. Jones, he became a key figure in the multimillion dollar slush fund scandals that engulfed the aerospace company in the Watergate period. In 1974, shortly before his retirement, he admitted violating the Federal Elections Campaign Act for his role in illegally contributing $150,000 in Northrop funds to President Richard M. Nixon's 1972 reelection campaign. He is survived by his wife, Sylvia; a daughter, Judith Allen Kessler of Seattle, and a granddaughter.

181-> HOW TO CUT UTILITY COST IN A CO-OP
ON one floor there may be a bachelor who travels a lot on business a nd rarely is at home. He does not own an air-conditioner; he sends h is laundry out and he eats so few meals at home he usually leaves t he refrigerator unplugged. Just below him may be a family of four, including two small children with allergies. In the summer, air-conditioners run constantly. The washer and dryer are used at least once a day. In the winter, the family augments the building's heat with small space heaters. And with the mother and the children home most of the day, lights are constantly on, as is the television set. Charging both apartments the same amount for electricity does not make much sense, but, until recently, that is what was done in many apartment buildings. Not only was one tenant paying for another tenant's electricty, but there was no incentive for any tenant to conserve energy. Encouraged by a change in New York law in l979, some cooperatives have set out to correct the imbalance by switching to a system of submetering. There are three basic ways co-op owners can buy electricity: When a building has a single master meter, the electricity bill goes to the co-op corporation and it apportions the costs among the apartment owners by a formula that usually is based on the size of an apartment rather than use. Alternatively, there is direct metering: each unit gets its electricty through its own meter directly from the utility, just like a single family home, and the unit owner pays the bill. Submetering is a combination of the two. Electricty comes into the building at bulk rate and is measured by a master meter, with the coop corporation paying that bill, but power passes to each apartment through its own meter and the owner is billed by the corporation for whatever he uses. Theoretically, submetering has a double advantage. Each tenant pays only for what he or she uses and the cooperative can buy electricity at a bulk or wholesale rate through its master meter and pass the savings on to the tenants. Consolidated Edison, for example, charges about 15 cents a kilowatt hour on a direct meter but the bulk rate for a master-metered building might be only 6.5 or 7 cents per kilowatt hour. But it is not that simple. Utility rates have many variables, the capital costs of converting can be high and each building must be analyzed separately. The savings could amount to thousands of dollars a month in some of the larger buildings but might be nominal in others. Individual meters also tend to make consumers save more energy. Studies show that buildings with individual meters tend to save about 20 percent or more on electricity costs and consumption. When a co-op wants to make these savings, the first question to be considered is the capital cost of the conversion. In buildings where tenants now are directly metered, it is relatively cheap and easy to put a master meter on the main cable bringing in electricity and work out a system for reading a tenant's meters. Normally, the co-op buys the individual meters from the utility. The economics of installing submeters for each apartment in a building with a master meter is not so clear. At 160 Riverside Drive, for example, the shareholders in the cooperative invested $27,000 to go from a master-metering system to submetering for its 69 units. The building cut its energy consumption by about 20 percent after the change was made in November l981. However, the cost did not decrease. In 1980 the building paid $49,500 for gas and electricity, compared to $62,500 in 1981 and $64,300 in 1982. (The l982 figure is a projection reflecting rate increases by Con Edison.) THE tenants did not get a reduction in their maintenance costs when t he submeters were added. What the installation did, according to E merson Gardner, treasurer of the cooperative board of the building, w as to keep costs from increasing even more than they did. Without s ubmetering, he explained, the board would have been forced to raise m aintenance fees. In other cooperatives, residents have had reductions in their maintenance costs when submeters were installed. The variables can include the the age, condition and layout of the existing electrical system and the cost of the new equiptment. Some buildings are willing to pay extra to have all the submeters installed in the basement, others save money by putting meters on every floor. Some put the meters inside the apartments. At 110-118 Riverside Drive, a 167-unit cooperative in two buildings, submetering resulted in reductions in maintenance fees. The average reduction was about $60 an apartment, although the fees are based on the number of shares an owner possesses. The buildings, which had been master metered, were converted at a total cost of $121,000, which worked out to about $750 a unit. The conversion was paid for by a special assessment, which was not the case at 160 Riverside Drive. But the cooperative's shareholders were able to take an energy tax credit on their income-tax return for the conversion. Money for converting the metering system was collected over a two-year period. There can be an added administrative burden with submetering. The utility's role ends at the master meter. The utility sends the building one bill based on what the master meter says. The cooperative is responsible for reading the submeters and billing each unit. Some cooperatives hire private companies to do the meter reading and billing. In l951, New York outlawed submetering in residential buildings because some landlords were using the system to gouge tenants. Then, in l976, the Public Service Commission said that all new residential construction had to be directly metered. AS energy got more expensive, the advantages of submetering became c ompelling. In l979, New York changed its laws again to allow s ubmetering in cooperatives and condominiums; the reasoning was that t here was no one to profit from submetering but the tenant owners. C hanges also allowed the owners of rental appartments to apply to theN ew York State Public Service Commission for the right to submeter, b ut few responded. Gateway Plaza, a complex of 1,700 apartments at Battery Park City is the most notable example of a submetered rental building. With many of the units still under construction, Gateway now has about 500 tenants who began moving in last June. Using advanced technology, the Gateway apartments have a computerzied submetering system that, among other things, gives tenants a digital meter in each apartment showing the exact number of kilowatts being consumed.

187-> STUDY OF FINANCIAL REGULATORS
Vice President Bush yesterday announced the formation of a group to study consolidating the numerous Federal agencies that regulate banks, savings institutions, securities firms and other financial institutions. The group, of which the Vice President will be chairman and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan vice chairman, includes the heads of all Federal financial regulatory agencies. It is expected to recommend changes to Congress in six to nine months. Under the existing regulatory scheme, three seperate agencies, for example, regulate and audit commercial banks; five agencies - and the Department of Justice - have jurisdiction over mergers or acquisitions involving depository institutions, and at least eight are involved in regulating the securities markets. Better Response Seen Richard C. Breeden, deputy counsel to the Vice President and head of the group's staff, said that combining the regulatory functions of different agencies might make it easier for the Government to respond to situations that involve inconsistent regulatory policies. He cited as ''a classic example'' the dispute that arose earlier this week between the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation over whether the Dreyfus Corporation, a major mutual fund company, should be allowed to purchase a bank. Another area of increasing regulatory conflict, Mr. Breeden said, is between the banking regulators and those that supervise the securities and commodities markets. The Federal Reserve, for example, is currently considering the BankAmerica Corporation's proposed acquisition of Charles Schwab & Company, the nation's largest discount brokerage firm. If approved, Schwab will be regulated by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act, while the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to regulate the firm as a broker-dealer. ''Historically, the banking regulators have emphasized confidentiality,'' Mr. Breeden said, ''the S.E.C., on the other hand, under the securities laws, has operated under a system that relies largely on disclosure. What happens when the S.E.C. comes in with rules that say disclose, disclose, disclose, and the Federal Reserve says maintain confidentiality.'' One of Several Efforts The Bush group is one of several ef forts in Washington to deal with the changes in the financial services industry. Last January, John S.R.Shad, S.E.C. chairman, proposed creating a joint industrygovernment commission to examine financial regulation, including the barriers separating banks and securities dealers. But the proposal was rejected by Mr. Regan as too broad in scope. The new group will focus solely on streamlining the structure of financial regulation. The decision to avoid the broader issues drew criticism from some members of Congress, where moves are already under way to address them. Wirth 'Disappointed' Representative Timothy Wirth, a Colorado Democrat and chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the securities laws, said today that he was ''disappointed that the Administration has chosen to take a very narrow segment of what we see as a very broad issue. Mr. Wirth, who is the sponsor of legislation to create a Commission on Capital Markets, contended that what is needed is a ''much broader look at these institutions. You can't do patch-work repairs anymore; we really have to do something comprehensive if its going to work.'' The new group is, in part, a reaction to the Wirth effect. In a letter to the Vice President last month, Secretary Regan urged speedy creation of the Administration's group to counter ''poorly conceived proposals'' such as Representive Wirth's.

188-> DISCOVERIES; 1. Flash in the Mask
If you're going to a Halloween party this weekend, you might check out a mask that's rimmed with tiny colored lights that flash on and off. The trick is that the lights are operated by a nine-volt battery that is hidden inside the mask. Macy's Arcade has the masks in various colors, priced at $10. 2. Step Up From Bunting Babies don't have to be dressed in pastel buntings, at least Kathy Sharon doesn't think so. She used to be a fashion illustrator and when her daughter, Alexis, now 2, came along, Miss Sharon found herself doodling sketches of baby suits that are nothing like the usual cotton knits. They aren't in pale colors but in black and white and are an amusing comment on adult fads. One is a tunic top with black dots on white, to which footed pants are attached. Alexis's favorite looks like a man's black formal suit, with a white dickey and tails done all-of-a-piece. The suits come in sizes newborn to 24 months, and are priced at $32 in Blooming Babies, 844 Lexington Avenue (64th Street) and Chocolate Soup, 946 Madison Avenue (74th Street). 3. Fanciful Wreaths Sook Kim used to run an art gallery; a friend of hers had a florist shop. Mrs. Kim loves flowers and her friend was getting tired of them, so they swapped shops. Now Mrs. Kim, a diminutive woman wrapped in an apron that proclaims the Y.W.C.A. in Seoul, South Korea, presides over Doro's annex, a small, brick-walled shop hung with plants and flowers. Chelsea dwellers are aware of her for something else besides the plants: Mrs. Kim makes charming wreaths, usually with dried grapevines as a base. Into them she tucks whatever strikes her fancy -dried flowers, leaves and berries, silk flowers and bits of ribbon, mixing colors and textures. Her prettiest designs are her bridal wreaths, circlets of either dried or silk flowers (or fresh ones to order), which people who are not brides often buy to hang on walls. Wreaths are from $9 to $250, with most in the $40 to $60 range. Special orders take about 10 days. Doro's Annex is at 180 Ninth Avenue (21st Street) and is open from noon to 7 P.M.

189-> Gen. Sidney Kirkman; Key Montgomery Aide
Gen. Sir Sidney Kirkman, described by his World War II commander, Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery, as ''the best artilleryman in the British Army,'' died Friday at the age of 87, his family reported. General Kirkman was Field Marshal Montgomery's chief gunnery officer in the crucial battle for Alamein in Egypt and was responsible for the blistering British barrage there that preceded it. The 1942 victory by Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army at Alamein was a turning point in the war, marking the beginning of the rout of the Nazis in Africa and subsequently in Western Europe. Field Marshal Montgomery, who died in 1976 at the age of 88, paid tribute to General Kirkman in his memoirs. General Kirkman was commissioned an officer in the Royal Artillery in 1915. In World War I he fought on the Western Front and won the Military Cross for bravery. He married in 1923 and had two sons.

Ray Perkins of the Giants won't have a coaching monopoly on local television much longer. Starting Jan. 9, area viewers will be able to tune in Herb Brooks, the head coach of the Rangers, who will be the host of a half-hour hockey show on Sunday evenings. The show, to be produced by the Madison Square Garden television network, is tentatively titled ''The World of Herb Brooks.'' Its main feature will be interviews with Ranger players and other guests, not only hockey people but people from other sports and from outside the sports realm. ''I'd rather have them call it 'The World of Ranger Hockey' or something like that, because it's not going to be focused on me,'' Brooks said yesterday. ''I want to get as many interesting people on there as I can, do some human-interest stories about people that the fans don't know, like Laura Stamm, our power-skating instructor. Or other coaches, or players from other sports, like Dave Winfield, who is a friend of mine. ''There are so many negative stories coming out of sports now - drugs, drinking, criminal behavior -and don't get me wrong, people who get involved in that sort of thing deserve all the bad publicity. But what I want to do is show all the positive things in sports.'' Michael Katz Lawrie Mifflin

194-> I.M.F. Supports Loan to Brazil
Brazil won official approval from the International Monetary Fund today for a $546.5 million loan at favorable interest rates. The loan is the first in what analysts expect to be a series of loans totaling $6 billion. Approval came from the fund's board of managing directors, which represents the fund's 146 member countries. The I.M.F. is taking a leading part in arranging loans to Mexico and Argentina, as well as Brazil, which are in acute financial trouble. In addition to its lending, the fund is pressing commercial banks to make loans. Brazil will pay the I.M.F. interest of only 6.6 percent a year. The loan is repayable in five years. Some of the rest of the $6 billion - fund spokesmen would not say how much - will carry considerably higher interest rates. It will be calculated at variable rates that depend on what commercial banks charge in the big industrial countries. Some details may be announced Thursday, when further word is expected on loans to Mexico.

195-> SCOUTING; Race to Stardom
Towering Inferno was minding his sheep in New South Wales when Tommy Woodcock noticed that he was a horse of the same color as Phar Lap. Towering Inferno no longer herds sheep; now he is a movie star, insured for $6 million, who this week is scheduled to finish his role as Phar Lap in a film about the thoroughbred race horse who died 50 years ago. Phar Lap, a 6-year-old gelding at the time of his death, was one of the greatest sports heroes in Australian history, although he was foaled in New Zealand. His death shocked Australia, coming only two weeks after his only appearance in the Americas, a smashing victory in the Agua Caliente Handicap in Mexico against a field of top American horses. After a 10,000-mile ocean voyage through tropical storms, Phar Lap had not only raced on dirt for the first time at Agua Caliente, he smashed the track record. The New York Times ran the story of Phar Lap's death, of a severe case of colic, on its front page. One Melbourne newspaper simply ran the headline: ''HE'S DEAD.'' The chestnut gelding was discovered dead on a California farm whose trees had just been sprayed with insect repellent and traces of arsenate of lead were found in the horse's body. Even now, there are Australians who still believe a myth, current then, that Phar Lap was murdered by American gangsters. The myth has long been dispelled. The film, which has one of the biggest budgets for motion pictures in Australian history, is scheduled for release sometime next year. ''The most difficult casting we had,'' said John Sexton, the producer, ''was for the horse.'' But Woodcock, who was Phar Lap's groom and later his trainer and is now an adviser on the film, settled on a nonthoroughbred chestnut, Towering Inferno, who even has Phar Lap's markings. ''His socks are right,'' said Woodcock after looking over Towering Inferno's ankles. Woodcock has no trouble remembering what Phar Lap looks like. The horse, stuffed and mounted, is prominently displayed at the Museum of Natural History in Melbourne.

197-> ENVIRONMENT GROUPS SUE U.S. OVER NEW RULES FOR WETLANDS
A group of 16 environmental organizations sued the Reagan Administration today in an effort to revoke new rules issued by the Army Corps of Engineers to ease regulation of the use of the country's fragile and rapidly disappearing wetlands. The suit, filed in the United States District Court here, charges that the new rules would ''substantially weaken Federal protection of the nation's wetlands'' as mandated by the Clean Water Act. The rules would exempt millions of acres of marshes, estuaries, tidelands, swamps, ponds, lakes, bogs, rivers and streams from the requirement that individual permits be obtained before they can be dredged or filled. Instead, the rules make it much easier for these activities to be conducted under ''national permits'' that do not require individual scrutiny by the corps before they are allowed to begin. Robert K. Dawson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army, said in a telephone interview today that the rules had been changed in recognition of the fact that the Corps of Engineers had ''limited manpower'' with which to regulate the use of the wetlands. The rules, he said, would ''diminish the intensity of regulation.'' But the environmental groups charged that the Administration ''is abandoning the nation's wetlands under the guise of regulatory reform.'' 'Trying to Write Them Off' Jay D. Hair, executive vice president of the National Wildlife Federation, one of the plaintiffs, said, ''Wetlands are some of the richest fish and wildlife habitat in this country, and the Reagan Administration is simply trying to write them off.'' Janet Welsh Brown, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, another plaintiff, said: ''These blanket permits are contrary to the overwhelming public support for protecting the integrity of our nation's waters, including wetlands. The Reagan Administration has abandoned the nation's wetlands just as it has abandoned countless other environmental imperatives.'' But Mr. Dawson insisted that ''the overall charge that we are abandoning responsibility for the nation's wetlands is just not true at all.'' He said that Federal oversight of the wetlands would continue but that it would be done more efficiently. Wetlands are important breeding grounds and habitat for a wide variety of wildlife. They also help preserve water quality by recycling pollutants and nutrients, recharge water supplies and act as a natural flood control by absorbing runoff. But the country's wetlands continue to diminish at the rate of over 300,000 acres a year in the face of human development. It is estimated that of all the wetlands that existed when the first Europeans reached America, only about 40 percent remain.

198-> DINU LIPATTI'S TALENT HIGHLIGHTS NEW PIANO DISKS
One of the profound artistic calamities of the 20th century was the early death, from leukemia, of the Rumanian pianist Dinu Lipatti. Only 33 when he died in 1950, he was recognized as a prodigious talent while still a child, and began his recording career at the age of 19. In his few remaining years, Mr. Lipatti made only a scant handful of recordings, yet these have guaranteed his posthumous reputation, as they are on a uniformly high level. Now Angel has distilled a four-record set (ZD 3924) from a more comprehensive seven-disk EMI/ Electrola reissue (IC-197-53780/86M; available from the German News Company) and has made it available on the American market. It is a fine package, and contains sterling performances of works by Bach, Mozart, Scarlatti, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel and Georges Enesco - the pianist's godfather. Mr. Lipatti's pianism combined a rare delicacy and grace with a rock-hard structural muscle, passion with a certain Olympian detachment. His repertory was limited - he was best known as a performer of Bach, Mozart and Chopin - but this was attributable to his uncompromisingly self-critical nature rather than any pianistic shortcomings. Until late in his life, Mr. Lipatti had never publicly performed the music of Beethoven: he claimed that he did not yet feel equal to the challenge. But what he chose to play, he played splendidly; although he was not a bravura pianist, and he shunned gratuitous showmanship, his technique was impeccable. The new Angel release contains quite a few of the most famous Lipatti recordings. Here is the celebrated 1948 rendition of Chopin's ''Barcarolle''; the pianist imparts an irresistible buoyancy to this limpid and evocative boat-song. And there is the great rendition of Mozart's Piano Concerto in C (K.467), recorded in performance with Herbert von Karajan. This precious souvenir was rescued from a live radio broadcast and released on disk some 10 years after Mr. Lipatti's death. Lipatti archivists will want to search for the imported set. The import contains studio performances of the Chopin waltzes, which remain, for many, still the most graceful and attractive renditions of these deceptively simple pieces. In addition, the EMI sevenrecord set contains distinguished readings of the Grieg and Schumann concertos, and a selection of Brahms waltzes arranged for four hands, in a charming rendition recorded in tandem with Mr. Lipatti's teacher and mentor, Nadia Boulanger. It should also be noted that the last Lipatti recital, recorded in France three months before he died, is still available in some shops as a two-record set on Angel (3556B), although it has been officially deleted from the catalogue. This recording captures an almost unbearably poignant moment for posterity, as Mr. Lipatti, mortally ill and shot full of cortisone, performed for a capacity audience fully cognizant of his condition. He falters only once, toward the end of his survey of the waltzes. After performing 13 waltzes, he could no longer muster the strength necessary to perform the final selection. So he substituted Myra Hess's piano arrangement of Bach's ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring.'' As the pianist's wife, Madeleine Lipatti, would later write: ''Broken by fatigue, scarcely breathing, Mr. Lipatti yet had the courage to play that Bach chorale, which, for him, was a prayer ....'' An earlier recording of this Bach work is available on both the European and domestic Lipatti reissues, and, in its rapt simplicity and awe, it represents the pianist's art at its pinnacle. An integral survey of the Chopin Nocturnes by Daniel Barenboim has just been issued by Deutsche Grammophon, and it is one of the finest records he has made (2741 012; two disks). Although there are some masterpieces among their number, the Nocturnes often present Chopin at his most formless and perishable. They do not have the structural and rhythmic vigor of the dance pieces, nor the complexities of the studies, nor the heroic scale of the Ballades and Scherzos, and we do not find in the Nocturnes the microcosm of varied emotions that so dazzles us in the Opus 28 Preludes. The Nocturnes represent Chopin at his most self-consciously poetic, most prettified; this is the Chopin of antiquated legend, the sickroom talent propped up at the piano, rolling his eyes heavenward. As a result, the Nocturnes need a clear-headed approach if they are to be fully effective; and self-indulgence on the part of a pianist will render them oversweet. Happily Mr. Barenboim plays straightforwardly, yet allows the music to breathe. He clearly understands the Nocturne's moody charms and his use of pedal is effective and spare. This is a complete set of the Nocturnes, containing several posthumous compositions, and those in search of a such a set will find Mr. Barenboim's recording most attractive. Sound and surfaces are first-rate. Peter Serkin's third recorded Chopin recital, just issued on RCA (ARC1 4356), is well worth acquiring. Mr. Serkin has put together a nice combination of well-known works and lesser known but worthy pieces, and this set contains recordings of three Mazurkas, the First Impromptu, the ''Andante Spinato and Grand Polonaise,'' the Third Ballade and the Nocturne in E flat,(Op. 55, No. 2). Mr. Serkin takes a generally classical, even elegant view of this music and it pays off. This is not to say that there is no passion to his playing, only that the passion is contained within a limited and literate structural framework. Mr. Serkin is not a pianist for histrionic excess; those who favor white-hot Chopin may wish to look elsewhere. But there is a cool intelligence and bright fire in these recordings. Mr. Serkin has a fresh conception of the Ballade in A flat, one with a good deal of spring and elasticity, and he takes an obvious joy in this music. The Mazurkas, while never betraying their humble roots as peasant dances, do not have the crudity with which they're sometimes imbued, and Mr. Serkin well understands that there is more than meets the ear in Chopin's miniatures. The Vietnamese pianist Dang Thai Son, who won first prize in the 1980 Warsaw Chopin Competition, has now produced his first recording, a Chopin recital. This disk, on DG (2531 359), cannot be recommended with much enthusiasm, as it reveals a talented artist still very much in the process of maturation. Mr. Dang was born in Hanoi in 1958 and grew up during the worst years of the Vietnam War. With such a difficult childhood, it is somewhat remarkable that he can play at all, let alone with such obvious technical finish. Yet there is little soul to his Chopin, and Chopin without temperament is Chopin slighted. These are well played but emotionally timid performances. A little restraint is usually beneficial to Chopin playing, but not in the case of Mr. Dang's recital. One also questions the wisdom of making a live recording, as it allowed the pianist no chance to tinker and perfect his ideas, and one can't escape the feeling that something - perhaps an understandable fear of missing a note - is holding him back. While there is much to admire here - a close attention to Chopin's contrapuntal writing and a dignified solemnity to some of the larger works - Mr. Dang's Chopin is currently rather prosaic. His career merits watching, but he cannot yet be said to be in a league with the best Chopin performers.

201-> INDIAN PT. REACTORS GET REPRIEVE
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 3 to 2 this evening to permit the Indian Point nuclear reactors to operate and to wait until an accident drill in March to determine whether deficiencies in emergency planning had been corrected. The commission had threatened to shut the plants if emergency planning were not improved. One member of the majority, however, John F. Ahearne, said that while he was voting to allow the plants to operate ''for now,'' he would vote to shut them after the March drill unless Rockland County, which has withdrawn from the planning process, came up with adequate plans of its own and unless enough bus drivers willing to work in a radiation emergency could be found in Westchester County. The two plants are in Westchester. The plants had been under a Dec. 3 deadline to correct 34 deficiencies found after a drill last March. On Dec. 17 the Federal agency said only two ''significant deficiencies'' remained. This evening's vote allows Indian Point 2, which is operated by the Consolidated Edison Company of New York, to resume operation as soon as technically possible. The plant was shut for refueling and repairs on Sept. 18 and is now ''in start-up testing, '' according to a company spokesman, Dan Walden. Indian Point 3, owned by the Power Authority of the State of New York, was closed by a steam generator accident in March and is not expected to reopen before February 1983. Today's debate on emergency planning is the latest in a series that began in 1979 after the reactor accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania. The N.R.C. eventually voted to require utilities and local and state governments to have for all nuclear plant sites workable plans to measure radiation in the surrounding area, to alert residents within 10 miles in the event of an emergency, to advise them to shelter themselves and to evacuate them if necessary. Penalties for noncompliance are against the nuclear power plants in the form of letters of reprimand, fines or suspension of licenses to operate.

204-> BOEING OFFERING NEW ANTI-ICING SYSTEM FOR 737'S
The Boeing Company has notified airlines that future twin-jet 737 planes will have an improved system designed to prevent wing icing while a plane is waiting to take off. It is also asking the airlines whether they wish to incorporate the improvement on 737's already in use. The cost of adding the system would be about $10,500 per plane, plus outlays for labor and flight time lost while the planes are in the shop. The change had been under study for months before an Air Florida 737 crashed in January while taking off from Washington National Airport in a snowstorm. However, that crash, which killed 78 persons, appears to have fortified Boeing's decision to offer the modification. In August, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigated the crash, recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration toughen its requirements for 737 takeoffs in weather likely to produce frost, snow or ice on the leading edges of wings. It urged the agency to issue an order requiring either that the antiice system be modified for routine use on the ground or that takeoff speeds be increased. Airlines are reluctant to increase takeoff speeds, saying that could require costly reductions of passenger or cargo loads on relatively short runways. Limits on New Orders The agency is expected to reject the idea of new requirements, at least for now. Its rationale, according to Government officials, is likely to be this: A mandatory order may legally be issued only when a plane is found to have a proven safety shortcoming. The Washington crash, and a series of close calls, would probably not have occurred had the crews followed the rule prohibiting takeoffs with frost, snow or ice on wings or control surfaces. Finally, there is no proof so far that the Boeing 737 is more vulnerable to wing ice than other airliners. One key to the Washington crash was that the plane had been exposed to a severe snowstorm for about 49 minutes while the crew awaited the plane's turn to take off. The safety board ruled that the main causes of the crash were the crew's failure to activate engine anti-icing systems; the decision to take off with snow or ice on the airfoils, and the captain's failure to abort the takeoff when his attention was called to abnormal readings on engine instruments. The failure to use engine anti-icing systems apparently caused blockage of engine probes, which in turn caused instruments to show proper takeoff power when the power was considerably lower, the board said. Other engine instruments had unusually low readings. The board listed as a contributing factor ''the known inherent pitch-up characteristics of the B-737 aircraft when the leading edge is contaminated with even small amounts of snow or ice.'' Incidents Date Back to 1970 The Boeing 737 generally carries 100 to 115 passengers on short-@ to medium-range runs. It has an excellent safety record. But fliers began to report trouble with takeoffs in icing conditions in 1970. The safety board reported it was aware of 22 incidents since then in which a plane either pitched up or rolled abruptly. Almost all the incidents occurred abroad. In November 1981, Boeing disclosed that it had proved the feasibility of improving the wing anti-ice system so that it could be used during ground operations and not just in the air. Routine ground use had not been provided for in the original design because of the danger of overheating the wing and sacrificing power on takeoff. With the improved system, overheating of wings will be prevented by use of new thermostat switches. The new system also will be rigged so that valves through which engine air is diverted will close automatically when throttles are advanced beyond a certain point used for takeoff.

205-> CHURCHES EXAMINE GENETIC RESEARCH
Christians often sing a hymn that says, ''New occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth,'' and nowhere is this more evident than in the field of social ethics and the new biological technology. A report issued recently by the National Council of Churches is expected to be a major stimulus to the discussion now taking shape in several religious bodies about genetic engineering, one of the thorniest areas of modern biotechnology. While affirming scientific inquiry, and stating that ''human inventiveness may enhance the lives of individuals and of societies,'' the report urges caution in genetic research, in which deoxyribonucleic acid, known as DNA, is broken down and combined to create new forms of plant and animal life. Rather than proposing specific ethical guidelines, the report focuses on the ''human values'' that should be considered by those involved in genetic research, and on the social consequences of the commercialization of scientific inquiry. Its authors suggested that the report become a base for a policy to be drawn up over the coming years. Two-Year Study of Issues Twenty of the panel's 25 members were appointed by the 32 Protestant and Eastern Orthodox denominations that make up the council. The other five were members of the council's staff. Over a two-year period, the study team, headed by Bishop James Crumley of the Lutheran Church in America, met with scientists, doctors and representatives of pharmaceutical companies, as well as with members of Government agencies and consumer groups monitoring science and technology. The report raises questions about whether cloning of human beings can ever be ethical. The social effects of the research should be of as much concern to Christian thinkers as the research itself, the panel concluded. Of special concern to the panel was whether unchecked research and development in genetic engineering might prove unjust by limiting the benefits of such research to countries and people able to pay for it, and whether there are broad risks to the environment by bringing new species into being. Major scientific advances such as the development of Copernican astronomy and Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, always cause Christians to ''rethink our scheme of the universe and the subsequent role of humanity in it,'' the 12,500-word report said. ''The church has taught that we are created in the image of God, endowed with prodigious intelligence and commissioned to exercise careful dominion over all of nature, including ourselves.'' ''It is the dangers of human creativity which must impose limits upon the glories of human powers,'' the panel concluded. The most specific prohibition suggested in the study paper is in a section on the cloning of human beings, which in the current state of the art is very far from a possibility and may never come about, and certain kinds of gene-splicing of animal and human cells. ''We know of no existing laws or regulations to prohibit such experiments,'' the panel said, adding, ''We know of no goal legitimate enough to warrant such radical experimentation.'' But when such experiments are technically feasible, the panel said, ''it is possible someone might attempt them.'' Factors to Be Weighed Ethical thinking about genetic engineering should consider the sacredness of human life, the interdependence of life systems, the goals of research and its effects on the environment, the participation of the public in deciding the course of the research and the just distribution of the benefits of the investigation, the panel said. Noting that scientists had already considered the risks of genetic research, the panel members urged caution because, they said, unfettered experimentation or the newly created life forms might threaten the balance of nature. Voluntary self-regulation is not enough, the panel said. The panel said modern research raised new concern about the possibility of improper medical experimentation. A major section of the study paper was devoted to the social consequences of research. It is just, the study paper said, for inventors to profit from their research. But the panel expressed concern about growing commercialism in the field of biology. ''Some people worry that many scientists will focus on the development of commercially useful products'' to the ''detriment of important, but not immediately profitable basic research.'' Thus, the panel said, some research might be considered unethical if, in the rush for profits and patents, corporations involved in biological engineering ignore human need or limit the benefits of the research. The panel also expressed concern about developments in patent law, which allows the products of gene splicing, the technique used in genetic engineering, to be patented. Along with the commercialization of science, patenting laws tend to restrict the flow of information among the scientific community, as researchers seek to protect their discoveries. Those involved in the panel say their conclusions are tentative because churches are relatively new to the field. But, investigation of the new problems in bioethics, specifically genetic engineering, will continue, said Rena Yocom of Prairie Village, Kan., who drafted the panel's report. ''Since God is the ultimate creator of life,'' she said, ''we have to keep asking ourselves what our new ability to alter life really means.''

209-> DeLorean Co.
The Northern Ireland police are investigating the finances of John Z. DeLorean's bankrupt auto plant in Belfast, the British Government announced today. The Times of London reported that the receiver, Sir Kenneth Cork, had found evidence of missing funds. The paper said that ''the amount is believed to be large.'' The Government announcement came in a reply by Adam Butler, a junior minister for Northern Ireland, to a question raised in the House of Commons over reported gaps in the company's accounts. Mr. Butler said that since the company had been in receivership, inquiries were made into ''the conduct of the DeLorean business.'' He said information that had been collected was turned over to the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's police force. A few hours before Mr. DeLorean was arrested in Los Angeles on Oct. 19 on charges of cocaine trafficking, the British Government announced it was shutting down the DeLorean Motor Company.

210-> GOING OUT GUIDE
BOOK AND BOTTLE The most ancient of cultures is housed in the most modern of buildings at the Asia Society, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street (288-6400), and the thrill of arts that flourished in Asia awaits the New Yorker there. In the main-floor gallery, through Jan. 2, a breathtaking assortment of nearly 90 paintings, drawings, manuscripts and calligraphy catches the eye. ''The Islamic Book: The Collection of Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan'' ranges widely, from colorfully stirring depictions of gods and legends to small and delicate drawings showing Europeans in Asia, all created between the 9th and 19th centuries and all drawn from the Islamic world between North Africa and India. Here are dragon slayers and birds right out of ''The Arabian Nights'' that carry hapless people away. There are the richly decorated writings in the beautifully flowing manner that only the Arab script allows. It all takes time to absorb. Downstairs, the showcases are lined with 200 small but special Chinese snuff bottles from the collection of the late Edward Choate O'Dell and assembled by John Ford of the Snuff Bottle Society. There are sections for bottles in jade, metal, ceramic, coral, ivory, mother of pearl, amber and glass. They date from the 1600's, when snuff became common in the Manchu court. The cleverness of the bottles is apparent in the wildly different themes fashioned on these small containers. Some have entire scenes of Chinese life, others display figures of animals or people, and still others show just a face. Through Nov. 28. Open 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesdays through Saturdays (to 8:30 P.M. Thursdays), and from noon to 5 Sundays. Gallery admission: $2; students, $1. GUEST SHOT Billy Taylor, the composer, conductor and jazz pianist, is a man who has long been articulate in his belief that jazz is classical music. He will be filling in for Bobby Short for five nights at the Cafe Carlyle, 76th Street and Madison Avenue (744-1600). Mr. Short, a semifixture at the Carlyle, will be playing concerts elsewhere tonight, next Friday, Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday, and Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. Mr. Taylor takes over those nights, with Victor Gaskin on bass and Keith Copeland on percussion. Although Mr. Taylor has performed in many rooms in town in the course of many years, this is his debut at the Carlyle. Shows at 10 P.M. and midnight. There's a $15 cover, no minimum. Main course, $9 to $18.50. Drinks, $3.50 up. OPENING Two new shows open tomorrow in the galleries of the International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Avenue, at 94th Street (860-1783), marking the center's eighth birthday. In keeping with the birthday tradition of featuring a show of work by a living photographer, one exhibition is of photos made by Jacques-Henry Lartigue. He has been a professional artist since 1918, but he also has dedicated himself to photography, and in this show there are 140 pictures that Mr. Lartigue took between 1902 and 1939. The other exhibition, ''A Day in the Life of Australia,'' grew out of a project that unleashed 100 photojournalists on the continent last Dec. 6 and had them point their cameras at whatever seized their interest, which turned out to be just about everything. The show at the center is a sampling of the 96,000 photographs that were made. Open, through Jan. 9, from noon to 8 Tuesdays through Thursdays and from noon to 6 P.M. Fridays through Sundays. Admission: $2; those over 65 and students, $1. RERUNS Six Yiddish films made in the United Staes will be shown, with English subtitles, over six Sundays at the Squat Theater, 256 West 23d Street (691-1238), presented by Miriam/Lillian Films. The first, to be shown tomorrow at noon, 2, 4 and 6 P.M., is a classic, ''Tevye,'' Maurice Schwartz's 1940 adaptation of Sholom Aleichem's short stories about the long-suffering and articulate milkman and his family and the shtetl that was their hometown. Being shown next Sunday is ''The Singing Blacksmith,'' a 1918 film that starred Moishe Oysher. On Dec. 5, the film is a comic musical, ''Americaner Schadchen.'' ''Eli,Eli,'' with Irving Jacobson and Esther Fields, made in 1940, appears on Dec. 12. Dec. 19: ''Motel, the Operator,'' a 1940 melodrama with Chaim Tauber and Seymour Rechtzeit. On Dec. 26, ''God, Man and Devil,'' (1950), one of the last Yiddish films made here, ends the run. Admission: $3; over-65's, $2 at noon screenings. Information on films: 763-5950.

211-> COUPLE LAW ASKED FOR SAN FRANCISCO
A proposed ordinance supported by San Francisco's large homosexual community would create a new class of ''domestic partners,'' allowing live-in lovers to be covered by the city's employee insurance programs. The measure, already passed by a vote of 8 to 3 in its first reading, would make San Francisco the first city to recognize unmarried domestic partners as having rights now reserved for husbands and wives. The proposal, offered by the Board of Supervisors' only member who has declared that he is homosexual, will come up for final passage Monday. Mayor Dianne Feinstein has not taken a public position on the measure, but, given its present support on the board, it could be passed over her veto. No moral questions were raised in the board's debate. Opponents questioned the greater costs that might arise. But The San Francisco Examiner editorialized last Sunday against the proposal, saying that ''the notion that an unmarried relationship is the equivalent of marriage is an attack on social norms.'' 'National Attention' Predicted The editorial predicted that the proposal would draw ''lots of national attention to San Francisco,'' and warned that ''the supervisors should not make a colossal mistake out of fear of some lost votes in the future.'' The measure would cover unmarried heterosexual domestic arrangements as well as those for homosexuals. But, in the context of San Francisco politics, people here assume that the proposed ordinance was tailored for the latter group. The proposal says those eligible to use it would be ''two individuals'' who declare they are domestic partners living together and sharing ''the common necessities of life,'' but who are not married or related. Each partner must be over 18 years of age. The ordinance would provide that the term ''domestic partnerships'' be used interchangeably with ''marriage'' in deciding qualification for benefits. Under the measure, ''domestic partners'' would declare and legitimatize their relationship by filing a formal, sworn statement with the San Francisco County Clerk. A filing fee of $23 would be charged, of which $13 would be used to finance a ''domestic violence program.'' Six-Month Waiting Period Termination notices similarly filed for a $5 fee and mailed to the other partner would end the relationship, but no new partner could be claimed through a new filing until six months after notice of the earlier termination. If the ordinance is passed, it would be administered by the City Human Rights Commission. Supervisor Harry Britt, who introduced the measure Nov. 9, described it as ''a significant redefinition of the law'' because it would give ''legal recognition to the relationships between lesbians and between gay men.'' The proposal would affect only city employees, but its backers hope that it will encourage other employers to change their employee benefit programs along the same lines. The city subsidizes health insurance for employees, who are able to buy coverage themselves for dependents at a reduced rate. Dependents of ''domestic partners'' will not be afforded such coverage, however. An Important Political Force The size of the city's homosexual population has not been measured. But the generally accepted estimate is that homosexuals make up about 15 percent of San Francisco's 680,000 residents. The 1980 census showed that 53 percent of the city's households were nonfamily, compared with 27 percent nationally and 37 percent in New York. Many of these were divorced people or heterosexuals who were not yet married, and many others were elderly people whose spouses had died. However, the proposed ordinance was tailored for homosexuals, who have become an important political force since they organized in the mid-1970's behind Harvey Milk, a homosexual who was elected to the Board of Supervisors and was shot to death four years ago today by Dan White, a political rival who also killed Mayor George Moscone. Mayor Feinstein's election in 1979 was attributed by political writers here to her support by homosexuals. She appointed Supervisor Britt to succeed Mr. Milk, and her opponent in the mayoral race was Supervisor Quentin Kopp, who cast one of the three votes against the measure in its first reading.

212-> AROUND THE NATION; Hawaii Hurricane Path Declared Disaster Area
President Reagan today declared the section of Hawaii struck by Hurricane Iwa a major disaster area, clearing the way for Federal agencies to help thousands of residents on Kauai, Niihau and Oahu to restore theirs homes and businesses. The Presidential action, taken at the request of Gov. George Ariyoshi of Hawaii, came as the first detailed list of damage was released for Oahu Island, including Honolulu. The Red Cross figures show at least 6,391 homes, 21 hotels and two condominium buildings were left with major or minor damage by the hurricane that struck Tuesday with winds of 110 miles an hour. A detailed damage list from Kauai was not expected until Sunday. The preliminary combined total of damage for Kauai and Oahu, estimated by the Hawaii civil defense organization, stood at $143 million.

213-> FED USES RATE AS POLICY SIGNAL
Under Paul A. Volcker, the present chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, the discount rate, which was lowered half a percentage point today, to 9 percent, has become the Fed's subtle -and sometimes not so subtle - signal of current policy. The rate is a lever,in the short term, that the Fed can use to move interest rates in the direction that its basic policy is heading. If the targets are the rocket, the reserves are the rocket engines and the discount rates are the thrusters that enable small changes in direction. The discount rate is the interest that the Federal Reserve charges on the loans it makes to banks and other financial institutions. The loans are used by some banks and thrift institutions to help meet the reserve levels that the Fed requires be maintained to back up deposits. Little Effect on Rates A change in the discount rate does make these borrowings more or less expensive. But because these discount window borrowings are small by comparison to the total reserves kept by banks and thrift institutions, a change in this cost has little effect on interest rates. The impact of the discount rate is based on the financial markets' growing dependence on it as a signal of the Fed's policy intentions. And since this summer, when interest rates began to decline, some market analysts contend that the discount rate has become an even more important signal because of problems that have developed with the once closely watched M-1 money supply number, which includes currency in circulation and checking accounts. In mid-October, the Fed acknowledged the problems associated with interpreting this weekly figure and said it would temporarily abandon it as a guide for policy, concentrating instead on the monthly M-2 measure, which includes M-1 and savings accounts and money market funds. ''The discount rate is a key way to communicate policy,'' said Allen Sinai of Data Resources Inc., a Massachusetts economic consulting concern. ''The discount rate is the only way the Fed can intervene and speed up the process,'' said Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ''The discount rate is 90 percent a signal,'' said Frederick W. Deming, senior vice president and economist for the Chemical Bank in New York. Mr. Sinai argues that the Fed has been using the discount rate aggressively since the summer to lead interest rates down. But other analysts, including some officials at the Fed, will only say that the Fed's actions have helped ''accelerate'' the decline in rates. And others at the Fed will argue that the Fed is just ''following'' a decline in interest rates. ''In the past the discount rate has been a follower,'' Mr. Deming said. ''There is some hope now that it is leading. What the market wants is a signal that the Fed is going to continue to be accommodative.'' Dropped in Six Slices Since the recent round of cuts began in July, the discount rate has dropped to 9 percent from 12 percent in six slices of half a percentage point each. And since then, six-month Treasury bill rates have fallen to 8.1 percent from 11.48 percent. The prime lending rate has fallen to 12 percent from a range of 16 to 16 1/2 percent. And the Dow Jones industrial average, responding to the drop in rates and the prospect of an economic recovery, has risen, with a few relapses, to 1,021.25 from 826.10. But despite all the attention it gets, the discount rate is still not the Fed's principal tool for setting monetary policy over the long term. That remains the Fed's annual growth rate target ranges and its operations aimed at controlling this growth rate by either supplying or draining reserves from the banking system. And Fed officials, who pride themselves on secrecy and their adherence to their tough anti-inflation policy, often do not like the way the markets interpret a move in the discount rate, especially when analysts contend that the Fed is pushing interest rates up or down. But officials do acknowledge that there are two general explanations of why the Fed would move the discount rate. The first is the intentional announcement effect, when the Fed, by a move in the discount rate, is signaling a move in policy, such as with the jumps in the discount rate in February 1980 - the first clear signal of the anti-inflation policy it instituted that year. Follows Changes in Other Rates More often, however, Fed officials say the Fed changes the discount rate to follow changes in other interest rates, especially the socalled Federal funds rate, the interest charged on overnight loans between banks. When this is done, the Fed often says it is affirming a drop or rise in interest rates that has already occurred. Analysts often say that the Fed is ''getting out of the way'' of further declines in interest rates. But although the Fed watches the spread between the Fed funds rate and the discount rate closely in making its decision, there is no automatic point of change. When rates have gone up, the discount rate has stayed below the funds rate. When they have declined, the spread has narrowed, with the funds rate sometimes being the same and sometimes lower when the Fed moved.

215-> Arizona State Is Upset
Arizona upset Arizona State, 28-18, tonight, preventing Arizona State from going to the Rose Bowl. Arizona State's loss meant that U.C.L.A. won the Pacific 10 Conference title and a Rose Bowl berth against Michigan (8-3). U.C.L.A. finished the regular season with a 5-1-1 conference record, 9-1-1 over all. Arizona State is 5-2 and 9-2. The Sun Devils now will be the host to Oklahoma (8-3) in the Fiesta Bowl on New Year's Day. Arizona finished at 4-3-1 and 6-4-1. The loss was Arizona State's first in four years to Arizona. The Wildcats scored 16 points in the first 4 minutes 45 seconds of the third quarter to open a 26-0 lead. Tom Tunnicliffe, Arizona's quarterback, completed 12 of 19 passes for 270 yards. He passed for two touchdowns, 92 yards to Brian Holland in the second quarter and 65 yards to Brad Anderson in the third. Holland also ran 1 yard for a touchdown.

216-> CONDOMINIUMS TAKE THE LEAD
ON EAST 47th Street at Second Avenue a new residential building called Dag Hammarskjold Tower is under construction. It is a condominium. On West 61st Street near Lincoln Center another residential tower, the Beaumont, is nearing completion. It also is a condominium. And on East 22d Street, on the southern edge of Madison Park, still another tower residence, Madison Green, is under construction. It, too, is a condominium. Condominium apartment buildings have become the dominant form of new residential construction in Manhattan, replacing both the rental building and the cooperative, according to bankers, developers and others in the real-estate industry. And in other boroughs where new housing in multifamily buildings is under construction, the condominium also is the most common form. Why are these new buildings being developed as condominiums rather than as rentals or as cooperatives, the traditional forms for apartments in New York? Developers, lenders and other real-estate leaders offer this explanation: New rental construction has long been in decline because rentstabilization has limited the income of buildings while the costs of operating them have been uncontrolled in an inflationary environment. But a new factor affecting both rentals and cooperatives came into play when interest rates began their upward surge late in the 1970's. In both forms, the building's primary mortgage is a fixed-rate, long-term loan, and many lenders who held such mortgages when interest rates began to soar determined not to be caught in such a squeeze again. Now, if they will lend at all for residential projects, they insist on short terms and variable rates, thereby passing the risks on to borrowers. The higher financing costs make most rental housing unthinkable because of the extraordinary rents that would have to be charged. And a co-op built today would have to impose such high monthly charges to cover the high interest cost of its mortgage that apartments might not be salable. Both kinds of projects carry great risks for developers. Rather than take those risks, they are favoring condominiums, in which the building itself has no mortgage, but each apartment owner carries a mortgage on his own apartment. ''The trend in new construction is strongly toward condominiums,'' said Jerome Steiker, senior vice president of Sonnablick-Goldman Corporation, the mortgage brokerage concern. Yale Robbins, president of Yale Robbins Inc., real-estate consultants, concurred. ''I think you're going to see a lot more condominiums built,'' he said. ''That is what the development community is interested in now.'' According to a report compiled the Robbins company, the value of the new condominiums now being offered on the market in Manhattan is $750 million. The report identified 10 new buildings, with from 50 to 263 apartments, with costs that average more than $175 a square foot. In some buildings, the prices exceed $500 a square foot. CONDOMINIUM prices declined in September for the third straight month, for a total drop of almost 2 percent since last December, the report found. But Mr. Robbins said the decline might be ending because the current drop in interest rates may bring more buyers intot he market. Prior to the current activity, the city had 1.9 million housing units, of which 4,000 were condominiums and 100,000 were cooperatives. The current wave of construction will nearly double the number of condominiums in Manhattan by the end of 1983, Mr. Robbins said. He added that the trend should continue for the foreseeable future because long-term mortgages still are difficult to obtain and construction costs are likely to remain high. Others pointed out that for the foreigners who constitute a large part of the market for the super-luxury apartments being developed in Manhattan, the condominium is the preferred and more familiar form of ownership. In addition, condominiums are often the only kind of apartment ownership open to corporations because the boards of many cooperatives will not permit companies to buy into their buildings. ''You won't see any financing for co-op construction,'' said Bruce Berger, developer of an 86-unit condominium at 309 East 49th Street. ''The financing will be short-term and at a variable rate, and you won't be able to predict what the rate will be. For a developer, that means condo development is the only way to go.'' Mr. Berger's view was echoed by other developers, but lending officers at Citibank and the Seamen's Savings Bank of New York, said that loans for co-op projects were still available at their institutions. Of the 57 condominium projects filed with the Attorney General's Office since 1980, 25 are being built in Manhattan, and they are the most-expensively priced. But condominium construction and conversion also is occurring in Queens and Staten Island -generally in the form of town-house and garden-apartment units. Edward Kalikow of Sidney Kalikow & Sons, which is building two condominium projects with more than 200 units in Queens, said about 2,000 new or converted condominium units are coming on the market there. ''This isn't Manhattan,'' he said. ''You won't find any apartments going for $800,000. But the market in Queens is very strong.'' The income-tax benefits for owners of cooperatives and condominiums are the same - both may deduct payments for real-estate taxes and mortgage interest from their taxable income. The difference is that the owner of a condominium makes these payments directly while in a co-op the cooperative corporation makes the payments and advises the tenants of their share. Condominiums are thought to be easier for an owner to sell because buyers do not have to pass the rigorous review and approval procedures demanded by some co-op boards. On the other hand, that review process may provide greater assurance to co-op owners of quiet, fiscally responsible neighbors.

217-> NINE PUBLISHERS SUE N.Y.U., CHARGING COPYRIGHT VIOLATION
Nine major publishers filed suit yesterday against New York University, 10 of its faculty members and an off-campus copy center, charging them with copyright infringement. The suit, financed by the Association of American Publishers, is the association's first legal action aimed directly at universities and faculty members accused of violating the 1976 Copyright Act. In April 1980 several members of the association won a suit against the Gnomon Corporation, a photocoyping service with outlets near several college campuses, forcing them to cease and desist. 'Not Necessarily the Worst' Carol Risher, who handles copyright issues for the association, said that N.Y.U. is not necessarily the worst violator but is ''representative'' of schools that violate the copyright act. She added that, ''Universities must recognize that they have a responsibility for what their employes and faculty members do, and the faculty members must recognize their individual responsibilities as well.'' Andrew Schaffer, the university's vice president and general counsel, said late yesterday he was aware that a lawsuit had been filed against the university but he was unable to comment because he had not yet received a copy of the complaint. However, many educators regard the law governing copyrighted material as vague and confusing. The suit, which seeks all appropriate revenues under the Copyright Act, was filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York. It accuses the defendants of ''engaging in the unauthorized and unlawful reproduction, anthologizing, distribution and sale of the publisher's copyrighted work,'' and it is intended as a warning to other educational institutions. Townsend Hoopes, president of the publishers association, said its purpose ''is to bring a stop to this illegal practice. The A.A.P. hopes that the suit will make the academic community aware that they are violating the law so that they will change their photocopying practices. A.A.P. member publishers will vigorously enforce their rights.'' The association has already begun to enforce copright compliance in other areas. Last month it announced an out-of-court settlement with E.R. Squibb & Sons, which eight publishers had accused of infringing upon their copyrights by its photocopying practices of certain scientific journals. The agreement involved procedures for reporting and paying fees for photocopying, even for articles used for research purposes within the company, to the nonprofit Copyright Clearance Center, established four years ago in Salem, Mass., by representatives of publishers, corporate libraries and authors to provide ''after-the-fact'' authorization to copy certain materials in return for royalty payments. Many Violations Cited Parker Ladd, director of the association's college division, which initiated the litigation, said the suit had been filed in hope of halting the growing number of copyright violtions over the last five years. ''Off-campus copy mills illegally copy material from textboks at the request of college faculty,'' he said. ''Copy centers then sell the copied material to students. This practice of copyright infringement is hurting authors who are not getting their royalties and publishers who are not receiving their copyright fees. College publishers are not willing to stand by passively while their market is eroded by this type of copyright infringement.'' He added that most academic people probably do not deliberately violate the law, they do so mostly out of ignorance of the law, but they nevertheless deprive authors of a livelihood and in the long run adversely affect the quality of publishing. The suit was filed by Jon Baumgarten, former general counsel of the United States Copyright Office. Mr. Baumgarten heads the Washington office of Paskus, Gordon & Hyman, a New York law firm. The plaintiffs are Addison Wesley, Alfred A. Knopf, Basic Books, Houghton Mifflin, Little Brown, Macmillan, the National Association of Social Workers, Random House and Simon & Schuster. Origin of the Suit Earlier this month the association revealed plans to file such a suit, but it did not name the university or the faculty members. At that time, Allan Wittman, chairman of the association's copyright committee, said that the suit would seek to demonstrate that colleges and universities need policies governing the use of copyrighted materials. He said individuals would be included in the suit because there are many professors ''who will defend their right to royalties from their own ideas, but when they are stealing from someone else, they have no respect.'' Irwin Karp, attorney for the Author's League, said, ''With high speed xeroxgraphy or other reproduction, it is possible to prepare a custom made anthology of copyrighted materials -books or serious journals - without paying a royalty. In some classes, the primary material consists of just that.'' The suit names the Unique Copy Center, 252 Greene Street, between Eighth Street and Waverly Place, and the following faculty members: Martin Hamburger, Phyllis Mervis, Thelma B. Chesney, Terri Schultz, Robert Sklar, J. Rosen, Stuart Johnson, Robert Sharp, Sherman Barr and William G. Simon.

218-> CRAFTS; NEW LUSTER FOR ESSEX
MILLBURN COLLECTORS, interior designers and browsers can welcome the recent opening of the Sheila Nussbaum Gallery in the upbeat business section of this Essex County suburb. (Essex County, incidentally, now has more galleries that carry fine crafts than any other section of the state). The inaugural presentation introduces, among an impressive ''stable'' of artists who will be regularly represented, many whose work has not previously been available in New Jersey. It reflects a serious search around the country for things that are fresh to this area, and yet consistent with the director's taste. In this initial show, the focus is on ceramics, jewelry and glass. The gallery, which bears the director's name, also carries paintings, sculpture and graphics. Sharing the space, but in a separate section, are a silk-flower boutique called Glory's Corner and a custom frame department. A schedule of shows spotlighting particular artists in different media will start next month. The clean, uncluttered setting underscores Mrs. Nussbaum's selection of objects that tend toward a classical direction; there is nothing here that is faddish or flamboyant. The sophisticated, allwhite interior and appointments designed by Martin Holub, a Manhattan architect, have brought distinction and maximum efficiency to an ordinary deep, narrow store. Altogether, the ambience communicates a strong professional commitment to the enterprise. On entering, visitors immediately will encounter a group of large, full-bodied stoneware vessels by Claude Conover, whose work is in the collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Everson Museum in Syracuse and the American Craft Museum in New York City. These monumental works in earthen tones, with textures rolled on with special tools, stand on their own as sculptures. However, they come with removable plastic cylinders, and thus can also serve as flower urns. The selection of glass emphasizes works that are directly derived from the glass-blowing process and which exploit the material's ability to interact with light. The assortment of jewelry is particularly wide. For example, for $300 there are pins (they double as pendants) by Carol Herman in which intricate patterns in cloisonne are combined with areas of woven strips; nearby, for only $15, are similarly colored porcelain pins with inlaid rhinestones as a playful touch. The combination of fine-arts and crafts asserts their ornate compatibility. It also points up the fact that, for less than $1,000, one can find in sculpture that which is tasteful and competent, but in crafts that which touches the innovative edge. The Sheila Nussbaum Gallery is at 358 Millburn Avenue. Hours are 10 A.M. to 5 P.M., Tuesday through Saturday, or by appointment. Three events designed to attract early holiday shoppers are scheduled next weekend in Essex, Hunterdon and Bergen Counties. ''The New Jersey Craft Experience,'' a fair that will take place for the first time, will be held at the South Mountain Arena in West Orange. More than l00 selected crafts people will exhibit and sell their wares. With a number of annual fairs already being held in the state throughout the year, one might well ask why another one is needed. ''New Jersey is a good area for crafts,'' explained Janet Rose, who with her husband, Howard, is promoting the event under the corporate name of Rose Squared Productions. ''We felt there would be an audience for a small fair in good physical facilities - a fair with quality crafts at a range of prices that many people can afford.'' In jewelry, the dominant item, prices will run from around $15 for pieces in inlaid wood to around $600 for gold and silver necklaces. The Roses, who are potters from Hillsborough, will be among some 50 exhibitors from New Jersey. Another large proportion will come from New York, while a few will be from as far away as Maine and California. A scan of the participants indicates that artisans in clay, wood, leather, fiber, metal and glass will include some who specialize in pipes, bamboo flutes, sheepskin accessories, mirrors and toys. There also will be prints and photographs. The fair will be open Friday from 5 to 10 P.M., Saturday from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. and next Sunday from 10 to 6 P.M. Admission at all times is $2.50 a person; children under 10 will be admitted free if accompanied by an adult. The South Mountain Arena is at 560 Northfield Avenue, in front of the Turtle Back Zoo. The Hunterdon Gallery of Fine Crafts will occupy the Town Pump Building in Sergeantsville next weekend in conjunction with ''Thanksgiving in the Country,'' an annual tour of significant old and new structures. The bus tour through the area, which boasts New Jersey's one remaining covered bridge, is for the benefit of Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. More than 30 craftsmen from Hunterdon County and adjacent areas will be represented in an impromptu gallery set up in the empty Victorian-era store at the crossroads of Routes 523 and 604. (Its present name was the title of a shop, not a water source.) Works will include enamel jewelry by Bob and Rose Ann Place, ikat wall hangings by Pam Richardson, woven garments by Joan Wortis, leather items by Kathleen and Donald Hopkins and ceramics by Barbara Schaff. A few doors away, at the ''Sunflower Studio,'' Karen Caldwell, who organized the show with her husband, Geoff, will demonstrate how they make jewel-like designs in beveled glass. Among the six buildings on the tour will be a 1750 house with a stone barn, a church built in 1947 and a two-year-old house with Colonial woodwork and microwave ovens. The craft gallery will open with a wine-and-cheese reception Friday from 7 to 10 P.M. and will continue through Saturday and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. ''Thanksgiving in the Country,'' which is based in Sergeantsville, will cost $7.50 for adults and $1 for children under 12. Information: (609) 397-3214. Forty nationally known craft artists will be represented at ''Art of Our Time,'' an exhibition and sale opening Saturday and continuing through Nov. 17 at Temple Emanuel, 87 Overlook Drive, Woodcliff Lake. Over the years, this annual show, which is sponsored by the Pascack Valley Hadassah, has maintained a commitment toward crafts on a collectible level, as well as painting and sculpture. Works will include baskets by Jane Sauer and Douglas Fuchs, ceramics by Nancee Meeker, Renee Murray and Barbara Grygutis, fiber works by Ruth Geneslaw and Carol Schwartzott, glass by Bill Slade and leather by Joseph and Betty Ann Morris. There also will be a large selection of jewelry. On Saturday, when the show will be open from 8 to 11:30 P.M., the minimum donation will be $30 a person; next Sunday (1:30 to 9 P.M.), it will be $15. From Nov. 15 through 17 (1:30 to 5 P.M. and 7:30 to 10 P.M.), the fee will be $1.50. Events Calendar Today through Nov. 30: ''A Body of Work,'' Ocean County Artists Guild, Ocean and Chestnut Avenues, Island Heights. Works in clay and fiber, with the human body as a focal point, by Carol Ventura and Katie Stacy. Hours: 1 to 4 P.M., daily. Today through Dec. 12: ''The Ultimate Cookie Jar,'' Nabisco Gallery, River Road and DeForest Avenues, East Hanover. National juried exhibition of contemporary cookie jars in various craft media and a collection of antique biscuit jars. Hours: Noon to 4 P.M., daily. Friday and Saturday: ''Crafts in Progress,'' Riverside Square Mall, Hackensack. Continuous demonstrations by members of the Northwest Bergen Craft Guild. Hours: Friday, 10 A.M. to 9:30 P.M.; Saturday, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M.

219-> Market Place; Protecting Paper Profits
IF there is anything more frustrating for investors in stocks than losing money on poor investment choices, it is picking the right ones and then watching large paper profits vanish in a general market retreat. Today, there are two good reasons for investors to worry about protecting their unrealized, or paper, profits, aside from the usual uncertainties of the marketplace. One, obviously, is that the strong market advance since last August has given many investors sufficiently large paper profits to worry about. The other concern is that tax selling becomes pronounced in the last two weeks of December as many individual investors unload unprofitable stocks to offset tax liabilities on gains taken this year. Also, many institutional investors sell stocks to convert paper profits into cash to dress up their performance records for the quarter and full year. Whether or not these ''technical factors'' will depress the market in the next two weeks, many investors can protect their paper profits by buying stock option puts on their holdings. An option put gives the holder the right to sell 100 shares of the underlying stock at a specified strike price before a fixed deadline. The cost of the put - the premium - depends on the time left before the option expires, the strike price and the prospects that the underlying stock has in rising or falling before it expires. Put options are traded on a number of exchanges along with calls, which give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy shares under the same conditions. Suppose an investor has a handsome profit on, say, International Business Machines, and wants to hold on to that stock. Perhaps the I.B.M. was bought on margin and the investor fears a temporary market decline would force a premature sale. By buying puts, which is a form of selling the stock short, the investor would make money on the option if I.B.M. declines. This profit should offset most if not all of the paper loss on the actual shares owned. Because I.B.M. is one of several hundred blue chips in which active put - and call - options are traded, there are many strike prices and premiums to choose from. For example, I.B.M. traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange yesterday at 95 1/8, while an April 1983 put option with a strike price of 95 was selling at a premium of 7 1/4. This meant that, for an ''insurance'' premium of $725 per 100 shares, plus commission, the investor could protect against a decline in 100 actual shares from the then market price of 95 1/8. Assuming that I.B.M. moves higher, the put buyer can sell it and recoup a portion of the premium and write off whatever loss on the option against tax liabilities. If I.B.M. shares were to plunge, the investor could deliver the actual stock against the put and use the profits on the puts to offset the loss on the actual stock. Stock options are available at various strike prices. In the I.B.M. example, the active April put strike prices yesterday ranged from 60, which traded at a premium of one-eighth of a point, with others at 5-point stages up to 100 that then had a premium of 10 1/4. Besides April, the other months being traded were January and July 1983. ''This form of hedging against portfolio losses offers several other advantages to conservative or nervous investors,'' said Michael Schwartz, partner in L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, and a specialist in stock options trading. ''For one, the hedger receives all dividends paid on the shares. Buying puts also reduces the exposure of investors who buy stocks on margin. The use of margin leverage increases the return on investment.'' While buying stock on margin requires a cash payment of 50 percent of the market price, buyers of puts and calls must pay the full premium, Mr. Schwartz added. Another advantage of puts is that they can be used to convert short-term captial gains into long-term ones for tax purposes and thus reduce the tax bite when holdings are sold at a profit. ''If an investor buys puts and an equivalent amount of stock on the same day and identifies the puts in his records as a hedge against the actual shares purchased, the holding period for the actual stock is unaffected,'' Mr. Schwartz said, ''The notation in the investors' records could read 'such and such stock to be used to deliver if puts are exercised' or some similar wordage.'' But if the put hedge is altered by, for example, the sale of the put or its expiration, and the investor buys a second put on stock not held for more than 12 months, ''the holding period already accrued will be eliminated,'' he added. If the actual stock has been held for more than 12 months prior to the second put, it would not affect the holding period. Investors who plan to use puts - or calls - to convert short-term capital gains into long-term ones should keep careful records and consult with their brokers and accountants, Mr. Schwartz stressed, ''because this remains a highly technical operation.''

223-> FOX FILMS AND PRODUCER ARE CLEARED IN INQUIRY
A highly publicized inquiry has found nothing to substantiate rumors that 20th Century-Fox and the producer Daniel Melnick engaged in shady dealings before Mr. Melnick left the studio last July. ''We have found no evidence to support any type of criminal investigation,'' said a statement from District Attorney John Van De Kamp. The District Attorney's Task Force on White Collar Crime in the Entertainment Industry conducted a ''preliminary inquiry'' into rumors that Mr. Melnick had benefited unfairly from his independent producer's contract at Fox. The task force began its informal inquiry in late September after weeks of rumors had culminated in an interview with Mr. Melnick in The Hollywood Reporter, an entertainment-industry newspaper. Denial of Wrongdoing In that interview, Mr. Melnick denied any wrongdoing, including allegations that he had received a $1 million tax-free loan as part of his independent producer's contract with the studio, which ended in July. ''No evidence has been found to support any of the rumors,'' Mr. Van De Kamp's statement said. ''Moreover, none of the key persons involved have made any allegations that criminal activity took place.''

224-> CHILDREN'S BOOKS
FRIENDS Written and illustrated by Helme Heine. Unpaged. New York: Atheneum/Margaret K. McElderry. $10.95. (Ages 3 to 6) Such good friends - Charlie Rooster, Johnny Mouse and fat Percy the pig! They share everything: games of hide-and-seek and pirates, fishing (using Johnny Mouse's tail for line), cherry picking and eating, plus the stomachaches that come after. They even share a bicycle - pig on one peddle, Mouse on the other, Rooster's claws clutching the handgrips as they go careering down a country road. The problem comes in spending the night together. Mouse's house is too small, a pigsty is unappealing and the henhouse perch is unsupportable. Each goes off sadly to his own bed. ''But that night they dreamed about each other, the way true friends do.'' Largely because of Helme Heine's watercolor illustrations, ''Friends'' is one of the better picture books this season. He shows special care - creates the illusion of movement by making the spokes of the bicycle shimmer as it moves past a wheat field; depicts the passage of time by lengthening the shadows of late afternoon; marks the age of farmhouse walls by mottling his colors. But what he gives us most is a sense of joy, of irrepressible glee, of fellowship and delight. The final two-page illustration says it all: The dreaming trio is walking on clouds across a star-studded sky and looking for all the world like vaudevillians making their exit into the wings, secure in the knowledge that they have been a smash. And indeed they have.

225-> EXHIBITION OF WORK BY FEMALE ARCHITECTS
JUDITH STOCKMAN, the architect who designed the First Women's Bank in New York, is one of 66 female architects and designers whose work will be shown tonight by the Alliance of Women in Architecture. So is Judith Edelman, who redesigned the fire-gutted St. Mark's in the Bowery; Lynda Simmons, who coordinated plans for the eightapartment buildings that make up Henry Phipps Plaza West on Second Avenue in the 20's, and Judy Graf Klein, author of ''The Office Book,'' on interior design. The alliance is celebrating its 10th anniversary with its first major exhibition, which is expected to be something of a reunion. ''Part of our intent,'' said Dodie Acklie, a New York designer and a coordinator of the show, ''was to invite everyone back'' - from Regi Goldberg, the group's founder, who has ''designed'' a five-tier anniversary cake for the occasion, to other early members, to the many fledgling architects who have swelled the alliance's ranks to 200. ''We are trying to show the variety of women's architectural accomplishments in furniture, publishing, fashion,'' and, of course, buildings, Miss Acklie explained. Photographs and drawings of each entrant's work will be mounted and shown tonight only from 6:30 to 8:30 P.M. at the Urban Center in the north wing of the landmark Villard Houses, at Madison Avenue and 51st Street. Admission is $10. On Nov. 1 the show will reappear for a month without charge at the Ultimate Lotus restaurant, owned by the architect Ming Wang, at 59 East 56th Street. The mounted boards are two-dimensional, but the drawings are full of detail and symmetry and have a strong three-dimensional quality. Landscapes, lofts, beachfront houses of pale wood and glass, street maps, fantasy buildings, office interiors and striking uses of light are sketched, photographed, meticulously drawn and even painted. ''An architectural drawing is not an end in itself but a tool,'' the architect Denise Scott Brown wrote on her board. ''The end is usually a building, although architects may draw for other purposes, for example, to express a philosophy or to wage a polemic.'' Lenore M. Lacey, a project architect for ABC, sent in photographs of the network's Washington newsroom and television studio, which were designed under her supervision. Miss Acklie mounted her fashion sketches, which look quite traditional until it is apparent that the knickers are skyscrapers and that the slim skirt is really the American Telephone and Telegraph Company building. Harriet A. Balarian, an architectural designer at I.M. Pei & Partners, contributed an ''architectural fantasy'' with which she crashed a recent invitation-only contest called ''Late Entries to The Chicago Tribune Competition'' (the original competition for the building was held in the 1920's). Miss Acklie and an architectural designer, Ethelind Coblin, the other coordinator of the show, asked each participant to submit a photograph of herself. There are architects flanked by partners, architects hugging children, serious architects, laughing architects and architects in their studios. Alliance membership, at $25 a year, is limited neither to women nor to architects. There are a few male members and students, textile designers, furniture designers, urban planners, certified architects and apprentices. Last year the group, which holds monthly meetings, lectures and workshops, published an illustrated booklet called ''Built By Women,'' surveying the work of female New York architects. Information can be obtained by writing the Alliance of Women in Architecture, P.O. Box 5136, F.D.R. Station, New York, N.Y. 10022.

227-> MCGRIFF AND MARTIN ANCHOR GIANT LANE
When the Giants lost their first three games this season, their defense lacked last year's steadiness and the ability to make the big play. Now the Giants have won their last three games, partly because that defense is playing to its potential. One reason is a defensive left end with versatility and amazing size - 12 feet 9 inches and 510 pounds. The secret, of course, is that the defensive left end is really two people -Curtis McGriff (6-5, 265) when the Giants expect a run and George Martin (6-4, 245) when they expect a pass. ''I'm the designated pass rusher,'' said Martin, ''like a designated hitter in baseball.'' ''We're like a tag team in wrestling,'' said McGriff. Martin has been a presence in the Giants' three-game winning streak. For example: - When the Giants beat the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving Day, Martin made their only sack and narrowly missed another that would have given them a safety. - When the Giants beat the Houston Oilers two Sundays ago, Martin had three of their five sacks, including two straight when the Oilers were trying to rally in the last three minutes. - When the Giants beat the Philadelphia Eagles last Sunday, Martin had one of their eight sacks, forcing a fumble that blunted the Eagles' last possession. An Immovable Object Meanwhile, McGriff has become an immovable object on running plays. He has outmuscled such strong offensive tackles as Keith Dorney of the Lions and Morris Towns of the Oilers. When the Giants play the Redskins in Washington Sunday, their success may depend on McGriff's ability to keep Redskin runners from getting outside and turning upfield and Martin's ability to pressure Joe Theismann on pass plays. This is the eighth pro season for Martin and the third for McGriff. Martin started as a rookie and held the job alone until the McGriff-Martin shuttle was introduced early last season. McGriff is strong enough against the run to dominate most offensive linemen, but he lacks the quickness that helps in rushing the passer. Martin, a two-year basketball letterman at Oregon, is quicker and more athletic, but smaller and not as strong. ''It's a nice situation for us to be in,'' said Bill Parcells, the Giants' defensive coordinator. ''We can combine the best talents of both players and also keep them fresh.'' The Giants are not the only team to alternate defensive ends. Fred Dean of the San Francisco 49ers has become an all-pro by playing Martin's role as the designated pass rusher. Tony McGee of the Redskins, formerly of the New England Patriots, is another passrushing specialist. 'Best of Both Worlds' ''Splitting time used to bother me a lot more than it does now,'' said Martin. ''I could be starting on other teams that utilize a 4-3, but I'm playing almost half the time, anyway. And I realize that what we're doing gives the coaches the best of both worlds.'' In a 4-3 defense, the ends are generally quick and the tackles big and strong. In the 3-4, which the Giants and most other teams use, the three linemen are often primarily tackle types. But on second and third downs, with the offense needing long yardage for a first down, most 3-4 teams switch to a 4-3 to get a stronger pass rush. ''I like that,'' said Martin, ''and I enjoy the 3-4 when I'm playing. It's a pressure situation for the offensive tackle when he knows a new guy is in just to rush the passer or disrupt the passer's rhythm.'' There is an additional benefit to sharing the job - fewer aches and pains. ''Theoretically,'' said Martin, ''we should last longer. Time will tell. But I wake up Mondays feeling a lot better physically than when I started playing this game.''

228-> DINING OUT; JAPANESE MENU WITH INNOVATIONS
BONBORI in Huntington occupies a trim little house on a side street. Small wooden tables are set in a connecting series of rooms on the first floor. One of the rooms is a sunny porch and another has been fitted with a sushi bar. Contrasts of light walls and ark wood with some highlights of Japanese fabric make for an attractively subdued setting. Although the menu lists many typical Japanese appetizers and entrees, some attempts at innovation are also included with varying degrees of success. For example, an appetizer of yakihama, the saltbroiled clams, is served with a topping of bacon bits (the soy immitation, not real bacon), a garnish that would not enhance any dish in any cuisine. The clams themselves were on the chewy side. On the other hand, the deep fried skewered kushiage appetizer that in most restautants is made with pieces of boneless pork combines pork, scallops and shrimp here, with fine results. Nuta consisting of sea scallops lightly poached and served with cooked scallion in a light sweet miso dressing was another appealing appetizer. The soups at Bonbori are also unusual. Bits of bean curd, tangy fresh spinach and scallions add delicate flavor to a traditional clear soup. The country soup consists of tiny mushrooms, cubes of fried bean curd and vegetables in a miso-enriched broth for a hearty and warming starter. Soup is not automatically served with the entrees except in the case of certain luncheon dishes. Neither, for that matter, does Bonbori offer an iceberg lettuce salad as part of the package, a welcome change from the practice of many Japanese restaurants. Rice, green tea and a small dish of homemade Japanese pickles are the accompaniments. These pickles are made of Chinese cabbage, a type of squash and cucumbers and are refreshingly astringent combining a crunchy yet rubbery texture that Western palates may find curious. Sushi and sashimi ordered as set combinations are less interesting than if selected individually. There is a separate sushi menu. The quality of the fish is good but not outstanding. The chirashi combination of raw fish over rice with seasoning was a fairly small entree, one that would be more suitable at lunch than at dinner. Although some of the vegetables in the tempura combinations were sliced a trifle thick so they did not have a chance to cook through as they were deep-fried in batter, the batter coating was light and crisp. The batter was equally fine applied to shrimps. But a special tempura combination with scallops, some soft-textured fish and squid also included a piece of king crab meat. This was a mistake since the crab meat had not been removed from the shell, making the tempura treatment worse than useless. It was crisp only on the outside of the shell, the inedible part, and unpleasantly soggy inside where it came in contact with the crab meat. A version of negimayaki beef rolls are made with asparagus instead of scallion, which also does not improve the original since the delightful pungency of the scallion flavor is missing. But loin of pork basted with pungent miso and broiled was excellent, as was the tatsuta age made with nuggets of boneless chicken crisply deep fried. Sukiyaki was merely decent. The donburi made with fried pork cutlet topping a bowl of rice with egg and onions, a typical Japanese luncheon dish, boasted a rich savory blend of flavor but would have been more enjoyable had the pork been less fatty. Bonbori has one of the more appealing dessert menus of any Japanese restaurant, with choices of fresh pineapple and melon, ice creams subtly flavored with green tea or studded with bits of sharp candied ginger, plus a couple of stirctly Japanese confections made with red bean paste. Service is extremely attentive, adding to the pleasant dining atmosphere. Japanese or American beer, sake and a dry white house wine can accompany the meals. Plum wine is also available.

229-> 60-MINUTE GOURMET
THE single most versatile and easy-to-cook dish from a raw state, in my opinion, is shrimp. In their most basic form, direct from a net, heads and shell left on, they can be tossed into a pot for a moment and they are ready to peel and eat with a little melted butter. In Louisiana a little Worcestershire and Tabasco are traditionally added to the butter. During a discussion of shrimp cookery with James Nassikas, a food and wine enthusiast who runs the Stanford Court Hotel in San Francisco, we recalled a number of our favorite shrimp dishes. One of mine is a Greek dish, garedes me feta - shrimp, a well-seasoned tomato-herb sauce and chopped feta cheese, to which, after brief baking, is added a dash of ouzo, that fine anise-flavored Greek spirit that turns opalescent when combined with water. ''One of my favorite New Orleans preparations,'' Mr. Nassikas said, ''is a shrimp dish made from that rather vague and flexible world of Creole cookery, a sort of grandchild to France, a descendant of Spain and a cousin to Africa.'' A dish he discovered as manager of a hotel in New Orleans years ago, it consists of shrimp baked 10 minutes in a butter sauce. The sauce is a blend of Tabasco, hot chili paste (of a sort you find in Chinese cookery), lemon juice plus lemon rind, a touch of rosemary and Worcestershire sauce. (For what it is worth, I have heard Worcestershire sauce described as the vanilla of the South, and watching some Southerners use it, I am inclined to believe it.) When the dish was recently prepared at home, it was served with an easily made rice dish in which toasted pine nuts were included and a mixed green salad. As the rice cooks the shrimp are a cinch to prepare. James Nassikas's Shrimp 1 1/2 pounds shrimp, about 40 to 44, shelled and deveined 1 lemon 12 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1 1/2 teaspoons dried rosemary 1 teaspoon hot chili paste (available in Chinese markets) 1/2 teaspoon Tabasco sauce 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley, optional. 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2. Prepare shrimp and arrange in one layer in baking dish. 3. Remove and discard lemon peel. Cut lemon into 1/8-inch slices, removing and discarding seeds. Arrange lemon slices in and around shrimp. 4. Melt butter in saucepan and add Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, rosemary, chili paste and Tabasco. Pour over shrimp and stir gently, leaving shrimp in one layer. 5. Place in oven and bake 10 minutes. Serve sprinkled with chopped parsley if desired. Yield: 4 servings. Rice With Pine Nuts 1 1/2 ounces pine nuts, about 1/3 cup 2 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup finely chopped onion 1/2 teaspoon finely minced garlic 1 cup converted (not instant) rice 1 1/2 cups water. 1. Place pine nuts in skillet and cook, stirring often, until lightly browned. Remove from heat. 2. Heat half the butter in saucepan and add onion and garlic. Cook, stirring, until onion is wilted. Add rice and stir. Add pine nuts and water and bring to boil. Cover closely and let simmer exactly 17 minutes. 3. Uncover, fluff the rice with fork and stir in remaining butter. Yield: 4 servings. Salade Panachee (Mixed green salad) 1 head Boston lettuce 1 bunch watercress 1 red, ripe tomato, cored and cut in eighths 6 radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced 2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1 tablespoon imported mustard such as Dijon or Dusseldorf 6 tablespoons olive oil Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste. 1. Core Boston lettuce and separate leaves. Trim off tough stems of watercress. Rinse greens and shake off excess moisture. Put greens in salad bowl and add tomato and radishes. 2. Blend vinegar, minced garlic and mustard in mixing bowl. Stir with whisk, gradually adding oil. Add salt and pepper to taste. 3. Pour dressing over the greens and toss. Yield: 4 servings.

232-> WHITE HOUSE ANSWERS ISRAELI CRITICISM ON AID
The Reagan Administration, responding to Israeli criticism, said today that it was ''puzzled that Israel can call into question our good faith'' simply because the White House opposed Congressional attempts to increase aid to Israel. President Reagan's spokesman, Larry Speakes, defended the Administration's opposition to a vote last week by the Senate Appropriations Committee to allocate more money for Israel than the $2.5 billion already sought by the Administration in the 1983 budget. Reading a prepared answer in response to a question at the daily White House briefing, Mr. Speakes said the Administration had already proposed a 21 percent increase and that any more might come at the expense of other allies' needs. ''The question of assistance to Israel was a carefully arrived at figure and we think it should be no more, no less,'' Mr. Speakes said. ''We note that the President's request for increased aid to Israel comes at a time when other U.S. friends are desperately in need of U.S. assistance to help them deal with ongoing military conflict.'' The White House comment was offered in response to complaints from the Israeli Government that the Administration's opposition was ''a bit astonishing'' and had included ''unfriendly remarks'' about Israel. At first, Mr. Speakes emphasized budget restraints in discussing the issue. But when asked whether the Administration also sought to send Israel a political message beyond the economic one, he replied, ''Both.'' He then retreated a bit from this, insisting that the aid question was not being specifically linked to the Administration's dissatisfaction with Israel on such issues as its withdrawal from Lebanon and its settlements policy in the West Bank. The White House, meanwhile, announced that President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt would visit Washington on Jan. 27 and meet with President Reagan. Aides speculated that President Reagan's Middle East peace proposal would be on the agenda. The State Department lobbied heavily against increasing aid to Israel. Administration officials argued in Congress that other countries would get less and that Arab nations would think Israel was being rewarded for its invasion of Lebanon with extra money to help pay for the operation. Israeli officials said privately today that although the Administration had opposed increasing the aid on budget grounds in earlier Congressional sessions, it chose to ''politicize'' the issue last week. In emphasizing the budget argument at the White House briefing, Mr. Speakes said Israel would, under the Administration's requested increase, receive ''28 percent of our total security assistance budget.'' ''Frankly,'' Mr. Speakes declared, ''in light of the President's proposed aid level to Israel, we are puzzled that Israel can call into question our good faith on this issue.'' Israeli officials emphasize that the proposal to increase aid began moving through Congress after the Administration proposed changing the previous year's mixture of direct grants and loans. In effect, the Israelis complain, under the Administration plan, the total grants would decrease by $50 million to $500 million, although the overall military aid would, through loan authorizations, rise $300 million to $1.7 billion. The Senate committee left the $1.7 billion military total unchanged but increased the portion in grants to $800 million from $500 million. It also added $125 million to the Administration's request for $800 million in economic aid. When questions arose at today's briefing about whether the Administration fought the extra aid with specific political differences with Israel in mind, Mort Allin, a deputy White House press secretary who specializes in foreign affairs, denied any connection was intended. He stressed that the aid proposal was prepared last spring.

234-> BILL TO CURB THEFT OF ART APPROVED
After being bottled up in Congress for 10 years, a measure designed to halt the illicit trafficking in stolen antiquities was approved early today and sent off to President Reagan, who is expected to sign it. The House of Representatives approved the measure late Monday night and sent it to the Senate, which added its approval at 1:30 A.M. today. The measure is the United States implementation of an already ratified United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization convention, The key to passage was a compromise that called for enforcement of its provisions only after similar enforcement is decreed in the other major art-importing countries. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, had blocked the measure in the past, partly on behalf of New York art dealers concerned that United States enforcement of the Unesco convention would mean that they would lose all their business to the countries that did not enforce it. Foreign Actions Awaited ''This was a good and reasonable solution to a problem that all the principals wanted to solve,'' said Senator Moynihan, who had become one of the leading advocates of the compromise measure. ''Let us hope that the other major art-importing countries do what we have done. When they come on board, we will come on board.'' The measure's leading advocate in the Senate, Spark M. Matsunaga, Democrat of Hawaii, said through a spokesman that he was ''grateful for passage of the bill after 10 years and particularly grateful for Senator Moynihan's cooperation in finally allowing the bill to go through.'' The Administration has endorsed the measure, which is part of the Miscellaneous Tariffs Act, and Congressional aides are confident that President Reagan will sign it. The measure is formally known as the Unesco Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Burden on Other Countries The measure now puts the burden of approval, and any onus for lack of approval, on the other major art-importing countries - France, West Germany, Britain, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries and Japan. The Unesco treaty requires that antiquities may not be imported into a participating country unless accompanied by a certificate of permission from the country of origin. The certificate requirement is intended to allow free exchange in the legal market while blocking the sale of stolen artifacts. Critics of the measure said that this provision would simply lead to creation of a thriving market in the counterfeiting of certificates. In addition, opponents of the treaty contended that the importing countries generally did a better job of protecting the antiquities than did the countries from which the artifacts were taken, partly because those countries did not have the resources to protect them. The principal victims of such thievery have been countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, but some Western nations, such as Greece, Turkey and Italy, also have been losing their antiquities.

235-> Bankruptcy Court Request
The Justice Department today asked the Supreme Court to extend the Dec. 24 deadline for Congress to restructure the nation's bankruptcy courts until March 25. The request was filed at the Court after the close of business. It came after Congress had adjourned without taking any action to cure the constitutional defects found by the Court in a June 28 decision. That decision struck down the broad powers Congress had granted to bankruptcy judges, but kept the courts operating while Congress was given time to remedy the problem with new legislation. The Court had set the Dec. 24 deadline for new legislation after Congress failed to meet an Oct. 4 deadline it had originally set. March 25 is the scheduled beginning of Congress's Easter recess.

239-> A CURIOUS PUSH TO WEAKEN F.T.C. ADVERTISING RULES
WASHINGTON CONSUMERS and advertisers are not usually in the same camp. But in an increasingly curious debate with the Federal Trade Commission these adversarial players are, for the time being, on the same side. James C. Miller 3d, the iconoclastic chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, along with his Bureau of Consumer Protection chief, Timothy J. Muris, are convinced that advertisers and consumers, even though they don't know it, have a real problem. The two men believe that some of the F.T.C.'s consumerist rules, which were adopted in 1971 and govern honesty in advertising, are an unjustified burden for advertisers and, indirectly, for consumers, too. And so, these deregulators are pushing a plan, as yet rather nebulous, that would give advertising copywriters more creative liberties in the slogans they write about products and services. But so far, the Miller and Muris team have had little luck convincing consumer groups or even advertisers that a problem exists. In fact, some advertisers initially feared the proffered gift of deregulation, saying that the industry would be thrown back to a ''jungle'' of false claims if the Government stopped requiring advertisers to have proof before making claims. Now the F.T.C. chairman and Mr. Muris, who had worked with Mr. Miller on the Adminstration's Task Force on Regulatory Relief, have apparently moderated their proposals and are stepping up their lobbying efforts for them: Last week, Mr. Muris issued a 33-page memorandum outlining what he considers the inconsistencies of the agency's rules governing substantiation of advertising claims. ''When the television weather reporter states that 'it will rain tomorrow,' the typical viewer does not interpret the statement as meaning that rain is absolutely certain,'' said Mr. Muris in his memo. ''The same analysis applies to advertising claims.'' This sort of logic, though technically correct, makes consumer advocates fear that Mr. Muris and Mr. Miller would encourage advertisers to make claims that are about as reliable as the local weather report. Consumer advocates believe the chairman's review will also promote more ambiguous and subjective advertising claims. ''Mr. Miller implicitly assumes that there is some good conveyed by subjective claims that can't be backed up,'' said David Greenberg, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. ''There usually isn't.'' While the issue is turning out to be not nearly so controversial as some of Mr. Miller's other proposals to reduce the agency's statutory power, staff and budget, it creates interesting shadows on the Administration's approach to regulatory relief. AFTER his proposal to change rules governing substantiation created a furor last fall, Mr. Miller, who directed the Presidential Task F orce on Regulatory Relief before being sworn in as F.T.C. chairman l ast year, met repeatedly with industry members to explain his ideas - with little apparent success. A small turning point came in late O ctober, when he met with representatives of the three major trade g roups and gained their support for an F.T.C. research project on the' 'problem.'' At that meeting, Paul C. Harper Jr., vice chairman of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, said: ''A great many people around this table are in complete support of substantiation before the fact. I have to ask you what you think the problem is,'' according to a report of the meeting. ''Why not leave it alone?'' asked Peter Allport, president of the Association of National Advertisers. Mr. Miller is concerned that the F.T.C. may require companies to develop excessive scientific data to back up claims and that consumers share the cost of producing this evidence. He is also concerned that the rule has a ''chilling effect'' on advertisers, in effect, keeping them from providing useful consumer information because they do not want to spend time and money for studies. To get his own research going, the chairman has prepared a lengthy questionnaire for the industry and it will be published in the Federal Register after review by the full commission. The memo put out by Mr. Muris is considered justification for the questionnaire. The industry, which appreciated Mr. Miller's earlier effort this year to clarify the legal definition of ''unfair'' advertising, is now willing to cooperate with the survey. ''The industry hasn't been overly excited about it, but we want to be responsive,'' said Howard H. Bell, president of the American Advertising Federation, a trade group representing all aspects of the industry. ''But it is appropriate for the chairman to make certain there are no elements that are unduly burdensome and restrictive,'' said Mr. Bell in an interview. ONE of Mr. Miller's Republican colleagues on the commission, David A . Clanton, said he ''is interested in what the advertisers have to s ay.'' But consumer groups and two other F.T.C. commissioners look askance at the chairman's resolve to re-examine agency's regulations. ''I have no objections to soliciting comments from outside the agency,'' said Patricia P. Bailey, a Republican commissioner. ''But I want to make sure that the comment is not sought in such a way as to suggest that there is any interest in backing away from the requirement of prior substantiation of advertising claims.'' Michael Pertschuk, the commission's only Democrat, said: ''It is really a remarkable mystery, all this effort dealing with a regulation nobody complains about and which generally enjoys support.'' Mr. Pertschuk, however, is worried that the review will ''leave consumers out on a limb and undermine the certainty advertisers have under the rule.'' Uncertainty already exists, contends Mr. Muris. For example, Mr. Muris said the agency has a rule that forbids companies, once an F.T.C. investigation has commenced, to produce new evidence to substantiate suspect claims. The rule, he said, is not enforced. ''Why have the rule on the books if it isn't used? Why not practice what we preach?'' he said. Mr. Muris said his memo also endeavors to ''make explicit what's implicit'' in the agency's operation. ''There is nothing fundamentally wrong with substantiation,'' he said. ''We just want to do some fine-tuning.'' He recommends that the agency develop criteria for the amount of substantiation required for different advertising claims; that it consider how much useful information may be lost if too rigorous substantiation requirements are made and that the agency explain when the commission accepts an advertiser's ''reasonable basis'' for believing its claim is true. The memo is directed at lawyers but occasionally breaks into plain English. ''Advertisers do not intend subjective claims and puffery, including obviously exaggerated opinions, to convey objective fact, nor do consumers interpret them as fact. Consumers simply do not expect subjective claims to be backed by substantiation,'' it states. A footnote explains that it refers to ''consumers who act reasonably under the circumstances.'' An example cited by Mr. Muris: In a radio ad, General Motors cited the opinion of a Road and Track Magazine writer that the Vega was ''the best-handling passenger car.'' In 1975, the F.T.C. prevented G.M. from using the quote unless it had scientific evidence to support it. ''Thus,'' he wrote, ''the commission prohibited the auto maker from providing valuable opinion information from a reputable publication concerning the handling qualities of the Vega.'' But consumer groups dispute this interpretation. ''Neither Mr. Miller nor Mr. Muris has a consumer's mind and their characterization of what consumers understand is not substantiated by the commission's investigation,'' said Mark Silbergeld, head of the Consumers Union lobbying office in Washington. ''Survey evidence showed that people believed that General Motors stood behind the claim and that G.M. was essentially making the claim that the Vega was the best-handling car.'' Mr. Muris does not dispute the F.T.C.'s survey, but said it does not bear on the legal merits of the case. ''If G.M. accurately portrayed the Road and Track statement - and it did - it ought to be able to give consumers the information,'' he said.

240-> AFTER BREZHNEV
WASHINGTON EACH hidden reshuffling of power in the Kremlin triggers a reflexive questioning in America: Will this make things better or worse for us and how should we handle it? Should we greet the new leadership with conciliatory gestures to lure them toward accommodation or with toughness to try to force them to ease off on the arms race and aggressiveness abroad. With Yuri V. Andropov, for 15 years the head of the Soviet secret police and intelligence service, replacing Leonid I. Brezhnev, many Americans are braced, in former President Carter's words, for ''new confrontations.'' But the most experienced Kremlin-watchers, even those who concede that the sour tensions and suspicions of the past few years could become even worse, now see a moment of opportunity. They point to the interregnum in Moscow after Stalin died in 1953 and before Nikita S. Khrushchev established himself. In those three years, the Russians signed a peace treaty accepting Austrian neutrality, reopened diplomatic relations with Israel, called off disputes with Greece and Turkey, and moved toward summitry with President Eisenhower. American experts reason that the Soviet leaders were then so preoccupied with internal jockeying for power and the legacy of Stalinist repression that they needed calmer relations with the outside world. Now once again, the Administration's experts reckon that new leaders are beset by staggering problems - inconclusive guerrilla war in Afghanistan, the risk of upheavals in Poland, and a stagnant Soviet economy - and may want to reduce tensions abroad while they sort out internal concerns. It is a moment, the experts argue, for American initiatives to break the bleak, deadlocked atmosphere. Some suggest reviving moribund negotiations on a full nuclear test ban or slowing the Reagan military buildup. Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser, suggests offers such as a guarantee of a neutral Afghanistan if Soviet troops withdraw; a proposal to cut back battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe if Moscow will reduce its tank forces in East Germany, and long-term aid for Poland, for Polish moves toward ''national reconciliation.'' Lech Walesa, the Solidarity union leader, was reported released yesterday amid hints at further liberalization.(New roles for the Polish church, page 3.) Even before the changeover in Moscow, President Reagan faced pressures for moderation. Nuclear freeze initiatives carried in eight of nine states, prodding him to be more accommodating on arms control. At his news conference Thursday, Mr. Reagan insisted that it ''doesn't make sense'' to put a freeze ahead of his arms buildup or his proposals for arms reductions. He contended that ''foreign agents were sent to help instigate and create'' the freeze movement, a charge some critics called an attempt to stifle debate. But he was unlikely to be able to still rising Congressional pressures on arms control. Perhaps more significantly, Congressional and public sentiment has shifted on military spending, largely because of the recession and the need to avert a $200 billion budget deficit in 1984. Republicans as well as Democrats are ready to battle the defense budget and trim back to a more modest pace of military growth. On another front, strains in the West and European resistance to Mr. Reagan's embargo on equipment for the Soviet natural gas pipeline had prompted the Administration to look for ways to lift the sanctions before Mr. Brezhnev died. Yesterday, Mr. Reagan finally relented, as a bow to Alliance unity. But he also announced new measures with the Europeans to curb the flow of high technology to Moscow, deals that, he said, ''serve to preferentially aid the heavily militarized Soviet economy.'' The effort to tighten trade controls was balanced by symbolic gestures of conciliation. The President visited the Soviet Embassy yesterday to offer condolences and he sent Moscow a message hoping for ''an improved relationship.'' But he rejected the advice of Secretary of State George Shultz and William P. Clark, his national security adviser, that he go to Moscow for the funeral. He reportedly felt the trip might make him seem overly eager to bargain with the new leaders. His standoffishness reflected his conviction that flexibility at this moment would be a critical mistake and that firmness - ''peace through strength'' - is required. Quite directly, the President made clear that he feels it is up to the new Soviet leaders to make the first move to make possible a new and better era of Soviet-American relations. When a reporter asked if Mr. Reagan were willing to take the first step, he replied that some people believe ''I took the first step with lifting the grain embargo.'' He added: ''Have we gotten anything for it?'' Fundamentally, the White House view is that Mr. Brezhnev's passing will bring no quick, dramatic changes in Soviet policies and that only as the new Soviet leaders face the competitive economic squeeze of the arms race and contemplate the cost of trying to match the $1.5 trillion, five-year Reagan military buildup will they be willing to make concessions in the arms talks. In a bit of personal Kremlinology, the President told his radio audience yesterday, ''It's always been my belief that if the Soviets knew we were serious about maintaining our security, they might be more willing to negotiate seriously at the bargaining table.''

241-> AN AMERICAN TREASURE FINDS A NEW HOME
One day two years ago or so, a young organ buff was wandering through churches in Plains, Pa. - a small city next door to Wilkes-Barre - to see what kinds of instruments they had there. The pickings were pretty slim on the whole, but in the rear gallery of one Roman Catholic church, he came across something curious. Two keyboards and an old-fashioned pedal board testified to the existence of an organ that was otherwise almost invisible. Ends of pipes could be seen, but the tops of them and of the organ case vanished strangely into a painted ceiling. Labels had disappeared from the stopknobs, some of the ivories had fallen off the keys, and the general impression was one of abandonment, indifference and neglect. It was clear that the organ had not been played for ages, and it could not even be tried out to see how it sounded. While peering at the dusty keyboards, the organ buff spied a nameplate in the space between them. It identified the builder, though not one he had ever heard of. Thomas Appleton. Who was he? Was he important? It occured to the young man that Alan Laufman might know. He is head of the Organ Clearing House, an organization devoted for more than two decades to the rescue and relocation of old instruments threatened with destruction. Mr. Laufman knew who Thomas Appleton was, all right, and on Tuesday night the 150-year-old instrument that languished in Plains for decades will be heard in its New York debut. A rare specimen, the 14-stop Appleton organ has been acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art and installed on the north balcony of the Equestrian Court. The balcony is part of the Andre Mertens Galleries for Musical Instruments. The first recital, given as a benefit for the Museum's department of musical instruments, will be played by Daniel Chorzempa, an American virtuoso of international reputation who lives in Europe. A few days ago, as the installation of the Appleton organ was nearing completion, Laurence Libin, the Metropolitan's curator of musical instruments, describes it as ''the finest and best preserved and possibly the largest early 19th-century American instrument still intact.'' And, although it is anything but large as pipe organs go, it is nevertheless the largest organ of historical interest in an American museum. (The Met Museum itself owns at least seven other smaller organs dating from 1598 to 1852, some of them playable.) A publication of the Organ Historical Society, a national organization, describes Thomas Appleton as ''the Boston organbuilder who brought the hand-made organ to the zenith of craftsmanship.'' Born in Boston in 1785, Appleton's first job was as an apprentice to a Boston cabinetmaker. Then, from 1810 to 1820, he worked with a prominent organ builder named William Goodrich. In 1821 he established his own workshop and is said to have produced his finest instruments between 1825 and 1845. Among the outstanding examples built by him during this period were those for the Bowdoin Street Church and the Handel and Haydn Society of Boston and for the Church of the Pilgrims in Brooklyn. No more than three or four two-manual Appleton organs are thought to survive, and none of the others is of as early a date as the one acquired by the Museum or in equally pristine estate. Furthermore, two have had to be identified as Appletons by attribution rather than documentation. Appleton's own logs show that he built just one instrument in 1830, and the one now at the Metropolitan is dated 1830 inside the case. Furthermore, records indicate that it was originally installed in South Church in Hartford, Conn. In 1854, the organ was moved to an unknown location when it was replaced at South Church by a larger instrument built by another maker. The 1830 Appleton surfaces in history again in 1883. That is when it was installed in Sacred Heart Church in Plains. Decades ago, Sacred Heart bought an electronic instrument and pretty much forgot about the old relic in the gallery. That forgetting turned out to be a blessing. Through neglect, the instrument escaped modernizing that would almost certainly have been its fate had the effort been made to keep it in playing condition. And that modernizing would doubtlessly have destroyed the original character of the instrument. During its quiescent years, the Appleton's air reservoir developed cracks and the leather of the bellows dried out, white-painted plywood was nailed to some surfaces of the fine mahogany veneers of the case (other surfaces were painted brown) and some of the metal pipes bent as a result of their own weight, but the organ was essentially intact when it was ''rediscovered'' recently. Even the big wooden handle by which the organ had been hand-pumped before the days of electricity was still there, and so, also, were the initials carved into the back of the case by generations of choir boys who had taken their turns at pumping. Indeed, except for the stop-knob labels, a few ivories on the keyboards and fragments of ornamental moldings, nothing was missing. Thus, the restoration of the organ, though detailed and painstaking, has involved no rebuilding, no wholesale substitution of modern elements for missing originals. The work has been carried out under the exacting direction of Lawrence Trupiano, an organ expert who, among other things, is curator of organs at St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue. The Greek Revival mahogany case has been brought back to its intended splendor, the facade pipes have been gilded anew with gold leaf, and the remaining arrays of wood and pewter pipes - which include two of the best preserved reed ranks known to exist in an American organ - are all in place. Despite its specialness and excellence, this Appleton organ is not an all-purpose instrument; all kinds of organ music will not sound equally good on it. Modeled after 17th- and 18th-century English instruments, its pedal division is limited, consiting of only one 16-foot stop. As Appleton built it, in fact, there were only 18 notes in the pedal. When the organ was moved to Plains in 1883, however, nine notes were added by the installer, Emmons Howard, to make a total of 27. These have been retained in the restoration. The lack of a full, multi-stop pedal division means that works having significant pedal parts - such as Bach's big preludes and fugues - will not fare particularly well on this instrument. On the other hand, it should be ideal for the Handel organ concertos, since they do not have pedal parts. In any case, as Mr. Trupiano points out ''Appleton never intended it to be a concert instrument.'' Still, it will function as a concert instrument at the Metropolitan, and Mr. Chorzempa's program will include works by Mozart, Mendelssohn, William Selby (an American) and August Wilhelm Bach, a teacher of Mendelssohn and unrelated to the well-known Bachs. The first pipe organs in what is now the United States were probably in the early Spanish missions of the Southwest, but on the East Coast the earliest mention of one in documents discovered so far was in 1703, a reference to an ordination service in the Gloria Dei ''Old Swedes'' Church in Philadelphia. Since churches were central to life in the American colonies, Pennsylvania had organ builders at work by the middle of the 18th century. And as settlements spread across the continent, so also did organs in churches, and by the second half of the 19th century numerous American builders were turning out instruments of varied size and quality. With the coming of the 20th century organs began to change as a result of the many ways in which electric current could be applied to them, and the earlier instruments began to be either transformed or discarded. Later, with the development of the electronic organ, which attempts to imitate the sound of the pipe organ, the abandonment of the old accelerated. In the 1950's the Organ Historical Society was founded to focus attention upon this part of America's musical heritage that was going down the drain. In 1959, the Society founded the Organ Clearing House, which became independent in 1964 and now has its headquarters in Harrisville, N.H. ''More than 800 organs have been relocated and saved as a result of our work,'' Mr. Laufman says, ''and we have 120 on the list that are available at present.'' Not all of these in either the saved or waiting category are of high quality, by any means, but a goodly number are. If the Metropolitan's acquisition and restoration of the Appleton is the most attention-getting of recent organ salvage operations, it is certainly not the only one of importance. An 1871 3-manual, 55-rank organ built by George and Elias Hook for St. Alphonsus Church on West Broadway has just been been installed in St. Mary's Church in New Haven in a mammoth relocation project. Structural defects had led to the condemnation of St. Alphonus which was demolished earlier this year. And just recently, the four-manual E. and G. G. Hook organ built in 1864 for Mechanics Hall of Worcester, Mass. was completely and spectacularly restored there. Still, the Metropolitan Museum's emphasis on historical accuracy sets the Appleton apart from other restorations. When Mr. Chorzempa plays his recital on Tuesday night, Mr. Trupiano, spelled perhaps by an assistant or two, will be at the right rear corner of the organ case laboring as choir boys in churches used to do - pumping away while Mr. Chorzempa plays. ''We will have an electric blower for rehearsals,'' Mr. Libin says, ''but it will be hand pumped for all performances.''

242-> A 'FAMILY ALBUM' OF CLOTHES
FASHION exhibitions at museums can be awesome experiences, as if the sponsors must justify the frivolous subject by embuing it with a heavy freight of aesthetic and social significance. ''Silhouettes of Style,'' the current show at The Hudson River Museum, which runs through Jan. 9, is nothing like that. It's as cozy as poring through an old family album or opening attic trunks filled with ancestral clothes. The clothes, from the museum's collection, were worn by local residents from, roughly, 1870 to 1930, not only by denizens of the mansions along the river but also by working people. Indeed, the scarlet wool shirt with the rounded yoke and white letter ''A'' appliqued to the pocket, is one of the best designs in the show. It was worn from 1910 to 1920 by local firemen, members of Company A. While the clothes are housed in the museum's new contemporary galleries, the main building, known as the John Bond Trevor mansion, was built in 1876, and used as a residence through 1918. The rooms are being restored - the sitting room and library have been completed, the dining room is almost done - and it would be instructive to pass through them on the way to the fashion exhibition to see the settings in which some of the grander clothes were worn. Without pressing the point, the display of more than 130 costumes charts the progress of women from their role as decorative objects, restrained by the amount of fabrics they carried on their backs as well as their corsets, to the relative freedom of today. Simply laundering the undergarments a fashionable woman was compelled to wear 100 years ago could have taken a toll on her working hours. ''Until the guns of August 1914 announced the end of a way of life, the amount of underwear worn by even a moderately fashionable woman was formidable,'' a placard announced at the lingerie display, one of many vignettes within the exhibition. Among the multitudinous undergarments were chemises, worn next to the skin, then rigid whalebone corsets and embroidered corset covers. On the lower part of the body were stockings, gartered at the knee, loose drawers, a hoop or support for the bustle, and petticoats. Then came the clothes. The bustle, one of fashion's many aberrations, reigned on and off for two decades after its invention by Charles Frederick Worth, who drew the voluminus skirts of the time to the back. By the 1890's the hourglass look was dominant, growing in extravagance until, with the advent of the first World War, fashion began, tentatively, to enter the modern era. Many glorious examples of late 19th-century dresses have been preserved, including ball gowns, and somewhat simpler styles for ''walking'' and ''visiting.'' The category known as ''morning dress'' contained styles that were simpler still. One example, in black and white silk crepe dated 1903, was decorated only with shirring at the waistline and five ruffled tiers near the hemline. (As recently as the 1950's, French couture collections regularly opened with relatively plain styles designated as ''morning dress.'') ''Tea gowns,'' which continued into the 1930's, are another lost category. These were worn at home, to entertain guests, and were less constructed than clothes worn outside the house. Chinese robes, with their amazing embroideries, and shawls from Kashmir, which served as outer wraps, have a place in the exhibition as wall hangings. There are also collections of shoes, hats and such accessories as parasols, boas, fans and handkerchiefs, all of which were necessary paraphernalia for a woman to carry around with her when she left her house. Special-occasion clothes are preserved best, so there are wedding dresses in mint condition along with christening dresses and some dress-up styles for children, with the same kind of handwork that is seen in the lingerie. The clothes that show signs of wear include such oddities as an electric blue satin dress from the pre-World War I period embroidered with peacocks, each feather meticulously reproduced. But there are some clothes that have stood the test of time and are as pleasing to the eye today as they must have been originally. A simple, unobtrusive dress in Wedgwood-blue silk, dated 1911, with a narrow edging of pearls on its surplice bodice is one of these. Almost all the knee-length beaded lace and net dresses of the late 1920's have retained their charm and beauty. But go yourself and pick your own favorites. The museum is open Wednesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; Thursdays until 9 P.M; and Sunday from noon to 5:30 P.M. Admission is free. An extra attraction, in an adjoining gallery, is an exhibition of contemporary fashion illustrations by Antonio Lopez, which includes drawings for Bloomingdale's advertisements as well as for La Foret, the store in Japan, and for Italian magazines. They have a strong sense of fantasy and super-realism. His drawings of shoes have a sensuous, eerie quality and in themselves are worth a visit. Like the costumes, the drawings will be on view through Jan. 9.

245-> 10 Convicted in Drug Case
Ten Florida men, including Gary Balough, a professional stock-car racer, were convicted today of conspiring to smuggle tons of marijuana into Florida aboard high-powered speedboats. The verdicts came after eight days of deliberations and 10 weeks of testimony and arguments before Federal District Judge Sidney Aronovitz. Seventy people have been indicted in the so-called ''race-car driver'' drug-conspiracy case, although few of those charged were actually drivers on the stock-car circuit.

248-> STUDENTS EXPLOITING HOLIDAY BREAK
They spilled into Greenwich Village, sporting college uniforms of down jackets, Norwegian sweaters, tweedy sport jackets, Norma Kamalistyle sweats and the occasional letter sweater. Yesterday - in the middle of the weekend that brings college students pouring back into New York City, often for the first trip back home in the school year - many chose not to stay indoors and finish the rest of the turkey. Instead, they peered in the Christmas window displays on Fifth Avenue, crowded into Rockefeller Center, ducked into St. Patrick's Cathedral or combed Greenwich Village shops for records and bargain fashions. Clustered near Capezio in the Village, a clothing store on Macdougal Street, a group of Brooklyn friends met and compared notes on surviving the holidays. ''I just miss college,'' said Nadine Fishelson, a freshman at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Her junior high school classmate, Dena Gartenstein, was somewhat more judicious. ''It's nice, in a way, to have that kind of caring for you,'' she said of her parents' solicitude, ''even when they're saying, 'What time are you coming home?' My roommate does that, but it's not the same thing. For four days, it's kind of nice.'' Janet Raiffa, emerging from Capezio, called out to Miss Fishelson, a high school classmate: ''Hi, are you at UMass now?'' Miss Fishelson nodded. ''I'm at Smith, '' said Miss Raiffa. Smith College is 10 minutes by bus from the University of Massachusetts and linked by student exchange programs. ''But this is the first time we've seen each other,'' she said. Miss Raiffa had her weekend schedule neatly plotted: ''The two big shopping places are Bloomingdales and Capezio's. First you hit the Village. Some people wanted to go to a museum, but if you're going to college, that's dull enough, so you might as well go shopping.'' At Rockefeller Center's ice-skating rink, Thanksgiving had given way to Christmas. The Christmas tree stood crowned by a star but bereft of other decorations. Variations on Christmas songs blasted from loudspeakers and all but drowned out the clanging bells of three Salvation Army volunteers conducting their Christmas ''dollar drive.'' Skating by twin girls clad in bright blue tutus and fathers clinging to their agile children's hands were John Niklarz and Brad Roberts, students at Michigan Technological University, where they are members of an intramural hockey team. The classmates, on a week's vacation, came to New York bearing skates and an eagerness to try skating in the city. They confessed to disappointment. ''It's small and overcrowded,'' pronounced Mr. Roberts, a sophomore from Harper Beach, Mich.. For some students who live too far away to get home for Thanksgiving, New York proved to be an acceptable second choice. Sarah and Gabrielle Frahm, who go to different colleges in New York, live in Chicago and spent their Thanksgiving together at the home of a friend. ''We're the only two people in our family in New York,'' said Sarah Frahm, who attends the Pratt Institute. ''So we talk about that a lot. This is the first Thanksgiving we've spent together away from home.'' Her sister, Gabrielle, a student at New York University, sketched their plans: ''Go to bars, sleep very late, go to a lot of coffeeshops.'' Her sister took up the agenda: ''You don't do all the work you say you're going to do, and you don't feel guilty until Monday, when you say, I could have gotten a paper out of the way, I could have gotten a lot more done.'' Candles flickered inside St. Patrick's Cathedral as worshippers and tourists gathered far from the jostling crowds and piped Christmas tunes on Fifth Avenue. Its hushed neo-Gothic splendor even lured a few students from other holiday diversions. Steve McCall, a junior at Wake Forest in Winston-Salem, N.C., said he had always wanted to see St. Patrick's -''and also because my brother's a seminary student.'' His brother, John, a second-year student at the Princeton Theological Seminary, smiled and said: ''I've been here before. He wanted to come here even before seeing the windows at Saks.'' Doug Crum of Lewiston, Idaho, gazed about at the elaborate carvings and breathed: ''It's one of the big sights in New York. It's a beautiful church.'' Although the second-year theology student at Catholic University in Washington said he planned to take in the Empire State Building, Chinatown, Greenwich Village, the Hayden Planetarium and a performance of ''The Pirates of Penzance,'' he allowed as how he was drawn to the cathedral first after getting off the bus at the Port Authority. Though holiday celebrations beckoned, some students could not shut out visions of looming papers and tests. Liza Fleishman, a freshman at the University of Buffalo, returned home to Greenwich Village to a warm - but distracting - circle of family and friends. ''I have a lot of work, and I'm not getting anything done because all my friends are coming to visit,'' she said as she hunched over a thick volume studded with pictures of Gothic cathedrals in the turreted Jefferson Market branch of the New York Public Library. ''It's really hard to work at home. I brought most of the stuff with me, actually,'' she said, waving at her art history tome and a paperback entitled ''Horror Literature.'' Explaining the title, she said: ''I'm trying to write a paper with a surprise ending, and I have to memorize the art history for a slide test. But I'm not doing too well. I'll stay here all day, but then I guess I'm going out tonight.'' Upstairs in the reading room, as the sunlight shone ruby, indigo and gold through the library's stained-glass windows, a student drew lines on a yellow pad of paper and plotted her answers to a Harvard Business School application. Intent on her work, she listened politely to a request that she discuss what she was doing over her Thanksgiving holiday. Turning back to her books, she said, ''I'd really rather just study.''

250-> CITY BALLET: A PREMIERE OF 'LA CREATION DU MONDE'
The New York City Ballet's latest premiere is ''La Creation du Monde,'' with the original ballet score by Darius Milhaud and new, highly abstract treatment by Joseph Duell, a young dancer in the company. Thursday night at the State Theater was the first time that New York has seen the revised version of the ballet Mr. Duell choreographed for the students of the School of American Ballet in their 1981 annual performance. The company premiere took place this summer in Saratoga. On this latest showing, the outline of the piece was very similar to last year's version, but the mood was very different. The progression in Mr. Duell's mind seems to have gone from the literal to the distilled, and that process in itself has been very interesting. The final result is a minor work in which Mr. Duell, who has already choreographed for the City Ballet and several school performances, remains a promising choreographer and one who here handles ensembles and mass groupings with total fluency. As erased as the ballet music's original libretto has been by Mr. Duell, its vestiges are nonetheless present and need to be recalled. ''La Creation du Monde'' or ''The Creation of the World'' was first choreographed by Jean Borlin for Les Ballets Suedois, the Paris-based avant-garde company headed by the Swedish match magnate Rolf de Mare. Milhaud's music was totally infused with the jazz he had heard just before in Harlem and the scenario by the writer, Blaise Cendrars, astutely looked in two directions. It harked back to the recent modernist predilection for African art - as in Picasso's case - and it paved the way for Paris's love affair with black American entertainers. It was shortly after the 1923 premiere of ''La Creation du Monde'' that Rolf de Mare introduced Josephine Baker to Paris. The original scenario had five scenes and the atmosphere was delightfully and, to the critics, disconcertingly influenced by Fernand Leger's schematized jungle-and-animal decor. An idea of this witty pop-out and mobile scenery was given in a reconstruction at London's Victoria and Albert Museum in 1970. The world's creation as seen by the Ballet Suedois is the following: Three giant gods perform magic incantations around a turning mass. A tree grows, another turns into an animal on all fours. Each animal-dancer joins the round until man and woman are created and execute a coupling dance. A violent ritual of witch doctors ends in calm, leaving the couple in an embrace and as a symbol, in Cendrars's words, of springtime. It is impossible to tell how much Mr. Duell has researched the original, but certainly his own ideas are related to the score's own relevance to that libretto. The central pas de deux, here danced with modern stylishness by Maria Calegari and Mel Tomlinson as a contemporary Adam and Eve, certainly occurs in the right place. And if there is no tree onstage, the final embrace has a striking arboreal image. Miss Calegari stands, enclosed in the arms of her Adam, who is behind. Both reach skyward, their arms steepled. If there is no trio of deities, there is, nonetheless, a trio - a supporting cast consisting of Jerri Kumery, David Otto and Michael Puleo. The idea of a lavalike churning mass, of chaos forming into order, remains as the key thematic motif. Having said that, it must also be said that Mr. Duell has given us anything but an Art-Negre Genesis. In 1981, the jungle motif was still present in the costumes. But even then, Mr. Duell changed the primal green and brown leotards of the first performances to more jazzy ones. Now David Mitchell's scenery and costumes are in pinks, blues and mauves. The backdrop has the same hues set off with moldinglike designs of cornered lines. The mood is Art Deco and the choreography echoes the same angles. The signature movement motif is a backward thrust of the hip. For all purposes, the ballet is plotless. The initial circles divide into units, Mr. Tomlinson enters, rotates his shoulders and arms. How much Mr. Duell has rechoreographed is hard to tell, but the main difference seems to make for less interesting choreography than last year's version. He aims for an imitation of jazz and yet has not really absorbed the jazz vocabulary into the classical idiom that is his own vocabulary. When Miss Calegari emerges from the ensemble, Mr. Duell's inspiration rises, although it is not totally sustained in the bluesy duet. Yet in abstracting both movement and theme to such a strong degree, Mr. Duell has offered an unusual experiment, helped largely by the world created through Ronald Bates's lighting. The company is dancing excellently this season; that was obvious in the two ballets by George Balanchine on the program - the always exquisite Mozart ''Divertimento No. 15'' and ''Tchaikovsky Suite No. 3'' in which Lisa Hess made a charming, if slightly earthbound, debut in the third section.

251-> LEFT SIDE OF PATIENT'S ARTIFICIAL HEART IS REPLACED
Surgeons replaced the entire left side of Dr. Barney B. Clark's artificial heart today after it began to fail. At the time of the crisis, he was experiencing a severe drop in blood pressure. After the operation, doctors described Dr. Clark as a ''very, very sick'' man whose condition was complicated because he had developed pnuemonia in his left lung. Asked about the outlook, Dr. Chase N. Peterson said, ''There is no reason why it can't succeed, but at the same time, it will be some awfully tough slugging for Dr. Clark.'' Late in the afternoon, Dr. Clark recovered from the anesthesia and was responding to questions by nodding, the doctors said. Doctors at the University of Utah Medical Center said a crack had developed in a valve of the polyurethane heart and was causing regurgitation of blood. The artificial heart is the first such permanent device to be implanted in a human. Dr. Clark, who doctors said was awake this morning when the heart began to malfunction, was taken to an emergency room. The 61-yearold Seattle dentist and his wife, Una Loy, both took part in deciding that he should be operated on for the third time in 13 days, John Dwan, a hospital spokesman, said. Just before going into surgery at 10:45 A.M., Dr. Clark blew a kiss to his wife, Dr. Robert K. Jarvik, who designed the heart, called the Jarvik-7, said surgeons discovered the fracture in the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle, the heart's principal pumping chamber. They pulled out the faulty ventricle, or pump, and replaced it with a spare ventricle that was snapped into special connectors sewn to Dr. Clark's arteries during the original surgery. ''It was basically a fracture, a stress failure,'' said Dr. Jarvik, ''and why it occurred, I cannot tell you.'' Temporary problems also developed with the left side of the Jarvik heart during the original implantation on Dec. 2. Dr. Peterson, university vice president for medicine, said it took the medical team 25 minutes to replace the ventricle, though the entire surgical procedure took about three hours. The fact that Dr. Clark's blood pressure had dropped precipitously and that his heart must not have been working properly surprised his doctors. They had described the device as having worked perfectly ever since it was implanted and had been beating precisely as it was supposed to, a total of about 1.5 million times, as it pumped blood through his body. But after the rupture, Dr. Clark's blood pressure dropped to a level of 80/ 40 instead of the 140/80 it had been in recent days. At the same time, the amount of blood the heart pumped to the body, the so-called cardiac output, dropped to a range of 1.8 to 3 liters per minute instead of the 6 to 7 liters it had been. Detection of Malfunction Still, Dr. Clark remained conscious. Dr. Jarvik was in the intensive care unit when the malfunction was detected. Other doctors were summoned immediately to begin tests. They quickly turned on a back-up power supply in the machinery at Dr. Clark's bedside. But that maneuver failed to correct the problem. The doctors then deduced that the problem was a malfunction of one of the two valves in the left side of the artificial heart. However, at that point the doctors could not determine its cause. They thought of three possibilities. The first was that a blood clot had formed and had lodged in such a way as to prevent the flow of blood through a valve in the heart. The second was that a piece of tissue had grown in the heart since the implant operation so as to impinge in some way on the valve, thereby interfering with the flow of blood through it. The third possibility was a mechanical of the valve itself, which is what it turned out to be. The Operation Begins It was about 11:30 A.M. when the operation began. Since Dr. Clark had been on an artificial respirator since he suffered several seizures one week ago today, and had a tube in his windpipe as a connection to the artificial respirator, the anesthesiologists did not have to take time to do that maneuver. As the anesthesiologists put Dr. Clark to sleep, his chest was cleansed and antiseptics applied. In the operating room, the medical team, led by Dr. William C. DeVries, opened Dr. Clark's chest by cutting through the original incision that had been made at the time the artificial heart was implanted. It was the same incision through which the surgeons operated when they repaired the air leaks in Dr. Clark's lungs on Dec. 4. The surgeons moved quickly to connect Dr. Clark's blood vessels inside the chest to a heart-lung bypass machine that would enable him to breathe and would pump oxygenated blood to his body. Problem in Mitral Valve As soon as the surgeons opened the artificial heart, the cause of the malfunction became apparent. It was the mitral valve that ordinarily opens and closes in such a way as to prevent blood from flowing backwards from the left ventricle, or bottom chamber, into the left atrium, or the top chamber. Under normal circumstances, the mitral valve acts as a one-way valve. But for some as yet undetermined reason, presumably the result of the stresses of the mechanical heart, the artificial valve had partly broken. It was a complication, Dr. Jarvik said, that the research team met in experiments with the artificial heart on three or four animals in the last two years. At least one animal died because of the problem, Dr. Jarvik said. ''We cannot say why it occurred'' in Dr. Clark's case, Dr. Jarvik said. However, he added that the nature of the artificial heart was such as to put much more pressure on the mitral valve than the human heart does on the natural mitral valve. Replaced With Spare Part Dr. DeVries, the head surgeon, having recognized the problem, then removed the damaged left artificial heart and put in a spare one that Dr. Jarvik provided. Dr. DeVries also put in a new hose that goes through Dr. Clark's abdomen and that is connected to an air compressor that powers the heart. There is a separate air hose for each side of the heart. Dr. DeVries also checked the right side of the artificial heart and found everything in order. There were no clots in either side of the heart. Initial tests showed that there was no evidence of infection in the heart. Both findings were encouraging to Dr. DeVries's team. Dr. DeVries also checked Dr. Clark's lungs and found an area of pneumonia in the left lower lobe that corresponded to what the doctors had seen on a chest X-ray earlier in the morning. The infected area comprised less than one-tenth of Dr. Clark's lung capacity, Dr. Peterson said.

252-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
A variety of books of interest will be reviewed in brief on occasion in this column. Clinging to the Wreckage. A Part of Life. By John Mortimer. 200 pages. Ticknor and Fields. $12.95. Although he is probably best known in this country as the screenwriter who adapted ''Brideshead Revisited'' for television, John Mortimer has had a long and distinguished career in Britain as both a prominent lawyer and a playwright. To these successful roles, one may now add that of memorialist. With ''Clinging to the Wreckage,'' Mr. Mortimer has given us a droll, impressionistic portrait of his own eccentric family and of Britain between the wars By turns tender and ironic, he enlivens the requisite stints at public school and Oxford with graceful wit, then goes on to chronicle, with great good humor, his London adventures in the theater and in court. There are some wonderful Waugh-esque meditations on the oddities of British law and some delightful riffs about the histrionic antics engaged in by English advocates. Best of all, though, are the characters in Mr. Mortimer's story: the head boy at Harrow who became an English butler in Hollywood; the headmaster who ''looked very much like God,'' and most notably, the author's blind father - a blustering attorney who would greet his son with quotations from Shakespeare, take at least two baths a day and direct his wife to read his scandalous divorce briefs aloud to him on the train, a man who could say one ''should avoid the temptation to do anything heroic,'' and yet cry on his deathbed, ''I'm always angry when I'm dying.'' Vedi. By Ved Mehta. 258 pages. Oxford Univer- sity Press. $16.95. In this, the third volume of his autobiography, Ved Mehta memorializes the four years he spent at Bombay's Dadar School for the Blind. The son of a well-to-do, English-educated doctor, Mr. Mehta lost his sight as a result of meningitis and was sent away to school by his father, who was determined that he not suffer the usual fate of the blind in India - that is, begging for alms or caning chairs. Although he would go on to school in the United States and Britain and later become a staff writer for The New Yorker, Mr. Mehta would always retain the sensiblity of an outsider - a sensiblity nurtured by these childhood years, when he was a rich kid in a school attended mainly by poor children, when he was a holiday visitor to his family's home. Set down in fine, poised prose, Mr. Mehta's recollections conjure the vanished landscapes of childhood and colonial India, as well as the anomalous world inhabited by the blind. Italy. The Fatal Gift. By William Murray. 256 pages. Dodd, Mead. $14.95. ''A man who has not been in Italy is always conscious of an inferiority,'' said Samuel Johnson, and for centuries travelers have been making a pilgrimage to that warm peninsula in search of art and beauty. For William Murray, who is half-Italian, half-American, visits to the country had an added allure - they were an opportunity to re-establish links with family and friends, a chance to discover his own past. The first extended visit came in 1947, when Mr. Murray went to Rome as an aspiring singer, and the writings of this period, which make up the first half of ''Italy,'' are a fairly conventional chronicle of a young man's adventures in the city's streets and piazzas. Except for an account of his grandmother's audience with the poet Gabriele d'Annunzio - a meeting of two formidable personalities - these chapters are dull and overly sentimental. Mr. Murray's placid style simply fails to infuse the descriptions of cramped living quarters and chance encounters with any sort of memorable vitality. Consisting largely of pieces he wrote for The New Yorker, the second part of the book is livelier and more entertaining. Here, Mr. Murray's familiarity with the country helps inform his reporting on such subjects as the Red Brigades and the new prosperity of Milan, with social and historical perspective, just as his ease with the language and people contributes a pleasant confidence and brio. Bernard Shaw and Alfred Douglas. A Correspondence. Edited by Mary Hyde. 237 pages. Ticknor and Fields. $25. George Bernard Shaw and Lord Alfred Douglas met for the first and only time over lunch with Oscar Wilde in 1895. Wilde was the one thing the two men had in common: Douglas, of course, was the beautiful young man whose friendship would lead to the playwright's disastrous trial, and Shaw was a friendly rival, who over the years offered professional sympathy and support. Years after Wilde's death, Douglas wrote to Shaw, asking him to contribute a preface to his autobiography, and a feisty correspondence ensued. Certainly it is difficult to imagine two more disparate sensibilities, and the differences between Shaw - the cranky, ascetic socialist - and Douglas - the vain, politically conservative esthete - lend these letters a delicious, crackly tension. ''You are worse than the tailor who got into London society on the strength of having once been kicked by Count D'Orsay,'' Shaw writes. To which the poet replies, ''You are such a mental Narcissus that you cannot believe that anyone who is not drunk can possibly fail to fall down and worship you.'' As time passes, though, a kind of respect and mutual affection also develops, and the correspondents are soon referrring to one another as ''Childe Alfred'' and ''Saint Christopher.'' Intelligently edited by Mary Hyde, these letters provide portraits not only of these two querulous and remarkably outspoken men, but also, by indirection, of their friend Wilde, whose spirit haunts this book like a sad and brightly costumed ghost.

254-> ARMY SUCCEEDS IN FOURTH ATTEMPT TO TEST-FIRE THE PERSHING 2 MISSILE
On its fourth attempt, the Army successfully fired a new Pershing 2 medium-range missile today. Army officers were relieved by the test firing because the Pershing program has been troubled with one failure, two delays in the missile launched today and a Congressional cutoff in funds to produce missiles next year. ''Good burn, good flight, good bird,'' one officer here said of the test. The Pershing missile, with a dummy warhead, was launched at 11:30 A.M. from the McGregor range near El Paso, Tex. It soared to a height of 200 miles and hit its target 65 miles away in the White Sands missile range in New Mexico. Said to Achieve All Goals An Army spokesman said preliminary information showed that all objectives had been achieved. The flight appeared to give the Defense Department new support in its effort to persuade the House Appropriations Committee to restore about $500 million to the 1983 military appropriation bill that had been cut this week by the Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense. Some members had contended that the missile would not work. The test put the Army back on its test schedule for missiles to be deployed in West Germany in late 1983. The Reagan Administration has set a high priority on Pershing deployment to reaffirm the American commitment to Western Europe and to have a bargaining lever in arms negotiations with the Russians. The Administration plans to deploy 108 Pershing missile launchers in West Germany as part of a program to modernize medium-range nuclear weapons in Europe. In addition, 464 ground-launched cruise missiles are to be deployed in Britain, Italy, West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Due in West Germany in a Year The Administration has pledged to send the first nine Pershing missiles and launchers to Germany in December, 1983, with 99 more missiles and launchers to follow by December 1985. The total number of missiles to be deployed has not been disclosed. The Defense Department's annual report to Congress said, however, that new Pershings would replace older Pershings one for one. A standard reference book says 575 older Pershings have been made, while military budgets call for producing 207 new Pershings through 1984. The new Pershings are designed to have a range of 1,100 miles, more than twice that of the older missiles, and to be 10 times more accurate, thus making a smaller nuclear warhead feasible. The missiles are to be fired from launchers that can be reloaded. Army officers say 18 test firings, of which today's was the second, have been planned through August 1983, with final evaluation to be completed in September and initial deployment in December. They said production of test missiles and the first 21 operational missiles was on schedule. The first test missile blew up 17 seconds after being fired in July from Cape Canaveral, Fla. Army officers said the explosion was a result of a weak motor casing, since fixed. Problems with electronic parts caused two delays in the second test. Three More Tests Set The officers said another test firing was set for early December at White Sands, then two more at Cape Canaveral in which the missiles will be fired as far as they will go to put all their guidance and propulsion systems under as much stress as possible. Officials said enough money was appropriated in 1981 and 1982 to pay for the 18 test missiles and enough in 1982 to pay for the 21 operational missiles. But they said about $35 million from the 1983 budget was needed to complete personnel training and to transport missiles. The Army officers said no problems with the missile design had been discovered. They said that production was moving as expected. In the companion program of ground-launched cruise missiles, Defense Department officials said it was on schedule since six of 10 tests have been completed, with five successes. This version of the cruise missile is made by the Convair division of General Dynamics.

255-> Your Money; Withholding On Pensions
MILLIONS of Americans are aware by now that withholding on interest and dividends will begin next July 1. But less known to the public is the fact that there will also be withholding on pensions and annuities - and that, in many instances, this withholding will start next Jan. 1. Many major payers of pensions and annuities, such as banks and insurance companies, have opposed the January deadline established in the 1982 tax law as unrealistic and unworkable. Perhaps as a result, the Internal Revenue Service released new regulations yesterday providing for a postponement on a case-by-case basis until April 1 or July 1, depending on whether the original target causes undue hardship to payers. Whether it starts in January, April or July, however, pension withholding will become a reality next year, to the dismay of large numbers of retirees. How they react to the reduced amounts they will receive therefore will be affected by how well they understand the withholding system authorized by the new law. Under the previous law governing pensions, there was no mandatory withholding for income taxes from pension or other benefit plans. Instead, retirees could elect to have any dollar amount withheld by filing a form W-4P with the trustee of their plan. Between 10 and 15 percent of those who could choose withholding actually did so. The 1982 law states that taxes must generally be withheld from all ''designated distributions'' -consisting of periodic payments, nonperiodic payments or qualified total distributions from taxsheltered plans - of more than $5,400 annually. Those who do not want withholding must promptly file a withholding certificate with the payer of their plan, who is required, in turn, to have notified them of this option. In the mail order business, a similar requirement - whereby recipients must specifically request that a shipment not be delivered - is known as a negative option. Each of the three different types of payments, moreover, now calls for a different type of withholding. Withholding on periodic payments, such as monthly pension checks mailed for more than a year, will be related to the wage withholding tables. Deductions will be on the basis of a married person claiming three exemptions, unless otherwise specified by the person receiving the payment. Nonperiodic, or one-shot, payments such as a lump-sum distribution will be subject to 10 percent withholding, just like the withholding on interest and dividends. The withholding tax table for qualified total distributions has not yet been issued. ''It is so incredibly complex,'' said George W. Cowles, senior vice prsident of the Bankers Trust Company and chairman of the American Bankers Association employee benefit services committee. ''I really believe that many people are going to be unable to understand it.'' ''We don't oppose pension withholding,'' said James McLaughlin, government relations counsel at the bankers association. ''But what's particularly frustrating is that we asked that the system be made simple and something we can administer. They have not made it simple and they have not given us anything to administer. As the 1982 tax law was being enacted, Jan. 1, 1983, was set to be the deadline for withholding on interest and dividends, as well as pension payments. But at the last minute, Congress decided on a sixmonth delay for interest and dividend withholding, while retaining the original date for pension withholding. Now that six-month delay -or at least one for three months - may also be applied to withholding on pensions. Some payers are nevertheless prepared to start withholding at the beginning of next year. For example, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which pays 350,000 annuitants under group pension plans and another 50,000 under individual arrangements, reports that it will be ready to proceed on schedule. ''It was a tight deadline, but we plan on doing it,'' said Albert B. Candido, a Prudential vice president. ''We felt it would be administratively easier to begin in January than to begin in May and then withhold retroactively.'' Mr. Candido noted that about 70 percent of those who responded to his company's withholding notification stated they did not wish withholding. In such situations, as with others, where there is no withholding and significant taxes are due, recipients will have to file estimated tax returns quarterly.

256-> AROUND THE WORLD; NATO Chief Warns Of a Warsaw Pact Lead
The Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, said today that the Warsaw Pact countries held more than a 2-to-1 edge over NATO in both nuclear and conventional forces and that the gap was widening. In an address to the North Atlantic Assembly, General Rogers reiterated his recent call to increase spending on conventional weapons by 4 percent a year. He said such an increase would be adequate for deterring both aggression and intimidation by the end of the 1980's. ''Today's military imbalances,'' he said, ''including present and imminent Warsaw Pact qualitative advances in equipment, have grown so serious and the trends so adverse that we no longer can rationalize away the ever widening gap.''

257-> BRIEFING
Whither Weinberger? P erhaps he doesn't like what he has been reading lately, or maybe he just wants to be alone, like Greta Garbo. Whatever the reason, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger appears to be keeping his distance from Pentagon reporters these days. Last September, when he traveled to the Middle East on short notice, Mr. Weinberger prevented reporters from accompanying him as they had on every overseas trip since he had taken office. Now the Secretary has decided that there will be no reporters tagging along on his next foreign trip, probably to New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and Singapore this fall. Travel is not the only area in which Mr. Weinberger and the press are drifting apart. The secretary has declined repeated requests from Pentagon correspondents for a full-scale news conference. Instead, Mr. Weinberger has confined his appearances before the press to one-subject news conferences, such as a session to praise the Marines for their service in Lebanon or to add a few comments on the report of a Presidential commission studying military manpower. In response to complaints that Mr. Weinberger has been ducking the press, his chief spokesman, Henry E. Catto Jr., points out the number of times the Secretary has appeared on television or granted interviews. The record, however, shows that most of the television appearances have been short interviews on morning talk shows. Also, as he has toured the country, Mr. Weinberger has made himself available to reporters interested primarily in local military issues. In Washington, however, his interviews lately have often been with correspondents for foreign publications. The Defense Secretary generally enjoyed good relations with the Pentagon press corps in his first year in office. But he became annoyed by the coverage of his trip through the Middle East last winter, especially since some news reports did not square with his own reports. A Losing Battle R aymond A. Peck, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, returned to Washington yesterday from Chicago looking like a man who had picked a fight with a motorcycle gang and lost. Mr. Peck was addressing the National Safety Council in the windy city when a man in the audience stood up and began railing against President Reagan and his policies. The highway safety chief, trying to humor the man, let him ramble on. Suddenly, the heckler hurled a book at Mr. Peck, knocking off his glasses and cutting his brow. The book that inflicted the nine-stitch wound was a Bible. Rickover: No Interview Adm. Hyman G. Rickover, who is on the speaking circuit to raise money for a foundation that bears his name, is one of those scheduled to address the 23d annual Multi-Unit Food Service Conference here on Oct. 24. The admiral, who is retired, will be sharing the platform with Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, and Nolan Bushnell, who, according to a news release, ''developed and then sold Atari to Warner and now has created one of the fast food industry's premier success stories by combining two of America's passions, pizza and video computer games.'' The news release also promised that Admiral Rickover, who has rarely given interviews, would be available to answer reporters' questions after his speech. When reporters began calling to take advantage of the admiral's apparent change of heart, conference officials double-checked with his office. The admiral, who, to put it mildly, doesn't care for fast food, quickly set them straight: He would no more grant an interview than he would eat a pizza. 'Let's Talk It Over' S enator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia, keeps saying it is his idea, but Senator Henry M. Jackson, Democrat of Washington, keeps promoting it as his. ''It'' is a proposal for an ''expanded hot line,'' a Soviet-American communications center that would be staffed around the clock by Soviet and American officials, military and civilian, with access to the highest levels of their Governments. In his latest speech calling for such a center, Mr. Jackson said he could not understand why a world that has organized an International Wizard of Oz Club, an International Save the Pun Foundation and an International Barbie Doll Collection Club is so slow to recognize the need for an International Let's Talk It Over Center to prevent accidental nuclear war.

258-> A NEARLY PAINLESS WAY TO SAVE TRANSIT FARES
To the Editor: Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has predicted a $1 subway and bus fare for New York City and at least a 50 percent railroad commuter fare increase (with another 25 percent to come in January) if the State Legislature does not enact a fare subsidy package by Friday. v. hat does this mean, in dollars, to riders and taxpayers? The $1 fare would cost a typical rider $250 a year more. For a family whose members take a total of 40 transit trips a week, the added annual cost would be $500. These enormous burdens fall on people who are transit captives and earn the least in the region. Three out of five New York City households own no cars, and 63 percent earn less than $20,000 a year. A commuter from western Nassau who now pays $90 a month for his railroad ticket (many commuters pay twice that much) and takes 10 subway trips a week would shell out $680 more a year at a 50 percent increase and $940 more for the full 75 percent increase. Such additional costs would surely drive large numbers of people into cars - and onto roads that are already suffering from record congestion. By comparison, a $306 million transit subsidy package could prevent any fare increases this year by spreading relatively minor increases among all the beneficiaries of a reasonably priced transit system. The Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A. has proposed four measures and has hired an economist to analyze the equity of each. * Converting the state gasoline tax from 8 cents a gallon to 8 percent a gallon would generate, at present lowered prices, $104 million a year regionwide. Based on gas usage of a typical household earning more than $20,000 a year, the 1.6 cents more per gallon would add only $10 to that household's annual gas bill. Since poor people drive less, a family earning less than $10,000 would pay only $2 a year more. All would benefit from roads not further congested by commuters driven off transit by fare increases. * A $15 surcharge on the registration fee of all vehicles would generate $65 million in transit subsidies and is equitable because auto owners in the M.T.A. region earn twice as much as subway riders and because more affluent families have more cars. (Adjusting the registration fee according to the price of the car would be even more progressive.) * A 1.5 percent surcharge on the state income tax paid in the M.T.A. region would add little to the tax bills of all those who benefit directly and indirectly from the economic engine that is Manhattan, but it would generate $82 million. Households earning less than $10,000 would pay $1.50 a year more in taxes. Households earning more than $20,000 would pay $8.40 more. Much of the regional income to be taxed for transit comes directly or indirectly from salaries earned in the city and spent in the suburbs. * Reinstating the 10 percent capital gains tax, with closed loopholes, on the transfer of properties and leaseholds in New York City worth more than $1 million would generate the needed balance of $55 million. These properties enjoy windfall profits fueled by international inflation and their fortuitous location in a city whose existence is based on a functioning, reasonably priced transit system. The users of the goods and services produced by the commercial tenants who may ultimately bear these costs are generally more affluent. And such tenants' decisions to relocate have historically been prompted largely by the increasing difficulty and cost of getting their employees and their goods into and out of the central business district. Since all these taxes are deductible from Federal income and corporate taxes, their real cost is actually less than indicated, and they keep our dollars in the M.T.A. region, not exporting them to Ronald Reagan to spend on munitions. The fate of the transit lifeline of the New York metropolitan region, with its importance to the entire state, cannot be dependent on unfounded impressions of who will be hurt by transit subsidies. The alternative to generally poorer transit-riding households paying $300 to $1,000 more in fares is for all the families of the M.T.A. region, because all are beneficiaries of the system, to pay $20 to $40 a year more in federally deductible charges. CAROLYN S. KONHEIM New York, Dec. 12, 1982 The writer heads the finance committee of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A.

259-> BEAUTY; STAYING POWER
Mother and grandmother remember them: those lipsticks in vivid shades of red, blue-red and orange that would neither wipe nor kiss away. Now, with improved for-mulations, new versions of the classic longlasting lipsticks are in vogue again. Their biggest advantage, of course, is their staying power. Unlike the average product, which may need to be reapplied as often as every half hour, long-lasting lipsticks stay on for as long as four to six hours, eliminating the need for frequent touch-ups. Long-lasting lipsticks also are less expensive. Since the product lasts longer and is applied less often, it needn't be purchased as frequently. And considering the lofty prices of some products - a lipstick that sells for $7.50 actually can cost as much as $93.75 per ounce - the savings can be considerable. Yet despite new formulations and advances in technology, the coloring agents that are responsible for the staying power of these lipsticks are also the ones associated with allergic reactions and irritation of the lips. Questions remain over the long-term effects of using these staining dyes, as well as the extent to which all lipstick colors actually penetrate the skin. ''These are questions that technology wasn't there to answer, that the Federal Food and Drug Administration never raised and that we never raised,'' says Norman F. Estrin, senior vice president for science of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association, which conducts research for the cosmetics industry. In the meantime, however, experts are taking a closer look at two colors widely used in all types of lipsticks, as well as in other cosmetics: D&C (drug and cosmetic) Red No. 9 and D&C Red No. 19, both of which show evidence, in animal studies, of being carcinogens. Although women have been rouging their lips from time immemorial, early versions of modern lipsticks -composed of coloring agents in an oil and wax base - date back to the years just before World War I. Long-lasting or staining lipsticks -dating from the 1950's - are not very different from others. All lipsticks contain oils, waxes and colorants. But in addition to the pigments - insoluble colors - found in every lipstick, long-lasting types contain specific colorants called bromo acids that have staining qualities. Although other lipsticks may use bromo acids, long-lasting ones contain higher amounts, according to Dr. Samuel Zuckerman, a director of H. Kohnstamm & Company, a supplier of pigments and dyes to the food, drug and cosmetics industries. In the last few years, a number of new long-lasting lipsticks have been introduced. These include Sheer to Stay by Coty; L'Artiste Enduring Lipstick by L'Oreal; Maquiriche Lasting Mat Lip Colour by Lancome; Eterna '27' Enriched All-Day Lipstick by Revlon; Colorfast by Max Factor; Natural Wonder Fresh-All-Day Moisturizing Lipstick by Revlon; LipCreme by Elizabeth Arden; Hours Longer by Flame-Glo, and Re-Nutriv All-Day Lipstick by Estee Lauder. These join the ranks of older long-lasting lines: Coty ''24,'' introduced in 1955, and the no-smear lipstick introduced by the pioneer in the field, the chemist Hazel Bishop, in 1950. Although the new products are almost as long wearing as those of the past, they are not as irritating to the lips because of advances in formulation in the last few decades, according to industry experts. ''The lipsticks our moms used were made with a staining dye that was used in very high concentrations,'' says Monroe Lanzet, senior vice president of research and development for Max Factor and chairman of the color-additives committee of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. ''They were a hazard because they might dry out the lips and cause cracking,'' he says. ''Toxicity or irritation is dose-related, and that means you can use a dye at low concentrations with absolutely no ill effects. But when you use it at 3 or 3.5 percent, as we did 30 or 40 years ago, you can cause a great deal of irritation. The products now contain one-eighth to one-tenth of the concentration.'' In addition, the old products used either harsh solvents to dissolve the dyes or just more dye than they could dissolve into solution, says David Garlen, president of Cosmetech Laboratories, a consulting firm that represents Hazel Bishop Industries Inc. All long-lasting lipsticks are based on the use of three staining colors certified by the Food and Drug Administration, known chemically as halogenated fluoresceins, according to Dr. Zuckerman. These are D&C Orange No. 5, which leaves an orange stain, D&C Red No. 21, which leaves a medium red stain, and D&C Red No. 27, which leaves a very strong blue-red stain. ''When you want a long-lasting lipstick, you will incorporate one or more of these three colorants into the lipstick along with other pigments, so that when the other pigments wear off the stain remains on the lips,'' Dr. Zuckerman says. All lipstick colors must be tested and proved safe before receiving F.D.A. approval. The Color Additive Amendments of 1960 placed the responsibility of proving cosmetic colors safe with the industry. All colors already in use, it said at the time, could continue to be used on a provisional, or interim, basis, while they were being tested. Although tests began at that time, in 1977 the F.D.A. required further testing because of advances in examination technology. At present, 17 colors are on the provisional list. Of particular concern are tests on D&C Red No. 9 and D&C Red No. 19, which have shown evidence in animals of carcinogenicity, according to Mr. Estrin. In the case of D&C Red No. 9, the tests showing carcinogenicity were done by the National Toxicology Program under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The F.D.A. has until Aug. 30 next year to review them and make its final decision. The animal studies on D&C Red No. 19 showing evidence of carcinogenicity were done by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association. Its final report was submitted to the F.D.A. last February; the agency has until February 1983 to decide on the color's fate. ''At the very best, it's a close shot,'' says Dr. Ken Falci, supervisor of the division of food and color additives within the bureau of foods at the F.D.A. ests on the staining colors D&C Orange No. 5 and D&C Reds Nos. 21 and 27, all on the provisional list, indicate that these are acceptable for use, according to authorities at the F.D.A. But since the staining colors, even in low dosages, may irritate the lips and trigger reactions in people who are prone to allergies, companies such as Almay that market hypoallergenic products say they do not use them. Some lipsticks not marketed as long-lasting still rate high on staying power, according to consumers who participated in surveys conducted by Patricia Boughton and Martha Ellen Hughes in ''The Buyer's Guide to Cosmetics'' (Random House, 1981). These included Revlon's Ultima II Lipstick/Lipliner Pencil; Diane Von Furstenberg lipsticks; Chanel's Rouge a Levres; Frances Denney's Moisture-Silk Lipcolor, and Cover Girl's Moisturized Lipstick. At any rate, in the face of multibillion-dollar lipstick sales, it is not likely that the cosmetics industry's color palette will shrink dramatically. Recently, a cosmetics executive wryly viewed an industry bereft of the red colors used for almost as long as women have been wearing makeup. It wouldn't necessarily mean the end of lipstick, he said. But the colors that would be left would be green, brown and black.

It said that the downgrading, which affects about $884 million of outstanding debt, reflected continuing and increasing operating losses resulting from current low levels of demand.

263-> HOMELESS CRISSCROSS U.S. UNTIL THEIR CARS AND THEIR DREAMS BREAK DOWN
Across the country, in church shelters, abandoned buildings, in broken-down cars with license plates from far away, the tide of homeless Americans is rising. They are the victims of darkened factories in the industrial Middle West, of cuts in welfare benefits that force them out of tenements in Chicago, of the renovation of old transient hotels on Manhattan's Upper West Side. They are migrant tobacco workers stranded in Springfield, Mass., and idled lumbermen who have lost their houses in the Northwest. And they make up a swelling tribe of nomads, victims of an oftenbroken A shelter offer is not always welcomed. About New York, Page B3. dream that a job, a home in time for Christmas, awaits them at the next city, if only they could get here. ''The problem is dire and it is getting worse,'' said Robert M. Hayes, head of the National Coalition for the Homeless in New York. ''We've seen estimates that there are between a half million to two million homeless people in the country, but the number is irrelevant because whatever the number is, it is perfectly clear that the need is far greater than the help that is available.'' On Wednesday, the first Congressional hearing on homelessness in America since the Depression will be held by the House Subcommittee on Housing and Economic Development. Officials say there may be 36,000 homeless men and women and 20,000 homeless children on the streets of the New York City alone, where the lack of affordable housing has greatly contributed to the problem. In one case on Long Island, Mr. Hayes says, the father became disabled and lost his income, forcing the family to live in a pickup truck at a shopping mall. Mr. Hayes's group went to court last month in an attempt to force Nassau County to provide emergency shelter for homeless families, as it succeeded in doing in New York City. The city uses five or six hotels to house families who have lost their homes to fire. Armories, opened two winters ago for families whose homes had no heat, have become part of the shelter system. The alleys and rail yards of major cities have long harbored destitute men, the hobos and derelicts that have long influenced the public's perception of homelessness. But church and welfare workers are now talking about the ''new poor'' and the ''new homeless.'' The officials say that while many of the homeless stay put in the communities where they once knew better times, an increasing number are taking to the road. ''These are families who had been fairly stable in their jobs and skills, people who may have been moving up an employee ladder and seemed to be heading somewhere,'' said Les Jones, head of the Denver Traveler's Aid office. ''They could be auto assemblers or steel workers or service workers used to fairly good pay who lost their jobs in the recession,'' he said. ''At first they stayed at home, eating into their resources, waiting for the job to come back, and finally, when their money is almost all gone, they pile into the car and head for someplace else, for out here, looking for, hoping for, the $10-to-$12-an-hour job they had before.'' But, Mr. Jones said, those jobs are not here either, or in Tucson, Oklahoma City, Houston, or any of the other western cities that have lured men and women in boom times. New migrants are met by scarce minimum-wage jobs, hard-to-find and expensive housing, and few government services. 'Look at Where We Are Now' ''If you can believe it,'' said James Thom, lately of Ely, Minn. ''Last August we owned our own house and a service station on the busiest intersection in town. Owned them both, and look at where we are now.'' Now the only thing Mr. Thom owns is the broken-down 1957 Chevrolet school bus parked behind the St. Vincent de Paul church center in Denver's Hispanic neighborhood. The bus is his family's home. In it Mr. Thom and his wife, Bonnie Sue, and their children, 18-month-old Nicholas and six-year-old Jessica, shiver through the deepening winter nights and while away the pale mountain days trying to find the money to buy the gas and transmission parts that would get them to Tucson and the jobs they believe they can find there. The Thoms are victims of the industrial recession. Ely lies in the Minnesota Iron Range, and as the economy slowed down, demand for steel faltered. Ely's six iron mines, along with many others on the Range, shut down. A lot of Ely businesses, including Mr. Thom's filling station, were forced to close too. ''A laid-off miner isn't driving to work anymore and he sure isn't buying much gas,'' Mr. Thom said. 'We Want to Get Moving On' ''We heard all about the jobs there were in Colorado and Arizona,'' added Mrs. Thom, who had just returned from an unsucessful attempt to get free government surplus cheese. ''But if the jobs are here, we sure can't see them. That's why we want to get moving on, only'' - she smiled ruefully - ''we can't do that either.'' Dan Hancock, who had a factory job in Newark until last year, said: ''The way we get by is I go behind the supermarkets where they throw away a lot of good fruit and vegetables, and I can get the stuff right out of the garbage dumpsters. If you get the right spices, I can make potato soup taste like clam chowder.'' When he lost his job, he drifted to Texas, looking for work. There was none, but he met and married his wife, Sue. With her daughter Donna they moved to California, then to North Dakota, where a janitor's job lasted until this summer, and then to a carnival job in Clackamas County, Ore., outside Portland. But then the carnival closed for the winter, and the Hancocks live in a Portland hotel that has been made into a shelter for the homeless. They scrounge for food and worry about finding shoes for Donna who, because of their traveling, has not yet started school. 'They're Crying and Frustrated' Bill Lewis, housing director for Northwest Pilot Project Inc., a community service group, said: ''Not a day goes by that I don't get a call from someone being evicted because of running out of rent. By the time they get to me after calling 10 or 15 agencies, they're crying and frustrated. I don't know what the answer is.'' And in Phoenix, Peggy Gearan, director of the St. Vincent de Paul Transient Aid Program, said: ''These people are going from California to Florida and from Florida to California, and they all pass through here, just like ants, moving all the time.'' Ninety-two percent of the calls Mrs. Gearan gets come from stranded families, she said. ''We pay for fixing up their cars, put in gas, and get them moving as fast as we can.'' Phoenix does not welcome transients. At one point it closed all its public shelters and only recently, under pressure, allowed one to open. Foraging Discouraged The city also passed a law making it a misdemeanor to lie down in public. It has declared garbage public property, making it illegal to pick through it, and there have been proposals to spray the dumpsters with kerosene, making the refuse inedible, to discourage foraging. The attitude is not unique to Phoenix. ''The Bums Are Back,'' said a leaflet handed out by merchants near Chicago's People's Church, a shelter for the homeless. Terry Sharp, of the Good Samaritan Shelter here, defended his homeless people. ''We don't know and we don't ask what they've done in the past,'' he said. ''If you're cold and hungry you get helped, but I suppose might find some guys who started missing on their support payments and are running from that. But not much else.'' Crimes and Suffering Children Indeed, if crimes are committed, they are against the homeless. A young woman sleeping under a bridge here in town was found murdered last summer. Edward Langley, who said he has put 100,000 miles on his 1968 Rambler since he and his family left Michigan a year ago, said: ''Getting your car broken into and vandalized is something you get used to when people know you're from out of state and have no place to go. They just figure we're bums anybody can pick on.'' And the children suffer and not just from the lack of school or homes, or from the candy and sweetened cereals that seem to be a staple of charity donations at many shelters. They also suffer from the neglect of parents too preoccupied with their plight to care for them properly. Holly Reed, seven months old, was one of those children. Last Monday she froze to death while sleeping in the car she lived in with her mother and father in the streets of Denver.

265-> Was the Drug Plan Only a Ploy?
Just before the November elections, President Reagan announced a new plan to fight organized crime and drug trafficking. It called for adding 900 agents to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration and creating task forces to conduct major investigations in 12 cities. The plan was impressive. The Administration seemed ready at last to go beyond rhetoric about crime. But funding remained a problem. Mr. Reagan said the $130 million could be found by cutting back other Justice Department programs. That shaky commitment aroused skepticism. Was this just another bold anticrime proposal sur-facing in the thick of a campaign and destined to sink from sight after the votes were counted? The skeptics now seem vindicated. The Administration duly asked Congress to pare the needed funds from other budgets. But when this met opposition, the White House backed off. The Office of Management and Budget now says it cannot find enough money in other programs, and offers no alternative. The Administration cannot be held serious about its plan if it will not help make the difficult financial choices. Not to fund the program, now that the election is over, turns an admirable plan into a cynical ploy. In the matter of crime-busting, that is disgraceful.

266-> Talks on Selling Sotheby's Held
Sotheby's, the auction house, indicated it was up for sale. The 239-year-old fine art auctioner said it had entered into preliminary talks with unidentified potential buyers. It said there was no assurance that ''any transaction or arrangement will be effected.'' Sotheby's had a loss equivalent to $2.5 million in the six months ended last February, the first trading loss in its history. It blamed a drop in sales for the loss. High interest rates, it said, drew investors away from art and made it costly for dealers to carry large stocks. Sotheby's said that while the market for high-quality and rare objects remained strong, sales of coins, stamps and modern jewelry were weak.

267-> Giants Trade Morgan to Phils
The Philadelphia Phillies have obtained the veteran infielder Joe Morgan and Al Holland, a top relief pitcher, from the San Francisco Giants for the pitcher Mike Krukow and two minor leaguers. The trade was announced today, although the Phillies' president, Bill Giles, said it was actually made last week at the annual winter baseball meetings. Giles said the Phillies had to reach agreement on a new contract with Morgan before the trade could be completed. The Phillies, who traded their second baseman, Manny Trillo, to Cleveland at the meetings last week, had sought the 39-year-old Morgan as a replacement for Trillo after Morgan reached a contract impasse with the Giants. ''I'm very happy that we were able to acquire a second baseman of the caliber of Joe Morgan and a relief pitcher with Al Holland's credentials,'' said Giles. ''Our head major league talent evaluator, Hugh Alexander, says Holland is one of the top four relievers in the National League.'' Morgan Twice Won M.V.P. Morgan had sought a $600,000 contract for the coming season; the Giants offered $450,000, and Morgan's agent announced that he would go to salary arbitration. Morgan, who twice was named the National League's most valuable player in his eight seasons with the Cincinnati Reds, played two seasons with the Giants after signing with them in February of 1981. Last season, he hit .289 with 14 home runs and 61 runs batted in. His best season was 1976, when he batted .320 with 27 home runs, 111 runs batted in and 60 stolen bases. In Philadelphia, Morgan will play alongside his former Cincinnati teammate, Pete Rose, who at 42 is the Phillies' first baseman. An 18-year veteran, Morgan was the National League's most valuable player in 1975 and 1976, when the Reds won consecutive World Series. He, Ernie Banks and Mike Schmidt are the only National League players to have won consecutive most-valuable-player honors. Holland E.R.A. 3.33 in 1982 Holland, 30, a left-hander, posted a 7-3 record with a 3.33 earned run average and saved five games for the Giants last season. His career record is 19-11, with 19 saves and a 2.60 e.r.a. Krukow, a right-hander, won 13 games, lost 11 and posted a 3.12 e.r.a. as a starter for the Phillies last year. The 30-year-old Krukow was obtained from the Chicago Cubs last season in a multiple-player trade that included the catcher Keith Moreland and the pitcher Dickie Noles. In addition to Krukow, the Giants obtained Mark Davis, a 22-yearold left-handed pitcher, and Charles Penigar, an outfielder. Davis was once one of the most promising pitchers in the Phillies' farm system, but has been troubled with arm problems. Last season, his record was 5-12 with a 6.24 e.r.a. at Oklahoma City. Morgan Helped Oust Dodgers Penigar, 19, hit .251 with Spartanburg in the Class A Carolina League last season. He also stole 65 bases. The Giants were edged out in the National League Western Division race in the final week of the season by the division champion Atlanta Braves and the runner-up Los Angeles Dodgers, but Morgan's homer on the next-to-last day of the season helped knock the Dodgers from contention.

269-> BALDWIN APPEALS ASSET RULING
The Baldwin-United Corporation, a leading financial services company, said yesterday that it was appealing a decision by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to reduce the value of its insurance assets by $111 million. Pending appeal, Morley Thompson, president, said the company had added $214 million to its assets to cover the discrepancy and to allow for future growth. The company had valued the assets at $3.2 billion. The assets, he said, were added to its Arkansas insurance subsidiaries. He said the additional assets were required because of heavy sales of single-premium deferred annuities, a tax-deferred insurance program paying compound interest of 13 1/2 percent a year after retirement. Mr. Thompson said the asset discrepancy'' is a routine thing. It's part of our Arkansas insurance audit every three years. It only means that, for purposes of computing the amount of business you can do,, Arkansas wants more capital.'' He contended that unidentified short sellers were ''planting'' such negative information about the company to drive the stock down. Short sellers sell borrowed stock, betting that they can buy it back at a lower price to cover their positions. Short Position in Baldwin By mid-October, the short position in Baldwin stock stood at more than 832,000 shares, although the position now is thought to be slightly smaller. By the close of trading yesterday, Baldwin stood at $38.75, up $1.875 in heavy trading. Carol Neves, vice president of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, who follows the company, said that part of the reason for the rise in the stock was Baldwin's favorable earnings forecast last Monday and Merrill Lynch's own bullish report. Mr. Thompson had said he expected Baldwin's third-quarter earnings to rise at least 85 percent to $1.50 a share from 81 cents a share a year earlier. Last Monday Merrill Lynch increased its 1983 earnings estimate to between $8 and $8.50 a share from its earlier $7.25-$7.50 forecast. ''I think it's a very well managed company,'' Miss Neves said, ''and has an annuity product line that can do well in a high interest-rate environment but also has a number of savings and loans, MGIC Investment Corporation and mortgagebanks, which can do very well in a lower interest rate environment.'' Baldwin Earnings Reports In Chicago, meanwhile, H. Robert Holmes, president of Gilford Securities, who said he had clients with short positions in Baldwin, maintained that ''Baldwin reports huge earnings increases but they're basically non-cash earnings; they're bookkeeping adjustments, aggressive accounting and deferred tax credits.'' Mr. Holmes said that a 7-page negative report on Baldwin, written in August by Gilford, and circulated among Baldwin short sellers, contends that the company has a ''staggering amount of short-term debt, $1.2 billion.'' He said that if Baldwin had non-cash earnings, ''the question is, how can you pay off the debt?'' He further noted that in August and early September, at a time the short position in Baldwin stood at about a million shares, Baldwin had made ''a concerted effort'' to convince shareholders to take possession of stock left with brokers. He called it a ''successful campaign to squeeze the shorts,'' explaining that short sellers normally borrowed their stock from brokers but that brokers had few shares to lend. Asked whether the addition of capital would have any impact on other Baldwin operations, Mr. Thompson said that it would have none.

270-> ABOUT CARS; CHRYSLER'S SPORTS SEDAN
ORIGINALITY hasn't been much of a key word in Detroit for a long time, but Chrysler Corporation does seem to have come up with an unusual new idea: a $40,000 car for $10,000. Of course, that is not precisely what you get in the company's recently introduced E class sports sedans, but the attempt is a good one - and in case buyers have missed the point, there are chrome numbers and letters on the boot in the same elegant type face used by Mercedes-Benz. Then, too, there is the five-pointed Chrysler star on nose and tail, and that is bound to evoke images of the Mercedes three-pointed trademark. Heavy-handed styling clues aside, however, Chrysler has a very nice automobile in its E-class sedan and in the Dodge versions of the car, which are called 600 and 600 ES. Basically, the front-wheel-drive vehicles are yet another permutation of the K-body on which the company has staked its future, but they are larger, roomier and far superior in a number of ways. The one that graced the driveway was a silver Dodge 600 ES, a sixpassenger four-door that combines a bit of traditional American kitsch with an unexpected helping of European handling. Outside, it was distinguished by a louvered grille, wide rub-rails, and blackout trim. Inside, there was red plush, corduroy and plastic, set off by Chrysler's omnipresent wood, the best that Detroit's forest of chemical vats can supply. The ES differs from the 600 in its suspension, decor and number of gadgets, but both cars have a 103.1-inch wheelbase and they are 185.6 inches over all, more than half a foot longer than a K-body. That translates into more trunk room as well as interior space. One of the car's innovations is an ''easy close'' deck lid that uses torsion bars and drive links to underbalance the lid when it is nearly closed. Unfortunately, both hood and trunk lid also tend to fly up when released, threatening an uppercut to the unwary. Behind the wheel, tricks of a more pleasant sort greet the driver. There is, for instance, an ''optical horn'' that allows high beams to be flashed in daylight, warning the car ahead that you want to pass. There is a thing called Travel Computer that shows time, date, trip mileage, average speed, average and instantaneous fuel economy, and the car's range, given the fuel remaining in the tank. And then there is the trickiest thing of all: The car talks. Unfortunately, it is a nag. Chrysler calls the system Electronic Voice Alert, and it monitors 11 functions, jabbering on about them in endless fashion. ''Please fasten your seatbelts,'' says the voice in resonant radio-announcer style. ''Thank you,'' it says after you have complied. ''A door is ajar, a door is ajar!'' the voice says in alarm, interrupting the radio to get the word across. ''Fuel is low,'' says E.V.A., its tone indicating that you should have been more provident. Worse, it won't let you alone. Even when everything is fine, the system seems compelled to tell you so. Maybe E.V.A. would become friendlier as time goes by, but a lot of owners are probably going to disconnect that smug-sounding fellow. The car has bucket seats divided by a console containing two storage bins, and there is a miniscule glove box in the dash. The seats have a folding armrest, and they offer reasonable support, although the driving position could be improved. Primarily, the problem is that the padded and rubber-wrapped sports steering wheel is too close to the driver, a regular affliction with tilt-type wheels. There was a time when Detroit solved the problem with a telescoping adjustment to the steering column, but that nicety seems to have gone by the board. The car does have every other comfort that could be wished, including power sideview mirrors that work with a system of arrow buttons a la Datsun. Quality was reminiscent of Japan, too, and it indicates how far Chrysler has come. The real story with the 600 ES, though, is in its standard ''sports-handling'' suspension, which includes larger front and rear anti-sway bars and stiffer shock absorbers. In addition, the car is shod with 14-inch Goodyear Eagle GT's, and they help to make it the most surefooted of Chrysler products. Suspension is stiff, with a typically European feel, and the power steering is pleasantly heavy as well. The car is not soft in any sense, yet it is a luxury tourer. The car is solid and quiet; highway ride is excellent. The silver Dodge had the optional 2.6-liter Mitsubishi four, although the weaker 2.2-liter engine, built in this country, is standard. In what is otherwise a true sports sedan, the bigger engine is available only with automatic transmission, while the 2.2 can be had with Chrysler's new five-speed. Federal economy ratings have not been established, but the estimate is for 24 miles per gallon, city, and 38, highway, with the manual gearbox and the small engine. In actual driving, the 2.6 with automatic averaged 22.8 m.p.g. in a city/highway cycle, not bad in a 2,564-pound car that tries hard to deliver on its unusual promise.

276-> Deep Immunity
Since Oct. 1, when it sighted an alien periscope, the Swedish Navy has been searching a narrow channel on the Baltic coast for an intruding submarine. The world watches, but the pursuit of the elusive vessel is no sport for spectators. Officials first announced that the submarine had been trapped, then that it could have escaped, then that the search might be continued indefinitely. There could be no better demonstration of a submarine's capacity to resist detection. The intruder was pursued by 40 Swedish naval vessels in a channel 12 miles long and 3 miles wide. Though some criticized the Swedes' tactics, no navy can be certain it would have done any better. The submarine had only to rest on the bottom of the bay to make no noise. Sonar searches are thwarted when the rapidly changing salinity and temperature of shallow coastal waters interferes with the echoes. In the open ocean the searcher has a somewhat better chance. Computer processing of the chatter from the U.S. Navy's worldwide array of underwater microphones sometimes helps spot submarines. But as submarines become quieter, listeners find it harder to distinguish their sounds from the sea's natural noises. The day when the oceans become transparent is far distant. Both in detection and in the building of silent submarines, the United States is believed to hold a substantial technical advantage. While the search for a way to make land-based missiles survivable seems ever more problematic, the deterrent force carried by submarines continues to look safe.

277-> AROUND THE NATION; Dairy Price Support Plan Blocked in Carolina Suit
A judge has blocked the Federal Government from collecting a new price support assessment from dairy farmers until a hearing scheduled for Jan. 3. Federal District Judge Matthew J. Perry granted the temporary restraining order Tuesday in a suit filed by Bryan Patrick, the South Carolina Agriculture Commissioner, and consumer and farmer representatives. They argued that Agriculture Secretary John R. Block put the assessment regulation into effect without conducting the required public hearings. The restraining order blocks a nationwide program designed to make dairy farmers pay for some of their own price supports. The program is to collect up to $600 million a year for the Government to buy surplus milk products and keep prices at their current support price of $13.10 per 100 pounds.

278-> 600 LIVING ON A PRIVATE HAWAIIAN ISLAND
That lumpy form rising out of the sea on the southeast horizon is Niihau, a privately held island as inaccessible to the public as any place in the United States. About 600 Polynesians with a fraction of Japanese ancestry live on the 18-mile-long island in 19th-century Hawaiian style, speaking the Hawaiian language in everyday life. They have no electricity, running water, liquor or firearms. There is no jail, nor are there police officers, and the Congregational minister, who is one of them, is the arbiter of disputes. The owners keep the island as a ranch where cattle and sheep graze on plants that can survive in an arid climate. Niihau lies directly downwind from the peak on the island of Kauai and so gets almost no rain from the northeast trade winds. A commercial honey operation depends on the yellow blossoms of the keawe tree, whose bean-like fruit then becomes fodder and whose wood becomes charcoal. Owned by Family Since 1864 Niihau has been owned by one family of cane planters since 1864 when Elizabeth M. Sinclair, a New Zealander, moved her family to Kauai, the northwestern island of the Hawaii chain. Almost as an afterthought when acquiring extensive holdings on Kauai, Mrs. Sinclair purchased Niihau for $10,000 in gold from the Polynesian monarchy that then ruled Hawaii. From that day to this, the island has been a private place for Mrs. Sinclair's descendants. Today most of what she held is in the Gay & Robinson Company, a sugar cane plantation, on Kauai's south coast opposite Niihau. Helen Robinson is the present senior family member. Her son, Bruce, is the manager of the family enterprises. Neither would agree to be interviewed about Niihau. People who have heard the Robinsons speak of Niihau say the mother and son feel that the island is a family property that the Robinsons may manage as they see fit and with no responsibility to account to the public. Called 'Forbidden Island' To a remarkable degree, the Robinsons have been able to control story-telling about ''the Forbidden Island,'' as local people refer to it. It is common for a professional man to say, when imparting some lore about Niihau, ''Don't use my name.'' The Robinsons have refused for decades to permit reporters to ride over to Niihau on the World War II landing barge that carries provisions in. Officials from public agencies, however, visit there freely as their duties require. Dr. Mitsugi Nakashima, the district superintendent of schools, said he had visited it ''a number of times.'' He described the island as very dry, the buildings of sawed planks as ''very weathered,'' and the life as ''simple in the extreme.'' There is no electricity on Niihau, nor is there a system for piping water into the houses. Kerosene stoves are used for cooking. Rainfall is caught on roofs and moved into barrels at each home to augment the communal water supply. 34 Students at School The Robinsons' Niihau ranch has 63 jobs. The ranch owns all the buildings, including the three one-room structures where teachers paid by the state are instructing 34 students this year. All three teachers were born on Niihau. The teacher in charge is Jean Keale, who holds the island's only teaching certificate. She is one of only two Niihau grade school graduates to earn a college degree. The other is Mrs. Keale's daughter, Jean Beniamina. After graduating from the island grade school, each woman went to Honolulu to Kamehameha School, operated for Hawaiians by the Bishop Estate, Hawaii's largest nongovernment landowner. There is now but one student from Niihau at Kamehameha School. Both Mrs. Keale and Mrs. Beniamina graduated from the University of Hawaii. Mrs. Beniamina, who is married to a Robinson cane worker of Japanese descent, now is a teaching aide at Waimea Canyon School, where a dozen or so Niihau students are usually in classes. These are children of Niihau families whose job assignments have been shifted temporarily to Kauai's cane fields. Start With Limited English These students come to the school only partly competent in English, said Jacqueline Carpentier, the principal. In their brief stays, a special federally financed program tries to teach them to broaden their English and such things as how to shop in stores and handle money. Mrs. Carpentier said: ''I make no effort to stop them from speaking Hawaiian because I see it as important to maintain their culture. So it is common to hear two Niihau students speaking in Hawaiian.'' Mrs. Beniamina translates. She will spend Christmas with her mother on Niihau and looks forward ''to talking with everybody all the time in Hawaiian.'' She said she loves the island, fondly remembers her childhood there and thinks about returning there to live. ''But I've gotten used to turning on the lights,'' she said. ''And I like the refrigerator, too.'' No Liquor and No Guns The Robinsons strictly enforce rules against liquor and guns. While tobacco is not banned, the ranch owners will not supply it, so residents who smoke must find a way to import tobacco. There is a Congregational Church on Niihau. A knowledgeable person who asked not to be identified said a Ten Commandments behavior code was what the Robinson family expected its tenants and employees to follow on Niihau. ''There's no fooling around with somebody else's wife,'' this source said. ''And if a boy gets a girl pregnant, he marries her, and that's all there is to it.'' There is a self-reliance and hardiness to the Niihau people that is said to please the Robinsons. The owners were particularly proud that after Hurricane Iwa on Nov. 23 damaged or destroyed a dozen buildings, the islanders immediately made repairs and shifted around so that no one was homeless.

279-> YANKEES TRADE MAZZILLI
Lee Mazzilli, who started the year with the Mets, will not end it with the Yankees. Mazzilli, once the favorite of Met fans, confirmed early this morning that the Yankees had traded him to the Pittsburgh Pirates. A source in the Pirates organization in Pittsburgh declined to identify the player the Yankees would receive, but he said that he was a minor leaguer. Chuck Tanner, the Pirates' manager, said that the player was not a ''big-name.'' Mazzilli, reached at his home in Greenwich, Conn., said he was informed of the trade yesterday at 4:30 P.M. by Bill Bergesch, the Yankees' vice president for baseball operations. ''I don't want to leave again,'' said the 27-year-old Mazzilli, who was traded by the Mets to Texas last April for two minor-league pitchers, and then dealt by the Rangers to the Yankees for Bucky Dent on Aug. 8. ''I'm hurt about leaving. I wanted to be part of it. I wanted to be part of a winning team in New York. But Pittsburgh's pretty good. I'll just go there and bust my butt.'' Pirates Without Moreno The Pirates have been looking for a center fielder since they lost Omar Moreno, who signed a $3.5 million contract with the Houston Astros as a free agent. They have been talking with the Yankees for some time about a trade. Bergesch would neither confirm nor deny the trade last night, but he said that the Yankees might have something to report late today. Pete Peterson, the Pirates' general manager, also would not confirm nor deny the deal, but he said the Pirates would have an announcement at 6 P.M. today. The interleague trading deadline had expired on Dec. 10, but the Yankees obviously had put Mazzilli on waivers and thus could deal him to a National League team. Mazzilli was the Mets' starting center fielder before Mookie Wilson came along. When they acquired George Foster early this year, Mazzilli became expendable. He soon became unhappy with the Rangers and in July asked to be traded. The Rangers granted his wish while they were in New York. He batted .266 and hit six home runs in 37 games with the Yankees, primarily playing first base and serving as a designated hitter. Mazzilli did not figure prominently in the Yankees' plans for next season. They signed Don Baylor as a free agent to be their designated hitter, and they plan to move Ken Griffey to first base with Steve Kemp, another free-agent acquisition, playing right field. Mazzilli said Bergesch told him the trade was not a reflection on the way he played for the Yankees. ''He said I busted my butt,'' Mazzilli added. ''But I played hurt.'' Bergesch also told him, the New York native said, that when they got him from Texas, they had high hopes for him. However, the club's plans changed when they signed the free agents.

281-> THE EVENING HOURS
IF you didn't happen to be an International Debutante, it was, by a ll reports, a poor week for partying. But the debutante whirl was d izzying indeed - parties at the Metropolitan Club, Regine's and D oubles - for the 57 young women whose week peaked on Wednesday e vening in the Waldorf-Astoria's Grand Ballroom, where they were p resented to society at the International Debutante Ball. Since the e vening benefited the Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Club, the g uests paid $150 a head for the privilege. ''Coming out is not the way it used to be; the girls no longer want to marry within the circle,'' Countess Barnatschke said with a halfsigh, half-chuckle as she waited with about a thousand others on the receiving line. ''My own granddaughters didn't want to come out,'' said the Countess, the grandmother of Chevy Chase, the comedian. Referring to him, she said: ''He was very well behaved, though, when I finally got him to one of these things.'' Helen Dow Matheson, the chairman of the debutante committee, didn't mind coming out at all; she had previously done so in Virginia, Washington and Newport, R.I. ''I've heard of one girl who came out 26 times,'' said Claire Helena Blue, the evening's sole debutante from Las Vegas, Nev. ''Everybody's got a little ham in them,'' said Beatrice Joyce, who founded the ball in 1954 because, she said, ''it appeared then that the world was getting closer together.'' Twenty-eight balls later, the worldly guests included Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia; Baron Foran, Duc de Saint-Bar, of France; Princess Chantal of France, daughter of the Count and Countess of Paris, and her husband, Baron Francois de Sambucy; Princess Katalin zu Windisch-Graetz, accompanied by Prince Egon Von Furstenberg of New York, and Mastrocristino Sirena, an artist with studios in Rome and Flushing, Queens. ''Beauty inspires me,'' she said with a toss of her gold turban as she glanced around the ballroom, decorated in silver and blush pink. Somewhere around 1 A.M., after the guests had polished off the roast-beef dinner, the Lester Lanin band had polished off both ''Thank Heaven for Little Girls'' and ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World'' and the debutantes had performed their curtsies (the 11 debs from Texas touched the floor with their heads), 18-year-old Georgette Alexandrovna Farkas became contemplative. ''We're not here just to be scooped up for the marriage market,'' she said. ''Most of the girls today just want that magical Cinderella night of tradition.'' ''Where I grew up in the Bronx,'' said her mother, Francine Farkas Sears, now of Stony Creek, Conn., ''the only place you came out was on the block.'' ''A beautiful, beautiful evening,'' Mrs. Sirena decided. ''I have been inspired to begin a painting entitled 'The International Debutante Ball.' '' On her way out she almost bumped into Sharada Haksar, the debutante from India, clad in a fuchsia sari and Lester Lanin beanie. WHAT does one serve if the Potato People are coming to dinner? It should be explained that Potato P eople is a mime troupe from Canada currently appearing at Town Hall u nder the auspices of the Performing Arts Repertory Foundation, p roducer of children's theater. Giving a dinner party in the c ompany's honor the other evening was Barbara Barrie, the actress, w hose husband, Jay Harnick, is the artistic director of the f oundation. The film that first brought Miss Barrie to the attention o f moviegoers was ''One Potato, Two Potato.'' You would think t herefore that ... Well, she didn't. Miss Barrie decided instead on a meal of rice and Indian food. ''More exotic,'' she said. THERE will be New Year's Eve parties and there will be New Year's E ve parties and then there will be the American Cancer Society's P arty of the Century. Tonight, 75 New Yorkers will meet an equal n umber of Europeans at Maxim's in Paris. Then it's into limousines a nd onto the Orient Express for a Champagne supper and New Year's Dayi n Venice.

282-> Steel Imports Up Last Month
Steel imports in November totaled 1.26 million tons, an increase of 9 percent from October, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported today. The imports accounted for 23.8 percent of the steel supply in the United States last month. In October, foreign steel entering the United States came to 1.14 million tons and accounted for 21.5 percent of the supply. Steel imports for the first 11 months of 1982, however, were 2.71 million tons less than in the comparable period in 1981, the institute said. In November, steel shipments from the European Economic Community rose to 493,045 tons from 346,262 tons in the previous month. Japanese imports dropped to 273,706 tons from 332,000 tons. Last week, domestic steel mills operated at 29.8 percent of capacity.

284-> U.S. DELEGATION TO SEEK TALKS IN MOSCOW
The Reagan Administration intends to use Leonid I. Brezhnev's funeral as an opportunity to tell the new Soviet leadership that the United States desires better relations but is prepared to continue its military buildup if the Russians prefer confrontation, senior Administration officials said today. They said that Vice President Bush and Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who head the American delegation to Moscow, hope to have meetings at least with Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko during the approximately 24 hours they will be in Moscow. They are due to arrive there on Sunday afternoon Moscow time and depart Monday afternoon after the funeral. The main point that Mr. Bush and Mr. Shultz intend to make, the officials said, is that the Administration believes that the Soviet Union is largely responsible for the deterioration of relations by its moves in such places as Afghanistan, Poland and Cambodia, and by its imprisonment of dissidents and its tighter emigration policy. The Administration is ready, they are prepared to say, to move toward improvement, but the Soviet Union will have to take steps first. Mr. Shultz told this to Mr. Gromyko during two sessions in New York in September and October, officials said, in the anticipation that there would be a new leadership in the Kremlin. As a result, they should not be surprised by the American message, the officials said. They said that given this policy, the United States planned to make no concessions to Poland for the reported release of Lech Walesa or to the Soviet Union in the aftermath of Mr. Brezhnev's death. White House and State Department officials said the American position toward both countries was based on longstanding policy decisions and that there was no inclination by President Reagan to alter them, even though the release of Mr. Walesa, the Solidarity leader, and the passing of Mr. Brezhnev from the Soviet scene were important events. 'We Need Some Action' Reflecting this cool attitude, officials quoted Mr. Reagan's comment at his news conference on Thursday that it was up to the new Soviet leadership to take concrete steps to improve relations. ''For 10 years detente was based on words from them and not any deeds to back those words up,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''And we need some action that they - it takes two to tango - that they want to tango, also.'' Officials said Mr. Reagan turned down the suggestion of the State Department that he attend Mr. Brezhnev's funeral, a move that Secretary of State Shultz reportedly believed would have lent support to the President's public statement that he looked forward to expanding areas of cooperation with the new Soviet leadership. Such a visit, the officials said, might have been misinterpreted as a sign that the United States was softening its stance toward Moscow without any sign of change by the Soviet Union on any of the contentious issues between the two countries. 'Not a Significant Signal' As to the reported release of Mr. Walesa, John Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said that it was ''not a significant signal in its own right.'' Mr. Hughes said that the United States and its allies had agreed last January that the sanctions against Poland would not be lifted until three basic conditions were met: that martial law would be ended, that all political prisoners, including Mr. Walesa, be released and that the regime resume exchanges with the Catholic Church and with the banned Solidarity free trade union. A White House official said that ''we don't even know what shape Walesa is in, and it would be crazy to ease up on the Poles until we've had a chance to hear what he has to say.'' As a result of the martial law in Poland, Mr. Reagan extended sanctions against Poland and the Soviet Union to bar European companies from using American technology in the building of a 3,700-mile natural gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe, angering many allies. Talks continued today on a formula to lift those sanctions at the same time that a broader and more comprehensive allied economic policy toward the Soviet Union is adopted. W. Allen Wallis, the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, met again this afternoon with key allied ambassadors to discuss the remaining procedural details, but the session failed to produce any final agreement. There is a dispute, primarily with the French, on how the formula is being portrayed to the public, since the American and French Governments do not want to appear to have made concessions to the other. With Mr. Reagan deciding not to attend Mr. Brezhnev's funeral, Vice President Bush, who is in Africa on an official visit, was designated to head a small delegation to Moscow, in which Mr. Shultz and Arthur A. Hartman, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will also take part. Mr. Shultz will meet the other two in Moscow. Journalists Not Allowed The White House said the Soviet Union had asked that foreign governments keep their delegations small, and plans for including senior members of Congress and former secretaries of state were dropped. Mr. Hughes, the State Department spokesman, said the Soviet authorities had also said they would not allow journalists to enter the Soviet Union in connection with the funeral and that there were enough foreign journalists already resident in Moscow. As a result no American reporters will be allowed to accompany Mr. Shultz on his plane. Administration officials, defending the President's decision not to go to Moscow, said that with the exception of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau of Canada and Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki of Japan, no other top allied leaders would attend the funeral. They said that in letters to Mr. Brezhnev, Mr. Reagan had made it clear that the United States was ready to cooperate, but that the Soviet Union had shown no willingness to back down from its positions on Poland, where martial law has been imposed; Afghanistan, where there are 100,000 Soviet troops, and Cambodia, where the Russians have backed the Vietnamese occupation. Officials refused to predict when the new Soviet leadership would be more forthcoming in seeking ways to reduce tensions. ''You can argue eloquently on both sides - that Andropov will be more flexible, or that he will be more rigid,'' a State Department official said. ''Nobody here really knows.''

286-> THE REGION; New Trial Ordered For Nurse in Death
A former cardiac-care nurse is entitled to a new trial on reduced manslaughter charges for allegedly giving a patient an incompatible blood transfusion, a state appeals court ruled today. A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of Superior Court ruled that a statement during the original trial by Dr. Robert Goode, the Acting State Medical Examiner, was so inflammatory that a judge's instructions to disregard the testimony could not overcome a bias by ''the ordinary jury to find someone on whom to visit retribution.'' The nurse, Laura Winter of North Plainfield, N.J., was tried on charges of aggravated manslaughter for the death in April 1980 of Anna Mudrjy, a patient in the coronary-care unit of Newark Beth Israel Hospital. A jury convicted her on a reduced charge of simple manslaughter.

290-> Yamani Hints Oil Price Flexibility
Saudi Arabia's oil minister was quoted by a Kuwaiti newspaper today as saying he favored retaining the benchmark price of $34 a barrel set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, but that he did not rule out a reduction. Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani told Al Watan that he would prefer holding the price at $34 a barrel. ''But we have no objection to studying a change in the benchmark price, if all OPEC members so desired,'' he said. Some analysts have contended that OPEC would be forced to reduce its price structure because of a sustained decline in world oil consumption and an increase in output by non-OPEC nations. Sheik Yamani's comments came three weeks before OPEC is scheduled to open its regular winter meeting to consider pricing and production policies. The meeting, originally scheduled for Lagos, Nigeria, is now to be held in Vienna on Dec. 9.

292-> A COLUMBIA FOOTBALL ERA ENDS AT BAKER FIELD
The wooden stands of Baker Field, a many-splintered thing to generations of Columbia students since 1928, will support the university's football fans for the last time today. When the Columbia and Brown teams trudge to the field house at dusk, one of the last remaining monuments to the era of iron-man football will be ready for the wrecking crew. For the construction of a new stadium, the university is raising funds to supplement the $3 million gift of Lawrence A. Wien, a lawyer and philanthropist. The final cost may be $15 million for the entire complex. ''The physical condition of the stadium was really terrible,'' said Mr. Wien, who goes to one or two football games each season. ''I always felt a little ashamed of it for Columbia.'' The Lions will play their games on neutral or rival fields until 1984. By then, on the bend of the Harlem River known as Spuyten Duyvil, will rise the modern stadium of concrete and steel, and not all of the Old Blues are happy about that. ''I said to the people planning the new stadium, 'Couldn't you possibly put up wooden stands again,' '' said Al Barabas, one of the many heroes who were cheered at Baker Field and who scored in Columbia's 7-0 upset of Stanford in the 1934 Rose Bowl. That was six years after the wooden stands were installed in Baker Field. There were 15,000 temporary seats in place when the first football game was played there in 1923, the Lions having played on South Field of the Morningside campus before then. Today's game will be the 323d varsity football contest at Baker Field, which Barabas sees as a ''big, warm and homey place.'' Only the older fans in attendance today will recall the glory that once was Columbia's. There were names like Sid Luckman and Cliff Montgomery that made national headlines week after week and teams like the 1947 powerhouse that ended Army's 32-game unbeaten streak. Now a Columbia team with a 1-8 record has only the glory reflected from its quarterback, John Witkowski, to ease its disappointment. Witkowski will attempt to add to his Columbia and Ivy League passing and total offense records against Brown. Montgomery, speaking from his home in Roslyn Heights, L.I., said he thought that plans for the new stadium were ''too small.'' The permanent seating capacity will be 16,000 with 4,000 temporary end zone seats. ''When I was there, in 1931-32-33 we used to sell out every week,'' he recalled. ''We lost only three games in three years and drew 32,000 for every game.'' Only 15,000 of the original seats remain in use. Barabas, who is retired and living in McLean, Va., praised Witkowski and the other Columbia players who made the 12-mile round trip to practice at Baker Field each day ''while the kids at Yale and Harvard and other Ivy schools can fall out of their dormitories and onto the field.'' ''But I love the setting on the confluence of the Hudson and Harlem Rivers,'' he said. ''All those trees and the corny wooden stands. And you couldn't hit a home run on the baseball field without its going into the Hudson. I'm opposed to big, concrete bowls. If ever football comes back to play in these settings, we'll all be better off.''

293-> UNION CONCESSIONS IN STEEL REPORTED
The executive board of the United Steelworkers of America approved a tentative agreement yesterday that calls for a cut of about 10 percent in wages and benefits and other major concessions, according to union and company officials. The concessions underscored the depressed state of the steel industry, which is operating at about 40 percent of capacity, and followed a pattern set by the automobile workers and other unions as a result of the economic slump. In another set of negotiations, the United Automobile Workers and the Chrysler Corporation are to return to the bargaining table in an effort to resolve an impasse. (Page D16.) Negotiated for Weeks The tentative agreement in the steel industry was reached after weeks of negotiations that began when a proposal for a wage freeze was rejected in July by 400 presidents of union locals. The tentative agreement, which is to be voted on by the local leaders today at a meeting in Pittsburgh, would take effect Dec. 1 and run for 45 months. It would reduce the average member's wages and benefits, which now total $23.40 an hour, by $1.50 in wages and 75 cents in benefits in the first year, according to the company and union officials. In the second year, wages would increase but would still be $1 an hour lower than the present average of $13.75, and in the third year they would be 50 cents below present levels. It was unclear whether benefits would also be cut in the second and third years. The proposed agreement would not cover some workers, now part of the contract, who are not directly involved in steelmaking, such as those in fabrication, warehousing and iron ore mining. This provision could affect more than 50,000 union members. If the proposed contract is approved, those workers would have to bargain separately in the future. In return for the union's concessions, company negotiators agreed to a complex profit-sharing plan that union sources said could give some union members a share of any profits after the companies had met obligations to stockholders and others. The amount would vary from company to company. The agreement also calls for deferring a cost-of-living increase outlined in the current contract from next month until August. A company source said the companies could elect to pay the cost-ofliving increase on a semiannual rather than the current quarterly basis or adopt the profit-sharing plan, whichever is the lesser amount. Supplemental Fund Payments The agreement also calls for the companies to contribute to the depleted funds that have been paying benefits to laid-off steelworkers. About 140,000 of the union's 447,000 members are out of work. Several union sources said that the 29-member board had unanimously decided to recommend approval of the agreement at a meeting at the union's headquarters in Pittsburgh. One union leader who had talked to two of the members of the executive board said they had told him they felt they had to ''swallow hard'' and recommend approval. The recommendations and the agreement will be put before the union's basic steel industry conference, which is composed of 600 union leaders who will decide whether or not to approve the agreement. Local leaders were gathering yesterday at the William Penn Hotel in Pittsburgh for the meeting. If they approve the agreement it would supplant the present three-year contract, which is scheduled to expire Aug. 1, 1983. ''It makes you sick,'' said one union leader who did not want to be indentified. ''I don't know what will happen tomorrow.'' Profit-Sharing Plan The most unusual aspect of the plan was the profit-sharing provision. The tentative agreement was negotiated in recent weeks by J. Bruce Johnston, the chief bargainer for the steel companies, and Lloyd McBride, the union's international president. Mr. Johnston was the leader of the Coordinating Committee Steel Companies, which represented the eight major steel producers: United States Steel, the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Jones & Laughlin, the Republic Steel Corporation, the National Steel Corporation, the Inland Steel Corporation, Armco Inc. and the Allegheny-Ludlum Steel Corporation. To replenish the nearly exhausted supplemental unemployment benefit funds for the 140,000 steelworkers who are out of work, the companies agreed to contribute 75 cents for every hour worked by each employee covered by a fund. The supplemental fund pays as much as $200 a week or more to some members with high seniority. Also, the union agreed to use the nine-cent-an-hour cost-of-living increase that was due the workers last Nov. 1, which has been kept in escrow, to replenish the fund. The union also agreed to defer the cost-of-living increases. Under the present contract, steelworkers get a one-cent-an-hour increase for every three-tenths of one percent quarterly rise in the consumer price index. First Proposal Rejected The steel industry, which has been hit heavily by the recession, has been seeking concessions from the union for most of the year. A proposal by the management in July called for a wage freeze, the elimination of the cost-of-living increase in the first year and a cap of 50 cents an hour on the cost-of-living increases in each of the next two years. That proposal was unanimously rejected by local union leaders. In September 400 leaders of local unions attending a national conference in Atlantic City gave almost unanimous support for a renewal of contract talks that led to the agreement to reduce labor costs. Mr. McBride, the union president, has said that he was eager to reach a settlement because he feared a prolonged strike next year if an agreement was delayed. In the past, long strikes have led to a greater use of imported steel. This greater use of imported steel led the industry and the union to agree to an experimental negotiating plan in 1973 in which the industry exchanged assurances of wage and cost-of-living increases for a no-strike pledge by the union. The unexpectedly high inflation rate led to large cost-of-living wage increases, however, and the companies refused to renew the agreement in 1980.

294-> POPE, IN SURPRISE MOVE, CALLS 1983 A HOLY YEAR
Pope John Paul II today declared the year 1983 a Holy Year in commemoration of the 1,950th anniversary of the Year of Redemption - the year Jesus died. Closing a four-day meeting of the Sacred College of Cardinals with an address in Latin, the Pope said: ''And now, it is near to my heart to make an announcement to you that will certainly be a cause of grand joy for you and the whole church.'' The Pope, recalling that in 1933 Pope Pius XI proclaimed the 1,900th anniversary as a special jubilee year, said there were strong reasons for celebrating 1983 in the same fashion. The reasons he offered were the centrality of the Redemption to Christianity, the approacing Synod of Bishops and the ''worthy preparation'' for the Holy Year 2000. The Pope said the Holy Year would begin in the course of the next Lent. ''Let us ask the Lord that this celebration will bring a gust of spiritual renewal at all levels!'' the Pope called out. A Change in Frequency Vatican sources were surprised at the announcement, which appeared to them to set in motion a tradition of celebrating six Holy Years each century instead of four, the last being in 1975. The first jubliee year was proclaimed in 1300 by Pope Boniface VIII. By 1343 the frequency was increased to every half century, by 1389 to every 33 years and in 1470 the present rhythm of every quarter century was instituted. Now the Redemption, to be commemorated in the '33 and '83 years, appears to be making the number six each century. The Pope also announced that a new code of canon law, which has been in preparation for several years and was expected to be published this year, was still under study. ''The importance of the work still requires a certain period of verification and reflection, which I have entrusted to a restricted and qualified study group,'' the Pope said. He did not explain the delay in publication of the laws to govern all church affairs.

295-> SCOUTING; Help for Mancini
Chuck Tanner, the manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates, drove over to Youngstown, Ohio, the other day to visit a young friend with a problem: Ray Mancini, the World Boxing Association's lightweight champion. They spent the day driving round the countryside and talking, while Tanner tried to help Mancini clear his troubled mind. Mancini has been troubled ever since he scored a 14-round knockout two weeks ago over the Korean lightweight Duk Koo Kim, who fell into a coma and died four days later. By then, Mancini was back in Youngstown, trying to reason things out with himself. He has had 25 fights in his career, and he won 20 of them by knockouts. He reports that he has received more than 1,000 letters, many of them addressed simply: ''Ray Mancini, Youngstown, Ohio.'' Almost all were comforting, many asked him not to retire from the ring, some carried prayers. ''I've got to come to grips with this,'' Mancini said. ''I have faith. And the flood of warmth from people everywhere touches me, especially the people of Youngstown.'' Tomorrow night, the people of Youngstown will try to comfort him in another way. The Wolves Club, a professional men's group, will honor him at a dinner as the club's man of the year. The proceeds will be turned over to the Raymond Mancini Scholarship Fund, which the fighter set up in August for deserving students at Cardinal Mooney High School. Mancini was a student there only a few years ago, before starting his successful and now troubled career in the prize ring. Joseph Durso

296-> ABOUT NEW YORK
The police had a body, or at least what was left of one. It was too late to determine easily the race, the age, even the sex of what had once been a human being. So they did what many before them had done: They took it to the American Museum of Natural History. Waiting for them there was Dr. Harry L. Shapiro, prepared once again to make anthropology work for law enforcement. Dr. Shapiro is 80 years old now, though still gangly as an adolescent, and while over the decades others have learned the skill that is called forensic anthropology, he is considered the dean of this art of telling all from a piece of bone, a skull, the curve of the pelvic cage. There are differences in the bones of male and female, of short and tall, of young and old, and Dr. Shapiro is adept at reading these differences. This is not his work, exactly, but a sideline that he has felt compelled to practice because of a sense of public duty and an interest in the configurations of old bones and the remains of those who will never make old bones themselves. So down the long hallway, past entomology and mammalogy, the police come, bearing remains. If ever a man worked in an ivory tower, it is Dr. Shapiro, whose sunny corner office in the museum is filled with papers and books and ceremonial masks and a bust of Peking man that the anthropologist thinks bears a marked resemblance to the late Chou En-lai. But the chairman emeritus of the anthropology department at the museum and professor emeritus of the discipline at Columbia University has managed to achieve an easy balance between the academic and the everyday. In those circles where people talk anthropology, he is known for his work on racial characteristics and inbreeding, for his classic study of the natives of Pitcairn Island - the descendants of the men who mutinied on the Bounty and their Polynesian wives. In those circles where people talk murder, he is known for his ability to take a handful of bone fragments and turn them into a victim. He has made 15 trips to the Polynesian islands for anthropological study - ''Oh, I'm very fond of the Polynesians,'' he says warmly -and dozens of appearances in court, in murder and paternity cases. He has been responsible both for the Hall of the Biology of Man at the museum and the identification of the remains of thousands of American soldiers at the end of World War II. When a self-styled bishop in Brooklyn was accused of murdering two young sisters and burning their bodies, it was Dr. Shapiro who scrutinized pieces of bone not much bigger than postage stamps and decreed that there were the remains of two people there, that both were female and that both were young. Last week, a man called him from Peoria, Ill., asking about a tribe of Filipino natives, a young woman whose racial lineage he had determined when she was an abandoned baby asked if she could stop by, and a detective from Nassau County visited him with the skull and pelvis of a body discovered in a dumpster in Freeport. Dr. Shapiro examined the remains, the telltale sutures of the cranium, the third molars and the pubic synthesis, and pronounced judgment: female, white, late teens, dead perhaps six months. ''Some years ago I had a very similiar case,'' he said. ''They found this skeleton in some bushes behind the stadium up in the Bronx. The Medical Examiner called me, and I looked at it for him. It was female, around 26, I thought. I estimated that the body had probably been exposed for about a year. They hadn't told me this, but apparently when they found the body they also found a wide belt with a large buckle. And they took that to the home of a missing young woman about the right age, who had been missing about that length of time, and when her sisters saw it they just screamed. It was hers. So I was pleased to know I had been correct.'' Dr. Shapiro has also practiced upon the living, and these are the stories that give him greatest pleasure. For many years, babies abandoned on the streets of New York City were brought to him by charitable agencies because he was an expert in racial mixtures. The young woman who came to see Dr. Shapiro the other day he had adjudged Oriental, probably Chinese, 25 years before. ''I thought, now what if she walks in and I was wrong?'' said Dr. Shapiro. ''And, my God, she walked in and she was exactly what I said she was.'' At one time he was seeing as many as five children a week so the agencies could put them up for adoption. ''I had one extraordinary case which gave me the power, which I never expected to have, to alter someone's birth certificate,'' he said. An English woman had married a black American soldier during World War II. When they were finally reunited, she was pregnant by another man, expecting a child she agreed to give up for adoption. When she and her husband arrived at the hospital for delivery, the nurse behind the desk wrote on the baby's birth certificate, ''Race: Negro.'' ''The baby was a blond, blue-eyed boy,'' Dr. Shapiro said. ''The agency came to me for my opinion, and I told them they must change the birth certificate from black to white.'' He does not see many babies anymore, and the days are long gone when he met with war refugees to try to find physical characteristics that might prove their identities. But the system that Dr. Shapiro set up to identify unknown war dead has been used ever since, and when remains of a body are found that cannot be readily identified, it is still Dr. Shapiro whom many police officers and medical examiners think of first. ''They forget that I'm retired,'' he said. ''The amount of time this has taken has been incredible, and there are many other things to do. But this does have a certain fascination.''

297-> Recipient of Two Lungs Is in Serious Condition
James Franzen, the first transplant patient to receive two lungs from separate donors, was in serious but stable condition today after surgery to stop internal bleeding, a hospital spokesman said. Mr. Franzen, 31 years old, of Marietta, Ga., underwent surgery Thursday at Toronto General Hospital after doctors discovered blood in his chest cavity. Surgeons were able to stop the bleeding and Mr. Franzen was put back on a breathing machine in the hospital's intensive care unit, the hospital reported. Pauline Jackson, the hospital spokesman, said the bleeding was unexpected, adding that it was not a side effect of the two lung transplants that Mr. Franzen underwent in August and September. Mr. Franzen, a nursery owner whose own lungs were destroyed after exposure to the deadly herbicide paraquat, had his right lung replaced Aug. 29 and underwent a second transplant Sept. 20 after doctors discovered the infection had rendered his left lung useless.

298-> Referee, 41, Dies Of Heart Attack
A basketball referee collapsed tonight during a tournament game between Tulane and Wyoming, and a spokesman at Baptist Hospital said he died about an hour later. Jerry Yarbrough, 41 years old, of Meridian, Miss., collapsed with about six minutes left in the first half as Wyoming was moving down court. Doctors and paramedics at Mid-South Coliseum applied electric shocks to his chest in an effort to revive him before he was taken to the hospital. The hospital spokesman said Yarbrough, who was parks and recreation director for the city of Meridian, died of a heart attack. The game, which Tulane won, 52-38, was stopped for about an hour and players were sent to their dressing rooms.

The Detroit Pistons said goodbye to their high-scoring forward, Kelly Tripucka, for six to eight weeks. Tripucka was placed on the injured list yesterday after straining the ligament in his right knee Wednesday in a game at Kansas City. He has been averaging 25 points a game this season. ... Rare miss: John Hannah, the iron man of the New England Patriots, is hurt and will not play tomorrow against the Houston Oilers. Hannah, the all-pro guard, sprained his left knee in practice. He had played in 133 games, missed only one as a rookie and hadn't missed any games in nine years.

300-> AROUND THE WORLD; Opposition Chief Asserts Guyana Regime Will Fall
Cheddi Jagan, Guyana's Marxist opposition leader, today predicted the imminent downfall of the Government of President Forbes Burnham. ''We have a very volatile situation,'' Mr. Jagan told reporters during a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference here. He accused President Burnham of using Venezuela's claim to two-thirds of Guyana's territory to divert attention from his failures. After a term as Prime Minister, he has led the opposition since 1964. Guyana became independent in 1966. ''Now the people are uniting in struggle against the Government,'' Mr. Jagan said. ''Mass action will flow from these conditions and we are going to be leading it. We are calling for a broad national front to throw out the Government and build the country up again.''

301-> Careers; Discontent Of Middle Managers
IS top management living in an ivory tower as more and more middle managers are dismissed to save money? Two separate surveys, taken together, indicate the answer is yes. Another question: Who should be surveyed to find out the truth about morale in corporations - the top bosses or the middle managers? One of the surveys focuses on top managers, the other on middle managers. According to a study recently issued by William M. Mercer Inc., an employee benefit and compensation concern, chief executive officers of large companies believe there has been no drop in employees' morale. ''Despite economic pressures, almost all employers believe that the employer-employee relationship has improved or remains unchanged,'' the Mercer report said. ''Only 13 percent of the respondents feel it has changed for the worse. Also, most report improved employee morale at their companies and feel that economic conditions have actually encouraged employees to work harder.'' Mercer, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Inc., the New York-based financial services company, conducted the survey last summer and released the results a few weeks ago. Karin Allport, a senior consultant in charge of the survey, noted that a majority of chief executives officers did say that ''the high level of remuneration earned by senior executives has given some large corporations a poor image.'' Otherwise, though, they seemed to see few problems at the middle management level. But the other survey, done by the Opinion Research Corporation, is based on responses from middle management, and it suggests that top management may be insulated from reality if it really thinks middle management's morale is strong. Opinion Research, the Princeton, N.J., polling subsidiary of Arthur D. Little Inc., has found that people in middle management are very unhappy not only about their pay and benefits but also about a growing lack of communication with the top level. In 1977 Opinion Research made a similar survey of middle management attitudes and found that employees were more unhappy with their jobs then ''than at any time since the end of World War II.'' The results of the latest survey, announced a week ago, has this added twist: Most middle managers now, it appears, are ''more unhappy with their companies than with their jobs.'' ''For the first time we see fewer than half the managers having good things to say about their companies,'' said William A. Schiemann, a vice president of the research organization. The middle managers are implying, he added, that they can hardly wait for the recession to end so they can change jobs. In fact, the Opinion Research report ventures to say that middle management has ''lost confidence in the leadership ability of their superiors.'' It goes on to warn that the situation ''poses a serious threat to reviving sagging productivity and boosting bottom-line performance in the 1980's.'' Mr. Schiemann said: ''Today we see 69 percent of middle management complaining of eroding authority, of seeing too many decisions made 'at the top' that up to a year ago were made by them at their level. ''Worse, the decisions are now made by people they say are unfamiliar with the particular problem, and they do it poorly.'' The middle managers seem to feel that they cannot talk to their immediate superiors as readily now as they could a few years ago, much less the top bosses. Speakers at an all-day session, in which executives reviewed the Opinion Research findings, mentioned another trend of top management that irks middle managers and the public. It is the growth of ''golden parachutes'' - special severance deals approved by corporate boards of directors that promise large payments if a chief executive officer and his top vice presidents lose their jobs because of a merger or leave for other reasons. The indications of middle management dissatisfaction come at a time when many American companies are talking about trying to improve productivity through joint efforts by people from various levels of management and blue-collar workers. Ernest Savoie, director of labor relations for the Ford Motor Company, told the conferees about Ford's productivity group meetings, which seek to improve the quality of cars. On the job front, the worst may be over for top managers but not for middle managers. Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc., an outplacement service based in Chicago,, said last week that cutbacks at the middle management level had accelerated. It also noted a decrease in senior management terminations (usually involving salaries of $60,000 or more). ''Now that the top ranks are thinned out, employers are turning attention to the midmanagement level as the recession deepens and they seek further operating economies for 1983,'' the company said.

302-> DOW DROPS 14.90 AFTER EARLY JUMP
The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 14.90 points yesterday in a hectic session that included a huge swing of almost 35 points. Trading volume accelerated to 98.4 million shares from Monday's 63.1 million. Analysts said that mounting concern over the weak economy was the main cause of the stock market's abrupt decline. With selling pressure intensifying in the final hour, the Dow finished at 1,009.38. By contrast, the average was up 19.95 points by 10:30 A.M. as investors responded with initial enthusiasm to the Federal Reserve's half-point cut in the discount rate, to 8 1/2 percent, announced on Monday after trading had ended. It marked the seventh cut since mid-July in the rate charged on loans to financial institutions. But whereas previous reductions in this key interest rate served to send stock prices soaring, the market's ultimate verdict yesterday was shockingly different. Investors Not Encouraged ''This time around, a rate cut failed to encourage investors because of the delay in the economic recovery,'' said Lee H. Idleman, research director for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ''This is a stock market in search of a correction, and we could see the Dow decline to the 925-950 range over the next couple of months.'' In addition, he said, there are some fears that interest rates will rebound in the 1983 opening quarter, partly because of this nation's growing trade deficit. In the credit markets, long-term interest rates rose and bond prices fell as investors became concerned that the Fed was tolerating rapid money supply growth, which might increase inflation in the future. (Page D7.) ''What we need now is an economic recovery and an increase in corporate earnings,'' said John R. Groome, a senior vice president at the United States Trust Company. ''Right now, neither one is in sight.'' Taking Cue From Fed Indeed, in its announcement of the discount rate cut, the Fed cited ''current business conditions'' as one reason for the action, which was aimed in part at stimulating the economy through the investment that would result from lower interest rates. ''This is hard evidence that the Fed is worried about the economy,'' said William M. LeFevre, portfolio strategist at Purcell, Graham & Company, ''and investors now are taking their cue from the Fed.'' ''These wild price swings,'' he added, ''are unsettling to the seasoned investor.'' The Dow industrials, along with the general market, began a long climb in mid-August. On Aug. 12, the Dow ended at 776.92 and by Nov. 3 it had risen to a record close of 1,065.49. Similar records were set by the New York Stock Exchange's composite index and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. Yesterday's intraday reversal in the industrial average was mirrored by a similar abrupt swing in the Dow transportation average. A total of 991 stocks closed lower on the Big Board, while 629 issues advanced. Another cause for worry, analysts said, was the vulnerability of such stocks as Pepsico and Warner Communications to adverse news developments. They said this raised investor fears that profit taking might spread to other sectors of the market in the wake of the huge price gains scored in recent months. Pepsico, the volume leader, plunged 6 1/2 points, to 33 3/4, on a turnover of almost four million shares. As a result of reporting irregularities in its foreign bottling subsidiary, the company restated downward its profits for the last five years. Warner Down 6 1/4, to 30 Warner, No.2 on the active list, dropped 6 1/4 points, to 30. Volume exceeded 2.3 million shares and, for most of the afternoon, trading in the issue was halted on the Big Board. On Monday, Warner rose 1 1/2 points. But last week, it plunged 19 5/8 points after the company said that fourth-quarter earnings would run below expectations. Earlier this year, video game issues had shown large price gains. Some stocks that displayed recent strength were caught in yesterday's downdraft. There were losses of 6 to 8 points apiece in Capital Cities Communications, Commodore International and Texas Instruments. Declines of more than 4 points each appeared in Digital Equipment, Monsanto and Pfizer. Precious-metal issues, which had performed handsomely earlier this month, retreated as the price of gold bullion dropped yesterday. Brokerage, energy, drug and computer issues ranked among the market's weaker groups. On the American Stock Exchange, Frontier Holdings, which operates Frontier Airlines, fell 3 3/4, to 20 1/4, after management projected a loss for the fourth quarter. The Amex market-value index dropped 4.67, to 330.63. In over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index declined 2, to 231.33.

303-> DONORS TO NEEDIEST CASES SEEK TO AID CHILDREN
The vision of a poor, lonely or neglected child overlooked in the festivity of the holiday season inspires many gifts to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. ''Please use this small contribution to help a child,'' Judith G. Handelman of Manhattan wrote in a letter accompanying a donation of $25 to the fund's 71st annual appeal. ''Certainly children are still our most important resources and the best hope for mankind.'' Sloane Shelton, also of Manhattan, donated $15, asking that it be applied ''preferably to aid children in some way.'' ''As a fortunate resident of N.Y.,'' she wrote, ''I am glad to have this small way of helping to improve the quality of life in our city.'' To Brighten Child's Holiday Another Manhattan contributor concerned with the happiness of children was Rosemary Love, who sent a check for $10 and a note that said: ''I have a little boy and I know how heartbroken he would be if he didn't see anything under the tree Christmas morning. I hope this small contribution will brighten up some child's holiday.'' Two donations totaling $20 came from Lucille Colandro Santarelli, also of Manhattan, in memory of her mother, Marie Colandro, and a friend, Tony Wisnewski, with the request that her gift be used ''to help children who are alone on the holiday.'' A contribution of $25 from Gloria and Bertram Kessler of Manhattan was supplemented by $1 from their daughter, Lori, with the hope that her gift could be used ''for children less fortunate than she.''

304-> A MARKET RALLY BUILT ON DOUBTS
A simple truth often forgotten in the frenzy of a bull market is t hat for every share of stock bought, a share is sold. In the stock m arket's surge over the past two months or so, the institutions have d one the buying and the small investors, by and large, have done the s elling. The results look euphoric - the Dow Jones industrial average surged to a historic high of 1,065.49 on Wednesday, trading volume topped the all-time record the next day at 149.4 million shares and the brokers smiled all the while. But the driving force behind the frenzy and the record-setting highs was not a great wave of optimism about the prospects for the economy. It was, instead, a brooding concern by both individuals and institutions that things really are not destined to get much better anytime soon. ''The strength in the stock market was not a vote of confidence in the economy,'' said George L. Ball, president of Prudential-Bache Securities. Since the bull market began in early August, many brokers report, the sellers have been predominantly the little guys - maybe the same ones who voted for the Democrats in last Tuesday's election. Seeing the value of their shares rise, they went out in droves to sell their stocks and ran home with their profits. Perhaps their ears were still ringing with the quibbles among economists over whether the economy was in a depression or merely a deep recession. Perhaps they, like many ana- lysts, doubted that the long-awaited recovery would ever arrive. The institutions have run to the stock market - not from it - in recent months because, from their perspective, that was the safest thing to do. The nation's money managers thought the economy would remain sluggish, at least for some months, and that this would push interest rates still lower. For them, the stock market with dividends assured, looked like the best investment. ''The preponderance of buying has been by institutions,'' said Elliot M. Fried, executive vice president and chief investment officer of Shearson/American Express, one of the nation's largest securities firms. ''From what we can see, individuals have been sellers all through this rally.'' And at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, the nation's largest brokerage firm, the story was the same. ''Our figures through Wednesday showed that individual customers have been selling more than they have been buying,'' said Richard T. McCabe, vice president and manager of the market analysis department. Mr. Ball of Prudential-Bache is a dissenter. He said his firm's analysis shows that, in the last 10 days at least, individuals have been on the buying side. This was not because of the economy, he said, but largely because people don't want to feel left out. ''The stock market itself has an internal momentum that does not easily reverse,'' said Mr. Ball. STILL, sellers seem to far outnumber buyers in this rally. The l atter are mainly the institutions, the individuals who look after l arge amounts of other people's money - those who manage pension f unds, trust accounts and mutual funds. Compared with individual i nvestors, there aren't many of them, but they buy and sell a lot of s tock. And in the recent rally, they have been heavily on the buy s ide, said Richard R. Schmaltz, co-director of the research d epartment at Morgan Stanley & Company, which deals with i nstitutional investors and large individual accounts. Many institutional investors cashed in their short-term moneymarket securities in early August, when the rally began, but others held off, either because of uncertainty or because, for technical reasons, they could not move. ''Some thought there would be a big correction and wanted to wait,'' said Mr. Schmaltz, ''but of course, there was no significant correction, the market kept going up.'' In many cases, he explained, the institutions delayed taking action because they did not have full discretion over some accounts and needed to await permission from their clients before switching into equities. The influx of such approvals, plus the beginning of a new move by foreign investors into American stocks, helped produce last week's spectacular upswing, he continued. But even the buyers were not motivated by a belief that the economy was on the upswing, analysts say. Rather, their plunge into the market reflected a belief that interest rates would decline further. And that conviction, in turn, was based on the belief that the economic rebound, whenever it comes, would be an anemic one, keeping interest rates low. The institutions' decisions to buy were based on cold calculations of relative yields during a period of declining interest rates: They expected to make a better buck from stock dividends than from investments in interest-earning assets. During recent years, when short-term interest rates seemed to go only up, the mood was very different. Big investors shunned the stock and bond markets and flocked into such short-term investments as overnight bank loans, bank certificates of deposit, corporate loans and Treasury bills. Until last August, when the Federal Reserve seemed to ease its monetary policy, the so-called yield curve was negative - short-term Treasury bills were yielding about 14 or 15 percent and long-term Government bonds were yielding only 13 to 14 percent. The situation was even more extreme in 1981, when yields on T-bills were as high as 18 percent. In August, when the yield curve turned positive, most money managers began to change their strategies and started to get out of shortterm money-market investments - which they call cash - and into stocks and bonds. The reason they were confident that short-term interest rates would continue to decline was the depth and stubborness of the recession. ''Starting in late July we noticed that the Federal Reserve had begun to inject large amounts of reserves into the system, and it was about then that we started moving strongly into equities,'' said Gordon P. Wilson, chief investment officer of Kemper Financial Services, which manages about $17 billion in pension funds, mutual funds and insurance accounts. ''The Fed will continue lowering interest rates until they get to a level that will sustain economic recovery,'' Mr. Wilson predicted. At the Bankers Trust Company, where the trust division manages about $13 billion of other people's money, John L. Schroeder, vice president in charge of investments, gave a similar explanation. ''Any turn from a negative to a positive yield curve is the surest signal of a rising stock market,'' he said. ''At this point,'' Mr. Schroeder continued, ''there is no evidence that the economy is picking up.'' Ironically, though, the surge in stock prices might be just what the doctor ordered for the anemic economy. There is a dearth of statistics about how many people walked away from the market with new cash in their pockets, and even less information about what they did or might do with that money. One possibility is that they will use their new liquidity to buy clothes, cars, furniture and all those things that economists lump together as consumption. It is a rebound in consumption that most economists these days are counting on to revive the economy. This expected sequence of events is one reason analysts consider the stock market to be a ''leading indicator'' of economic activity. A rising market puts money into peoples' pockets and, beyond that, it can generate a sense of general well-being in the country that encourages people to go out and spend. So far, however, there is no evidence that the sale of stocks during this bull market has translated into cash register receipts. Small investors, at least for now, seem to be building up liquidity, not spending more. One surprise, analysts say, is that despite declining interest rates, people are still pouring money into money market mutual funds. According to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, total assets of all such funds rose to more than $241 billion in the week that ended Nov. 4. That was $7 billion higher than it was two months earlier, on Sept. 8, even though the seven-day yield on these funds was down a full percentage point, to 8.81 percent, last week, from 9.86 percent in September. INDIVIDUALS seem willing to accept those lower rates, at least for t he time being; but the institutions are not. Instead they are c asting about for investment alternatives and so far they have f avored both stocks and bonds. ''Bonds prices, in fact, have risen e ven more than stock prices since the start of this rally,'' e xclaimed Mr. Schroeder of Bankers Trust. The fact that institutions are putting money into the bond market, he said, is additional evidence that they remain uncertain about the economy. If they felt bullish, they would turn away from bonds. For in a strong economy, companies would want to build new plants or buy more expensive equipment and would try to finance them by selling bonds. This increased demand would put upward pressure on long-term interest rates and create capital losses for bond holders. But if the economy continues to poke along, at least for the next few months, as most institutional investors expect, long-term interest rates might decline, and there is room for still more capital gains to be made in the bond market. For institutions that think along these lines, the choice between stocks and bonds in today's market is a toss-up. ''It's a question of whether you like Beethoven or Brahms,'' said Mr. Schroeder. Stocks, however, should be favored by the institutions as the economy improves and the outlook for corporate profits brightens. The interest received on bonds would remain steady, while the dividends paid on stocks would generally rise. In such a world, bond prices would fall and stock prices would climb. It is not clear yet that conditions are approaching that point. But Mr. Schroeder thinks it may not be far off. ''Conditions for an economic pickup are very powerful,'' he said. ''The consumer is in very good shape, partly because of the rise in the stock market, and pent-up demand is high.'' Mr. Schroeder said he is considering switching from bonds to stocks. If and when he makes the switch - and if other institutional investors do the same - there could be another good ride for the stock market.

305-> 2 LEADERS VIE FOR POWER IN EL SALVADOR
A bitter conflict between two of the most powerful figures in the Salvadoran Government has flared in recent weeks and left American officials increasingly concerned about the stability of the political system here. The conflict pits the Minister of Defense and Public Security, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, against Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former national guard intelligence officer and leader of the ultraright National Republican Alliance. At issue, according to foreign diplomats and Salvadoran officials, are attempts by Mr. d'Aubuisson to encourage opposition to General Garcia among army officers and the public in the hope of unseating him, Such a step would create serious problems for the United States because General Garcia has largely supported American efforts here and has placed the Salvadoran Army behind land redistribution. Mr. d'Aubuisson, who is president of the Constituent Assembly elected in March, opposes social reform and has been accused of having ties to rightist terrorism here. Western diplomats say Mr. d'Aubuisson's efforts to extend his power and dominate the military would severely weaken, perhaps crush, United States-supported efforts to shape a democratic government. Minister's Role Is Crucial Reflecting a new, harder line in United States policy here, American officials are saying that any move by Mr. d'Aubuisson to remove General Garcia would virtually insure an end to United States military aid to El Salvador. The job of Defense Minister is probably the most important in El Salvador, partly because the military chief is responsible for all security in the nation but also because he controls other appointments that give him some power over the economy too. While a Western diplomat here described the struggle between Mr. d'Aubuisson and General Garcia as largely ''psychological warfare'' that had not yet reached a ''point of crisis,'' El Salvador's former junta president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, took a differnt view. Confrontation Called Complete In an interview here, Mr. Duarte, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, said that a ''complete confrontation'' was taking place between General Garcia and Mr. d'Aubuisson and that the rightist leader was seeking ''a legal coup d'etat.'' Mr. Duarte added: ''D'Aubuisson sees Garcia as his problem and wants to get rid of him. The army, at this moment, is behind reforms. But a new command can change many things.'' Mr. Duarte said that ''some actions'' to unseat General Garcia took place in July, September and October. He did not elaborate. Besides talking to army officers, Mr. d'Aubuisson and his party have recently supported advertisements and editorials in rightist newspapers that have harshly criticized General Garcia for the security situation in the nation. A Western source said that Mr. d'Aubisson had seemed in recent weeks to be focusing his energies less on the Constituent Assembly and more on the military. Regiment Kept Near Capital Asked what Mr. d'Aubisson was doing in his efforts to unseat General Garcia, a Western diplomat replied, ''Talking to officers.'' Asked if the United States was concerned, the diplomat said, ''I would say anyone mucking around with the military is a concern.'' General Garcia is known to keep a cavalry regiment - the only mobile armed unit in the military - near the capital, despite suggestions by Americans that it move permanently into the field. A Western source suggested that the regiment was based near the capital largely because the Defense Minister wanted ''a guarantee against a coup.'' General Garcia spent a full day last week meeting privately with the provisional President, Alvaro Magana. The next day General Garcia met all day with regional commanders in an effort to bolster his support among the military. Although the conflict between General Garcia and Mr. d'Aubuisson dates back some time, tension between the two heightened after April 21 when the general, supported by the United States, informed Mr. d'Aubuisson that he wanted the moderate Mr. Magana to serve as the nation's provisional President. The 38-year-old Mr. d'Aubisson, who sought the job himself, was reportedly furious. As expected, the Constituent Assembly supported the appointment of Mr. Magana. Power Shifts in Assembly In recent weeks the Assembly itself, which is seeking to draw up a constitution, has witnessed a shift in power. After the March 28 elections, a right-wing coalition under Mr. d'Aubuisson took control of the 60-seat Assembly. But a personality clash has split one of the rightist groups, the Nationalist Conciliation Party. This has resulted in the creation of a 30-seat ''democratic alliance,'' largely made up of Christian Democrats but joined by others. For the moment at least the Assembly is in a dead heat between this alliance and the rightists, with Christian Democrats asserting that efforts to thwart land redistribution and other social measures will now be overcome. Western diplomats remain wary of the effectiveness of the alliance itself as well as the entire Assembly. One Western source said that the Assembly has spent the bulk of its time on patronage, in finding and exchanging jobs for party members and - in the past two weeks - in angry public debate about whether or not to have a ''dialogue'' with leftist guerrillas. According to Western diplomats, most of the debates in the Assembly so far, however, have focused on relatively minor issues, such as tax breaks for various companies, and little on the creation of a constitution. ''They have approved three articles of a new constitution that's supposed to be very long,'' said a diplomat. ''At the rate they're going they'll finish the constitution in the year 2000 - if you're an optimist.''

306-> U.S. WILL CONTINUE PAYMENT OF INTEREST POLAND OWES BANKS
The State Department announced details today of President Reagan's plan to suspend tariff benefits on imports from Poland because of its ban of the independent Solidarity trade union movement. At the same time, the White House said that Mr. Reagan would authorize the Government to continue payment of interest owed by Poland to American banks to prevent a default that would relieve Poland of its debt. The White House spokesman, Larry Speakes, said the decision to continue payments to the banks meant that the United States would keep the Poles ''on the line, owing the money, and not let them off scot free.'' The Polish debt to the West is $23 to 24 billion, including $3.2 billion to American banks, according to the Treasury Department. On the Polish trade issue, a State Department spokesman, Alan Romberg, said that Mr. Reagan would sign a proclamation shortly suspending so-called most-favored-nation status for Poland, which means the payment of normal tariffs on Polish goods imported into the United States. ''This action was seen by the President as a tangible way of expressing our deep displeasure over the Polish Government's action to abolish Solidarity on Oct. 8,'' Mr. Romberg said. In the White House briefing, Mr. Speakes said the tariff decision was a significant psychological expression of American opposition to martial law in Poland, even though the United States bought only $103 million worth of Polish goods in the first half of 1982. Poland ranked fourth among Communist exporters to the United States, after China, Rumania and the Soviet Union. Although the White House signaled more than two weeks ago that Mr. Reagan would take the action, the State Department provided the details of the procedure to suspend the favorable trade status that Poland has held for 22 years. State Department aides said that Congress had been consulted on the move, but that no formal Congressional approval was needed. In granting most-favored-nation status to a country, the United States agrees, essentially, not to grant more favorable terms to any other trading partner.

307-> CONNECTICUT TO ALTER ITS TURNPIKE TOKENS, SOLVING SUBWAY ISSUE
Connecticut agreed today to modify its turnpike tokens so they could no longer be used for the New York City subway. The announcement here came as the city disclosed that 40,000 tokens had been retrieved from turnstiles so far, costing the city $30,000 in lost revenue since illegal use of the tokens was discovered a month ago. The subway tokens cost 75 cents; the turnpike tokens, sold in quantity, cost 17 1/2 cents. Under the agreement, Connecticut would pay to have a mint alter its 10 million tokens as soon as two weeks from now, if a study of the proposed change shows it will not cause other problems, according to Edmund J. Mickiewicz, chief administrative officer of the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The announcement came after a two-hour meeting at the West Haven toll plaza with Charles Kalkhof, the vice president and general manager of rapid transit for the New York City Transit Authority. But neither man would divulge further details of the tentative settlement of the battle of the tokens, in which 46 people have been arrested for using turnpike tokens to enter the subway. Asked if he thought peace was at hand in the dispute, Mr. Kalkhof said: ''I certainly hope so. It's a very expensive problem for New York. We can hardly afford it.'' Mr. Mickiewicz said: ''We have a feasible solution if there are no problems. But we'll have to see.'' Both the Connecticut Transportation Department and the city's Transit Authority will study the proposed modifications to the turnpike token for two weeks before officials meet again, Mr. Mickiewicz said. The problem has been that the turnpike token, with a diameter of 0.880 inch, is only five-thousands of an inch larger than the subway token. A change in the turnpike token's dimension could involve altering its thickness or its diameter, Mr. Mickiewicz said. 3 Alternatives Weighed Before the meeting this afternoon, a Transit Authority official familiar with the discussions said three alternatives were being considered: ''rolling'' the edges of the tokens to make them thicker and smaller than the subway token; flattening them to make them thinner and substantially larger in diameter, or striking a notch, slot or serrated edges on the tokens. The transit official said any of the three possible changes could be made with the existing tokens by the Roger Williams Mint of Attleboro, Mass., which made both the turnpike and the subway tokens. The nature of the alternatives indicates that Connecticut's earlier proposal that its tokens be coated in nickel, making them magnetic and thus different from the subway tokens, may have been abandoned. David Kilmartin, the president of the mint, who attended the meeting today, said alterations to all 10 million tokens could be completed for $15,000 in 10 to 15 days. The tokens could remain in circulation throughout the process, he said, as those collected at toll stations were sent to the mint for modification. Connecticut officials at one time suggested that the Transit Authority simply mint new and different tokens if the subway fare is raised to fill a transit deficit. But Mr. Kalkhof said a possible fare increase did not come up in today's discussions. Since turnpike token sales began on Oct. 18, 7,655,680 tokens have been sold in 188,167 rolls of 40 at $7 each. The Greenwich toll plaza, the closest to New York City, has sold 36,205 rolls. And the West Haven toll plaza, at the turnpike's midpoint, has sold 32,496 rolls. First Found on Nov. 6 On Nov. 9, six days before the turnpike began accepting the tokens, the Transit Authority first found them in subway fare boxes. John D. Simpson, the Transit Authority president, asked Connecticut to stop selling the tokens until a solution was found; officials of the Connecticut Transportation Department replied that it was ''New York's problem.'' Mayor Koch personally made the request of Gov. William A. O'Neill - only to be turned down. Mr. Koch and Mr. Simpson, meanwhile, mounted Operation Pariah, a campaign of increased police patrols in subway stations. The transit police since then have arrested 46 people for using turnpike tokens on the subway, and 13 people for using metal slugs, according to Jeanne Edelson, the director of public affairs for the Transit Authority. But, according to Mr. Kalkhof's statement today that 40,000 turnpike tokens had been found in subway fare boxes, many other offenders have apparently continued the practice unhindered.

308-> A CONVERSION TO THE REAL WORLD
WHEN THINGS OF THE SPIRIT COME FIRST Five Early Tales. By Simone de Beauvoir. Translated by Patrick O'Brian. 212 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $13.95 Literature abounds with works published long after they were written, when an eager public clamors for anything bearing the nowhonored name of the established author. We know of works that could not be published in the author's lifetime because of their subject (E.M.Forster's novel about his homosexuality, ''Maurice,'' for example), of first novels published only because the author's second was so successful (John Fowles's ''The Magus'') or works long considered too experimental and then brought out to satisfy a devoted band of readers (Samuel Beckett's ''Watt''). Now Simone de Beauvoir has joined this rank with the publication of her first completed work of fiction. Forty-five years after they were rejected for ''heaviness and tedium'' (by Gallimard) and for lacking ''any originality at a deeper level'' (by Grasset), the five stories that make up ''When Things of the Spirit Come First'' are now translated into English following their French publication in 1979. These stories, written during the years 1935-37, when Miss de Beauvoir was between the ages of 27 and 29, appear at an appropriate time. An exploration of her entire canon and its impact is long overdue and particularly timely today, when many of the spheres of intellectual thought and political activism in which she played a seminal role are undergoing major shifts: for example, the feminist movement, which is clearly seeking redefinition and new impetus. Simone de Beauvoir is generally regarded as one of the leading feminist theoreticians and intellectuals of our time. Her fiction has had both critical and commercial success in many languages, and her nonfiction has thoroughly documented her beliefs as a political activist. Her influence has been felt in areas ranging from philosophical inquiry to pacifism. Her conceptualization of the status of women in ''The Second Sex'' preceded every other contemporary work on the subject of women and 33 years after its publication still powerfully affects the international women's movement. Her relationship of more than 50 years with the late Jean-Paul Sartre placed her at the center of the philosophical circle that made Existentialism so significant in the mid-20th century. The five stories in this book were written after Miss de Beauvoir had abandoned several complete and partly complete early writings that were never offered for publication because of what she called ''shoddy romanticism.'' She wrote this book when she was already involved with Sartre and was teaching in the provinces, away from Paris, her family and friends, at a time when her own life was undergoing the extreme changes so eloquently recorded in the second volume of her memoirs, ''The Prime of Life.'' She had already decided that fiction should be her means of expression and to this end began experimenting with short texts that fictionalized her own experiences as well as those of other women. In the five stories that each bear the name of a single woman, she wrote about five different approaches along as many different paths toward the discovery of the same personal truths. To further unify the stories, she chose a theme reflected in her first title for the book, ''Primaute du spirituel'' (The Ascendancy of the Spirit). When she discovered that Jacques Maritain had already used this title, she changed it slightly to ''Quand prime le spirituel'' (When Things of the Spirit Come First). Although the five stories are independent entities, the leading characters of some appear as background figures in the others. All the stories deal with the harm done to young women by the excessive religiosity that dominates their backgrounds and constricts the marital and educational opportunities and possibilties of behavior open to them. In the preface to the book, written some 40 years after the stories themselves, Miss de Beauvoir describes this as ''the dangerous influence of that kind of spiritual life'' and speaks of her desire to ''tell their (the women's) stories and also to deal with my own conversion to the real world.'' These are stories of young women in the process of defining what they want to be; of their youthful attempts to break free of familial, social and religious restraints, to learn to respect themselves as well as to love others, to come to terms with commitments either freely chosen or else imposed, and to dare to flaunt social convention. Miss de Beauvoir writes about the undefinable feelings that presage the first youthful discovery of femininity and concurrent passion. She writes of role models who no longer serve, of friends who disappoint, of men who behave, quite simply, as themselves. When placed within historical context - the bourgeois French society of the early part of this century - these stories can be read as accurate reflections of that culture, portraying a suffocating insularity requiring great courage for undereducated women to rail against. It is this emotional toll that Miss de Beauvoir conveys so successfully. Despite certain failures of style, there is a realistic cast to these stories that makes the situation of the women tangible. One can almost smell the garbage spilling out of the too-small pail that it is Marguerite's duty to carry down five flights each evening after dinner, and one lurches along in the overcrowded Metro with Marcelle, who sometimes feels so sick ''that she was often compelled to get out and finish the journey on foot.'' THE stories have not been published exactly in the order in which Miss de Beauvoir wrote them: They appear as ''Marcelle'' (written second, originally entitled ''Renee''), ''Chantal'' (third), ''Lisa'' (first), ''Anne'' (fourth) and ''Marguerite'' (fifth). Her decision to rearrange them is correct because this allows the book to begin and end with women who are spirited and interesting, possessing by far the most intelligence and vitality. With ''Chantal'' and ''Anne'' she takes deliberate stylistic risks that for the most part succeed. ''Lisa,'' the weakest in terms of content, gets buried in the middle so that its conventional predictability is mitigated by its placement. ''This book is a beginner's piece of work,'' Miss de Beauvoir writes in the preface, with ''obvious faults,'' and ''Lisa'' comes closest to fitting this judgment. ''Chantal'' begins splendidly with the diary of the provincial teacher who romanticizes her dull life, but it disintegrates when Miss de Beauvoir seems unable to decide whose point of view the narrator should embrace. ''Anne'' is the author's first attempt to write about her friend, Elizabeth Mabille, the ''Zaza'' of her memoirs. She begins with a dramatic monologue in which Anne's mother prays at Sunday Mass, rambling through pride, self-abasement, selfevasion, willfulness and vengeance. Miss de Beauvoir then moves smoothly on to scenes of French family life on summer holiday, but the story drifts into jargon once Anne reaches the point at which she must make important decisions about her life. The final outcome, though true to Miss de Beauvoir's life, seems contrived when fictionalized. ''MARCELLE'' and ''Marguerite,'' are stories about two sisters. Marcelle is moody, bright and ''extraordinarily sensitive.'' Her desire is ''to live with a man of genius'' and be ''his companion,'' for when she is ''in the company of these intellectuals she felt rich with a mysterious femininity.'' She insists upon a disastrous marriage and perceives very early that ''life always fell short of dreams.'' Just as willfully, she insists that solitude and suffering will form a higher calling than happiness. ''I am a woman of genius,'' she proclaims, and we believe her. ''Marguerite,'' which Miss de Beauvoir calls ''a satire on my youth,'' is the most openly autobiographical of the stories and the one whose details will be most recognizable to readers of the memoirs. This ''little bourgeoise trying to act the bohemian'' triumphs over religious and familial crises and ends with her explanation of how she came to ''try to look things straight in the face, without accepting oracles or ready made values. I had to rediscover everything myself, and sometimes it was disconcerting - furthermore, not everything is clear even now.'' The importance of this book today lies in its demonstration of how early in her career Simone de Beauvoir recognized and expressed the ideas that would figure throughout her writing, particularly the question of the forces that determine women's lives. Recently she remarked that she would write no more fiction, nor would she publish any early works other than this one. She feels that her canon is complete and ''one book more or less will not change anyone's opinion about the body of my work.'' Her last fiction published before this was ''The Woman Destroyed,'' a collection of three stories about older women who are made vulnerable to suffering by old age, loneliness and the loss of love. Now, with this book about five young women, we have the perfect set of bookends to enclose a remarkable lifetime of writing.

309-> CITY'S DENIAL OF A TAX BREAK TO TRUMP IS RULED IMPROPER
The state's highest court ruled unanimously yesterday that New York City had improperly denied a multimillion-dollar tax abatement to Donald J. Trump, the developer who is erecting a 59-story building on the site of the old Bonwit Teller store in midtown Manhattan. The tribunal, the Court of Appeals, invalidated a rule used by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development in determining who qualifies for the tax break. The court said that the rule was more restrictive than the Legislature had intended when it set up the tax-abatement program in 1971 to encourage the construction of residential housing. No Clear Guidelines Given The court ordered the city's Housing Commissioner, Anthony B. Gliedman, to reconsider Mr. Trump's application on the basis of whether the Bonwit Teller site was ''underutilized'' property. But other than saying what was not meant by the word ''underutilized,'' the court gave no clear guidelines for defining the term and left a final determination to the housing agency. Mr. Trump's building, which is known as Trump Tower, is on Fifth Avenue at 57th Street. It includes 18 floors of retail and commercial space and 38 floors with 266 luxury condominiums. The condominiums are being sold for a total of $268 million, in prices ranging from $500,000 for the smallest one-bedroom apartments to more than $5 million for a triplex. The high court did not specifically say that Mr. Gliedman must award the tax abatement to Mr. Trump, but it did reject all the reasons the city had given for denying it. The city had contended that the property was not ''substantially underutilized'' because the building it had contained was not ''functionally obsolete.'' The city also said that the tax exemption had been designed to encourage the construction of low- and middleincome, rather than luxury, housing. Both arguments were rejected. City officials did not view the ruling as a victory for Mr. Trump. In a statement, Mayor Koch said, ''The Corporation Counsel has advised me that, in his opinion, this same determination -denying the exemption - could be substantiated.'' Frederick A.O. Schwarz Jr., the Corporation Counsel, said: ''There are extremely powerful arguments that the exemption still should be denied, and certainly we are going to make every effort, within the law, to make sure it is denied. It seems to us that it is quite inequitable and unnecessary to grant an exemption on a luxury apartment house that is making lots of money for its owner.'' Questions regarding the impact of the decision were referred to Commissioner Gliedman, but his staff said that he was unavailable for comment. The decision was, however, hailed by Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump's attorney, as ''a shot in the arm'' for the real estate industry in New York City. The city has said that the tax abatement would be worth $20 million over 10 years, but Mr. Trump has described it as a ''modest'' abatement worth between $7 million and $10 million. The discrepancy, he said, is caused by economic uncertainties. If granted the abatement, Mr. Trump would pay no taxes on the building during the first two years after its completion. In the next eight years, the amount of taxes he paid would gradually increase. After 10 years, he would be taxed at the full rate. Under the state's Real Property Tax Law, the site for which a developer seeks an abatement must have previously been vacant, predominantly vacant or underutilized. At the time Mr. Trump applied, the law said the property must have been underutilized as of Oct. 1, 1971. It now requires that the property be underutilized in the 36 months before new construction. But the city had adopted a regulation that defined ''underutilized'' as land that contained a ''functionally obsolete'' structure. It denied Mr. Trump's request because the Bonwit Teller site ''was not occupied by a functionally obsolete nonresidential or residential building.'' The court, in an opinion written by Judge Sol M. Wachtler, said, ''Had the Legislature intended to limit the availability of the exemption solely to property underutilized by virtue of the presence of functionally obsolete structures, it could have done so through appropriately worded legislation.'' Previous Ruling Overturned ''By requiring functional obsolescence of the building,'' the court continued, ''then the regulation improperly limits the availability of the exemption to one category of underutilized land in direct contravention of the plain words of the statute.'' The ruling overturned a decision by the Appellate Division in May that denied the abatement. The appellate court had overruled a lower court decision that allowed the abatement. Yesterday's decision did not make new law. It simply prohibited the city from imposing conditions that are not contained in the statute. Even with the uncertainty of the decision, Mr. Cohn said it was a welcome one for the real estate industry. ''A lot of people have been sitting back, afraid to build until this thing was settled,'' he said. ''It is a shot in the arm for their proposed buildings.

310-> A PLAY-IT-SAFE PHILOSOPHY PERVADES HIGH POINT MARKET
HIGH POINT, N.C. ''THIS is the first market in two years that has opened on an optimistic note,'' said Robert P. Gruenberg, general manager of the Southern Furniture Market, a wholesale center for more than 1,300 furniture manufacturers based here. ''Since about 60 percent of all furniture is bought on credit, the falling interest rates should have a positive effect on business,'' Mr. Gruenberg said. The optimism was cautious, for no one is sure when the economy will pick up. Furniture sales have been sluggish for several years now and retail-store buyers, who descend on this North Carolina town twice a year to shop furniture-showroom displays, don't seem ready to gamble. ''It is still too early to take risks,'' said Robert Kok-las, a buyer for the May Company, a chain of 34 department stores in southern California. ''Most of us are interested in just filling in with the basics that we feel confident will sell.'' These sentiments were echoed by many other buyers, who came from New York to Colorado for the nine-day show, from Oct. 14 through 22. Furniture manufacturers were playing it safe too. Rather than emphasizing new designs, they stressed quality, details and versatility. For the present, showrooms continued to be a sea of traditional reproductions, as they have been for the last two years. Even companies known primarily for contemporary designs appeared to be less daring and even, at times, downright nostalgic in their approaches, their furniture reflecting everything from Art Deco styling to 17th-century French Provincial influences. Although many companies displayed new lines this fall, the designs were hardly innovative. Most so-called introductions were simply spinoffs from designs that sold well in previous markets. The Baker Furniture Company, for example, introduced a collection of 60 designs based on 18th- and 19th-century French furniture. It was prompted by the 1981 success of its Stately Homes Collection, reproductions from the homes of 14 titled English and Scottish families. This year's Baker collection includes everything from a Louis XV armoire to a Napoleon day bed. Prices range from $225 to $4,500. William V. Barborka, director of advertising for Baker, said, ''It appears there is still a growing trend in fine traditional furniture.'' Thomasville seemed to agree. Its showrooms featured a collection called French Court, which includes 35 pieces based on Louis XV styles. The Lane Furniture Company is also capitalizing on its success with traditional furniture. Now that its America Collection, which the company introduced last April in conjunction with the Museum of American Folk Art, is selling well, it is continuing the American Country look with a line of oak furniture called Country Crafts. These pieces are geared to smaller spaces and budgets. ''Since 35 percent of all new housing today are condominiums, coping with small spaces is a growing problem,'' said Bill Martin, advertising director for Lane. ''The average two-bedroom condominium is about 930 square feet and each bedroom usually measures 11 by 12 feet.'' One of Lane's answers to storage in these small rooms is an oak dresser 58 inches wide and 70 inches high that is compactly designed to include drawers, an armoire for hanging clothes and a mirror. The piece will retail for about $800. In a more contemporary-styled response to the space shortage, Progressus, a Swedish company, introduced a stackable wall system available in red-, white- or black-lacquered finishes. It is designed in modules that have small drawers, shelves and grid bins. A unit 32 by 32 inches will cost about $600. Since electronic equipment is finding its way into more homes these days, one would expect to see a large selection of storage units made specifically for these items. But there were only a few noteworthy pieces, among them a wall system at the Design Institute of America made to house stereo and recording equipment. This new entertainment center is smaller than some of its past designs. It is only 40 inches tall and comes in two pieces, one 44 inches wide and the other 33 inches. The system is available in black nickel, chrome and platinum with smoked glass shelves. It will retail for about $1,100. ''Right now we are working on systems for many components and home computers,'' said Robert Winzeler, president of the Design Institute of America. ''But it still seems too early for the public to respond to these ideas.'' Not every manufacturer feels that the way to a small-home or apartment owner's heart is through small-scale items. Overscale, especially in upholstered furniture, is making a strong appearance. Homes may be getting smaller but people aren't, says Milo Baughman, the designer for Thayer-Coggin. His new line of what he terms postmodern furniture is a collection of generously proportioned chairs and sofas that have oversized pillows and curved classical arms. Pastel colors such as salmon pink, celadon green and sky blue also follow the postmodern spirit. Several manufacturers, including Thayer-Coggin, are stressing the importance of details. Shirred fabrics, welting, scroll backs and bun feet give a custom-made look to these mass-produced items. This year the Lambert Furniture Corporation, in collaboration with Greeff Fabrics, introduced several country pieces that are reproductions from the Shelburne Museum in Vermont. A love seat, for example, features shirring along the bottom, shirred bun feet, scroll arms and ruffled pillows. John Mascheroni, the designer for Swain Designs, uses traditional details in a contemporary setting. His three-piece sectional, which costs $4,400, has two-inch-thick down-filled cushions. They are outlined in flat welting. ''People today like down not only because it is comfortable, but also because it has a softer, less tailored look,'' Mr. Mascheroni said. This more relaxed styling was also evident at Selig, where a sofa bed was loosely draped in a reversible quilt. The piece, which costs $950, unfolds so that the quilt also becomes a bed cover. But perhaps the least tailored piece of all was Directional's almost comical ''no slouch'' chair. Designed by Howard Meister, a SoHo sculptor, it is a simple slipper chair with a slipcover that hangs as loosely as a painter's drop cloth. The chair costs $425 and comes in nylon, canvas, cotton or silk slipcovers. The chair looked so inviting that tired buyers couldn't resist trying it out. Nor could people pass the Sherwood showroom where a Pac-Man machine was the main attraction. The machine was there to promote Sherwood's Pac-Man chair, designed by Milo Baughman. These bright yellow vinyl chairs come in three sizes: children, $49; preteen, $79, and adults, $99. ''This is our one departure from practicality,'' said Stanley Smith, vice president of Sherwood. ''So far nobody knows quite what to make of it.'' Whether buyers will gobble up these chairs remains to be seen.

311-> Sanyo in England
Sanyo Marubeni U.K. Ltd. expects to make videotape recorders at its Lowestoft, England, plant, a company official said. The plant, which opened in October, would continue to emphasize the production of color television sets next year, but might assemble videotape recorders by 1984 or 1985.

312-> SCIENCE WATCH; PARTICLE SEARCH HALTED AMID HOPEFUL SIGNS
EFFORTS at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva, to produce the long-sought particles embodying the so-called weak force that controls many subatomic reactions, were suspended Monday night with no announcement that the particles had been found. Physicists at the center said it might be spring before the voluminous data could be fully analyzed. They said, however, that the machine used for the tests, which makes beams of protons and antiprotons collide head-on, had recently begun working so well that for a while it seemed likely at least some ''W'' particles had been produced. Current physics theory predicts that the weak force (which, for example, causes some forms of radioactivity) should be embodied in a class of particles known as intermediate vector bosons. They would consist of electrically positive and negative W particles and a neutral Z particle. These particles, according to the theory, should materialize from the burst of energy generated by proton-antiproton collisions in the giant circular machine at CERN. The newly ended run of experiments began in October and will be resumed in April after the machine has been used for other tests. In recent weeks there have been reports of ''candidate'' events in which, for example, an electron was ejected at a large angle and at an extremely high energy. This event could have represented the decay of an extremely short-lived W particle with the expected mass (expressed in equivalent energy units) of about 80 billion electron volts. Pending more detailed analysis, however, these findings have been called unconvincing.

313-> CARDS TURN BAD FOR LAS VEGAS
For Las Vegas, the easy assurance of an ever more prosperous future built on gaming revenues has given way, at least for now, to an intense competition among casino executives for a share of a shrinking business. This has been a difficult year in a city accustomed to an annual growth rate of 15 percent to 20 percent in casino revenues. This year's growth - up 7.3 percent through September, to $1.35 billion - has barely outpaced inflation. The head count is down. Unemployment is 12.4 percent. And profits in many of the bigger hotel-casinos are taking a beating. A shakeout is already taking place, in the view of many executives and analysts. Horn & Hardart, which closed its Royal Americana last March, reportedly agreed yesterday to sell the hotel to an investment group for only $15.4 million, its book value; plans to sell the financially ailing Dunes Hotel were announced Monday, and an illtimed expansion has left the Riviera heavily in debt. 'A Maturing Business' ''This is a maturing business,'' said Jeffrey Kahn, audit chief of the Nevada Gaming Control Board. ''In order to resume growing, it needs strong operators who can bring in fresh business,'' he said in an interview in Las Vegas earlier this month. But Saul F. Leonard, a partner in Laventhol & Horwath, an accounting firm that follows the gaming industry, said the city would eventually shake its present malaise. ''Those companies with the better management will recover faster,'' he added. Many, however, doubt that Las Vegas can recapture the heady growth rates of the recent past. The blossoming of Atlantic City, for example, which can draw from a population of 56 million people within 300 miles, has diverted thousands of potential gamblers away from Las Vegas. Attendance at the New Jersey resort is expected to top 19 million in 1982, compared with about 12 million in Las Vegas. But, for now, Atlantic City, with only 4,000 hotel rooms, is not the biggest problem facing Las Vegas, gaming officials say. By most accounts, the city's casino industry has been hurt more by the recession, Mexican credit losses, rising air fares and an oversupply of quality hotel rooms. ''Las Vegas is the victim of a series of concurrent events, all of which are negative,'' said Daniel R. Lee, a gaming analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. In good times, seven major hotels collectively cater to a pool of about 250,000 identified ''high-rollers,'' or people who bet with $5,000 or more on house credit. These gamblers typically lose at least $1,000 on each visit to a casino, and account for a disproportionately large share of a hotel's gross win. Impact of Peso Devaluation But the recession has thinned the ranks of these high-rollers, according to several hotel executives. Moreover, the casinos have had to write off more than $40 million in credit to Mexican bettors who are now unable, or unwilling, to repay their debts because of that country's new fiscal and currency-exchange controls. ''The Mexican devaluation killed the big credit houses,'' Mr. Kahn said. Dunes Hotels and Casinos Inc., for example, says that Mexicans accounted for about 32 percent of its gambling-credit business. It was partly the Mexican debts, the company said Monday, that forced it to sell its landmark hotel to Clifford and Stuart Perlman for $185 million. The Sands has also suffered big credit losses, according to analysts, but the Hilton, the Tropicana, the MGM Grand and the Desert Inn have not been hurt so much. The MGM Grand fared better in part because ''we're not as liberal as most hotels with credit procedures,'' said Alvin Benedict, president of MGM Grand Hotels Inc. In general, figures from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau suggest that business in 1982 has been about the same as last year. Air Traffic Up 6.2% Most Las Vegas visitors come by air, and regularly scheduled flights brought 6.2 million in the year's first nine months, up 4.2 percent from 1981. But visitors arriving on chartered flights fell 21.5 percent, to 515,000. A steady increase in the number of available rooms is also contributing to the problems of hotel operators, analysts say. There were 50,270 guest rooms available in Las Vegas at the end of September, up from 45,815 at the end of 1980. At the same time, average occupancy rates have declined by 6 percent. Southern California, with more than 14 million residents, has long been a stable reserve for casino operators. That market has held up, with drive-in traffic up 2 percent, to 1.8 million people, through September, officials say. With the high-roller business in the doldrums, and the Atlantic City threat looming larger, many casino executives want to promote Las Vegas more as a resort destination and not just a gambler's town. About 40 casinos and local businesses recently hired a former public relations representative for the Six Flags Corporation, Richard Tyler, to attract more sporting and musical events. A Change of Image ''Las Vegas should offer more to people than large-scale gaming,'' he said. For example, he added, ''We'd like to get Luciano Pavarotti here and build a major international music festival around him.'' In contrast to the high stakes, credit-oriented houses, those casinos that have built a steady business on a mix of middle-income, family and blue-collar customers have continued to do well. The president of one casino on the city's famous Strip, who asked not to be identified, said he expected that at least two of the seven major hotel-casinos would have to follow suit to stay in business. Places like the Flamingo Hilton, the Stardust and the Frontier are drawing large crowds to sprawling slot-machine parlors and $2 craps tables with $1 million jackpots, inexpensive meals and rooms for two priced between $20 and $35. Another of the discount casinos, Circus Circus, added 500 rooms last year, to increase its total to 1,600. The hotel, which shuns high-priced entertainment in favor of arcade amusements, and which recently listed a double-occupancy room for $20 on weekends, occasionally is booked full three months in advance, according to a reservations clerk. William Bennett, president of Circus Circus, refused repeated requests for an interview, but a source close to the casino said its net income rose 11 percent through September. Meanwhile, at Caesar's Palace and the MGM Grand, where room rates were $95 and $64 recently, casino crowds are down. Las Vegas has gone through slumps before, mostly as the result of overbuilding, and some experienced executives say it is only a matter of time before the high-rollers return and Las Vegas recovers. Others, however, caution that Atlantic City is likely to overtake Las Vegas this year in total gaming revenues. While some of that is the result of luring first-time gamblers from the East Coast, a sizable portion is coming from Las Vegas customers. Anthony C. Atchley, executive vice president of Del Webb Hotels, which owns the Mint in Las Vegas and the Claridge in Atlantic City, said many East Coast gamblers no longer come to Las Vegas. ''We're trying to zero in on them for the Claridge,'' he said. The problem for Las Vegas, he said, is that casinos have to have a good mix of customers and compete aggressively for them. ''Marketing is the key,'' he said. ''Aggressive marketing.''

314-> SHULTZ, IN EUROPE, TO SEEK A JOINT POLICY
Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrived here early today at the start of a two-week tour of Western Europe to try to put into effect a new agreement on a joint economic policy toward the Soviet Union. The Administration is still uncertain whether France will abide by the accord, State Department officials said in Washington, and one of the goals of the Shultz mission is to find out from President Francois Mitterrand and Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson whether France is ready to join the other allies in the economic policy approach toward Moscow. Without French concurrence the month-old accord could collapse, officials said. On the flight here from Washington, Mr. Shultz said in a news conference that he had noted an emphasis on the desire for more constructive relations in Soviet-American exchanges since the death of Leonid I. Brezhnev last month. Mr. Shultz said that, in the various European capitals and at the foreign ministers meeting of the Atlantic alliance in Brussels, he would ''compare notes'' on what has been happening since Yuri V. Andropov became the new Soviet leader. 'Trying to Test It Out' Discussing the recent exchanges with the Russians, Mr. Shultz said that ''both sides have said they are interested in a more constructive relationship, and we are trying to test it out.'' ''Just what it may be as of this point we just don't know,'' he said. ''We will have to find out and, if anything different emerges, it will have to emerge in terms of substantive things.'' He denied that the United States was insisting that the Soviet Union make the first move. He said the United States was willing to enter into discussions on differences and to try to reach solutions at the negotiations already started on arms control. Mr. Shultz, sitting in the front cabin of his Air Force 707, seemed interested by what he acknowledged was a new tone in Soviet-American exchanges. ''It is as though people are saying the same things they were saying before,'' he said. ''Where we had said and they had said, 'We would like to see negotiations be successful,' there has been a tendency to underline to that a little more. But nobody's substantive position has shifted.'' He said that, in the messages sent between the two capitals, there has been ''a little more emphasis'' put on seeing negotiations succeed. Meeting Today With Kohl Later today, Mr. Shultz is to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. In addition to the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Thursday and Friday and a cabinet-level session with Common Market countries on Friday to discuss continuing differences over agricultural subsidies, Mr. Shultz will have talks with the new Socialist Government in Spain to find out how far Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez wants to stay from the alliance, which the previous Spanish Government joined. In his first major trip abroad without the President since becoming Secretary of State, Mr. Shultz will also visit Paris, Rome, The Hague and London. State Department officials said that at the NATO meeting, the allies are expected to discuss contingency plans for lifting or reducing sanctions against Poland if the Polish Government, as rumored, ends martial law on Dec. 13, the anniversary of its imposition. State Department officials said the allies had insisted on three conditions being met for ending sanctions: lifting martial law, releasing all political prisoners and resuming discussions between the Government, the independent labor movement and the Roman Catholic Church. The issue that will have to be addressed is how far the alliance should go if Poland meets some but not all of the conditions. ''We should not be taken in by cosmetic changes,'' a senior official said. As described by American officials, the talks Mr. Shultz will have in Paris are likely to be the most crucial. Administration officials said the White House was particularly distrustful of the Mitterrand Government and was hoping that Mr. Shultz would be able to bring back from his talks a clear idea of French intentions.

A new professional basketball league has been formed although the format is not new at all. The Pro-East Basketball Association will begin its first season on Jan.14 and run though March 13. There will be teams in eight cities, among them New York and Hazleton, Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pa. Games will be played on weekends so that players may pursue full-time jobs. Sound familiar? ''Yes, it's a takeoff on the old Eastern League,'' said Al Verssen, the new league's commissioner and a mathematics and computer science teacher at Francis Scott Key Junior High School in Brooklyn. ''Some of these cities were the heart of the Eastern League in the days when it was the training ground of the National Basketball Association.'' Peter Alfano

322-> U.S. REFUSES ORDER FOR DATA ON DRAFT
Government prosecutors paved the way today for dismissal of charges against a young draft resister by refusing a Federal judge's order that the counselor to the President testify and that White House documents be made available to the defense. But Richard Romero, an assistant United States attorney, said that if the judge dismissed the case ''the Government will promptly pursue an appeal.'' Attorneys for David Alan Wayte, 21 years old, of Pasadena, a former philosophy student at Yale University who is charged with refusing to register for the draft, contend that he is being selectively prosecuted because of his outspoken stance against a possible military draft. The attorneys maintain that access to the documents on the Reagan Administration's policy for prosecuting draft resisters, coupled with testimony by Edwin Meese 3d, the counselor to the President, would prove their case. Executive Privilege Cited Mr. Romero refused to honor Federal District Judge Terry J. Hatter's order, citing the doctrine of the executive's privilege to withhold information in the national interest. ''As we have explained at some length in other pleadings in this case, it is our position that important governmental interests are at stake in connection with our claim of privilege, which we sincerely believe have not been shown to be overridden in this case,'' Mr. Romero said in a written refusal filed with the court. ''Nor can we concur in the court's conclusion that a sufficient basis has been established to justify requiring the appearance and testimony of an official as senior as the counselor to the President,'' the document said. ''Contrary to the court's finding in its order,'' Mr. Romero continued, ''the record amply demonstrates that decisions relating to the prosecution of nonregistrants were made within the Department of Justice and that there is, therefore, no nexus between the White House and the selection of the defendant for prosecution.'' White House Data Sought The Government's position is in response to an order last Friday by Judge Hatter that White House documents, including transcripts of meetings of the Military Manpower Task Force and memorandums from the White House and the Selective Service System, in addition to Mr. Meese's testimony, be made available for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Mr. Wayte had been singled out. William G. Smith, one of Mr. Wayte's attorneys, said the Government's response was clearly a victory for his client. ''We're pleased because we're confident that the judge will grant a motion to dismiss the indictment,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We think we've made a prima facie case of selective prosecution which the judge has supported on record.'' Mrs. Smith also contended that the Administration was ''trying to put itself above the law by refusing to turn over the documents or allowing Meese to testify,'' and predicted, ''We're going to prevail if the Government does appeal.'' If Judge Hatter does dismiss the case, the Government is expected to file an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

323-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Fritsch Retires
After 12 seasons in the National Football League, the place-kicker Toni Fritsch retired yesterday. Signed by the New Orleans Saints this season after the Houston Oilers had cut him, Fritsch missed on a 20-yard field-goal attempt in the Saints' 3-point loss to Tampa Bay Dec. 5. Then, last Sunday against Dallas, one of his kicks was blocked and he missed from 40 yards on another. ''I was very unhappy about my performance the last couple of games, and at my age I don't want to be very unhappy,'' said Fritsch, who is 37 years old. He said he would return to his home in Vienna and become a coach in soccer, a game at which he had been good enough to make the Austrian national team before coming to the United States. His replacement with the Saints will likely by Morten Anderson, a rookie. ... John Roveto, the place-kicker waived Monday by the Chicago Bears, says he is considering legal action against the team, but the Bears insist that they are within their rights. ''You're not supposed to be able to be put on waivers if you're injured,'' said Roveto, who contended that he had played with an injured leg for the last three weeks and that the team doctor told him two weeks ago that he would be placed on injured reserve. Movement to the reserve list on Monday, instead of to the waiver list, would have allowed him to receive his salary for the last two weeks of the regular season, pay that will be denied him now that he has been cut. Responding to Roveto's charge, General Manager Jim Finks said yesterday: ''We sent him to our team doctor today, and the doctor said he was healthy and could play football. So we stand by waiving him.''

324-> AROUND THE NATION; Storm Strikes Midwest, With Up to Foot of Snow
By The Associated Press A snowstorm, the first of the season in the Middle West, swept across the Corn Belt yesterday, bogging down the already late harvest with snow up to a foot deep, disrupting travel and snapping tree limbs still heavy with foliage. Two deaths were reported after vehicles skidded off wet and icy roads, one in Omaha and one in Freeborn County in southeastern Minnesota. Electrical power was knocked out in some areas and travelers were stranded by the storm, which hit western Nebraska on Tuesday, then pushed across southeastern South Dakota and southern Minnesota into Wisconsin and Michigan, with winds gusting to 50 miles an hour. Farmers were worried about their corn, a great amount of which was still in the fields because planting had been delayed by an unusually wet spring. Jack Aschwege of the Nebraska Crop and Livestock Reporting Service said only 7 percent of the state's corn had been harvested.

326-> Required Reading Recalling Burke
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, in remarks before the 20th annual conservation conference of the National Wildlife Federation. Dec. 8, 1982: In 1790, Edmund Burke explained the basis of government and the society it governs as a ''partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are dead, and those who are to be born.'' It cannot have escaped your notice how applicable these words are to the stewardship of our public lands. If we are to maintain our fiduciary relationship to the generations to come, then we must maintain our lands, and their lands, in perpetual trust. These last remnants of our great natural heritage are not ours to destroy for short-term profits. What the Administration is proposing to do with lands held in the public trust is pursue a course of so-called ''privatization.'' It means selling off chunks of the public's lands. Remember that we are in a very depressed economy. This has had a deep impact on the real estate markets. Where does the Administration think the buyers are coming from? And how many will be able to pay fair market value for these properties?

329-> PUBLISHING: '82 SALES OFF AND '83 COULD BE WORSE
''THINGS have been spotty for booksellers all year,'' said G. Roysce Smith, executive director of the American Booksellers Association. ''Right up until November, they were wondering if things were going to pick up.'' Christmas is by far the single most important selling season for booksellers, and sales did indeed pick up during the holiday, according to The New York Times's computer-processed figures from 1,600 bookstores in every region of the United States. ''Christmas saved the year,'' said a bookseller in Pittsburgh. But the same bookseller, as did many others, reported ''very flat'' overall sales for 1982 and predicted, ''It will get tougher before it gets better.'' In many ways the plight of bookstores in 1982 mirrored the condition of the country's sluggish economy generally, but the industry is still worse off than it has been in decades. ''I don't think the book business has ever been hit so badly since the Great Depression,'' said Mr. Smith, whose association represents some 5,500 booksellers. ''In fact, books have generally been considered recession proof.'' No longer. And one reason, to judge from the most common complaint lodged by booksellers in an additional New York Times survey of 97 booksellers in 31 states, is the perception that book prices are too high. Economists say that the rate of increase in book prices has lagged well behind the inflation index for a decade or more. And industry officials, even those who worry most that rising book prices will scare off buyers, point to much higher book prices in Britain, Japan and most other developed nations. Booksellers, too, insist that books are still cheap in comparison to other forms of entertainment. ''A $3.95 paperback lasts three nights, a $5 movie only two hours,'' said a New Hampshire bookseller. Nevertheless, higher prices are very much on the mind of booksellers in a number of states, including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Tennessee and Florida. One Maine bookseller, asked about the outlook for next year, replied: ''Lord knows. If prices keep going up, no one is going to buy books.'' A bookseller in an affluent New Jersey community, who reported a good Christmas season and a much better 1982 than 1981, said that he was selling ''very few'' of the high-price ''coffee-table'' books, which depend heavily on holiday sales. A Connecticut bookseller said that the problem was not so much that book prices were rising, but that they had ''shot up so much so quickly, as if the publishers are trying to catch up overnight.'' It should come as no surprise that bookstores in the Midwest, like many other businesses in that region, had a particularly rough 1982. ''Sales were bad, very down, for the first time in six years,'' said a Michigan bookseller. ''Sales were down this Christmas. The only day they were up was the 23d of December.'' Asked about prospects for next year, he replied, ''I am terrified, and I do not know what to do.'' At the same time, certain bookstores in the so-called Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia and Arkansas reported a bad 1982 and a bad Christmas season. Bookstores in Texas and Florida reported a generally good year - a store in St. Petersburg reported that 1982 sales were about 12 percent ahead of last year, which was its best year ever - but even in the heart of the Sun Belt, booksellers felt the economic impact. ''Christmas sales were down 15 percent over 1981, and they were poor for the whole year,'' said a bookseller in a Florida beach community. Sales this Christmas bore a closer resemblance to 1980 levels than to last year's, according to the computer figures. Sales of best sellers during the 1980 Christmas season were relatively unaffected by that year's economic slump, and they did relatively well this holiday season also. For example, James Michener's ''Space,'' the No. 1 hard-cover fiction best seller, sold more copies in Christmas week than the top three hard-cover novels combined sold during Christmas week last year. Even ''Different Seasons'' by Stephen King, the No. 9 hard-cover fiction title, sold as many copies last week as last year's No. 1 fiction title, ''An Indecent Obsession'' by Colleen McCullough, did during the same period in 1981. But again, sales of both fiction and general best sellers were lower in the Middle West than elsewhere in the United States. While the nation's general economic health is beyond the control of booksellers, many owners have not been content merely to sit back and pray for an upturn. ''They've been more aggressive because they've had to be,'' G. Roysce Smith said. ''More stores were taking markdowns before Christmas than in the past. And bookstores have been taking in more sidelines the last few years, adding stationery and greeting cards.''

331-> COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND POLITICS DO MIX
To the Editor: Stanley Turkel of the City Club urges a revision in the collective bargaining process for New York City and its municipal unions, and suggests limitations be considered on the support municipal labor unions may offer to candidates running for office while responsible for collective bargaining (letter Nov. 22). As the basis for this bit of fine-tuning of our democratic system, Mr. Turkel cites the recent experiences of Mayor Koch, who ran for Governor while collective bargaining was taking place. Mr. Turkel claimed that the Mayor was negotiating with people whose support he was seeking while ''at the same time municipal union leaders attempted to influence the candidates with whom they negotiate ... through campaign donations and by directing the votes of their union members.'' What an astonishing reading of recent events. There were no more vigorous and outspoken supporters of Mayor Koch's opponent than the leadership of District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (the city's largest municipal union), the United Federation of Teachers and other unions then negotiating with the city. To his credit, the Mayor never showed any difference in his conduct toward those unions that publicly supported him and those that actively opposed him. While negotiations and the primary campaign were taking place, dozens of reporters asked me and other union officials if we detected any actions by the Mayor that could be attributed to resentment of our support of his opponent. Repeatedly the answer was ''No.'' Mr. Turkel first completely distorts what took place; then, based on his distortion, he describes the municipal bargaining process as ''flawed.'' It is difficult to take his logic and his suggestions seriously, yet they appear in The Times and must be described for what they are: Not a misguided but a deliberate attempt to impose reactionary, undemocratic strictures on the collective-bargaining process. If anything, the recent experience in New York City provided virtually a textbook example that collective bargaining, freely and openly conducted, represents one of the strengths of our democratic system. Mr. Turkel takes on a foolishly impossible task when he tries to link political support with the results of the recent contract negotiations as a base for attacking collective bargaining. VICTOR GOTBAUM, Executive Director, District Council 37 New York, Nov. 22, 1982

VIRGINIA SETS 2 MARKS IN ROUT CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Nov. 26 (AP) - Ralph Sampson scored 25 points and Kenny Lambiotte, a freshman, added 17 as top-ranked Virginia set two school records and tied another tonight in a 124-60 rout of Johns Hopkins. The victory came in the opening game of the Virginia Tipoff tournament, which Virginia has won six times. Virginia will meet Virginia Commonwealth, a 78-67 victor over George Mason, for the title Saturday night. Virginia scored the first 7 points, 5 by Sampson.

The 64-point victory margin tied the school mark set in 1914 in an 80-16 romp over Wake Forest. Sampson, who left the game with 12:12 left, made 10 of 14 fieldgoal attempts and 5 of 7 free throws. He also grabbed nine rebounds and blocked five shots. Also in double figures for the Cavaliers were Dan Merrifield with 13 points, Tim Mullen with 12, Craig Robinson with 11 and Othell Wilson with 10. Virginia used 12 players and all scored.

333-> SUMNER CROSBY, 73; MEDIEVAL ART EXPERT WAS YALE PROFESSOR
Dr. Sumner McK. Crosby, professor emeritus of art history at Yale University and an authority on medieval art and architecture, died Tuesday at Waterbury (Conn.) Hospital following a stroke. He was 73 years old and lived in Woodbridge, Conn. Dr. Crosby retired in 1978 after teaching at Yale for more than four decades, beginning in 1936. He was named a full professor in 1952. He also served as chairman of the art history department from 1947 to 1953 and from 1962 to 1965. An author and editor of several works on medieval art and architecture, he was completing a major study of the Abbey of St. Denis near Paris at the time of his death. Wartime Arts Adviser During World War II, Dr. Crosby was executive secretary of the American Council of Learned Societies' committee on the preservation of cultural materials in war areas, and a special adviser to the State Department on the restitution of cultural materials. In 1950, the French Government named Dr. Crosby a chevalier in the Legion of Honor, and later made him an officer in the Order of Arts and Letters. Dr. Crosby was born in Minneapolis. He attended Phillips Academy, graduated from Yale in 1932 and received his Ph.D. there in 1937. He also studied at the Ecole des Chartes in Paris. Dr. Crosby is survived by his wife, Sarah; four sons, Sumner McK. Crosby Jr. of Woodbridge; Gerrit L. Crosby of Woodstock, Vt.; William F. Crosby of Tucson, Ariz., and Frederick T. Crosby of Old Lyme, Conn.; two sisters, Eugenie Tyler of Woodbridge and Olive Case of Wayzata, Minn.; a brother, Thomas M. Crosby of Long Lake, Minn., and six grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at Yale's Dwight Chapel on Nov. 27 at 2 P.M.

334-> One Killed and 3 Hurt In Queens Bar Robbery
A shootout in a Queens bar early yesterday left a robbery suspect dead and three other people wounded, including an off-duty state corrections officer, the police said. Three men entered the bar - the U-Go Inn, at 23-02 33d Street, Astoria -at 3 A.M., pulled a gun and demanded money, the police said. Patrick Dufficy, 26 years old, the corrections officer, was shot when he tried to stop the holdup. A customer, Carmen Moya, 40, was also shot. As the robbers tried to flee, the police said, another officer shot two of them. They were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, where one died. The other suspect was listed in critical condition. The police identified the dead man as Ismael Arturo Del Gato-Matos, 18. The third robber escaped. The wounded customer and Officer Dufficy were listed in good condition at the City Hospital Center in Elmhurst, Queens.

335-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; N.F.L. SEASON IS IN PERIL
This is the week of decision in the National Football League labor dispute. If the players' strike is not settled by the weekend, and if games are not played by the following Sunday, Nov. 7, look for the owners to let the 1982 season evaporate. Sunday night Leonard Tose, the owner of the Philadelphia Eagles and a member of the Management Council's executive committee, warned, ''I'm only speaking as one man, not for the committee, but I think the season's over.'' To that, Tex Schramm, the president of the Dallas Cowboys and a member of the N.F.L.'s competition committee, added yesterday: ''I think it's premature for Leonard Tose to say that, but the next few days will be crucial.'' For the N.F.L. to cancel the season would require the formal approval of at least 21 of its 28 clubs. ''Calling off the season is very, very close,'' said Jim Miller of the Management Council. ''The players haven't gotten that message.'' The union has argued that if the season were canceled, the 1,500 members of the players assocation would be declared free agents, creating a chaotic market for players for the 1983 season. But the N.F.L. club owners would surely go to court to retain their rosters. The threat to the season has developed because of the N.F.L.'s insistence both on maintaining the Jan. 30 date for Super Bowl XVII in Pasadena, Calif., and on having at least a 12-game regular-season schedule, including the two games that were played before the strike. ''O nce you go to fewer than 12 games,'' Tex Schramm said, ''it would be difficult to establish credible divisional champions.'' If the labor dispute were to be settled in time for the season to resume Nov. 7, both a 12-game schedule and the original Super Bowl date would be salvaged by inserting regular-season games on Jan. 2 and Jan. 9, using the Jan. 15-16 weekend for divisional playoffs and moving the two conference championship games to Jan. 23, originally an open date. ''Regarding the Super Bowl date, we've had a commitment since 1979 to several hotels and other facilities in the Los Angeles area,'' said Don Weiss, the N.F.L.'s executive director, who supervises the Super Bowl logistics. ''We promised to deliver certain things at certain times.'' Moving the Super Bowl date to late February, which the union has argued is possible, would mean that some regular-season games would have to be played throughout January in such cold-weather areas as Green Bay, Buffalo, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Denver, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore and New England. ''When our playoffs are in January, we occasionally have to bite the bullet on a game being played in bitter cold, as we did last year at Cincinnati for the A.F.C. championship,'' Don Weiss said. ''But if a full complement of 14 games were to be played each week in January, you're talking about six or eight of those games being held where the fans and the players would be exposed to that kind of weather.'' According to Don Weiss, the N.F.L. has been warned of ''colder than usual'' temperatures in the East and the Middle West shortly after Christmas. ''The long-range forecasts we've had from weather services and the Farmer's Almanac,'' he said, ''tell us that temperatures are supposed to be at least 6 to 8 degrees, and possibly as much as 20 degrees, lower than normal. So, from both a weather sense and a competitive sense, the regular season has to end on Jan. 9 if the Super Bowl is to be played Jan. 30.'' I n a restructured 12-game schedule, only one wild-card team in each conference - instead of two, as in recent years - would qualify for the playoffs. Meanwhile, the N.F.L. labor negotiations are at a standstill over the players association's demand for a wage scale and a central fund from which salaries would be paid. Over the weekend, the mediator, Sam Kagel, returned to his San Francisco home after both the union and the Management Council had refused to budge on that issue. ''Until the players regain control of their own union,'' said Chuck Sullivan, the executive vice president of the New England Patriots and the chairman of the Management Council's executive committee, ''there will be no progress.'' After the meeting of the 28 team player representatives Sunday in Washington, the union's executive director, Ed Garvey, reaffirmed the solidarity of the players. But the question remains, as it has since the strike began: Is Ed Garvey representing the players' wishes, or are the players, by striking, representing Ed Garvey's wishes? Several players, for example, have suggested publicly that the issue of the wage scale and the central fund has not been worth a strike. In addition, the players association's two alleged all-star games that were on cable TV a week ago were not worth a penny to the nonparticipating players. The union was paid $1 million by Ted Turner's ''superstation'' for the TV rights. But the 160 participating players collected a total of $440,000 ($3,000 for each of the players on a winning team, $2,500 for each of the players on a losing team); the remaining $560,000, according to Brig Owens of the players association, paid the cost of insurance and workmen's compensation, equipment, travel, promotion and game expenses. Brig Owens also said that Ted Turner had lost about $800,000 in the promotion. ''B ut the owners learned,'' Brig Owens said yesterday, ''that the players can put on a game.'' Except that neither was a game anywhere near N.F.L. caliber. As in the Pro Bowl, which is not really N.F.L. caliber either, no blitzing was allowed. And, if a view of the Los Angeles game was any guide, quarterbacks were treated tenderly. On one kickoff, none of the tacklers and blockers on the TV screen were off their feet when the ball carrier was eased out of bounds. Maybe the players put on a game, of sorts. But in the process, maybe they realized that they are not ''the game,'' as their union battle cry contends. And if the season isn't resumed, ''the game'' won't exist at all.

337-> STAGE: 'HOLLY AND IVY,' PARSON AND 2 DAUGHTERS
WITH its successful productions of ''The Winslow Boy'' and ''The Browning Version,'' the Roundabout Theater has made a persuasive case for the enduring value of the old-fashioned plays of Terence Rattigan. Last night the Roundabout advanced this cause further, albeit unintentionally, by reviving a lookalike, Rattigan-style work, ''The Holly and the Ivy,'' which Rattigan did not write. The author is Wynyard Browne (1911-1964), and his play, which was written in 1948, doesn't just creak - it clunks. After seeing it, one feels even more admiration for Rattigan's ability to breathe life into the conventions of the well-made drama. One can also see just how those conventions, when flogged to death by lesser talents such as Browne, must have suffocated the British theater in the period just before ''Look Back in Anger'' cleared the air. ''The Holly and the Ivy,'' which is being staged at the newly renamed Susan Bloch Theater (formerly the Roundabout Stage Two), does have a potentially fascinating protagonist. The Rev. Martin Gregory (Gwyllum Evans) is a country parson, five years away from retirement and a widower, who wonders if his life has been misspent. A bright, nondoctrinaire, intellectually curious man, Parson Gregory has ''preached enough sermons to fill 150 books'' and yet doubts that anyone in his village has ''paid attention to any of them.'' He fears that instead of enlightening his flock he has made a career of doing ''silly, trivial things'' for ''silly, trivial people.'' While it's refreshing to meet a stage clergyman who is suffering a personal rather than a spiritual crisis, Browne only states this predicament and never dramatizes it. In lieu of digging deeper into the parson's psyche, the author fills the quaint Gregory living room with seven stock figures and plunges them through a series of contrived domestic conflicts that often raise tedious side issues and push the hero offstage. The main story, which is set over 24 hours of symbolic Christmas revelry and holly-strewing, involves the Rev. Gregory's two daughters. Jenny (Jennifer Harmon) has devoted her young adulthood to taking care of her father; she at last wants to leave home but doesn't want to abandon the aging parson at his time of loneliness and need. The other sister, Margaret (Pamela Brook), is a toney fashion writer in London, unlikely to quit her fast-paced Fleet Street career to take Jenny's place. Or so it seems until Browne pulls a switcheroo in his third act. The playwright accomplishes his turnabout through trickery. Margaret has several dark secrets, each unconvincingly manufactured, that may yet draw her back home to Dad. The secrets are revealed to her various relatives in artificially spaced increments - a dramatic process as exciting as a two-hour striptease. Jenny also has a secret that's withheld from her father, if not everyone else, until the end: she wants to marry an engineer (Gerald Walker) who's emigrating to South America. Since the parson is manifestly a generous and understanding man, we never do understand why both daughters don't tell him the truth and resolve everything in the play's very first scene. The evening is stalled further by the eccentric doings of two elderly aunts (Betty Low and Helen Lloyd Breed) and the unasked-for confessionals of a middle-aged cousin (Thomas Ruisinger) and the parson's prodigal son (Frank Grimes). The rest is inspirational talk, none of it witty, much of it bland and repetitive. ''Everything has its roots in something else - in the past,'' goes one of Browne's Yuletide chestnuts. We also learn that ''our lives take on meaning because of someone else'' and that all religion comes from ''the need to make sense of the world.'' It isn't too long before we realize just why the parson's sermons put his congregation to sleep. ''The Holly and the Ivy'' has never received a previous major production in New York, but it did become a popular film following its initial London run. Not having seen the movie version, I assume it was enlivened by the stellar cast, which included Ralph Richardson, Celia Johnson, Margaret Leighton and Denholm Elliott. The actors in the Roundabout production are all quite decent and hard-working, but they lack the distinctiveness that might impose some saving character on the text's flat language. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of this revival is that its director is Lindsay Anderson. It's a total mystery why the man who has championed David Storey's plays and who has directed such films as ''This Sporting Life'' and ''If...'' would have any interest in going to the mat with ''The Holly and the Ivy.'' That said, it can be reported that the staging is highly polished until the final scenes. At that point the author's last-minute plot resolutions come so fast and furiously that not even Mr. Anderson can prevent a previously genteel and becalmed play from rattling dementedly in its grave.

338-> VOLUNTEER GROUP FOR ELDERLY SHOWS ITS VIGOR ON 11TH BIRTHDAY
Some carried canes, others sported corsages and many demonstrated a mean fox trot as they danced old age away yesterday in the Roseland Ballroom. Ranging in age from 60 to 90, some 5,000 energetic workers were expected to celebrate the 11th birthday of the Retired Senior Volunteer Program, which places New Yorkers in volunteer jobs with more than 500 community organizations. At yesterday's bash, the first of a two-day celebration to be concluded today and to be attended by 2,500 volunteers each day, officials of the program feted their members with awards, entertainment and dancing. They pointed with pride at the program's growth - to more than 10,000 workers - and to its success at changing public attitudes toward the elderly. ''Instead of being looked on as parasites,'' said James Sugarman, the program's director, the elderly ''are seen as valuable members of society.'' The program, which places workers in schools, hospitals, drug centers and even some city agencies, is partially financed by the Community Service Society of New York, a nonprofit social services agency. Yesterday's festivities began with a forceful rendition of ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' by Belle Lazarus, a 78-year-old mezzosoprano. Mrs. Lazarus sings and plays the trumpet with the Mildred Bratman Orchestra, which entertains at homes for the elderly. ''The love we get back - that's our reward,'' she said. The hourlong show that followed featured such entertainers as Mike Burstyn, who played the title role in ''Barnum''; Lee Roy Reams, the star of ''42nd Street,'' and Eartha Kitt. The show was produced by Philip Gerard, 69, a former vice president of Universal Pictures. ''I've had a very full experience in motion pictures,'' Mr. Gerard said, ''and I wanted a purposeful, productive involvement where I could give back to the community.'' In the audience was Ruth Beckles, 73, who teaches sewing and arts and crafts at a Brooklyn club for the elderly five days a week ''to keep myself young,'' she said. Louis Peters, 85, wore a ten-gallon hat with a fluffy feather and savored the jokes of a comedian named Emile Cohen. Mr. Peters himself tells jokes and entertains in nursing homes. ''I'm a sick man,'' he said, ''but when I see other sick people and their smiling faces, it's therapy for me.'' The hit of the party was Eartha Kitt, who growled a steamy rendition of ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love.'' Like the other entertainers, she donated her services. ''I may be a senior citizen any minute,'' she said.

339-> Three Shows of 'Plenty' Missed by Kate Nelligan
Kate Nelligan, who managed despite a high fever to open Thursday night to outstanding reviews in David Hare's ''Plenty'' at the Public Theater, was forced to miss three performances over the weekend. ''She had a virus but is fine now,'' Joseph Papp, producer of the Public Theater, said yesterday. Miss Nelligan had a fever of 102 degrees on opening night. She went on with a fever of 101 degrees at the final preview on Wednesday night, which was attended by several critics, who were unaware of her illness. The Canadian-born actress was in the play Friday night, again with a fever but missed the Saturday matinee and evening performances and the Sunday matinee. Her understudy, Randy Danson, took over for her in the role of a young English woman who had been a courier for the French Resistance behind German lines during World War II and who drifts into madness in postwar British society.

352-> TV: REPORT ON 'WHITE COLLAR MOB'
AT 8 tonight, WOR-TV, Channel 9, commemorates the 25th anniversary of the famous gathering of alleged Mafia caporegimes in Apalachin, N.Y. ''White Collar Mob,'' a one-hour documentary presided over by F. Lee Bailey, the lawyer, begins with the unsupported estimate that criminal enterprises are second only to America's oil industry in gross profits and are No. 1 in net profits. It concludes with the dire warning that the economic and political power of white-collar criminals ''may soon make them impossible to fight.'' In between, we are offered a smattering of history, including warmed-over charges that J. Edgar Hoover was reluctant to take on organized crime; videotapes of Abscam conspirings and of an East Harlem street scene that, we are told, depicts a heroin sale but could be practically anything; a semicoherent interview with Harold Kaufman, a Government informer who sounds like Bugs Bunny, on the mob's control of garbage collection, including toxic-waste disposal, in New Jersey and New York; a few minutes of Judy Campbell Exner, who claims to have been friends with Frank Sinatra, with the late Chicago mob chief Sam Giancana and with John F. Kennedy all at the same time; and several present and former law-enforcement officials who draw attention to connections between the mob and the White House, past and present. The hottest news in this show is that Mrs. Exner believes that ''the Kennedy men were morally bankrupt.'' (Is the zest with which reformed parties, like Mrs. Exner and Mr. Kaufman, vent their newfound righteousness against former accomplices and alleged lovers a necessary side effect of taking an overdose of purity?) ''White Collar Mob'' is the first of a series of four WOR documentaries under the title ''The War Within,'' designed, the publicity release says, ''to highlight the forces at work in American society that are tearing us apart.'' It is a hyped-up brand of journalism that uses surmise as evidence. One of the more sensible observations comes from the Abscam prosecutor who says, ''I don't believe there's some don sitting in Bensonhurst sipping coffee who controls the economy of the United States.'' Mr. Bailey may be correct when he reports that the Mafia has tens of thousands of members who control thousands of businesses and union locals, but nothing in this hour supports those figures or most of the other charges. The moralizing Mrs. Exner's concession, ''I can't back up some of the things I know,'' may be taken as a coda for the entire program.

353-> 60-MINUTE GOURMET
A SURPRISING number of people are not aware that if you master just one basic cooking technique, then you have a whole host of foods that you can prepare with equal facility. Take mayonnaise or hollandaise, for example. If you can make mayonnaise, you can convert it into countless tasty dishes simply by adding one ingredient or another. You can turn the basic sauce into cucumber sauce to be served with fish by adding cubed cucumber; into a sauce tartare by adding capers, chopped sour pickles and herbs; into a sauce remoulade by adding chopped anchovies and chopped tarragon. You can turn a hollandaise into a sauce Choron by adding tomato or into bearnaise by using tarragon and crushed peppercorns. One of the finest and most versatile of techniques is known in English as breading and in French as ''panees'' or ''a l'anglaise'' (''English style''). It is can be done quickly, as in one of my favorite breaded dishes, medallions of pork, using thin slices of boneless loin. The technique is this: Take the meat - boneless chicken, fish or whatever (scallops in season are especially good) - and dip them in flour, then in a beaten egg mixture until well coated and finally in fine fresh bread crumbs. If you want to add an Italian or Milanese touch to the dish, you can blend a little Parmesan cheese with the crumbs. That is all there is to it except the cooking. Breaded foods are cooked in a shallow amount of hot oil until browned on both sides. Serve with lemon wedges, a vegetable accompaniment and salad. A quickly made dish of potatoes and carrots in a light cream sauce is excellent. Medaillons de Porc a l'Anglaise (Breaded pork scallops) 1 1/2 pounds boneless loin of pork, trimmed of almost all fat Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1 egg 3 tablespoons water 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon corn, peanut or vegetable oil 1/3 cup flour 1 cup fine fresh bread crumbs 3 tablespoons butter, optional Lemon wedges for garnish. 1. Cut meat or have it cut crosswise into 12 slices of equal thickness. Pound each lightly with flat mallet. Arrange on flat surface and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. 2. In side dish combine egg, water, one tablespoon oil, salt and pepper. Beat well to blend. 3. Put flour in second dish and bread crumbs in third. 4. Dip pork slices in flour to coat thoroughly, shaking off excess. Dip each in egg mixture and then in crumbs to coat well. Pat to help crumbs adhere. 5. Heat about 1/4 cup of oil in large, heavy skillet and add a few breaded slices to fill skillet without crowding. Cook about 5 minutes on one side until golden brown. Turn and cook about 5 minutes or slightly longer on other side. Transfer to warm platter. Continue adding oil and pork until all are cooked. 6. Heat butter until lightly browned and pour over meat. Serve with lemon wedges. Yield: 4 or more servings. Pommes de Terre et Carottes a la Creme (Potatoes and carrots in cream) 3 large carrots, about 1/2 pound 3 large Idaho, Maine or russet potatoes, about 1 1/2 pounds 1 1/4 cups milk 1/2 cup heavy cream Salt to taste if desired Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese 1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley. 1. Preheat broiler to high. 2. Trim carrots and scrape. Cut each into eighth-inch thick rounds; there should be 1 3/4 cups. 3. Peel potatoes and, using knife or a food processor, cut into thin slices, each about sixteenth of an inch. As potatoes are sliced drop into cold water to prevent discoloration. Drain. There should be about 4 cups. 4. Bring milk, cream, salt, pepper and nutmeg to boil in skillet. Add potatoes and carrots. Stir. Let simmer, stirring often, 25 minutes. 5. Turn potato and carrot mixture into baking dish. Sprinkle with cheese and run under broiler until nicely browned on top. Sprinkle with parsley and serve. Yield: 4 or more servings.

354-> OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS
To the Editor: I read the Nov. 6 news article ''7th-Day Adventists Face Change and Dissent,'' by Kenneth Briggs, with interest and concern. In our opinion, it contained some inaccuracies. Mrs. White was not the founder of the church. The denomination developed from the Adventists who looked for Christ to come in 1844. A young preacher named Hiram Edson first recognized that perhaps the Scriptures pointed to something other than the second coming that year. Further Bible study by Edson, the Whites and others led to Seventh-day Adventism as we know it today. We believe that the basic doctrines of the church go back to apostolic times. Worship on Saturday is based on the Genesis account of God's creation of the world in six days, resting on the seventh. In Exodus 20, the Fourth Commandment specifically mandates keeping the seventh day holy. The 100 ministers cited as leaving the church in recent months were, in fact, 100 pastors, workers and other members. Of a total ministerial force of 9,400 serving around the world, far less than 1 percent have resigned, and no significant membership loss overall has been noted as a result of theological differences. In fact, the church continues to be one of the fastest-growing in North America. With regard to intellectual freedom, if one is engaged to teach Adventist theology that has been accepted and affirmed by the great majority of the church constituency and then elects to teach opposing concepts, a very practical problem is posed: the salary of the teacher is paid by the church body that affirms denominational theology. Just as a corporation would not allow its training force undue intellectual freedom in presenting other than company-approved guidelines, so the members of the church consider it inappropriate to have its religion teachers do so. To refrain from wearing wedding rings is not a tenet of faith, and neither is vegetarianism. Only about 50 percent of our membership is vegetarian. (Studies have shown that the Adventist life style - which includes emphasis on nutrition, exercise and the nonuse of tobacco, alcohol and caffeine -results in Adventist men living seven years longer than the average male.) What is considered central in Adventist thinking is living for Christ and being of service in the world. A lesson that might have been learned from the change and dissent discussed in Briggs's article is that in the final analysis the church is people. Bible study and a prayerful relationship with the Lord change lives and personalities but will never neutralize them. We thank God for the rich diversity within our ranks. G. MERLIN KRETSCHMAR President Greater New York Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Manhasset, L.I., Nov. 10, 1982

355-> HOW NOT TO CURE LEBANON'S ILLS
To the Editor: Karim Mroue's Op-Ed article of Nov. 19 certainly had a catchy title: ''Lebanon for the Lebanese.'' However, his prescription for achieving the stated goal is fatally flawed. he Lebanese National Movement, for which he presumably speaks, is a hodgepodge of intellectual luminaries and street gangs that were hiding behind the skirts of the P.L.O. and the Syrian occupiers in Lebanon. Now that this protection has evaporated from Beirut, Mr. Mroue offers an olive branch to his enemies. I call this pseudoreconciliation under duress. I would have liked to give him the benefit of the doubt and accept his good intentions. However, in his article he fails to mention by name the Syrians, who must vacate the Lebanese scene simultaneously with the Israelis, the P.L.O. and sundry groups of mercenaries (such as the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, invited by the Syrian ''peacekeeping forces'' to fight in Lebanon). Mr. Mroue also stated that ''the Palestinian civilians living in Lebanon be allowed to remain and be protected, along with their social and political institutions.'' Does he really believe that, after the bitter lessons of the civil war, a sovereign Lebanese government would again consider allowing the Palestinians to have ''political institutions''? Unless his memory is woefully short, he might recall that such a foolish gesture was what created the P.L.O. state within a state in Lebanon and precipitated the country's descent into the abyss. If Mr. Mroue and the people he speaks for really want a Lebanon for the Lebanese, they should demand the withdrawal, forthwith, of all the foreign forces. They should also strive to make the Lebanese National Movement truly Lebanese and refrain from parroting all the extreme doctrines of their mentors, the so-called radical Arab states (Syria, Libya, Algeria, Iraq, etc.).

356-> NEW YORK; New York Wants You!
My friend Trafalgar called last week in a snit about my columns on the worrisome state of the city's finances and the resultant crumbling of our public works. Trafalgar, you may recall, is the oracle who some months ago proposed building subways in El Salvador to create construction jobs for the hungry peasants and simultaneously provide transportation to carry Salvadorans to the polls on election days so they could vote for democracy. The Reagagnomes in the White House snubbed that seminal idea, but this hasn't extinguished Trafalgar's messianic spirit. ''You're always writing that the city has no money and the roads and bridges and sewers are all falling apart,'' he scolded over the phone. ''Just the other day you blithered on about potholes yawning in the streets as big as tank traps.'' ''Well, isn't that what's happening?'' I asked calmly. ''Sure, sure,'' he said, ''but you haven't got a single new idea as to what to do about it. You're paid to have ideas, not to repeat tired cliches like setting up an infrastructure bank.'' This hurt to the quick, speaking of cliches. ''O.K., Mr. Omniscience,'' I challenged. ''What would you do about the city's problems?'' ''It's as simple as the tank trap on the Queensboro Bridge,'' he shot back. ''We've got to bring in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines.'' ''The city isn't in riot, Trafalgar,'' I protested. ''What would the troops do here?'' ''We wouldn't send them all in right away,'' he said. ''Just a few advisers at first to look over the situation and report back to the Pentagon on how many divisions are needed.'' ''And then what?'' ''And then they'd come in and start cleaning up the mess and rebuilding the city,'' he explained patiently, as to a child. ''The anarchy here would soon be over.'' ''Can you give me a small example?'' ''I can give you dozens of examples, my dear chap. Take the traffic chaos. It's one thing to sail blithely through red lights when the only symbol of authority in sight is an intimidated traffic agent in a chocolate-brown uniform who is frequently mistaken for a doorman at a second-rate hotel. Can you imagine any driver doing this if the man in the intersection were a marine in camouflage fatigues, draped in fragmentation grenades and brandishing a loaded M-16 rifle? Want some more examples?'' ''I'm all ears,'' I said resignedly, knowing that old Trafalgar couldn't be gagged now. ''O.K.'' he said. ''Our bridges are in disrepair, right? You've seen the war movies. Who builds better bridges than the Marines or the Seabees? And the dirty streets - instead of falling out every morning to police their barracks areas at Quantico or Fort Benning, they could march 12 abreast with push-brooms here and make every road in every borough spotless, curb to curb. And the crime problem - you want to hear what our boys would do about that?'' ''It's not necessary. I think I get your drift. But I do have one question: who's going to pay for all this?'' ''That's the beauty part,'' he chortled. ''It's already paid for. The Pentagon budget is the only one being expanded in Washington. All the civilian aid has been cut to nothing. So we use military funds for domestic programs. And New York City offers itself as the prototype for the experiment. It's too sweet for words.'' ''But, my good fellow, why should the Pentagon buy this idea? How will it keep the armed forces in that state of readiness they're always talking about?'' ''That should be obvious, even to a pundit,'' he said. ''What better place for the Special Forces to get their anti-guerrilla training than in our subways? And could anyone find a more perfect survival-testing ground than Central Park - it's ideal for setting up firebases with barbed-wire perimeters to fend off enemy assaults against joggers and dog walkers. Our military would be the fiercest in the world. Do the Russians have anything like New York to toughen their troops on?'' ''You have a point, Trafalgar, but are the citizens of this city ready to believe that the emergency is so dire that we have to bring in our fighting men?'' ''Don't worry, we'll be able to convince them. We'll remind everyone of all the East bloc spies at the United Nations and of President Reagan's discovery that the nuclear freeze movement has been taken over by Soviet agents. We'll explain to them that, with military counterespionage units posted all over town, the next time a million average American dupes turn out for a disarmament rally in Central Park, we'll be able to catch some of those Commie infiltrators. That should do the trick.'' ''Maybe you're right,'' I said, ''but our military is a volunteer force now. How are you going to get soldiers to volunteer for New York if life is such a hassle here?'' ''Life may be a hassle, old boy, but it's also Fun City. There's not a soldier alive - after a week of strain and stress doing battle with everyone from litterers to ax-murderers - who wouldn't want to lose himself in hedonism and the sybaritic life.'' ''I see. So the fleshpots of Eighth Avenue turn out to have a grand civic purpose, after all.'' ''You've got it! You've got it!'' shouted Trafalgar, exultant over my conversion. I hope the Pentagon gets it, too. I could use a battalion on my block.

357-> GERMAN CATHOLICS FOR A NUCLEAR DETERRENT
To the Editor: Your Nov. 23 news article about a West German Government spokesman's reproach of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops for their opposition to the first use of nuclear weapons said that ''West German Catholic bishops have avoided taking a position on nuclear weapons.'' On Nov. 14, 1981, the Central Committee of German Catholics, noting the massive Soviet conventional and nuclear threat to Western Europe, declared:$''The only course open to the Western alliance, by way of response, is to equip itself with comparable weapons within a collective security system. Only in that way can it defend itself against political coercion and make it clear to a potential aggressor that ... the use of force entails considerable risks for himself as well. That is essentially what deterrence is all about. ... Under the given circumstances, then, nuclear weapons are a means of preventing war and thus maintaining peace.'' ANTHONY T.

358-> Manville Insurers Are Subject of Suit
Two companies with asbestos-related claims against the Manville Corporation, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, said they had asked the Bankruptcy Court in New York to permit the claims to be brought against Manville's insurance carriers. The Keene Corporation and Standard Insulation Inc. both bought Manville's asbestos products and both have been sued by purchasers of their insulation supplies. They said the failure of Manville's insurance carriers to defend and indemnify Manville contributed to Manville's bankruptcy filing. The companies also argued that the insurers should pay damages to Keene and Standard, saying the companies were harmed by the insurers' failure to pay Manville's share of damages in the asbestos cases.

359-> PERSONAL COMPUTERS; A BIG 1983 EXPECTED FOR THE DIGITAL MOUSE
HAVING run through apples, oranges, limes, peaches and most of the other familiar fruits in search of people-comforting nomenclature, personal computing marketeers are now setting their sights on animals. Witness, for instance, Leading Edge's Elephant floppy disks. However, the biggest computer news personality of all is soon to be the pachyderm's mythological archenemy, the mouse. In fact, after visiting the Comdex computer conference and exposition in Las Vegas last week, I came away with very much the feeling that 1983 will see the ascendancy of the digital mouse. There were mice all over the Convention Center - not among the neon-flashing, balloon-frosted displays of new computers, disk drives and tantalizing graphics systems, but scurrying about beneath the tables and in the hidden boxes backstage of the booths. What with so many firms trying to be both first to the cheese and secretive to the end at the same time, the marketing strategy in evidence seemed to parallel the psychology of Mus musculus itself. Mice as data-entry devices actually first entered the world of computers back in 1967 when Douglas Engelbart fathered the first potentiometer-driven rodent. Eventually a soap-bar-size box with a couple of buttons for ears and a long tail connecting it to the computer, this device measured changes in electrical potential as it was pushed back and forth. Using analog, rather than digital, technology, the mouse's movements had to be translated into computerintelligible information before a person, or a pointer, could be shifted back and forth across the display on the computer's monitor screen. Even so, cursor direction could be controlled without the operator having to use the keyboard. While it may not seem much of an accomplishment, a mouse coupled to the right software makes accessible a whole new style of computing. Instead of dealing with Cartesian coordinates, requiring the computer operator to strike the cursor keys, say, 17 times for left and 12 for up, all that need be done to reach a desired location on the screen is to move the mouse so that the cursor sidles directly into the appropriate division, traveling with ease even diagonally. Essentially, mice allow a nonverbal expression of information. You can say ''Put it here'' by merely pointing, rather than by typing in the commands. Touchscreens had also emerged by the time the mice appeared. But fingers are larger than the small points composing a video image, and you can't see through them. Besides, they leave greasy fingerprints. Light pens, besides being clumsy, pose the same problem of obstruction, minus the fingerprints. Joysticks can be used for cursor movement. However, they don't leave the hand free to press command or function keys for actually inducing the computer to perform the desired tasks. Despite the evolutionary advance they represented, mice remained confined to the laboratories for a number of years, breeding but slowly, until Jack S. Hawley developed the first digital mouse for Xerox in 1972. The digital mouse and today's computers are very cozy. Both speak the same binary electronic language of ones and zeros, on and off, plus and minus. Known as the Alto Mouse, Mr. Hawley's rodent was used internally at Xerox for quite some time. It finally escaped into the world at large attached to Xerox's Star computer system. But at some $20,000 or so for the complete Star system, the electronic mouse was not about to join the biological original in most people's homes. Meanwhile, however, Hawley opened the Mouse House, with the slogan ''Purveyors of Fine Digital Mice to an Exclusive Clientele Since 1975,'' in Berkeley, Calif. (telephone 415-525-5533), and set about building a better mouse for which the world would beat a path to his door. His current mouse is called X063X - you were expecting maybe Mickey? Manufactured under license from Xerox, it uses a ball on its bottom to sense movement and direction. Essentially, it's an upsidedown trackball, like those used on many video arcade games. On top are three buttons which permit the operator to activate various functions, such as text selection, scrolling and graphics manipulation, while still palming the mouse. OTHER companies, such as U.S.I. International, of Brisbane, Calif. (415-494-9111), and Mouse Systems Corporation, in Sunnyvale, Calif. (408-730-2132), produce optical mice bearing names like Optomouse and M-1. These rodent renegades from some hybrid opthalmological world use a special grid as their turf. An optical mouse pushed back and forth across a special typewriter-paper-sized board optically senses the grid beneath its feet and translates its motion into digital impulses. Proponents of optical mice claim theirs are superior to mechanical ones because they have no moving parts to break down and no ball to become gummed up. The advocates of mechanical mice, on the other hand, feel that the need for a special pad upon which the optical mouse will dance limits its flexibility. The first battle of the mouse war has only begun. It may turn out that neither optical nor mechanical mice will prove to be the eventual winners. For as the Pied Piper of personal computing begins to play the consumers' tune, a whole host of mice are beginning to clamber out of the growth and circuit cellars of Silicon Valley. Most of the new rodents can be expected to sell in the $100 to $200 range, with software extra. As usual in the industry, the little black boxes are preceding the content, and so the game of software catch-up will start all over again. But for starters, Visicorp, producer of the now-legendary Visicalc software for financial modeling, has announced its new Vision, a mouse-manipulated program that reduces operator learning time to a fraction of that formerly required for Visicalc and comparable programs. At the same time, Vision integrates a whole host of related programs and graphics into one. It's like having a desk covered with papers to shuffle. The computer screen is divided into a number of overlapping ''windows,'' and you use the mouse to move the cursor over to the sheet, or window, you want, press an ear, and the sheet moves to the fore. Move the mouse so that the cursor goes to any of the command words, such as ''Phase,'' ''Transfer'' or the crucial ''Help,'' press an ear and the computer does what you want it to do. Vision (with mouse) is expected to be available for most of the newer personal computers by the summer of 1983. Apple is rumored to be bringing out a mouse even sooner. Its much-awaited McIntosh should be in the stores by early spring. The new-generation Apple will be priced competitively with the Apple II. And what goes better with Apples than cheese?

360-> LEGISLATURE SPLIT ON POSSIBLE RISE IN TRANSIT FARES
Members of the New York State Legislature met in private conferences today and differed widely over whether an increase in bus, subway and commuter rail fares could be avoided this year in the New York metropolitan area. Following separate meetings, two key Democratic leaders, Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink and the Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, said they would not support any mass-transit tax package unless enough money was provided to put off a fare increase through the end of 1983. But Warren M. Anderson, the Senate majority leader, said he doubted enough money could be raised to close the entire deficit of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. He said some fare increase could be required. ''It depends on who you are and where you live,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''Nobody likes taxes.'' Fink Confirms Disagreement After a two-hour meeting last night with Democratic Assemblymen, Mr. Fink said: ''Yes, there seems to be a split.'' But he said he was prepared to discuss any one of more than half a dozen tax proposals mentioned in negotiations over the last few weeks. Legislative leaders are scheduled to meet Tuesday with Governor Carey and Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo, and if they can agree, the Legislature will be called into special session. But today was marked by contradictory proposals and changing figures on how much the Legislature would have to raise for the M.T.A. to prevent a fare increase. Richard Ravitch, chairman of the M.T.A., informed legislative leaders that he would require $225 million to close his budget gap, down $75 million from earlier figures. He attributed this to optimism that the M.T.A. would receive $75 million more under new Federal transit-aid legislation that is yet to be passed and signed into law. After a day of meetings in Washington, Mr. Ravitch arrived in Albany and said that though there were ''risks'' in counting on the Federal legislation, it was ''likely to happen.'' If it does not, he said, he will have to decide whether fares go up. Regan Issues Analysis State Comptroller Edward V. Regan issued a new analysis of the M.T.A. budget today and concluded that the City Transit Authority budget had been overstated by $56 million. The fiscal committee of the M.T.A., meanwhile, adopted operating budgets for its subway and commuter lines that assumed some action by the Legislature to keep the fare down. ''We approved budgets which we do not have the capacity to fund,'' said Stephen Berger, chairman of the fiscal committee. Senator Anderson said his Republican colleagues had reviewed many different taxes but had not taken votes. The group will meet again Tuesday morning, he said, before his meeting with Governor Carey. Before taking up the M.T.A. deficit, the Senate Republicans had reelected Senator Anderson as majority leader. The Taxes Being Discussed New taxes under discussion include a levy on aviation fuel, a surcharge on the stock-transfer tax, an increase in the sales tax in the M.T.A. region, and an increase in a tax on the gross receipts of oil companies. Senator Anderson said that while no consensus had been reached, he personally favored a mix of fare increases and new taxes. And several Senators from the metropolitan area emerged from the meeting to say the prospects for saving the present fares were grim. ''I don't think that any of the options will provide enough sufficient revenue to protect the fare,'' said Sen. Joseph R. Pisani, Republican of New Rochelle. Democrats Seek Fare Guarantee Minutes later, Mr. Ohrenstein said his Democratic colleagues, who provided the bulk of the votes in the Senate for aid to the M.T.A., would not vote for new taxes unless enough money was provided to keep the present fares. After a two-hour meeting with Democratic Assemblymen tonight, Mr. Fink, a Democrat of Brooklyn, said: ''It is my conference's position that we ought to act now to raise revenues so there is no fare increase in calender year 1983.'' Senator Ohrenstein, a Democrat from Manhattan, proposed that the entire M.T.A. deficit be funded through a payroll tax on employers of four-tenths of 1 percent, to raise $225 million. He called the tax an ''employer's transit tax.'' ''To put the taxes on the general business community is to put the taxes on those companies that benefit most from mass transit,'' he said. Deficits Are Reviewed At the meetings in the Capitol today, legislators also discussed deficits projected by New York City and the state. Both Senator Anderson and Speaker Fink agreed to take some action to aid New York City, but they differed on what do about the State deficit. Speaker Fink said that the Assembly was prepared to act on enough taxes, tax penalties and other fees to raise up to $380 million over the next 15 months to cover this year's state deficit. Governor Carey has put the deficit at $579 million, but Mr. Fink said that if some surplus state funds were used, the actual deficit was $391 million. Senator Anderson said his house had informally agreed to put off action on the state's deficit until after January, when Governorelect Cuomo takes office. Mr. Cuomo called Mr. Anderson's position ''totally unrealistic.'' Help for City Suggested On the city's deficit, both Senator Anderson and Speaker Fink said they were prepared to support two proposed measures: a speed-up in collection of the city's corporate tax and a change in the calculation of city pension costs. In Manhattan, the M.T.A.'s finance committee approved financial plans for the Transit Authority and the commuter railroads for calendar 1983. The budgets were then sent to the full M.T.A. board amid uncertainty about where the funds would come from. The committee approved a $2 billion budget for the Transit Authority to run the subway and bus system, a $500 million budget for the Long Island Rail Road and $385 million for the Metro North lines, made up of the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven railroad lines. Dispute on Transit Budget Comptroller Regan's report on the M.T.A. budget took exception to an expected deficit of $187 million for the Transit Authority. He put the gap at $131 million, principally by anticipating $22 million more in aid from Congress.

361-> MUSIC: SCHNEIDER'S STRINGS
EACH year for the last 14 years, the violinist Alexander Schneider has led a seminar in New York for young string players. During the Christmas holidays, students from music schools and colleges around the country study chamber and orchestral performance, and perform in concerts at Carnegie Hall and at the Kennedy Center in Washington. This year, 59 young musicians between the ages of 15 and 22 were coached by Mr. Schneider, Isidore Cohen, Felix Galimir, Bonnie Hampton, Mischa Schneider and Michael Tree. And on Wednesday night in Carnegie Hall, Mr. Schneider conducted the students in an an ensemble called the New York String Orchestra. Their program was more interesting than many similar ones played by professional orchestras. The sound of the group tended to be a bit raw, and Mr. Schneider's beat gave a thumping brusqueness to von Bulow's transcription of Beethoven's ''Grosse Fuge,'' but when soloists joinged the orchestra the music displayed the coherence and care of good chamber playing. The piano soloist Cecile Licad, brought a brisk and intelligent sensitivity to Mozart's Piano Concerto in D minor. Nuances were sacrificed for the sake of kinetic drive, but the performance remained under control, giving the work an extroverted vitality. The soloists in a poised, sometimes enchanting performance of Haydn's Sinfonia Concertante in B flat (Opus 84) were Nancy Hsuhsien Tsung, violin; Ramon Bolitata, cello; Ellen Sherman, oboe, and Richard Ranti, bassoon.

362-> SOCIAL SECURITY'S PRESENT DANGER
To the Editor: It is astonishing how rarely, in discussing the crisis of Social Security, the media have brought into focus a chief reason for the plight of that fund: the well-known fact that, all told, 14 million Americans are out of work. hese individuals naturally do not make contributions out of wages under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (F.I.C.A.), and of course no employers are called upon to make matching contributions for them. A simple calculation (14 million unemployed times $15,000 average pay times 13.5 percent F.I.C.A.) shows that there is at present a loss to the Social Security fund of $28.35 billion per annum, or $2.362 billion per month. Is it any wonder that the 36 million Americans who now receive Social Security benefits are in danger of being frustrated by default? Moreover, many of those without employment who are in the 62-to-65 age bracket reasonably elect the option of receiving Social Security benefits early. When that happens, they begin draining the fund faster than would occur in prosperous times. Again, it is not surprising that the Social Security System faces the grave threat of insolvency. Recognizing the recession's impact on Social Security gives us one more crucial reason - if such were needed - for addressing the problem of the unemployed. That population has now reached the level of the Great Depression of the 1930's, and then unemployment was not coupled to inflation. Regardless of the Administration's boasted triumph over the annual rate of inflation, the fact remains that the price of a common loaf of bread is now 80 cents, not 20 cents, as was true only a few years ago. The White House should do more than coax us into the optimistic faith that stimulation of the private sector, through big business tax reductions and similar selective boons, will create new jobs. That theory appears to be stillborn. And even if it were true in the long run, people starve, both physiologically and psychologically, in the short run. The evil is here and now, and it should be faced and remedied by whatever measures the Government can muster, with or without the cooperation of the private sector. Such measures will help 50 million Americans: the 14 million who are out of work and the 36 million who are no longer normally employable. With the unemployed again at work, they and their employers will make F.I.C.A. contributions that will shore up the Social Security fund. SAUL ROSENZWEIG St. Louis, Dec. 25, 1982

365-> S.E.C. Shifts Its View on Disclosure
In a speech prepared for delivery Friday, John M. Fedders, head of the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, says he does not believe Federal securities laws require disclosure of all illegal behavior. The statement represents a much narrower view of disclosure than was held by Mr. Fedders's precedessor, Stanley Sporkin. Mr. Fedders says in the speech, to be given at an American Bar Association meeting here, that ''conduct that violates Federal, state or foreign law may be, but is not necessarily, material information affecting investors.'' Mr. Fedders does not name specific companies for which this interpretation would apply, but S.E.C. sources said that this was the key issue raised by the agency's handling of the controversial Citicorp case. In that case, a three-month investigation by the enforcement division staff found that the bank holding company's senior management had been responsible for operations from 1973 to 1980 that had circumvented and at times violated the foreign exchange and tax laws of other countries. In a statement explaining why it did not take action against Citicorp, the commission said the company's practices were old and the matter was essentially a banking case or a tax case, not a securities case. The statement also said the transactions involved ''were not material to Citicorp.'' Citicorp maintained throughout the staff investigation, and in Congressional hearings, that its foreign exchange trading practices were ''basically proper'' and had been ''thoroughly disclosed.'' The transactions at issue had involved $46 million in profits that were shifted to avoid foreign banking regulations, according to S.E.C. staff documents. Under Mr. Sporkin's leadership as head of the enforcement division, the commission appeared to have developed a rationale that almost any action that might be at odds with laws in this country or abroad were inherently material and should be disclosed.

370-> JANET MACKAY COLE, RIDER IN HORSE SHOWS
Janet MacKay Cole, a former horse-show rider and judge, died Thursday in Boonton, N.J. She was 80 years old. Mrs. Cole and her husband, John Tupper Cole, who died in 1975, performed in the National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden and at local shows on many occasions. Among Mrs. Cole's best known horses were My Love, Cherokee Princess and Checkmate. Mrs. Cole was one of the first Americans to judge the dressage competition, featuring the fancy walk, trot and canter steps developed in Europe. Mr. Cole was captain of the United Stated Equestrian Team that won the Olympic Games gold medal at Los Angles in 1932. Mrs. Cole is survived by a son, Frederick MacKay Cole, of McLean, Va., a daughter, Jean Gascoigne, of Boonton, and a brother, John F. McKay of Locust Valley, L.I.

371-> OPTIMISM GROWS OVER BALLET TALKS
Things seem to be looking up for the first time in the American Ballet Theater's nine-week labor dispute with its dancers. Spokesmen for both the Ballet Theater management and the dancers, who are represented by the American Guild of Musical Artists, showed guarded optimism yesterday, with three consecutive days of solid negotiating behind them and the prospect for continuing talks over the weekend. ''There has been a better atmosphere since Tuesday,'' Leonard Leibowitz, lawyer for the dancers, said. ''I feel there's been real progress made on both sides,'' Charles Dillingham, general manager of Ballet Theater, added. ''We've spent a lot of time reviewing positions this week,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, ''and some time on trying to clear up the noneconomic issues. Most now are fairly well agreed-upon, with the exception of job security, but we're getting close.'' Dancers on Unemployment Ballet Theater has laid off some members of its office staff, and the dancers, now receiving unemployment compensation, have sought temporary work. One of the company's stars, Natalia Makarova, will star in a revival of ''On Your Toes,'' to open Dec. 14 at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. She will also head a cast of Ballet Theater dancers and Broadway stars who will appear on Nov. 15 at Roseland in a gala benefit for the nonprofit A.B.T. Dancers Fund, which expects to hold such benefit performance-parties yearly to raise money for loans and gifts to dancers with financial problems. On Sept. 2, after four and a half months of negotiation, the dancers were locked out following their vote to reject Ballet Theater's latest contract offer. Under the terms of the old contract, which expired Aug. 31, third-year salaries averaged $392.50 a week for corps de ballet dancers, and 19 of 23 soloists in the 91-member company received either $525 or $540, with principals receiving a minimum of $650 a week, for a 40-week year. The new contract would have offered corps dancers from $400 to $547 in the first year and from $425 to $603 in the third year. Soloists would have earned from $625 to $730 in the first year, and from $700 to $805 in the final year. The offer was described by Mr. Dillingham as representing an average increase of more than 30 percent in basic wages over the proposed three years of the contract. Mr. Leibowitz said the dancers had asked for an average increase of approximately 40 percent. Paris Appearance Canceled On the day of the lockout, Ballet Theater canceled a planned twoweek season in Paris, and later canceled fall seasons in Boston and Washington. Negotiations continued intermittently. On Oct. 25, the dancers offered to return to work under a one-year contract, with wages to be increased by the amount Ballet Theater had already offered for the first year of the new three-year contract. The proposal was rejected when negotiations resumed Tuesday. The company offered a new five-year contract; the dancers made a counterproposal for a four-year contract, which is under consideration. Neither side would disclose wage figures for the proposed fourth year. Frank Smith, the dancers' spokesman, said that among the issues under discussion have been wages, vacation pay, single rooms on tour, retroactive pay over the period of the lockout, the number of guaranteed weeks of employment and the preservation of job security and quality-of-life procedures won in the last contract, which was arrived at after a bitter nine-week labor dispute in 1979. The company's next engagement is in Miami, where it is scheduled to open Jan. 24 in a two-week season produced by the Great Artists Series in Miami Beach, which had also offered to raise $200,000 for a new production of ''La Sylphide.'' Judith Drucker, the series director, said yesterday she had given the company no cancellation deadline but hoped for a decision within ''a few more days.'' As the dispute has dragged on, the issue has been raised as to why Mikhail Baryshnikov, the company's artistic director, was not actively involved in the negotiations. The dancers are in the process of filing an unfair labor practices charge with the National Labor Relations Board against Ballet Theater, which they accuse of refusing to provide the dancers' union with access to the company's books and records. They have raised the question as to whether Ballet Theater is engaging in sufficient fund-raising. ''Most arts organizations rely much more on contributions than on box office,'' Mr. Leibowitz said. ''If they get 40 to 50 percent of the budget from the box office, they're doing pretty good. Here, it's just the reverse. Ballet Theater does great at the box office. Of their $13 million budget last year, $9 million came from the box office. If they did as well at fund-raising, we'd be in free.'' The organization has countered by suggesting that certified financial statements were available to the dancers and the public, and that it was not the job of an artistic director to participate in labor negotiations. ''We agree that the company must raise more money,'' Mr. Dillingham said. ''Consistent with that, we've raised our fund-raising budget from $3 milion received in 1982 to $4 million projected for 1983. My difference of opinion with Mr. Leibowitz is on how fast and high those increases can come in terms of an unknown future, exacerbated by the general economic climate and changes at the National Endowment for the Arts.''

372-> SECRECY RULE: A COURT TEST; News Analysis
In July, Herald Price Fahringer, the defense attorney for Edwin P. Wilson, vowed that if the Government put the former spy on trial he would ''be forced to reveal information that will shake the C.I.A. to its foundations.'' He delivered a lot less than he had promised at the trial that ended Wednesday with Mr. Wilson's conviction on charges of smuggling five guns to Libyan agents overseas in 1979 as part of more than $20 million in dealings that he is said to have had with the Libyan regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The trial provided only fleeting glimpses into Mr. Wilson's purported contacts with the Central Intelligence Agency while he was in Libya. There was a list of Soviet military equipment that a former employee of Mr. Wilson said had been delivered from Thomas G. Clines, an official of the intelligence agency, to Mr. Wilson in 1978; there was no testimony why Mr. Clines would have sent such a list. There were Mr. Wilson's meetings in Europe with Mr. Clines and Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord of the Air Force; the purpose of the meetings never came out in the trial. There was a trip by a Wilson employee to Marseille, France, to pick up a piece of Soviet equipment; the nature of the equipment and the reason for obtaining it were not disclosed. And that was about it. Dearth of Information The mystery of this first of four scheduled Wilson trials is why so little information came out. Mr. Fahringer said in an interview today that his hands were tied by a pretrial order precluding him from using classified information to support his defense that Mr. Wilson was acting as an undercover C.I.A. agent in Libya seeking to obtain military equipment. The prosecutors said there never was any evidence, classified or otherwise, that Mr. Wilson was doing any work there for the C.I.A. Because the pretrial proceedings concerning Government secrets were closed, under a 1980 statute called the Classified Information Procedures Act, it is not clear what, if any, significant evidence Mr. Fahringer was barred from using. But it appears that tactical decisions by the opposing attorneys not to call certain potential witnesses, including Mr. Wilson himself, played at least as important a role as did the statute and the secrecy order in producing a surprisingly brief and uninformative trial. Other Possible Witnesses The potential witnesses also included Theodore G. Shackley, a former high-ranking C.I.A. official; Mr. Clines and General Secord. They are all said to be under scrutiny in the continuing Federal investigation into Mr. Wilson's wide-ranging business dealings. Mr. Wilson, facing a maximum possible prison term of 39 years on Wednesday's conviction, and three more Federal trials in the next three months on more serious charges, may feel increasing pressure to try to bargain whatever information he may have about them and others for some kind of leniency, sources close to the case say. But there are no signs that serious plea-bargaining is under way. The 1980 statute that was the basis of the pretrial order limiting evidence provides for closed hearings in cases like Mr. Wilson's, so that Government prosecutors can examine classified information, presumably involving national secrets, that defense attorneys propose to use and to ask judges to exclude or limit irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible portions. If the judge rules that the evidence is admissible and is sustained on appeal, the prosecution would have to choose between proceeding and having it become public or, in an extreme case, dropping the charges. The law was designed to prevent defendants like Mr. Wilson from avoiding prosecution by threatening to disclose national secrets at their trials. A Problem in the Past This tactic posed problems in the past for prosecutors in criminal cases involving sensitive national security information, hampering and in some cases actually blocking prosecution. The transcript of some of the secret pretrial proceedings, apparently left in the public file inadvertently, shows that Federal District Judge Oren R. Lewis assserted that ''regardless of what the statute says'' he would not allow ''Mr. Wilson or anyone else to publicly divulge secrets of national importance.'' But the transcript also indictates that Mr. Wilson was not barred from producing hard evidence, if he had any, to support his contention that high-ranking intelligence officials had authorized his activities in Libya. Nor was the prosecution barred from producing hard evidence to the contrary. It is not clear why both sides chose to pass up the opportunity to explain the few tantalizing but inconclusive tidbits of evidence about Mr. Wilson's contacts with intelligence officials that the defense did put into evidence. Mr. Wilson's decision not to testify in his defense lent plausibility to the prosecution's argument that he had no proof that the C.I.A. had authorized his actions. But his decision could also have been a tactical one, based on the risks of a wide-ranging cross-examination concerning all his purported crimes. The Government's failure to call Mr. Clines or General Secord to explain their meetings in Europe with Mr. Wilson in 1978 and 1979 left open the possibility that there may be more to Mr. Wilson's C.I.A. contacts than the scraps of evidence at this trial would suggest. Prosecutors say they were prepared to call them as witnesses in rebuttal of Mr. Wilson's ''C.I.A. defense,'' if necessary, but that there was nothing to rebut.

Calling for new sanctions against the Polish Government, a group of Polish exiles and American supporters of the Solidarity union yesterday made public the names of 933 people who it said were serving jail terms of six months to 10 years for violating martial law in Poland. At a Manhattan news conference, the group, the Committee in Support of Solidarity, also charged that between 5,000 and 10,000 others remained in jail and that more than 100,000 had been arrested, interned or fined in the year since martial law was imposed. At least 35 people have been killed by the police, the committee said. The figures, compiled by the committee from official and underground sources, contrasted with those issued last week by the Polish authorities. If accurate, they indicate that the Government of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski cracked down far more harshly than it has publicly acknowledged. Polish officials have said that 10,000 people were interned at one time or another but that only 317 remained in custody. The Government said 3,616 others had been arrested for violating martial law and that 15 people were killed in demonstrations against martial law. Hundreds Reported Released In recent days the Polish Government has announced the release of hundreds of people, apparently in preparation for lifting martial law and in an attempt to mollify Western governments, which have refused to ease sanctions against the nearly bankrupt Warsaw Government until it ends martial law. Andrzej Dobrzynski, a first secretary at the Polish Embassy in Washington, insisted that his Government's announcement was accurate and charged that the committee inflated its numbers to ''get publicity.'' But Eric Chenowetch, director of the committee, which was formed last December to organize support for Solidarity in the United States, said the group probably underestimated the total number of people arrested, jailed, interned or killed. The list was made public yesterday at a news conference in the basement of the state headquarters of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. at 451 Park Avenue South.

377-> SETTLEMENT NEAR IN A PANTHER SUIT
The civil rights lawsuit stemming from a 1969 police raid in which two leaders of the Black Panthers were killed is close to being settled for $1.85 million, a Government attorney said today. Robert Grueneberg, an assistant United States attorney, said that attorneys for the Government and the plaintiffs had worked out the tentative settlement after more than a year of negotiations with the help of Federal District Judge John Grady. The suit, which accused law enforcement agents of violating the civil rights of Black Panther members, has been appealed as far as the Supreme Court in its 10 years in the legal system. ''I am happy having a settlement,'' Mr. Grueneberg said. ''I hope it's a just result.'' 9 Will Share in Settlement Mr. Grueneberg said that nine plaintiffs would share in the settlement, including the mothers of Mark Clark and Fred Hampton, the two Panther leaders killed in the predawn raid on the Panthers' West Side headquarters here. The proposed settlement is designed so that the city, the county and the Federal Government will each pay an equal share, Mr. Grueneberg said. He said that the Justice Department had already approved the agreement and that the county board was scheduled to vote Nov. 1 on paying its $616,000 share. On Dec. 4, 1969, 14 Chicago policemen assigned to the Cook County State's Attorney's office raided the headquarters. The officers carried a warrant authorizing them to search for illegal weapons at the apartment. Suit Filed in 1972 A gun battle ensued, in which the police fired more than 80 times. Mr. Clark and Mr. Hampton were killed and four of the seven other persons in the apartment were injured. A lawsuit charging civil rights violations and asking $47.7 million in damages was filed in 1972 against 28 defendants, including Edward V. Hanrahan, the State's Attorney at the time, and the city, county and Federal governments, on behalf of the survivors and the family members of those killed. After an 18-month trial in 1977, believed to be the longest Federal court trial ever held, District Judge Joseph Sam Perry dismissed the suit against 21 of the defendants without allowing the case to go to the jury. When jurors deadlocked in determining the liability of the remaining defendants, Judge Perry dismissed the case against them, too. In 1979, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reinstated the case against 24 defendants and ordered that a new trial be given ''high priority.'' The court said the Government had ''obstructed'' the judicial process by withholding certain documents relevant to the case. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court and in 1980, it refused to dismiss the case and voted 5 to 3 to send the matter back to District Court for another trial. If the tentative agreement is approved, the case will be closed, Mr. Grueneberg said.

379-> PERSONAL INCOME RISES 0.7%
Americans' personal income rose a moderate seven-tenths of 1 percent last month, the Commerce Department reported today. The report showed, however, that private wages and salaries actually declined in October. More than half the increase in overall income came in the form of Government ''transfer payments'' such as unemployment benefits for workers laid off in the recession. Spending on personal consumption, meanwhile, rose a disappointing one-tenth of 1 percent. On a more encouraging note, the Labor Department reported that new applications for unemployment compensation declined by 23,000 in the week ended Nov. 6. The 629,000 new claims were the fewest since early in September, indicating that layoffs might be slowing. But economists caution that a figure of more than 600,000 weekly claims still indicates a rising unemployment rate. Comment From Baldrige Despite the scant rise in personal spending, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige predicted that ''lower interest rates and improved consumer attitudes will boost consumer spending further during the coming months.'' He added, ''Retailers should enjoy solid sales gains during the current holiday season, compared with those of a year ago.'' Jack Lavery, chief economist for Merrill Lynch, agreed that spending should pick up in November and December. But he also said it was clear that the October income gain ''does not really reflect improvement in economic conditions.'' In October, today's report showed, total personal income rose $19.1 billion, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $2,620 billion. Private wages and salaries declined $1.8 billion, mostly because of reduced employment in industries producing durable goods such as automobiles. Government wages and salaries rose $3.6 billion from September, reflecting a 4 percent pay increase. Jobless Benefits Expand Nearly $11 billion of the overall income gain resulted from a rise in transfer payments. These include checks from the Government for Social Security and other programs as well as unemployment compensation. Jobless benefits increased by $5.7 billion, mostly because of recent legislation extending payment of the benefits by as much as 10 extra weeks. Although such payments can be spent just like income from private employers, economists say laid-off workers tend to spend as little as possible. What they do spend goes mostly for nondurable goods, such as food and clothing, rather than for new cars, houses or other major items. Also in October, the report noted, farm proprietors' income rose about $2.1 billion, interest and dividend payments rose $2.5 billion, and other nonwage income rose $1.8 billion. Rise in Disposable Income Disposable income, meaning what is left after taxes, climbed seven-tenths of 1 percent, to an annual rate of $2,220 billion, while personal consumption spending edged up to an annual rate of $2,010 billion. With income rising faster than spending, more money was channeled into savings. The report said personal savings rose 10 percent, reaching an annual rate of $156.3 billion. The national savings rate - personal savings as a percentage of disposable income - rose to 7 percent from September's 6.4 percent. Revised figures in the report showed that total income in September rose two-tenths of 1 percent rather than the three-tenths of 1 percent estimated earlier. And personal consumption spending in September grew 1.1 percent instead of 1 percent. All of the figures were adjusted for normal seasonal variations. October's personal income total is equivalent to $9,553 for every man, woman and child in the United States, based on the present population estimate of 232.7 million.

381-> THE REGION; Williams Testifies Before Senate Unit
Former Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, appeared before the Senate Ethics Committee today and said he had used excess campaign funds to pay for legal expenses in the Senate arising out of his Abscam conviction. The committee had asked Mr. Williams to answer questions after published reports appeared that he had used $65,500 of campaign contributions to pay legal fees. A Senate rule forbids members and former members to use excess campaign contributions for personal expenditures, although the Federal Election Commission allows such use. Mr. Williams described the use of the funds as official rather than personal. He said that the bulk of the money had been used for legal fees associated with his defense before the Senate during expulsion hearings last March, and that $10,000 had been used to pay for the legal fees of staff members subpoenaed before a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn investigating his conduct. Mr. Williams resigned in March after 23 years in the Senate rather than face expulsion.

The suspension includes two games Korab missed last weekend while awaiting his hearing before Brian O'Neill, the league's executive vice president. Korab drew the match penalty when he swung his stick at Dale Hunter of the Nordiques, catching him on the jaw and opening a wound that required several stitches to close.

384-> ITALIANS SAY NOTHING YET LINKS POPE ATTACK TO A GOVERNMENT
The magistrate whose office is conducting the inquiry into the 1981 attempt to kill Pope John Paul II said today that evidence gathered so far proves that the assassination was the work of several people but does not sustain assertions that it was the result of a conspiracy on the international level. The magistrate, Ernesto Cudillo, who made his statement in a press release, was evidently referring to allegations by NBC News and Claire Sterling, a journalist specializing in international terrorism, that the Bulgarian secret service, and behind it the Soviet secret police, had organized the assassination. The statement was the Italian authorities' only official response to press queries on the arrest Thursday of a Bulgarian airline representative, Serge Ivanov Antonov, on charges of complicity in the assassination. However, Ansa, the national press agency and a frequent channel for leaks from various official circles, distributed a dispatch saying that unidentified investigators believed Mr. Antonov was in St. Peter's Square when Mehmet Ali Agca, a Turk, wounded the Pope with a pistol. Easy Access to Aircraft The investigators were reported to believe that the Bulgarian Government employee's part in the assassination plot consisted of finding Mr. Agca a hideout while in Rome and that he was to spirit the Turkish terrorist out of Italy if he managed to elude the police and the crowd in St. Peter's Square. As an official of the Bulgarian airline, Mr. Antonov had access to planes at the Rome airport without having to go through passport controls. The investigators were reported to believe that it was Mr. Antonov who reserved the hotel room in which Mr. Agca stayed the night before his assassination attempt. The manager of the hotel said the room was reserved by a man speaking Italian. The Turkish gunman does not speak Italian; the Bulgarian official does. According to the investigators, Mr. Antonov had parked a getaway car right outside the colonnade that rings St. Peter's Square. However, the head of the police antiterrorist branch, Anzuino Andreassi, suggested that the Ansa account was unoffical and untrue, either in whole or in part. The antiterrorist branch is the principal police agency cooperating with the investigating magistrate. The statement distributed by Mr. Cudillo said that evidence permitted the conclusion that the gunman had accomplices, some of whom have been identified and some not. It also said that Mr. Agca met with them in Italy and elsewhwere. It concluded: ''It should be stressed that any reference to complicity by other people not the objects of the investigation under way and to the existence of alleged plots by international organs, for the present moment, on the basis of the evidence, are without any foundation.'' The investigating magistrate this afternoon interrogated Mr. Antonov in Rebibbia prison, where he has been held since Thursday, when he was arrested at his airline office. Two suitcases of documents were reported to have been seized.

385-> The Job-Killer Bill
''Why not a Datsun made in Detroit?'' So ask the newspaper ads taken by the United Automobile Workers to press for the ''domestic content'' bill expected to come up in the House tomorrow. The theory of the bill is that by requiring cars sold in this country to be at least partly made in this country, Congress would save jobs in this country. Many Congressmen, sympathetic to the plight of unemployed auto workers and angry at Japan for its protectionist policies, are tempted to go along. It would be a self-defeating mistake. Forcing big foreign car companies to manufacture here or get out might generate a modest number of jobs in the auto industry, but at a staggering cost to consumers. Worse, it would probably destroy more jobs than it creates, while crippling efforts to make American business more competitive in the world economy. The U.A.W. bill would require ''domestic content'' in cars sold here; the more sold, the more American parts and labor required. Thus, if Toyota wished to maintain its current sales of 700,000 cars a year, Toyotas would have to be 70 percent ''made in U.S.A.'' Peugeot, by contrast, would be unaffected because its share of the market is small. The overall effect, the U.A.W. contends, would be 800,000 more jobs. That claim is a wild exaggeration. The estimate offered by the Congressional Budget Office is 38,000. And those 38,000 jobs, the C.B.O. reckons, would come at great cost. Tens of thousands of jobs in export industries would be lost, either because foreigners would retaliate with their own trade restrictions or because foreigners couldn't earn the dollars needed to buy American. Consumers, moreover, would be forced to foot a hefty bill. The Commerce Department estimates that the resulting increase in production costs and reduction in competition would raise car prices by about 10 percent. To put it another way, each job created in the auto industry by domestic content legislation could cost American car buyers about $100,000 a year. If domestic content legislation is no solution, what is? A bit of realism on wages could slow the economic tide now engulfing the U.A.W. An average auto worker earns $13.15 an hour, not counting fringes - 53 percent more than the typical industrial worker. Such wages contribute to sticker shock, reducing car sales. And they encourage manufacturers to substitute robots for labor. A return to prosperity, aided by less stringent monetary policy, would help too. Many Americans can't afford new cars now because interest rates are so high; many others can't afford to go into debt regardless of interest rates because they fear for their own jobs. The hard truth, though, is that even these short-term steps can't do much to improve long-term employment in the auto industry. Legislators who are serious about improving the lives of jobless auto workers should be trying to ease their transition to productive employment. Stopgap measures to preserve auto jobs are a pointless drain on the rest of the economy and a terrible precedent for other industries under stress. A vote for domestic content would be a vote to kill jobs, not save them.

386-> POP: JONATHAN SCHWARTZ, SINGER
DURING the seven singing engagements that Jonathan Schwartz has had at Michael's Pub in the last four and a half years, he has salted his programs generously with songs written by his father, Arthur Schwartz. His current appearance at the East 55th Street restaurant (through Dec. 4) is no different in that respect except that, having gone through his father's best-known songs, he is now bringing out some that are rarely if ever heard. No one could be better qualified to do this because, as he says, ''I have an inside track'' on knowing about unknown Arthur Schwartz songs. In exposing these songs, he is doing a very worthwhile service both to the public and to his father. The ones he has chosen reveal the elder Mr. Schwartz as a consistently attractive and appealing melodist with a special flair for tunes that keep dancing on in one's mind after the song is ended. This rhythmic joy flows through ''You and I Know'' from a short-lived 1937 musical, ''Virginia,'' ''Why Go Anywhere At All?'' from ''The Gay Life'' in 1961 with lyrics by his long-term collaborator, Howard Dietz, and a new song, ''Who Knows?,'' for which Arthur Schwartz wrote both words and music. The younger Mr. Schwartz sings these songs and other Schwartz and Dietz pieces, as well as songs by such contemporaries of his father as Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart and Irving Berlin, with an airy joy that is only slightly diminished by a tendency toward heavy dramatics in his delivery.

387-> SCALPING RING BROKEN, STATE SAYS
The New York State Attorney General's office said yesterday that it had broken up a ticket-scalping ring at Madison Square Garden that traded in scarce tickets to concerts at the garden and a hit Broadway show. Attorney General Robert Abrams accused five ticket sellers employed by Madison Square Garden with having illegally sold large blocks of tickets to brokers for payments totaling more than $11,000 in the summer and fall of 1980. The tickets were for rock-and-roll concerts by Bruce Springsteen; two groups, the Rush and Van Halen, and for the Broadway musical, ''42d Street.'' Some of the tickets, which had a maximum price of $12.50 and a $2.50 broker's commission were sold for $100, Mr. Abrams said. No Criminal Charges No criminal charges were brought against the ticket sellers, who were identified as William McCaffrey, 54 years old, of Red Bank, N.J.; his son, William Jr., 31, of Lynbrook, L.I.; Al Billotti, 32, of 421 East 71st Street; Scott Howie, 26, of Yonkers, and Dennis O'Grady, 30, of 5300 65th Place, Maspeth, Queens. The men face administrative proceedings before the Attorney General's office, which licenses box-office personnel. If found guilty of obtaining illegal premimums or ''ice'' they can be suspended or barred from working as ticket sellers. Nathan Riley, a spokesman for the Attorney General, said the criminal charge for ticket-scalping - or obtaining an illegal surcharge - is a misdemeanor. It carries a maximum penalty of less than one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. ''Losing your employment can be more severe than a misdemeanor,'' Mr. Riley said. Brokers Called Cooperative He said that four ticket brokers who bought the tickets had cooperated with the inquiry and that no charges would be brought against them. Two of the brokers were from New Jersey where there is no law setting a limit on ticket prices. The brokers were identified by Mr. Abrams as the Jacobs Theatre Service, 1501 Broadway; Lawrence Pearlstein; the Herbert Agar Ticket Agency, Union City, N.J., and the Colony Ticket Service, Union City, N.J. In New York State, the maximum commission a broker can impose is $2.50 a ticket. Mr. Riley said the inquiry began after complaints from David Merrick, the producer of ''42d Street'' and from persons who said they were overcharged for tickets. Madison Square Garden, at Seventh Avenue and 32d Street, sells tickets for Broadway shows as well as concerts and sports events at the arena. Attempts to contact the accused ticket sellers for comment yesterday were unavailing.

390-> SPOKESMEN FOR TWO PARTIES DIFFER ON MEANING OF ECONOMIC CHANGES
Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders argued tonight on national television over whether recent economic indicators, especially advances in the stock markets, meant that the country's economy was recovering. The campaign debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, said in the debate that the 240-point advance in the Dow-Jones industtrial average since Aug. 12 ''means people are investing again in our country.'' He also said that the advance would lead to new jobs. But Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, third-ranking Democrat on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Mr. Dole was engaging in ''doublespeak'' because last year Republicans considered a sagging market a poor indicator. ''I don't think it really signifies anything,'' he said. Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House Democratic whip, said, ''The problem is still on Main Street, not on Wall Street.'' The one-hour exchange, carried nationally by the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network and Public Broadcasting Service, managed to mute the sharp differences on the economy heard on the stump in this year's campaign. Mr. Foley and Representative Barber Conable, Republican of upstate New York, are running for re-election this year. Mr. Foley faces a substantial challenge. Neither Senator Dole nor Senator Bumpers is running this year. Both sides decried unemployment. Mr. Bumpers said that despite President Reagan's campaign pledge to create jobs, the line of unemployed would now reach ''from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic.'' But Mr. Conable, senior Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, answered, ''Unemployment is a function of the condition that Reaganomics is trying to cure.'' He added, ''We are creating jobs, but we are not creating them fast enough.'' The debaters agreed that action would soon be necessary to solve short-term Social Security financing problems. But they steered away from the political rocks of specifying changes. Mr. Bumpers said the public should trust his party to make whatever changes were necessary. ''Democrats have a paternalistic view of the system,'' he said, ''because we set it up in the first place.'' Both sides agreed that there would be little specific debate on Social Security changes until after a presidential commission headed by Alan Greenspan reports after the election. But the Republicans said, in different ways, that they regretted that delay. Mr. Dole said, ''Both parties robbed the voters of discussion of the most important domestic issue in this election. Everybody's gone underground. It's like crying fire in a crowded theater.'' Mr. Conable demurred, saying failing to discuss the issue ''is like refusing to cry fire in a theater that is burning.''

391-> POLITICAL NOVICE MAKING PLUCKY RUN AT KENNEDY
It is 20 years since Edward M. Kennedy was first elected here to the Senate, a seat he holds virtually as a matter of natural right in this Roman Catholic, Democratic and heavily Irish-American Commonwealth. Ray Shamie, a Republican, is one of the few who disputes that notion. ''That's a defeatist attitude,'' he said recently. ''I won't buy it.'' And so Mr. Shamie, a political novice but one of the state's considerable number of new high-technology millionaires, is giving Senator Kennedy a run for his money. Mr. Shamie plans to spend $2 million, $1 million of it from his own pocket, in trying to defeat Mr. Kennedy. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee has contributed $318,000 to Mr. Shamie's war chest, and such uninvited right-wing groups as Citizens Organized to Replace Kennedy have raised almost $250,000 to distribute 1.2 million copies of a political ''comic book'' attacking the Senator's character on incidents in his past that range from college cheating to the drowning of a young woman at Chappaquiddick. About 700,000 copies have been distributed. Kennedy to Spend $2.5 Million Mr. Kennedy, in response, plans to spend $2.5 million - three times more than his 1976 campaign budget - in this year's effort to retain his seat against a man no one had heard of a year ago and whom he is leading, according to the most recent public opinion poll, by 60 percent to 27 percent, with 12 percent undecided. All this would seem to suggest that something unusual is afoot. Given that the polls show Mr. Kennedy is again the leading contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination, something is unusual. For one thing, Mr. Shamie is regarded by the Kennedy camp as ''the most spirited'' opponent the Senator has had in years. Mr. Shamie caught the public eye with his posture as the frustrated Republican underdog, trying in sporting fashion to bring Mr. Kennedy down to the level of a one-on-one debate -something that Kennedy aides say he has always done in the general election. But Mr. Shamie hired skywriters to spell out his challenge over dozens of states, an offer of $10,000 to any nonpartisan group that could get Mr. Kennedy to debate with him. The Senator chose the Cardinal Cushing School and Training Center for retarded children as the sponsor of the debate. Sunday night, when the two men debated at Boston College in Newton, the voters of Massachusetts had their first and last chance to see them together: Mr. Kennedy, in middle age, looking like a sculpted and substantial Irish lord, and Mr. Shamie, grayer, smaller and leaner, thumbing through a huge tabbed reference binder for quotations and votes with which to challenge Mr. Kennedy, attacking his support of a nuclear freeze and characterizing his positions on foreign policy as ''inconsistent and irrational.'' Mr. Kennedy seemed alternately amused, grave and politely annoyed. The big difference in his campaign strategy this year is not so much to defend himself against Mr. Shamie as to reinvigorate his natural support and to confront the issue of character that the ''comic books'' raise, an issue that dogged his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1980. Ads Depict Compassionate Man The Senator had rejected advice then to raise the issue on his own terms, and ''we're not going to wait again,'' Bob Shrum, his press secretary, said when the Kennedy forces introduced a new series of television ads a month ago. The ads were filmed by Michael Kaye, a Los Angeles producer, using old friends and supporters of Mr. Kennedy and hospital nurses to describe the compassionate, dependable and personal side of the Senator: the man who spent every night for two weeks in the hospital room of his son, Teddy, when the youth's cancerous leg was amputated, but who also left the hospital to escort his niece at her wedding rather than have it canceled. Mr. Kennedy has spent a lot of time since Oct. 1 campaigning in Massachusetts, appearing in both cool and friendly forums. But he has also spent a large amount of time campaigning for other Democrats in such states as California, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, New York and New Jersey, and is scheduled to go to Connecticut Tuesday to help Representative Toby Moffett, a Democrat, in his campaign to unseat Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Representative Robert K. Dornan, a conservative Republican from California, arrived here today to campaign against Mr. Kennedy at a fund-raising dinner sponsored by the Mid-American Conservative Political Action Committee, which is raising $125,000 in an effort to defeat Mr. Kennedy. ''I'm returning Ted Kennedy's favor,'' Mr. Dornan said. ''He was just out in California campaigning against associates of mine.''

392-> Kentuckians Get Phone Line To Turn In Drunken Drivers
Kentuckians are helping the state police arrest drunken driving suspects by turning them in on a tollfree telephone line. Lieut. John Lile, spokesman for the state police, said today that the line had attracted 20 calls and had resulted in two arrests in its first two days of operation. The program began Wednesday and was timed for the start of the four-day Thanksgiving holiday. National figures indicate that a drunken driver has only a one chance in 2,000 of being arrested. But with the new line, Lieutenant Lile said, ''I think maybe we've reduced that to one in 10.'' Last year 14 people were killed in Kentucky in highway accidents on the Thanksgiving weekend, including six deaths linked to drinking.

394-> DEMOCRATS' GAINS CARRY OBLIGATIONS
As their initial euphoria over the election has faded, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives have come to realize that added strength imposes a new responsibility on the next Congres: to go beyond opposition to President Reagan and devise a clear alternative to his program. In their lumbering, collegial, undisciplined way, the Democratic leaders are now busy with talk about employment initiatives, curbing the growth of military spending, forming a policy to revitalize American industry and make it more competitive, possibly raising energy taxes and revising Social Security in ways that bear a Democratic stamp. In the retiring 97th Congress, which reconvenes in a special session Monday, the Democrats have been in an awkward political position. They have outnumbered Republicans 243 to 192, but have lacked the strength not only to set policy but also to control legislative procedure. Early on, they lost key procedural votes that set up the President's budget and tax victories. But the Democratic gain of 26 House seats on Nov. 2, which some Democrats now ambitiously term ''a mandate for moderation,'' have given their party a working House majority in the 98th Congress and thus have made their leadership accountable for what emerges in the next two years. 'Opportunity to Go Forward' ''With 26 more seats, we'll have more opportunity to go forward with our own legislation,'' Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, asserted. ''This is the first chance Tip has really had to shape House policy,'' added Christopher Matthews, an aide to the Speaker. ''If we don't come up with a clear, live, dramatic alternative to Reaganomics, then Reagan will go back to running against the past Democratic record of 1980.'' ''What better time to come up with a program,'' added another aide. ''You've got a Presidential commission saying that the Social Security system is going broke. You've got 10.4 percent unemployment. You've got a $200 billion deficit. It's a lot easier for us than it was two years ago.'' Some Democrats worry that the President may have stolen a bit of their thunder by proposing a five-year, $32.9 billion program to repair highways and bridges and assist mass transit, producing about 320,000 jobs. The 80 percent Federal share of the program would be financed primarily by a gasoline tax increase. Budget May Be Early Test But others, like Representative Leon E. Panetta of California, hold that that Mr. Reagan is likely to help the Democrats draw the battle lines if, as expected, he submits a budget for the fiscal year 1984 calling for further large cuts in domestic programs, insisting on a military buildup and balking at nearly all tax increases. ''If he sticks with Reaganomics, he makes it easier for us,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''But if he starts compromising early with the Senate Republicans, it's going to be much tougher for us to draw a partisan distinction.'' With large deficits looming, Democrats cannot veer far from fiscal conservativism, but they must differ with Mr. Reagan at the margins. ''We're not going with the old-time programs,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''The main thing is to get rid of the image that we're the big spenders.'' Emphasis on Creating Jobs One area where Democrats intend to carve out a niche is in creating jobs and providing a new stimulus for economic recovery and modernization. A caucus study group has developed ideas for investing in highways, bridges, railroads and waterways, offering tax incentives and other aid to high-technology companies, financing research and development and scholarships for engineers and scientists and setting up a council to monitor world economic trends and help guide American enterprise. Another area of broad Democratic unity against the President is military spending. Representative James R. Jones of Oklahoma, the Budget Committee chairman, asserts that if Mr. Reagan seeks an 8 to 10 percent real increase in 1984, Democrats will try to hold at 5 percent, saving $10 billion to $15 billion. On taxes, many Democrats would like to postpone the scheduled 1983 tax cut or put a ceiling on it. But Mr. O'Neill is skeptical that he has the votes to beat a certain Presidential veto. He would prefer to revoke the provision that would index income tax rates to inflation starting in 1984. Openness on Social Security On the unavoidable issues of reducing budget deficits and revising Social Security, influential committee chairmen like Mr. Jones and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of the Ways and Means Committee take a more bipartisan approach. Like the Republicans, Mr. Rostenkowski is looking to the Presidential Commission on Social Security to issue a report that would break the political ice by proposing a combination of accelerating tax increases, lowering cost-of-living adjustments in benefits and bringing Government employees into the system to add revenue. A partisan stance now, the chairman says, could jeopardize responsible reform. Republican and Democratic philosophies differ more patently on the budget, but the Democrats have not yet sorted themselves out. Mr. O'Neill wants a political document with protection for education and housing programs, but Mr. Jones's primary concern is the potential $200 billion deficit, which drives him toward cooperation with some Republicans on cutting various benefit programs. ''We have the responsibility to bring something forward,'' he said. ''If we continue to have partisan showdowns, the 98th Congress is going to accomplish little. I don't think either party can stake out a partisan position and get it into law.''

395-> Showers, Shelters
''For the city to come in on the eve of winter and say 'we don't want to obey the consent decree' is not only shameless, but also heartless,'' said Robert Hayes of the Coalition for the Homeless. He was referring to New York's request that it be allowed to provide fewer lavatories and showers in shelters for homeless men. As a dedicated advocate whose tireless efforts forced the city to agree to provide shelter for any homeless person requesting it, Mr. Hayes may be forgiven a proprietary interest in the shelters. But the city's request is not heartless. It is sensible and economically prudent. The court agreement specifies conditions for the shelters, including one lavatory for every six residents and one tub or shower for every 10. These standards matched the state regulations for adult homes at the time the agreement was reached. But city officials were unable to find buildings to use as shelters with plumbing facilities that met the court's standard. Robert White, who supervises the shelters, says that if the standard had been strictly adhered to last winter the city would not have been able to house all who requested shelter. Nevertheless, the city has met the hygienic needs of its homeless clients. It simply uses its total of 125 showers throughout the day and evening. At the Men's Shelter, for example, several hundred men are showered in a period of one hour. That experience led the city to ask the court to modify its order. Despite Mr. Hayes's protest, shelters are not intended as permanent residences. And most of the homeless can accommodate themselves to available facilities; they have plenty of time to shower on a staggered schedule. New York sorely needs a more comprehensive response to the problem of the homeless, including treatment programs and permanent residences with adequate support services. Also needed is a revision of the entire policy of deinstitutionalization. To oppose a sensible change in the court mandate for toilets and showers is to waste reformist energies.

396-> IN SHARK WOMB, FETUS 'CANNIBALIZES' RIVALS
IT was the biggest surprise of Stewart Springer's life. Mr. Springer, a veteran shark researcher, was in his laboratory dissecting a sand tiger shark that he had caught near Chandeleur Island, off Louisiana. To his consternation, when he reached into one of the animal's oviducts, or birth canals, he was bitten. Each oviduct contained a living, nine-inch shark pup. This discovery led him and others to undertake more than a decade of intensive studies of shark reproduction, whose findings, though still incomplete, have already amazed marine biologists. They have revealed, for example, widespread internal cannibalism in which one shark embryo eats scores of its potential brothers and sisters. The research is part of a wide-ranging program of studies in shark behavior whose most practical goal is preventing, or at least minimizing, shark attacks on people - and on underwater equipment, such as the Navy's sensitive submarine-monitoring systems. The research appears, for example, to be leading toward development of the first truly effective shark repellent - one that might be included in every life jacket and wet suit. Mr. Springer, who works at the University of Florida in Gainesville, has found that the sand tiger shark produces as many as 25,000 pea-sized eggs in a lifetime. Periodically 15 or 20 eggs pass from the ovary into each oviduct, where they are fertilized and packaged inside an avocado-shaped egg case, where the shark embryos begin to develop. It is then, even though they are tiny, that their struggle for survival begins. For most of them it does not last long. The embryos begin eating one another until only one, the fiercest and fittest, remains. It does not starve, for soon a new egg case comes down the oviduct and is promptly eaten. After a year-long succession of egg case deliveries the baby shark in each oviduct is 40 inches long - close to half the length of its eight-foot mother. Perry W. Gilbert of Cornell University, a leading authority on sharks, points out that the baby at this stage is facing forward. To depart into the sea it must somehow perform a sharp U-turn inside its mother. Research has demonstrated, or at least suggested, that embryos of several other shark species are cannibalistic or ''ovaphagous'' before birth. They include the great white, porbeagle, mackerel, mako and some, but not all, species of thresher shark. One clue to their prenatal behavior is the stage at which they develop teeth. Samuel H. Gruber of the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami and L.@J.@V. Compagno of San Francisco State University have found ''fully functional'' teeth in immature embryos of the bigeye thresher, which they suspect aids them in ''cannibalizing potential siblings.'' Such early dentition is otherwise rare in sharks. Marine biologists have been dumbfounded by the diversity of methods used by sharks to bring forth their young. Even closely related species depend on very different techniques. Some sharks nourish their young internally through a primitive form of placenta. Others produce single eggs of huge dimensions. Mr. Springer is currently studying a shark of the genus Centrophorus that produces a single egg the size of a softball. Its nutrients are sufficient to enable the embryo within that egg to grow to one-third the length of its five-foot mother before being born. Other species produce small eggs but enough of them to provide food for the more successful embryos. One species of tiger shark may give birth to 80 pups at a time. Some sharks bear egg cases that drift in the sea until the babies hatch, like the ''mermaids' purses'' (skate egg cases) sometimes found on beaches. Horn shark egg cases occur in a variety of exotic spirals, some with twisted appendages. The whale shark egg case is larger than a basketball. In a review article on shark reproduction in Oceanus, journal of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Dr. Gilbert has told how two families - the requiem sharks and hammerheads - use a placenta, in the form of a yolk sac, to nourish their young after the pups have exhausted the food supply in their eggs. As in placental mammals, such yolk sacs transfer wastes from the offspring's bloodstream to that of the mother and carry nourishment in the opposite direction. Dr. Gruber, in addition to his research on threshers, has been keeping track of free-swimming lemon sharks as part of his behavioral research. Some 1,500 of them have been tagged in Florida waters and 90 of these have already been recaptured. Dr. Gruber is also working to develop a powerful new shark repellent and ways to test its effectiveness. The Shark Chaser developed under Navy auspices during World War II proved of little value, but in the 1970's it was found that a Red Sea fish, the Moses sole, exudes a substance that repels at least some shark species. Sharks have been seen to charge a Moses sole with open jaws, only to stop within inches of the fish. A strong dose of the active substance, called pardoxin, may cause the shark to behave erratically or curl on the bottom of a test tank, belly up. The substance, a chain of 162 amino acids, is difficult and costly to synthesize. It quickly deteriorates and is not as powerful as might be desired. Early in efforts to learn how pardoxin works Eliahu Zlotkin, a specialist in insect toxins at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, proposed that the key to its effect on sharks might be its surfactant properties. Surfactants, or surface-active agents, reduce surface tension in liquids and help give detergents their cleansing properties. Dr. Gruber, with funding from the Navy, the National Science Foundation and the Binational Science Foundation (an American-Israeli agency) is collaborating with Dr. Zlotkin and his colleagues. Some 17 commercial surfactants have been tested on captive sharks. Some, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, have proved effective against sharks at one-quarter the concentration needed to obtain the same effect with pardoxin. Dr. Gruber hopes eventually to test the repellents on about 10 shark species, but his recent efforts have been directed at lemon sharks in captivity. To study the response of animals to the repellents in their natural habitat as well as their day-to-day behavior Dr. Gruber is preparing to place instruments on the floor of a shallow lagoon enclosed by the Bimini Islands, 55 miles east of Miami. During each afternoon schools of lemon sharks congregate at certain spots within the lagoon, then apparently go hunting after dark. Dr. Gruber hopes that after implanting tracking devices in a few dozen sharks he will be able to follow their courses and behavior for a year. An effective repellent will presumably have to act on at least one of the shark's senses, of which there appear to be many. Sharks use electrical and magnetic clues, as well as sound, taste and smell, in their search for prey. In the Nov. 26 issue of the journal Science, Adrianus J. Kalmijn of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at La Jolla, Calif., tells of electrical tests on dogfish and blue sharks in the open sea.

399-> FOURTH AMENDMENT NEEDS NO REWRITE
To the Editor: Like most of the Reagan Administration's proposed criminal-justice system ''reforms,'' its proposal to create a ''good faith exception'' to the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule is based - either ignorantly or disingenuously - on false premises. In a Dec. 10 letter, Deputy Attorney General Edward C. Schmults justified a goodfaith exception with two flawed arguments. First, he claimed that the exclusionary rule ''can only deter police officers who (subjectively) believe that they are acting illegally.'' Mr. Schmults cannot be serious. One of the fundamental principles of American law is that legal rules deter everyone, whether or not he or she knows the rules, because the existence of the rules puts a premium on both caution and finding out what the rules are. The prosecution in criminal cases does not have to prove a defendant's knowledge of the law; a victim of asbestosis need not prove that Johns Manville knew its product would injure, only that the company was in a position to have known and to have taken steps to avoid injury. In fact, when Mr. Nixon's accomplices in Watergate attempted to escape conviction by claiming a subjective belief that they were not engaging in illegal conduct, they were politely shown the door to Federal prison. The exclusionary rule is based on the same understanding of human nature: police departments operating under it are given a strong incentive to train officers properly so that objective rules (i.e., the Fourth Amendment) are not broken. Second, Mr. Schmults defends abolition of the rule in cases where police obtain warrants, on the ground that the exclusionary rule cannot deter police officers in such cases. But the Fourth Amendment does not speak only to the police: it is addressed to the government, or more properly to its criminaljustice system. Unless magistrates issuing warrants are deterred from violating the Fourth Amendment, they could issue warrants in every case, whether probable cause existed or not. Such a regime would hardly protect the constitutional right to be free from searches where police lack probable cause. Given the routine nature with which magistrates review warrant applications, making the exclusionary rule inapplicable whenever a warrant was granted would remove the present incentive for police to submit adequate information to meet the modest probable-cause standard. Judging by reported decisions in American courts, no constitutional rule is more widely violated today than the Fourth Amendment. Instead of trying to rewrite the Fourth Amendment to make us free from unreasonable searches and seizures only where police or magistrates intend to violate our rights, the Attorney General and his staff, sworn to uphold the Constitution, would be truer to their oaths if they devised better ways to deter and eliminate searches which the Constitution forbids, regardless of the motive. They could begin by using the formidable legal talents of Justice Department attorneys to devise train-ing materials on Fourth Amendment compliance for distribution to law enforcement staffs nationwide and effective internal disciplinary procedures to ensure that governmental agents throughout the nation obey constitutional norms. CHARLES S. SIMS, National Staff Counsel American Civil Liberties Union, New York, Dec. 14, 1982

400-> AS THE COST OF CONGRESS KEEPS GOING HIGHER
To the Editor: Now that the House of Representatives has voted to raise its members' pay $9,138 a year, to $69,800 (news story Dec. 15), we can appreciate the counsel of former Attorney General Mitchell to ''watch what we do - not what we say.'' Among the 303 legislators who voted for the increase are some of the harshest critics of the high cost of government. They voted themselves a 15 percent increase while calling for cuts in Government spending and ignoring the staggering rise in the cost of running Congress itself. This cost is up 808 percent in 20 years and, as the Tax Foundation reports, now averages $2.3 million a year for each member of the Senate and $836,000 for each member of the House. Multiply these figures by 100 for the Senate and 435 for the House and, to use the late Senator Dirksen's words, ''pretty soon we'll be talking about real money.''

401-> MRS. KIRKPATRICK PRAISES U.N. VOTES
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the United States delegate and a frequent critic of the United Nations, said today that ''some real progress'' had been made in the organization toward achieving Washington's objectives. Reviewing the General Assembly session that ended today, she cited several resolutions as United States victories, most notably the defeat of attempts to expel Israel and to characterize Puerto Rico as a colony. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, who spoke at a news conference, said that United Nations efforts to end wars had been far less successful but that these were far more difficult issues to resolve. Even so, she said, the United Nations has helped make the world a ''little less dangerous.'' Then she paused and added, ''I think so, perhaps.'' Contrast With Earlier Remarks The tenor of Mrs. Kirkpatrick's remarks contrasted with her frequent public denunciations of the United Nations as a place where oratory inflames conflict and concern for human rights is limited to a handful of what she has described as pariah nations. The attitude she displayed today appeared to reflect not only frequent political victories she won here this fall but also the frequent support that American positions gained from nations grouped as nonaligned. Today she repeated her view that nations in the Arab, African and Soviet blocs were well protected from inquiries into what she denounced as their abuse of rights. At the same time, she welcomed the formal announcement made today by Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Hugo J. Gobbi of Argentina would lead an inquiry into Poland's record on human rights. Mrs. Kirkpatrick called this a ''landmark decision that cannot easily be repeated.'' She said she regretted that it had not been made sooner. 'A Rewarding Victory' The American delegate hailed the defeat of Iran's attempt to expel Israel from the Assembly as ''a rewarding victory'' that ''demonstrates we are no longer as vulnerable as we felt.'' She termed it ''not just a victory for the U.S. but the U.N.'' because, she said, it upheld ''respect for the principle of universality'' of the world organization's membership. Mrs. Kirkpatrick said the United States had taken the lead in this fight. Most envoys here regard the decision by the Arab nations to scuttle the effort as the decisive factor. She described as ''a clear victory'' the Assembly's rejection of Cuba's move to have Puerto Rico treated as a colony. Mrs. Kirkpatrick also singled out the adoption of a resolution designed to protect disarmament movements by citizens' groups, a document aimed at Soviet harassment of unofficial peace organizations, and Assembly agreement that the Secretary General should continue to examine charges of the use of chemical and biological weapons. She also expressed satisfaction with a drive by the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union and others to hold down United Nations costs. Earlier in the day, Imre Hollai of Hungary, the Assembly President, also told reporters he thought the session had been useful, but his priorities were different from Mrs. Kirkpatrick's. Mr. Hollai said the Assembly had ''helped the spirit of dialogue'' between the superpowers, most notably by its resolutions urging a freeze on the production and deployment of nuclear weapons. The United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries had opposed the texts on the ground that they left the Warsaw pact with a substantial advantage in nuclear arms. Asked how this had furthered any dialogue, Mr. Hollai replied, ''I don't think the first rejectionist attitude will be the final attitude of those who voted against the freeze resolution.''

403-> ITZHAK PERLMAN
THE virtuosity of the violinist Itzhak Perlman was everywhere in evidence in his recital Sunday night in Avery Fisher Hall, but it was a particular sort of virtuosity. Mr. Perlman can do just about anything he wants on the violin. But he is not the sort of virtuoso who reaches into a listener's guts, or who has the audience balancing with him on the sliver of contact between bow and string. Nor is he the master technician whose patter chills a listener with glistening perfection. Mr. Perlman is not a visitor from other realms casting spells; he does not separate himself from the audience as a being with special powers - frightening and transcendental. Instead of being a virtuoso in the 19th-century mold - a priest, demon, spokesman and ruler - Mr. Perlman might be called a sort of democratic virtuoso. His appeal is that he is one of us, a person who appears on stage and plays his music. And when he plays, one marvels at his execution, relishes his sound and experiences a sympathy for his musical expressions that involves empathy, respect and pleasure. This was surely the case, for example, in the violinist's performance of Dvorak's ''Four Romantic Pieces'' (Opus 75). Mr. Perlman, assisted as he was throughout the recital, by the exemplary piano accompaniments of Samuel Sanders, allowed each of the pieces to breath, to create its own world, simply and eloquently articulated. These were not involving performances, but they were involved; they did not make the listener in awe of the player, rather they made one care for what he was doing. The dangers of this restrained style of virtuosity, is that at less successful moments, the performer can seem to be playing quietly for himself, rather than for an audience. This was the case before intermission. There was a bland refinement, for example, in the performance of Beethoven's violin sonata No. 2 in A (Opus 12, No.2). Played with overly reflective tempos, the pulse of the work became diffuse, with too much attention given to each perfectly shaped gesture. But this reflective frame of mind was carried over to Prokofiev's sonata No. 1 in F minor (Opus 80), and at times it worked well. In the gracefully introspective andante, the spare lines and cultivated tone combined exquisitely. But here again, the player attended to details of phrases without attending to their direction. The brusque rhythms of the second movement, for example, lacked sharp thrust and parry. There was a casual perfection about the playing, as if Mr. Perlman had forgotten that a performance is, after all, a form of public drama. But when Mr. Perlman returned from intermission to present the world premiere of ''Twelve Caprices for Solo Violin'' by Earl Kim, he was again the democratic virtuoso, sharing his artistry and the music's for the invited guests. Mr. Kim, a professor at Harvard University, wrote these violin pieces in the tradition of Paganini and Schumann. He tried to include every violinistic difficulty he could while creating a coherent musical cycle that would bind together contrasting characters - the dramatic and the lyric, the sophisticated extrovert and the withdrawn dreamer. That was how Mr. Perlman played these caprices, seemingly and incidentally reducing each difficulty to simple gesture. These were often attractive, charming works, immaculately played, culminating in a children's lullaby that Mr. Perlman played with such vocal simplicity that applause seemed an intrusion. The character of Mr. Perlman's violin style was also evident in the final selections, announced by the performer toward the end of the recital. They included works by Kreisler and Wieniawski, works that grow out of an entirely different school of virtuosity. In making them his own, Mr. Perlman left behind the unpredictable, lilting and seductive genius of those masters, replacing it with a warm and straight-forward perfection, the voice of a friend sharing his skills and his music.

404-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar at 6-Month Low Against Yen; Gold Rises
The dollar fell to a six-month low against the Japanese yen yesterday and lost ground to most major currencies as expectations spread of further declines in interest rates in the United States, which would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive. Gold prices rose in quiet trading at bullion exchanges around the world. In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar fell to 246.70 Japanese yen from 247.85 yen on Friday. It fell in London to 244.80 yen, and wound up the trading day at 244.08 yen in New York, compared with 247.35 yen Friday. In European trading, the dollar dropped to its lowest level against the West German mark in more than four months. The dollar closed at 2.4195 marks, down from 2.4330 on Friday and its lowest since July 26, when it closed at 2.4078 marks. The Dutch guilder, and Swiss and French francs all closed at their best levels against the dollar since Aug. 26. Peseta Gains Even the Spanish peseta, devalued 8 percent on Saturday, gained ground on the dollar during the day. After opening at 8.22 cents in Madrid, the peseta rose to a late rate of 8.26 cents. But the British pound, a victim of falling domestic interest rates and slumping demand for North Sea oil, slid to $1.6280 in London from Friday's rate of $1.6413. Later in New York, the pound dropped to $1.6238 from $1.6425 Friday. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with those on Friday, included the following: 2.0645 Swiss francs, down from 2.0880; 6.8500 French francs, down from 6.8950; 2.6685 Dutch guilders, down from 2.6745; 1,399.00 Italian lire, down from 1,411.45, and 1.23925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.23805. These are the late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's: 2.4115 West German marks, down from 2.4300; 6.8414 French francs, down from 6.8750; 2.0560 Swiss francs, down from 2.0800, and 1.2406 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2366. Gold bullion edged up $1.33 in Hong Kong to close at $438.27 an ounce. In London, gold closed at $443.125, up from Friday's late rate of $440. In Zurich, bullion climbed to $445.25 from Friday's $440.50. Gold for December delivery rose $4.60 on the New York Commodity Exchange to close at $446 an ounce. In later New York trading, bullion was bid at $446.50 an ounce at the Republic National Bank, up from Friday's late bid of $441.

406-> Funds Down $6.5 Billion
Assets of the nation's money market funds dropped $6.5 billion, to $210.9 billion, in the week ended Wednesday, marking the fourth consecutive week of declines, the Investment Company Institute said yesterday. It attributed the continued outflow to the lure of the new deposit accounts being offered by banks and thrift institutions, as well as shareholders' need to finance holiday spending. It also noted that some other short-term securities like certificates of deposit were yielding more than the money funds. The latest decline was somewhat lower than the $8.3 billion withdrawn in the previous week, but higher than the $4.7 billion and $1.8 billion withdrawn in the two prior weeks. The total for the four weeks is a $21.3 billion decline from the record level of $232.3 billion money fund assets for the week ended Dec. 1. The institute said that assets of the 157 general purpose funds dropped $2.2 billion, to $68.1 billion; the 77 broker-dealer funds lost $3.1 billion, declining to $102.5 billion, while the 50 institutional funds declined $1.3 billion, to $40.2 billion. Donoghue's Money Fund Report said the money funds' seven-day yield averaged 8.09 percent compared with 8.15 percent the previous week, and the 30-day yield was 8.22 percent, compared with 8.28. In the case of institutional funds the seven-day yield was 8.40 percent, down from 8.42 percent, and 30-day yield was 8.48, down from 8.49 percent. This week banks can pay a maximum of 8.653 percent on six-month money market certificates compared with 8.768 percent last week.

408-> Get a Grip on Quicksilver
In the fast world of high finance, commodity speculation is the fastest game of all. Too fast, according to the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which recently issued its report on the great silver bubble of 1980. The staff's report, which blames the boom and bust in silver prices on the failure of regulation, should spur overdue reforms. It was the juiciest financial drama of the era. Lamar and Nelson Bunker Hunt, who controlled America's largest family oil fortune, amassed 195 million ounces of silver valued at $6.6 billion. Then in spring of 1980 the price of silver collapsed, and so did the Hunts' dream of cornering the world market. Banks and brokerage houses lent the Hunts $1.7 billion to buy the silver; none lost their money. An emergency line of credit, arranged with special approval from the Federal Reserve, gave the Hunts time to sell enough assets to make good on all their debts. But it was a close thing: one big brokerage house nearly collapsed and a half-dozen were imperiled. If such a bubble were to burst in today's troubled financial climate, there might well be a panic. Is there much risk of that? Economists take comfort from the thought that such heavy speculation is illogical. When one owns a huge stake in silver (or any other commodity), it is nearly impossible to sell without driving down the price. But illogic didn't stop the Hunts, and the S.E.C. report suggests that not much has been done to pre-vent them or anyone else from trying again. One problem was that the brokerage houses failed to report their precarious finances to the New York Stock Exchange, which polices brokers. Another problem is that no one stopped one broker, Bache, from lending money to the Hunts even though the Hunts controlled a large bloc of Bache stock. The biggest problem of all was the Government's failure to control margin buying. Commodity speculators routinely buy on credit, or ''margin,'' to increase their potential gains. That is not entirely bad. The presence of speculators builds profitable trading volume for brokers and makes it easier for business to use the markets to hedge against commodity price changes. But heavy margin borrowing is what hurt banks and brokers in the silver fiasco. A tough lending limit would cut brokers' profits, but experts think it would not damage the liquidity of the markets. Margin requirements in commodities are now set by private exchanges. Congress should remove the temptation to overlend by empowering the Federal Reserve Board to set limits, just as it does now for stocks and bonds. Actually, the regulators need not wait for Congress. The Fed and the S.E.C. could discourage margin lending by a combination of tough talk and stern accounting requirements. The silver market proved to be bigger than the Hunt brothers. The markets would probably prevail in some future financial rollercoaster ride too, with or without help from the regulators. But think how much there is to lose by waiting to find out.

416-> DE GUSTIBUS; MORE THOUGHTS ON SMOKING AND FOOD
The rights of smokers as against those of nonsmokers in restaurants appears to be a matter only slightly less controversial than the issue of capital punishment, and, indeed, for most advocates on both sides of the smoking question only the extreme sentence would seem to do for their opponents. Nonsmokers will have their day Thursday, designated the Great American Smokeout by the American Cancer Society as part of its national effort to discourage smoking for health reasons. After a discussion of the offense smokers of cigars and pipes give to nonsmokers in restaurants, readers wrote on both sides of the question. As might be expected, those who enjoy cigars and pipes after dinner sought to defend their rights, while nonsmokers spoke up on the side of clean air and clear palates. Many readers took exception to what they assumed was my tacit approval of cigarette smoking in restaurants. Although cigarette smoking is annoying, especially in badly ventilated rooms, it is less offensive because the aroma is milder; unless the smoke is wafted from an adjoining table it is less likely to interfere with the ability to taste food. In addition, many more people smoke cigarettes than cigars and pipes, so restaurant owners would be more reluctant to antagonize them. Thomas B. Lemann, a lawyer in New Orleans, summed up the argument for cigar smokers by writing: ''No one can disagree with your observation that it is impossible to appreciate the flavor of food when the heavy aroma of a cigar or pipe is in the air. But it is equally impossible to appreciate flavor when the acrid aroma of a cigarette is in the air. Furthermore, I daresay very few cigar and pipe smokers actually smoke during a meal or between courses, whereas cigarette smokers do all the time. Therefore it does not seem to me that you should beat on pipe and cigar smokers.'' Martin Lederman, author of ''The Slim Gourmet,'' suggested that the smell of garlic and perfume from neighboring diners might be as offensive as cigar smoke. Taste Buds Well Coated Al Brackman of Plandome, N.Y., went even further, writing: ''Ironically, nonsmokers who travel through New York City arrive at a restaurant with their taste buds already coated in varying degrees with the residue of soot, carbon monoxide, sulfur and other pollutants. Forbidding the entry into a restaurant of people doused in colognes and perfumes would be a boon to diners allergic to such odors. The clashing smells of perfumes also affect taste buds for some, as does cigarette and cigar smoke for others. ''If a patron cannot sit near someone smoking or someone oozing perfume odors, or cannot sit near the kitchen door from which odors of food preparations escape, what is left? The coatroom? If cigar and pipe smoke affects the taste buds of diners, what better place to smoke cigars and pipes than on an airplane -just before dinner is served?'' A problem nonsmoking areas would create was described by C.K. Lendt of Manhattan, who wrote, ''I have no objections to designated smoking areas in restaurants so long as the tables set aside for this purpose are no less desirable than the others.'' A pleasant remedy was described by David Sider of the Bronx: ''At the Elizabeth restaurant in Oxford, England, diners are invited at the end of the meal to retire to a cozy room upstairs for brandy and smokes - a nice practice from every point of view.'' The most concrete help came from Jeannette V. Orel, the inventorpresident of Smoke-Trapper Inc., a Los Angeles company that makes a device called the Smoke-Trapper. A cigar ashtray designed to inhale second-hand smoke, its base is a plastic tray over which sits a chimney that contains a filter and a battery-operated fan. Smoke from a cigar laid in the tray between puffs is drawn up by the fan and caught in the filter. A test by a resident cigar smoker found that the device works as far as it goes, but it does not solve the problem when the cigar is being puffed. Furthermore, the Smoke-Trapper literally smokes the cigar because the moving air keeps it burning at a rapid rate. What the device suggested is a few inventions of our own, practical and otherwise. Whether to wall off the smoker or the nonsmoker was the question; both possibilities are accommodated in these devices. In one, a climate-controlled plastic bubble would enclose the heads of smokers and, if they liked, it might include piped music. If there were chimneys, the bubble could be attached wherever the smoker was seated and the exhaust would be carried away. A more extreme idea is to enclose the smoker's head in a chimney. Nonsmokers could be walled off in a glass or plastic room within a room, enabling them to breathe and taste freely. The subject is obviously marked for further discussion. Suggestions for any other inventions that would help clear the air would be greatly appreciated.

418-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
After the Fire, What Happens to Kids? When parents and children are burned out of an apartment the city sends them to a few S.R.O. hotels scattered around the boroughs. What happens next, some say, is just as traumatic as the fire. School Chancellor Frank Macchiarola, prompted by a passing remark at a commissioners' meeting, asked Ira Ewen to check on the kids in the relocation hotel across the street from the Board of Education on Schermerhorn Street. What Mr. Ewen found were about 150 truant kids there and another 350 in four other hotels. Five hundred more attended school irregularly. Some had no clothes because all the family's possessions had been burned. Some had been frightened into reclusiveness by the fire. Without direct transportation, parents were afraid to send children back to the neighborhood school. Lacking both refrigerator and stove in the rooms, children were becoming malnourished on junk food. Many had not been immunized. Now they're back in classes. ''We've solved the problem for this year,'' said Mr. Ewen. Charities donated clothing while the city provided buses and other logistical help. ''And we're taking measures to make sure it doesn't happen next year.''

420-> PRESS ROLE IN A SIEGE; News Analysis
When the police requested Friday night that WABC-TV broadcast the full text of a statement from a gunman holding hostages at a Brooklyn hospital, ''we didn't have the time to sit down and debate the philosophic and ethical aspects of the request,'' the station's news director said yesterday. In fact, said the official, Cliff Abromats, ''we had two minutes.'' The station did broadcast the statement in full, and the gunman, Larry Van Dyke, did release another hostage. Now that the siege is over, however, some reporters and editors are beginning to wonder whether that decision and a host of other ones they made in the heat of battle might not come back to haunt them. ''There's something wrong when a guy who was just a number in Attica a few days ago can commandeer the spotlight like that,'' an editorial in The Daily News said yesterday morning. ''We in the news business must draw the line against being twisted so easily.'' A Test for Theories The incident at the hospital, and the extensive coverage it was given, provided a practical test of a variety of press beliefs and procedures. In some respects, the press adhered to the rules it sets for itself; in others, it appeared to cast aside principles for the sake of drama and moment. In general, the press says it tries to avoid being a participant in an event because it could jeopardize impartiality. But often the role is thrust on a reporter, as it was on Bella English, a Daily News reporter. Mr. Van Dyke had asked the police to bring her to the hospital to relay many of his requests. Having reporters act as intermediaries in situations like the surrender of fugitives or in prison riots has become accepted practice, though it risks a later fight with law enforcement officials who want the reporter's notes or cameraman's tapes as evidence. In such cases, the reporter generally does not write the news article about the event but may provide a first-person account of his or her role, as Miss English did. A Welcome Role? The later display of those first-person accounts, however, can encourage a belief that the role of the participant was a welcome one. On Sunday, the front-page headline in The Daily News trumpeted: ''STATE OF SIEGE: MY 47 HOURS - Bella English tells of her role in the Brooklyn hostage crisis.'' The more vexing issue for the press arises when a terrorist or captor demands, as Mr. Van Dyke did, access to air time or to the news columns for unedited remarks. As a matter of policy, the major news organizations say they will grant such access only when lives are at stake and law-enforcement or government officials say it could help avert a tragedy. ''We must guard against efforts by terrorists to use or manipulate us for their own ends,'' says the ABC News written policy on coverage of terrorist acts, adding that ''no such incident should be broadcast live except in the most compelling circumstances.'' WABC, the network affiliate in New York City, put that policy to the test twice during the Brooklyn hospital siege. On Friday it broadcast an edited version of a statement by Mr. Van Dyke and, when he became infuriated by the editing, it carried the statement in full later during the same news broadcast. On Saturday morning, it provided live coverage of the release of the last hostage and of Mr. Van Dyke's ''press conference'' before he was led back to prison. In both cases, Mr. Abromats said, the coverage decisions were reached ''because the police said it would save lives.'' Statements on Hijacking Other news organizations have made similar decisions, overriding their basic policy against giving anyone else control of the content of the news columns or broadcast time. In 1976, for example, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times all printed the text of statements as demanded by Croatian nationalists who had hijacked a jetliner with 92 passengers. Seymour Topping, the managing editor of The New York Times, said yesterday that as a matter of policy the newspaper did not want its reporters to become involved as negotiators or participants, nor would it routinely give terrorists access to its news columns. But, he said, ''we have to review each situation in terms of the problems that are presented from a human as well as a journalistic standpoint.'' In the Brooklyn siege, radio station WINS carried unedited tapes of Mr. Van Dyke at the urging of the police. ''You're not proud you did it,'' said the executive editor, Joe Gillespie, ''but you're not ashamed either.'' Journalists worry, however, that acceding to demands on coverage encourages future demands. ''When you have one hostage situation, suddenly you'll have four; what the media has used once, suddenly it will be used four times,'' said Chris Borgen, a WCBS-TV reporter. 'No Dangerous Precedents' Lieut. Robert Louden, the commanding officer of the New York City Police Department's hostage negotiating team, said that the extent of the media's role in this case was ''unique,'' but that there had been ''any number of times when the media have helped us in hostage situtations. ''I see no dangerous precedents,'' he said. Unlike earlier incidents, the Brooklyn siege did not begin as an attempt to draw public attention to a situation but evolved into one when Mr. Van Dyke, having botched an attempt to escape, used the situation to bargain for protection from other prisoners who might retaliate against him because, he said, they thought he had been an informant. He monitored the coverage closely, demanding and getting a television set and daily newspapers. He reacted angrily, for instance, to a New York Post headline that called him a ''maniac.'' Admonitions by Police The press generally followed police admonitions on what to leave out of the coverage, as well as what to include. One television station's reference to the possible long prison term that Mr. Van Dyke faced was excised in a later broadcast. And reporters agreed not to use tapes of one hostage signaling that Mr. Van Dyke had a gun at his back, lest the captor see the segment and feel he had been deceived. The reporters on the scene also became deeply engaged in the search for competitive advantage. The Post and The Daily News clashed over whose photographers and reporters could get closest to the basement locker room, where the hostages were held. Television crews, dissatisfied with the camera angles in the room that the hospital made available to them, barged into patient rooms and, in one case, a women's rest room overlooking the courtyard where the hostages emerged. Miss English said Mr. Van Dyke had called her Monday and yesterday to urge her to stay interested in his story. She said she was glad that the incident ended without violence, but ''I'm angry at him for the way he used us all.''

423-> AFRICA AT CROSSROADS: IS O.A.U. DYING?; News Analysis
Amid palms where vultures preen in the tropics' damp verdancy, a settlement is rising up in Conakry, its spendor distinct from the encircling slums and from Guinea's pervasive decline. Although the hospitals in this most dilapidated of African capitals have no drugs, and the people are dirt poor, 50 new and luxurious villas are being built at a rumored half-million dollars each, and a vast, circular conference center, still under construction, towers over shanties that cling in the heat to a beach of basalt rock on Africa's Atlantic seaboard. This is to be the site of next year's annual gathering of the Organization of African Unity, and, at the same time, a monument to Guinea's President, Ahmed Sekou Toure, crowning his emergence as an African sage after the hermitic isolation of the 1960's and 1970's that turned his nation into Africa's Albania. But doubts are now rising along with the new, Arab-financed buildings. On Thursday the organization that is supposed to gather here next year abandoned its second effort this year to convene in Tripoli, Libya. The meeting broke up over issues that raise questions about whether the O.A.U. will survive, and, if not, what shape and complexion of assembly will be held here next year in acknowledgement of President Toure's desire for eminence. Clash Over Western Sahara The collapse in Tripoli was foreshadowed in August, when an attempt to bring the organization together under the chairmanship of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi failed because of a dispute over who should represent the territory called Western Sahara. The division was not healed, but a compromise, involving the absence of one claimant to the territory, enabled the second effort to be made. That failed because the body that is supposed to express and nurture a pan-African ideal of unity and independence, dating back over two decades, could not collectively decide who should represent Chad. The so-called moderate bloc of countries supported Hissen Habre, a former Defense Minister, who took the capital, Ndjamena, by force in June after a protracted civil war. The self-styled progressives backed Goukouni Oueddei, a Libyan protege who fled the capital in June and who has reportedly set up a rival government with no real powers in northern Chad, supported by Colonel Qaddafi. The Libyan leader has blamed the United States, France and other Western nations for undermining the effort to convene the Tripoli meeting. But in the view of Guinean officials the blame for failure lies with Colonel Qaddafi himself for trying to foist illegitimate governments on a continent that does not accept his self-avowed refusal to subscribe to the organization's traditional, orthodox values. Semblance of Cohesiveness Thus, a Guinean official said, Colonel Qaddafi has violated the fundamental ''courtesies'' of the organization that previously enabled it, by consensus and compromise, to project at least the semblance of cohesiveness among 50 disparate nations. And, from the perspective of Guinea - a perhaps misnamed member of the ''moderate'' group - Libya has also contradicted African legality by trying to impose a government that, to all intents and purposes, has no mandate -not by force of arms, not from the O.A.U. not from the war-weary people of Chad. The ironies abound, for it seems that Colonel Qaddafi has been trying to establish a principle that a perceived ''legal'' government should take precedence over a de facto administration that has won power by military victory. Yet if the circle of those admitted to the O.A.U. was limited to governments that had not taken power by military action, many African countries - including Libya - would not qualify. ''No one wants to take the responsibility for the disintegration of the Organization of African Unity,'' a Guinean Foreign Ministry official said, so efforts will continue to heal the rifts. The intention of the ''moderate'' group, the official said, is to convene a special meeting of African leaders in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, where the O.A.U. has its secretariat, to discuss only the Chad and Western Sahara issues, and solve them in time for next year's Conakry meeting. 2 Victories by 'Moderates' So far the ''moderate'' group, reversing a trend toward radicalism in Africa, has won two major victories over Colonel Qaddafi's efforts to stamp his own will on the organization and convert it into a platform for his zealotry. And, since the Tripoli meeting has not been held, Colonel Qaddafi cannot yet become the organization's chairman, a development that will probably be welcomed in private by the Reagan Administration. But from an African perspective there are wider issues that invoke a sense of dignity and viability. If a special meeting of leaders is unable to create harmony, then the O.A.U. would effectively dissolve into rival blocs whose divisions would blunt the continent's selfesteem and its ability to exert influence in the campaign against white minority domination of South Africa and for the independence of South-West Africa from Pretoria's domination. There might also be a sense that African presidents like Mr. Toure, who was one of the founding fathers of the O.A.U., have now been overtaken by divisions that cannot be controlled by the organization. Numerically, both ''moderates'' and ''progressives'' have the strength to prevent the organization's institutions from mustering the two-thirds quorum necessary to convene legally. In Tripoli it was the ''moderates'' who withheld their participation to torpedo the meeting. The desire in Conakry is to insure that next year the ''progressives'' do not reciprocate, thereby turning the imposing new settlements here into a costly irrelevance, and sealing the organization's demise. Western governments may also have an interest in helping salvage the organization. Although the Reagan Administration and its allies would have had no hope of access and influence under Colonel Qaddafi's chairmanship, President Toure has in recent years turned to the West for economic help. The Western calculation seems to be that he would provide the West with a friendlier and more accessible African visage.

425-> TO SAVE HOUSING FOR A CITY'S POOR
To the Editor: There appears to be some obfuscation in the debate over the sale of city-owned apartments under the Tenant Interim Lease (TIL) program . I couldn't agree more with The Times (editorial Nov. 3) and Mayor Koch that if TIL tenants buy their apartments for $250 and resell them at a profit, the city should get a sizable share (40 percent) of the gain. Where we differ is that I also support an amendment, developed with Comptroller Goldin, Manhattan Borough President Stein and tenant group coalitions, which would allow the new co-op boards to forgo any profit in order to preserve this housing stock for the poor. In either event - resale for profit or no profit at all - the program will have rigorous monitoring and audit mechanisms to avoid fraud. At a time when Washington has turned its back on supporting low-income housing, it defies logic that the city would pass up this opportunity to preserve at least a few more units affordable to citizens of modest means. We are fortunate to have enterprising residents who put hard work into redeeming buildings nobody once wanted. If they profit from their efforts, the city should share in it. But if they choose to sacrifice any gains, let's encourage their generosity. That way we all benefit. CAROL BELLAMY, President of the Council, New York, Nov. 3, 1982

427-> KNICKS DROP 4th; NETS DEFEAT CAVS
Almost everything about David Thompson looks the way it did before last season: His looping jumpers from 20 feet out, his drives to the basket and his constant adjustments of his socks. The different look in Thompson is the green Seattle SuperSonics' uniform he wears this season with a 44 instead of a 33 on it. Tonight, with Thompson leading the scoring for the fourth time as a Sonic with a season-high 30 points, unbeaten Seattle won its fifth game, a 112-103 decision over the Knicks. New York, without a victory in four games, did not go down to defeat easily. After trailing, 58-42, with 4 minutes 26 seconds remaining in the third period, the Knicks rallied and tied Seattle at 99-99 on a jumper by Bill Cartwright with 3:53 remaining. Cartwright, who led the Knicks with 24 points, fouled out with 2:12 left and tghe Knicks trailing by 102-100. After a Seattle basket, the Knicks cut the margin to a point at 104-103 with 1:58 to play on a field goal and a free throw by Louis Orr. But they never scored again as Jack Sikma and Thompson split 8 points between them. Besides his uniform number, what the 6-foot-4-inch, 205-pound Thompson left in Denver when he was traded last summer for Bill Hanzlik and Seattle's top 1982 draft choice were his disputes with Coach Doug Moe and a season that was his worst in seven as a pro. With the Sonics, the 28-year-old Thompson appears to be rejuvenated, playing the high-flying brand of basketball that made him a three-time all-American at North Carolina State and an all-star in the American and National Basketball Associations. ''I never lost anything as a player,'' Thompson said this afternoon. ''I felt bad when my playing time was cut because I knew I could still play. The entire situation in Denver was eating away at me. I was just in a bad situation. Every chance Doug Moe had to snipe at me, he did. It was pretty much a slow-death situation. ''I enjoyed my first few years with the Nuggets. They were great, but when losing replaced winning, finger pointing and back stabbing took over, all pointed at me. That's when the fun ended.'' Moe relegated Thompson, who had never averaged fewer than 21.5 points a game, to be the fourth guard. Further hampered by back and ankle injuries and suspensions, Thompson averaged 14.7 points last season in 61 games. Now, according to Gus Williams, his new backcourt mate, Thompson is back. ''He's the same player in a different situation,'' said Williams. ''A great player has come back. We both came out of college at the same time so I got to know him. I remember we played in a college all-star game in Hawaii, and he scored something like 44 points. ''Everybody has been asking me how it is to play with David. There can only be one answer - great - not only for me but for all the guys.'' ''David is playing very well,'' said Coach Lenny Wilkens. ''People are getting to see what he really can do with the ball. David is a complete player.'' Wilkens said Thompson had been on the trading market for at least a year before he became a Sonic. ''We just didn't jump in because he was David Thompson and he was available,'' Wilkens said. ''Obviously, we did a thorough job of checking Zim out, and we found his problems were past him.'' Did he think the trade was a gamble? ''I guess everything is a gamble,'' the coach said, ''but I find it exciting trying to help somebody, especially the type of players who are often labeled unfairly. Some players do deserve their labels, but from what I have heard about David, I don't think everything that had been said about him was totally fair.''

430-> What Criminal Justice System?
The proper measure of the justice system's effectiveness is not solely the crime rate, which it cannot control, but the efficiency - and justice - of a system laboring to function under the stress of the great demands placed upon it. So says Governor Carey's commission on the administration of justice, and there is little doubt about its conclusion that, measured by its efficiency, New York's justice system fails dismally. The main recommendation of the commission, headed by Arthur Liman, is for a cabinet-level coordinator of criminal justice. It seems somewhat utopian. A proposal for revamping the management of criminal records is far more practical. As long ago as 1936, Governor Lehman called for better coordination of the police, court and prison systems. The Liman Commission calls for a state official, with budget powers, to do just that. Governorelect Cuomo has moved swiftly to authorize the job and to appoint Lawrence Kurlander, a former Monroe County District Attorney. Mr. Kurlander deserves support; the state budget crisis makes his assignment more urgent than ever. Yet yoking together locally elected prosecutors, locally appointed police chiefs and an independent state judiciary probably exceeds the ability or authority of any state appointee. Much will depend on Mr. Cuomo's commitment. In the meantime, a specific problem highlighted in the Liman report demands immediate action: the criminal records fiasco. New York now spends about $14 million a year on computerized record-keeping that is virtually useless. Equipment is outdated, or varies so much from agency to agency that information can't be shared. The state cannot even keep accurate account of what happens to people arrested for felonies. City Council President Carol Bellamy earlier this year denounced a similar criminal records breakdown in the city. Badly managed records contribute to costly trial delays and often leave judges and prosecutors in the dark about a defendant's history. Some officials may prefer chaos: proper management of records is sure to expose embarrassing differences in productivity. Yet such accountability is crucial. A study performed for the Liman Commission by I.B.M. suggests that upgrading and unifying records management would cost only a few million dollars, thereby giving the state an enormous leg up on the larger problem of coordinating its $3 billion criminal justice system sensibly. Here, surely, is where Mr. Kurlander's work should begin.

433-> COLUMNIST TESTIFIES PEARSON FEARED BLACKMAIL
Drew Pearson, the columnist, believed he would be blackmailed by one of his bitterest enemies, Senator John L. McClellan, when he learned that the Senator had obtained some intimate letters from Mr. Pearson to a civil rights worker, a jury was told today. Jack Anderson, the partner of Mr. Pearson, who died in September 1969, testified in a lawsuit against Mr. McClellan's estate that the Senator and Mr. Pearson had waged a ''bitter, ugly, protracted feud.'' Mr. McClellan, an Arkansas Democrat, died in 1977. Mr. Pearson's letters were written to the then-single Margaret McSurely, who worked for the columnist as a secretary and subsequently left him to work in the civil rights movement in the South. She later married Alan McSurely, a civil rights worker. The McSurelys, who are now divorced, worked with the poor in Pikeville, Ky. On Aug. 11, 1967, their home was ransacked by sheriff's deputies and boxes of items were seized, including the Pearson letters. The items were turned over to Senator McClellan, who was then investigating race riots. Lawsuit Filed in 1969 The McSurelys, charging violation of their civil rights, are seeking up to $8 million in a 1969 lawsuit filed against Senator McClellan, three of his former aides and a former Kentucky prosecutor. Mr. Anderson testified that he learned that the Senator had the Pearson letters in 1969, shortly before the McSurelys were subpoenaed by the Senator for his investigation of riots, and said Mr. Pearson ''was fearful the Senator would use those letters to discredit him and blackmail him.'' The McSurelys refused to produce documents requested by Mr. McClellan and the Senator led a move to declare the couple in contempt of Congress. They were convicted, but the verdict was later overturned.

435-> MICHAELS HAS FAITH IN SLUMPING LEAHY
Once, two seasons ago, Coach Walt Michaels gave Pat Leahy an ultimatum - kick well, or be cut. The pressure worked. The next game, the Jets faced the Miami Dolphins, and Leahy kicked what turned out to be the winning field goal. Now, Leahy is again experiencing trouble; in the last three games he has missed eight kicks - four of seven field-goal attempts and four extra points. But today Michaels did not issue a kick-or-be-cut edict. In fact, he said Leahy's job was secure. When asked whether he would give Leahy another ultimatum, or planned to try other kickers, Michaels replied: ''No. I just think he'll snap out of it. He has before.'' In the midst of plenty - they are 5-1 and one victory away from clinching a second straight playoff berth - the Jets have a problem in Leahy's recent slump. Leahy's recent performance is in contrast with his career mark as one of the most efficient kickers in National Football League history. He ranks seventh, with an accuracy rate of 65.1 percent, among place-kickers with at least 100 field goals. The last three games have been Jet victories, minimizing Leahy's failures. But next Saturday the Jets play at Miami in a game that is likely to affect the American Conference championship. The Jets are tied for first with Cincinnati and the Los Angeles Raiders, while Miami is at 4-2. In the 11 meetings since Michaels became head coach in 1977 - the Jets have won seven, lost three and tied one - eight have been decided by 6 points or fewer. One was an overtime tie, another was determined by a point, and two by a field goal. Line Produces in Clutch Twice in Sunday's first drive against Tampa Bay, Michaels opted to run on fourth down instead of attempt a field goal. But the coach insisted that was not because he lacked confidence in Leahy, but because he thought his offensive line could produce the holes for the runners in the short-yardage situations. He was right. Most people on the Jets, including Leahy, say they know what his problem is: Either he is not keeping his head down, or he is rushing his kick. ''I'm all right,'' said Leahy today. ''It's probably easier for another player to get over a slump. I'm only in there five or six times a game.'' He said he thinks he has been lifting his head, an action that tends to cause the ball to travel on a low trajectory. Leahy said he would view films of his good kicks and contrast them with his recent kicking - which included a missed 40-yard field-goal attempt and two missed extra points in Sunday's 32-17 victory over the Buccaneers at Shea Stadium. Larry Pasquale, who is in charge of the Jets' kicking team, points out that a difference of a quarter of an inch in where the ball is struck can make its path vary by 10 to 15 feet only 25 yards down the field. Pasquale said he thought the 57-day strike layoff affected Leahy's rhythm. Even though Leahy kicked three straight field goals in the first game after the strike, against Baltimore, Pasquale said Leahy ''wasn't in the same rhythm. We looked at film and could see the difference.'' Pat Ryan, the holder, took the blame for one of Leahy's missed extra points against Tampa Bay. The Cold Is Blamed ''It was so cold that I bobbled the snap and planted it badly,'' said Ryan. Meanwhile, Richard Todd, the quarterback, could not convince Michaels that the Jets should leave early this week and practice in Florida. ''I think it would have helped the passing game,'' said Todd. ''A better field helps you plant better.'' Although the game in the Orange Bowl is on grass, the Jets may not be able to use their own grass fields at their camp here to practice on unless the weather warms. Instead, they would practice on artificial turf. Michaels, though, said he had asked people who have gone from cold weather to play in warm weather, ''and I see no advantage in leaving early.''

The Banco do Brasil said yesterday that it had not borrowed from the Federal Reserve Bank to meet its liquidity requirements. ''We are meeting our daily funding needs from our normal commercial bank sources,'' it added. ''Markets are tight, but we have not had to resort to assistance from the Federal Reserve Bank.'' The statement was in response to a published report yesterday that the Brazilian bank was rescued from default last week by credits from leading New York banks and that, according to some bankers, the Federal Reserve had lent money to the Banco do Brasil. A spokesman for the Federal Reserve had declined to comment on those reports Sunday night. Bankers said the Banco do Brasil again had difficulty raising money yesterday and that again it was assisted by major American banks.

Koch on City Life (Cont.) It was the deteriorating quality of life in New York that brought on its coming move to Rhode Island, according to word this week from the Automobile Insurance Plan Service Office. The office, which represents 800 companies, has 354 employees in Manhattan. Actually, Richard J. Decker, president, said later, he meant it was the high cost of living that led to the move. But Mayor Koch was as fast off the blocks as if his pre-primary denunciation of non-urbanites had never backfired. ''If I was looking for quality of life,'' the Mayor said, ''I wouldn't spend the rest of mine in Rhode Island.'' At which point he caught himself, grinned broadly and added: ''Assuming of course, the alternative was living in New York City.'' ''That kind of statement,'' said Mr. Decker, ''explains why he isn't governor.'' Mr. Koch, in his earlier jeremiad, had cited shopping at Sears, Roebuck as an example of the emptiness of rural life. Mr. Decker, describing himself as a devoted New Yorker, said he gets his suits at a Sears store in Brooklyn.

A Federal appeals court today upheld the nation's toughest gun ordinance, ruling that the Chicago suburb of Morton Grove acted within its authority in banning sale and possession of pistols. In a 2-to-1 decision, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit rejected arguments that the ordinance, enacted last year, violated provisions of the state and Federal constitutions that guarantee the right to bear arms. No one has been charged with violating the ordinance since it took effect Feb. 1, and only a few weapons have been turned in. Justice William J. Bauer, who wrote the decision, said he agreed with a district court that the village acted within the police powers granted by the state constitution in outlawing sale and possession of pistols by anyone except law officers and registered collectors.

Mr. Colombo suggested that an increase in the strength of the force might require the participation of other countries, but he declined to identify potential contributors. Prime Minister Giovanni Spadolini of Italy discussed the situation in Lebanon in a private meeting this morning with Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The Foreign Minister and the Prime Minister arrived in New York Thursday after discussing problems in East-West trade with President Reagan in Washington. Mr. Colombo emphasized that consensus was essential in the establishment of guidelines on trade with the Soviet Union. He said ''a common strategy'' should replace ''the other strategy of unilateral action'' taken by the United States.

444-> TAXING HEALTH BENEFITS CAN'T CUT HEALTH COSTS
To the Editor: With regard to your Dec. 5 news article detailing proposals - made to President Reagan by senior officials of his Administration - to tax health benefits, two points should be mentioned: These benefits are not the equivalent of cash income unless they are used. * If they were to be taxed even if unused, there would be greater incentives for healthy workers to opt for elective medical procedures, if only to avoid being ''cheated'' out of benefits. This, of course, will put more upward pressure on medical costs. Taxing healthy workers in order to generate revenue and to contain medical costs seems to be a rather poor proposition.

446-> PILL CASE SUSPECT FOUND IN NEW YORK
A fugitive charged in a plot to extort $1 million in the Chicago area Tylenol deaths was seized by Federal agents in New York City yesterday afternoon. The authorities said the suspect, James W. Lewis, was picked up at 2 P.M. at the New York Public Library Annex in midtown after being recognized from a poster distributed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He was arraigned in Federal Court in Manhattan last night before United States Magistrate Ruth V. Washington on charges of extortion and unlawful flight. She ordered him held in $5 million cash bond pending an identity hearing Dec. 23. He was sent to the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a Federal facility in downtown Manhattan. Kenneth Walton, the deputy assistant director in charge of the New York office of the F.B.I., said yesterday at a news conference that there was no evidence to link Mr. Lewis or his wife, Leann, directly to the seven deaths that were caused by cyanide-filled Extra-Strength Tylenol capsules bought in Chicago area stores. The deaths occurred between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1. He Is Accused of Writing Letter Authorities have said that after the deaths, Mr. Lewis wrote a threatening letter to Johnson & Johnson, the parent company of MacNeil Consumer Products, the manufacturer of Tylenol, demanding $1 million under the threat of further poisionings. Tyrone Fahner, the Illinois Attorney General, said when the arrest warrant was issued that ''the nature of the extortion letter and the claims in it are such that the investigators would naturally want to talk to Mr. Lewis.'' Mr. Walton said the whereabouts of Mrs. Lewis remained unknown but urged her to turn herself in. ''We're going to find her, too,'' he said. There was no word on where the Lewises may have been living since they left the Hotel Rutledge on Lexington Avenue at 31st Street, wherethey reportedly stayed from Sept. 6 to mid-October. The couple had been sighted a number of times in New York, and their presence set off a large-scale hunt here by Federal agents and the city police. Posters were displayed in midtown from river to river, asking people to call if they spotted the Lewises. ''Today someone did,'' Mr. Walton said. He said a phone call led agents to the library annex at 40th Street and Fifth Avenue, where they found Mr. Lewis sitting, copying names and addresses of newspapers from a book. Mr. Walton said the suspect was unarmed, offered no resistance and acknowledged his identity. In the news conference in the F.B.I. office at 26 Federal Plaza, a clean-shaven Mr. Lewis could be seen being whisked past a door into an elevator. In the weeks after the deaths, more than 100 Federal, state and local investigators in Illinois worked on the poisioning case. The team is now less than half its original size. In a letter to The Chicago Tribune in October, Mr. Lewis, using one of his many aliases, denied that they had had any role in the deaths. The formal charge against Mrs. Lewis is fraudulent use of a Social Security card. ---- There Are Other Suspects Special to the New York Times SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Dec. 13 - At a news conference at the Illinois State Capitol, Attorney General Tyrone Fahner said tonight that James Lewis ''is high on our list of people,'' but added: ''We have to determine whether or not he's responsible. I hasten to make clear: He is a suspect, but we have others as well.'' He said other suspects ''had made statements to friends, or had exhibited conduct, or had made threats against one of the companies involved at a previous date, and had exhibited criminal or quasicriminal behavior that would lead us to believe they are capable of doing these terrible crimes.'' ---- F.B.I. 'Saturated' Libraries CHICAGO, Dec. 13 (UPI) - Tony DiLorenzo, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said that the agency had circulated posters of James Lewis to libraries because they had determined that he had been following The Chicago Tribune. ''We knew he was getting copies and we knew he wasn't getting it from newsstands,'' Mr. DiLorenzo said. ''So the logical place was from the public library. We saturated the libraries with wanted flyers.''

448-> ISLANDERS RALLY FOR 3-3 TIE
Despite a chaotic situation in which a number of players substituted briefly for their disabled coach, the Islanders managed a 3-3 tie with the Quebec Nordiques tonight in a penaltyriddled game. Five of the six goals were scored on power plays. Billy Smith, in goal, saved the game for the Islanders after he relieved Roland Melanson late in the first period with the Islanders behind by two goals. Melanson, who said he ''just didn't have it tonight,'' yielded all of Quebec's goals. But Smith held the Nordiques scoreless as he turned away 19 shots. Shoulder Is Dislocated This was what players call a ''chippy'' game, involving high-sticking, cross-checking, roughing and fighting. The principal casualty, though, was not a player. He was Al Arbour, coach of the Islanders, who suffered a dislocated left shoulder in the third period as he tried to restrain Bob Nystrom from going over the boards to join a fight on the ice. In the 10 minutes Arbour was in the dressing room getting first aid, Butch Goring, a center who also serves as assistant coach, took charge. The first thing he did was to send himself onto the ice for a shift. What followed, as Bob Bourne put it, was ''total chaos'' as players outshouted one another with orders. One of them was Nystrom, who said, ''I tried to be a playing coach.'' Mike Bossy added, ''Everybody wanted to coach.'' Eventually Lorne Henning, a full-time assistant coach, came down from his perch in the upper stands and took charge. Ultimately Arbour returned to the bench, with his arm in a sling, to resume coaching. His arm was set by a Nordiques physician and the Islanders' trainer, Ron Waske. Gregg Madill, the referee, whistled 20 minor penalties and one misconduct, to Andre Dupont of the Nordiques. The Islanders took 12 of the minor penalties. Scores on Power Plays Stefan Persson, Bryan Trottier and Clark Gillies scored for the Islanders, all on power plays. Mike Bossy got three assists. Wilf Paiement and Dale Hunter scored power-play goals for Quebec and Anton Stastny scored one while the teams were even-handed. Arbour described the Islanders' play in the first period as ''sluggish.'' The second period, though, was a vivid contrast as the Islanders came to life and scored two goals, one at the beginning of the period and the other with 26 seconds remaining. There were no goals in the third period, but the action was exceptionally lively on both sides. After the game Arbour, said he was pleased that the Islanders had come from behind twice in their last two games. Last Saturday they trailed the Philadelphia Flyers by 3-1 and then went on to a 4-4 tie. Arbour Is Annoyed However, Arbour was annoyed by the many needless penalties the Islanders took. ''If they played the body like they should,'' he said, ''they wouldn't be taking silly penalties like tripping and holding. It's been going on too long,'' The best sign that came out of this game was the reassertion of the Islanders' power play. Currently they have the league's best power play but on the road they rank last. Until tonight they had scored only one power-play goal in 15 chances in five games. Smith, who had been benched for two games, was his old ebullient self again. ''It's not what you did last night that counts, but what you did tonight,'' he said. ''The rest did me good. I was mentally tired, and that got me physicaly tired.'' Nystrom Is Restrained The Arbour incident happened during a scuffle in which Denis Potvin slashed Dale Hunter. While players were massing around the combatants, Dupont came off the Quebec bench. Nystrom started to go over the Islanders' boards when Arbour reached out to hold him. Nystrom had so much momentum that he pulled Arbour's arm out of its socket. ''I'd have gone farther,'' said Nystrom, ''but I saw he was in pain. I must have apologized a hundred times.'' After a listless start, the Islanders posted the first goal of the game, on a power play, with Persson scoring on assists by Potvin and Bossy. The Nordiques came back 1:15 later on the score by Paiement. Hunter made it 2-1 and then Stastny raised the score to 3-1 on a 40-foot shot. That was when Melanson was pulled out of the goal.

Letter: On Housing Subsidies Building a Stimulus Into the Economy To the Editor: In your Oct. 23 editorial ''What's So Special About Housing?'' opposing any Congressional action to adopt a housing stimulus package, you cite some favorable developments affecting housing but neglect to mention other significant trends that be-speak the continuing severity of the problem. Overall during the last three years, housing starts have fallen 52 percent and new housing sales have dropped 47 percent, while unemployment in the construction industry is heading off the charts. Many members of Congress from both parties are developing new approaches for dealing with the immediate housing-related problems affecting the economy. The bill you mentioned was au-thored by Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana. His proposal sought to provide a Federal subsidy to reduce mortgage rates to a set level, thereby making home ownership affordable and in turn helping to spur activity in the housing construction industry. The bill was vetoed by the President, but Democrats in the House have picked up its theme and have included it in their comprehensive housing package designed to provide homeowners with relief from the pain of this current recession while helping homebuilding and related industries. You ask why Congress should provide assistance to this sector of the economy. The answer is simple. A healthy housing construction industry benefits everyone by creating jobs in its own and allied spheres. It also contributes significantly to the health of the general economy; stimulation of the housing industry has proved to be the linchpin of economic recovery during past periods of recession. This proposal represents an equitable way to create activity in the housing construction industry without an unacceptable strain on the Federal treasury. In the absence of any realistic hope that Congress will restore cuts in welfare, food stamps or housing benefits for the poor, I believe that reasonable, fair efforts to begin the national recovery that we all seek must be supported and encouraged.

451-> DORFMAN ASSETS CURB UPHELD
A three-judge Federal appeals panel today refused to stay an order by District Judge Nicholas Bua to place in receivership the assets of four businesses owned by Allen M. Dorfman, who was convicted in the teamsters bribery conspiracy trial. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit said the judge's temporary restraining order Wednesday was not an appealable matter. Earlier today, Judge Bua refused to lift his order, which froze the assets of Amalgamated Insurance Agency Services and three other Dorfman businesses. But the judge modified the order to allow Mr. Dorfman to draw money for living expenses. Mr. Dorfman and four other men, including Roy L. Williams, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, were convicted Dec. 15 of conspiring to bribe Senator Howard W. Cannon of Nevada in a land deal. Amalgamated holds a multimillion-dollar contract with the Teamsters Health and Welfare Fund and processes insurance claims of 500,000 beneficiaries of the $300 million fund. Judge Bua's 10-day receivership order also affects Federal Computer Systems, Health Plan Consultants Service and Prescription Plan, all subsidiaries that process claims for the fund. The Government had argued that there was a ''reasonable likelihood'' that Mr. Dorfman could conceal or destroy Amalgamated records. His attorneys argued that receivership would disrupt Amalgamated's efficiency. They also said there was no evidence that Mr. Dorfman, who is free on a $5 million bond, might dispose of the companies and flee the country. A Justice Department attorney who asked not to be identified said the freezing of Mr. Dorfman's assets would have no effect on his bond unless a motion was made requesting a bond change. No such motion has been filed. Judge Bua's order, imposing the receivership until Jan. 10, came after Labor Secretary Raymond J. Donovan filed suit requesting the action. The suit reportedly charges that the fund overpaid Mr. Dorfman $5 million.

453-> Decision File; Airline Fined On Smoking Complaints
The Civil Aeronautics Board recently imposed a $12,000 fine on American Airlines for refusing to provide sufficient seating in the no-smoking sections of its airplanes. According to the Federal regulatory agency, the airline denied 12 passengers their right to smoke-free air on separate flights in 1979 and 1980. On one occasion, a nonsmoking passenger was told that he would not even be allowed to board the plane unless he agreed to give up his claim to a no-smoking seat. John M. Vittone, the agency's administrative law judge, called the carrier's violations of Federal regulations ''gross.'' The regulations require airlines to provide a no-smoking area for each class of service and to make sure that nonsmoking passengers are not ''unreasonably burdened by breathing smoke.'' Carriers must also expand no-smoking areas to meet consumer demand. American Airlines did not dispute the facts, but sought to get the cases dismissed for a variety of reasons, including an argument that the violations had occurred ''on a once-in-a-million basis.'' The airline noted that it had received only 31 smoking complaints during a period when it had carried 24.6 million passengers. The C.A.B. was not persuaded and it upheld the administrative law judge's decision. The board said that a carrier's over-all record does not excuse it from penalties and, that ''American's argument unreasonably assumes that every passenger wrongfully denied a nosmoking seat files a complaint with the board.'' In the first nine months of 1982, the agency received 200 complaints related to smoking, down 41 percent from the same period in 1981, according to Ted Lopatkiewicz, an agency spokesman. Exploding Grates The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which monitors 20,000 household products for safety, reported recently that some new types of fireplace grates may explode. Since 1977, according to the commission, five people have been seriously injured and at least one person has been killed in explosions of such grates. Two of the grates in question are U-shaped racks and one is a fireplace liner. The devices, made of tubular steel, use the fire's heat to warm water for washing dishes and bathing. After the water is heated inside the grate's plumbing, it is circulated to a standard water heating tank. These unconventional heaters must have a pressure-relief valve as a precaution against overheating and explosion. The commission warns, however, that valves are missing on some of the grates and liners, which were made by Ridgeway Steel Fabricators of Ridgeway, Pa. and Shark Manufacturing Corporation of Greenlawn, N.@Y. The affected models were sold under the brand names ''Hydrohearth,'' ''Hydroplace'' and ''Aqua Grate.'' The commission says that owners of any of the grates should have them checked by a qualified, licensed plumber who has ''specific knowledge of boilers, water pumps, pipe freezing problems and pressure relief valves.'' The companies are not recalling their products because both went out of business, the commission said. Air-Bag Test The National Highway Safety Administration plans to install and test crash-cushioning air bags in some police cars in Arizona. Raymond A. Peck Jr., administrator of the Federal agency, said in a recent statement that he was ''committed to seeking automotive demonstration projects which assure continued research into reliable and cost effective auto safety technology for the American car-buying public.'' This year, Mr. Peck rescinded a regulation that would have required automatic seat belts or air bags in 1983 passenger cars. That decision, which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia characterized as ''capricious'' and ''unlawful,'' is now awaiting review by the United States Supreme Court. False Notice The Federal Trade Commission does not set minimum prices for recharging spent fire extinguishers, but somebody outside the commission apparently thinks that that would be a good idea. A ''public notice'' to that effect, on what seems to be an F.T.C. letterhead, has recently been circulated in Chicago. It threatens companies that recharge fire extinguishers with antitrust action if they do not adhere to a minimum price list. The notice, purportedly sent by James C. Miller 3d, chairman of the commission, is a fraud. According to an F.T.C. press release meant to set matters straight, and confirmed as bona fide, ''antitrust law requires each competing firm to determine for itself the prices it will charge.'' 'Incredible' Sale In June 1981, Frank Baker, an unemployed Washingtonian, sold $22,823 worth of United States Government checks he had obtained to an undercover Secret Service agent for $1,850. Arrested and taken to the Federal District Court in Washington, he offered no defense and was sentenced to serve two to six years in prison. Without disputing his guilt, Mr. Baker appealed. He contended, among other things, that the Government had failed to mention in the indictment that he had knowingly dealt in stolen property. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia said that indictment language followed no particular verbal formula and upheld the verdict. ''It is incredible,'' added the appellate court, ''that someone with the legal authority to sell or negotiate the checks would sell them for less than 10 percent of their value.'' The appellate court did agree that the lower court had made an unrelated technical error, but ruled it ''harmless'' and irrelevant to the ultimate outcome of the trial. Michael deCourcy Hinds

454-> FOR COLUMBUS IN U.N., A STORMY PASSAGE
Even old-timers here were hardpressed to recall another instance when so much had been said by so many to accomplish so little. The General Assembly, long accustomed to long and vitriolic debate, agreed a few weeks back to set aside vexing problems in Afghanistan, Lebanon and Cambodia to take up a seemingly innocuous agenda item entitled ''The Discovery of America.'' The Assembly did not seek to challenge the discovery, nor its merits, but rather sought the observance of 1992 as the quincentenary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus. The resolution produced a brief and startling alliance that brought together the United States, Canada and El Salvador with ideological rivals such as Cuba, Nicaragua and Grenada. Resolution Meets Opposition Together they provided unabashed support for a resolution hailing ''the growing contribution by the peoples of the New World to progress and understanding among nations.'' But while the resolution generated novel sources of support, it also provoked a surprising, somewhat tongue-in-cheek opposition in the Scandanavian countries and a more serious-minded one among the African nations. The usually conciliatory missions of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, led by Iceland's delegate, Hordur Helgason, feeling slighted by the Latin American initiative promoting Columbus, countered with their own insufficiently heralded explorer, Leif Ericsson, a Norwegian of Icelandic descent. Ericsson, the Scandanavians argued, discovered the New World a full 500 years before the upstart Columbus. Mr. Helgason said ''the historical fact of Leif Ericcson's discovery is so totally ignored in the absolute wording of the draft resolution that we cannot give it our vote.'' A Contender From Ireland Ireland's representative, Noel Dorr, amused some colleagues and provoked laughter from the General Assembly president, Imre Hollai, by suggesting that perhaps it was St. Brendan, the patron saint of County Kerry, who discovered the New World. Mr. Dorr concluded his speech with the ''hope that the amity and unity of purpose'' the resolution's sponsors had shown in asking the Assembly ''to commemorate 1492 in 1992 will be evident in their approach to the other urgent problems of 1982.'' Even such modest attempts at humor, which the subject seemed to make irresistible, were quickly doused by impassioned proponents of Columbus. Spain's delegate, Jaime de Pinies, responded that it was possible that the Icelanders and the Irish had left remains at certain sites but ''up to this point the only thing that I have found from Ireland, with all due respect, is the police force in New York City'' and other distinguished Irishmen. The resolution was first conceived by Latin American diplomats at a Columbus Day luncheon given by the Spanish representative, which was described by one delegate as ''boisterous.'' Africans Vow a Veto The delegate from Costa Rica, Emilia Castro de Barish, told the Assembly, ''We cannot deny that Christopher Columbus demonstrated that the world was round, because up until that point it was believed to be flat.'' Mrs. Barish added that if ''Eric the Red'' or the Irish ''did visit the New World they never knew quite where they were.'' Mr. Dorr then exercised his right of reply and assured certain offended members of the Assembly that no disrespect had been intended. The Scandanavian countries, galvanized by Iceland, jocularly suggested to the Assembly that the draft resolution ''commemorates colonization.'' The African nations took this argument seriously and vowed to veto the resolution if it came to a vote. One United Nations official said that the resolution had ''reawakened latent antagonisms of colonialism and racism.'' Today it was decided to leave the fate of Columbus to the next year's session of the General Assembly.

455-> NOW IS THE TIME TO DEMILITARIZE SPACE
To the Editor: Your news series dealing with militarization of space should increase public awareness and concern on an issue that has for too long been neglected. We intend to reintroduce this resolution when the Congress reconvenes in January. The deployment of space weapons systems will jeopardize American security interests and only increase the chance of accidental or intentional nuclear war. While we are in the early stages of developing and deploying these weapons, it makes sense for us to negotiate a complete and verifiable prohibition of weapons of any kind in space. Time is short, and we must act before we pass a threshold where nations are unwilling to negotiate the removal of weapons from space. The Soviets have indicated their willingness to commence talks. It is now up to us to take positive action. President Kennedy was once asked the difference between the Atlas rocket, which could destroy Moscow, and the one that boosted John Glenn into orbit. His answer: ''Attitude.'' We suggest that the attitude of the Administration and Congress be one of working toward preventing a costly and dangerous extension of the arms race. We believe that our resolution is an important step in achieving this goal. JOHN JOSEPH MOAKLEY Member of Congress, 9th Dist., Mass. HAROLD C. HOLLENBECK Member of Congress, 9th Dist., N.J. Washington, Oct. 22, 1982

456-> IN THE NATION; Looking Like Jimmy
As a manager of the national economy, Ronald Reagan is beginning to look as indecisive as Jimmy Carter ever did: * In 1981 he pushed through a massive, three-stage income tax reduction, insisting that it would so stimulate the economy that no one need worry about budget deficits. * In 1982 he pushed through a massive, one-stage tax increase, saying that it was necessary to hold down huge impending deficits. * In 1983 he says he may try to stimulate the economy by advancing the third stage of the original tax cut to Jan. 1 from July 1, and never mind the increase in a deficit that even his Administration admits will be in excess of $150 billion. Shades of Jimmy Carter! The net stimulative effect of putting the 1983 tax cut into effect six months earlier than scheduled, Congressional sources say, would be roughly the same as the $50 income tax rebate Mr. Carter proposed after taking office in 1977. And that's not much stimulus. Mr. Carter, of course, later withdrew the proposal; and Mr. Reagan might yet back away from his. The Administration is said to be divided, with Secretary of the Treasury Regan for the acceleration and Martin Feldstein, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, opposed. Even if moving forward the tax cut were a good idea, all this backing and filling is bound to be as confusing to businessmen, the credit markets and consumers as Mr. Carter's flip-flops were. And Mr. Reagan is beginning to suffer from the impression, so fatal to his predecessor, that he does not know his own mind - much less what to do about the economy. But advancing the tax cut is not a good idea. It would add $14 billion to the deficit, and probably not recover even that much through increased business activity. It might increase employment by 100,000 jobs, certainly not more than 200,000, effecting a drop of one or two tenths of 1 percent in unemployment. Adding $14 billion to what already looks too much like a deficit that's out of control could help rekindle inflationary expectations. And the additional strain on credit markets would produce upward pressures on interest rates, tending to cancel the desired stimulative effect. Besides, Mr. Reagan clearly is going to put up a hard fight against cuts in his military budget - the obvious target for anyone who seriously wants to reduce forthcoming budget deficits. In view of those deficits, he can hardly argue for more tax relief but no reduction in military spending. Meanwhile, the Great Communicator spread further confusion in addressing a group of savings and loan officials in New Orleans. He said it was ''a real dipsy doodle'' to claim that his tax cuts and military spending increases were responsible for the record deficits now in sight; and that trying to reduce those deficits by delaying the scheduled 1983 tax cut, as some Democrats want to do, would be a ''surrender to the big spenders.'' But mirror, mirror, on the wall, who spends biggest of them all? Ronald Reagan, that's who, with his projected Pentagon budget increases that will drive military expenditures to about $279 billion, or 32 percent of the total Federal budget, in 1985. The military's share was only 24 percent in 1980. And by 1985 the Pentagon will consume about 7.1 percent of gross national product, compared to only 5.6 percent in 1981, when Mr. Reagan took office. When these rising military outlays are added to the estimated $377 billion in revenues lost to the Government in 1982-85 owing to Mr. Reagan's 1981 tax reduction - even allowing for his 1982 tax increase - it's easy to see where the budget deficits are coming from. The Carter Administration was mainly responsible for deficits of about $60 billion in 1980 and 1981. But Mr. Reagan's 1982 deficit was $111 billion; most economists think the figure will be nearer $200 billion than $150 billion in 1983, and remain near that level in the several years following. As for ''real dipsy doodle,'' Mr. Reagan produced some of his own from his seemingly endless store of misinformation. He contended, for example, that his income tax reductions ''will barely neutralize'' Social Security payroll tax increases. But the rise in employer and employee payroll taxes from 1982 to 1985 will be about $78 billion - or roughly $300 billion less than the sameperiod revenue loss from income tax reduction. ''Current and projected deficits,'' he also said in New Orleans, ''result from sharp increases in nondefense spending.'' In fact, the largest category of nondefense spending, ''payments to individuals'' (which includes Social Security and unemployment compensation), will decline from 11.1 percent of G.N.P. in 1981 to 10.9 in 1985, and all other nondefense spending will fall from 3.9 to 2.8 percent of G.N.P. in the same period. Nondefense spending also will decline as a percentage of the total budget.

458-> Jacobs Group Lifts Pabst Offer to $30
A group headed by the Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs has raised its offer for 3 million shares of the Pabst Brewing Company to $30 a share from $24. The withdrawal deadline remains midnight next Friday, the group said, and the offer will expire at midnight, Dec. 2, unless further extended. The Justice Department said it would not file antitrust objections to the proposed acquisition, thus clearing the way for the offer to proceed. The Heileman Brewing Company has a competing offer for Pabst, endorsed by management, to acquire 5.5 million Pabst shares at $27.50 a share. The Jacobs group also said that a preliminary count as of Nov. 17 indicates that about 2,175,000 Pabst shares had been tendered before the first pro ration date and not withdrawn, and 960,000 shares were tendered thereafter and not withdrawn.

459-> THOUSANDS GIVE THANKS WITH FREE HOLIDAY MEAL
Tens of thousands of Americans pinched by the recession gathered together on Thanksgiving Day to ask for turkey and dressing from charity agencies, some of which were hard-pressed to find donations. This year's Thanksgiving food giveaway was one of the biggest ever for charity groups in Miami and San Francisco and dozens of cities in between, and long lines of the poor and unemployed formed in Washington and Detroit. In Santa Monica, Calif., a vegetarian group served browned tofu strips. A homosexual bar called Buddies threw a Thanksgiving feast for 200 elderly Boston residents. Chuck Enyeart of Peru, Ind., invited his whole town of 14,000 people. ''I couldn't have done any better myself,'' said Carl Ahnert, 92 years old, a former fire chief who lives alone and accepted Mr. Enyeart's offer. ''I've been around here 92 years and I think this is one of the nicest things that's ever happened to me.'' About 150 people ate at a local Roman Catholic school, and meals were also being distributed to shut-ins and needy families who didn't show up. Turnout Low in New York In New York City, the turnout for a Volunteers of America giveaway was ''surprisingly'' far below expectations, said Norma Goldsmith of the charity group. The Volunteers had prepared to feed more than 1,500 needy men and women at the Bowery Tabernacle, but on Thursday officials said it appeared only 1,000 would show up, making it a ''normal Thanksgiving'' despite the economy. In Cleveland, only a last-minute surge of donations saved the Volunteers' annual Thanksgiving giveaway, and Ann Harlan, director of the New Orleans Food Bank, said donations of food were running at about half last year's level. But while some found donations lacking, others said the economic climate prodded the spirit of giving. ''I get a lot of letters telling me, 'I know these are hard times, I know the lines are extra long, so I'm increasing my donation,' '' said the Rev. Floyd Lotito, the Franciscan director of St. Anthony's Dining Room in San Francisco's Tenderloin District. Some 5,600 people were fed Wednesday at a Methodist church, and Father Lotito expected to serve more than 5,000 Thursday at St. Anthony's. Lines Near the White House President Reagan shared a turkey dinner with members of his family in Santa Barbara, Calif., while across the street from the White House the poor lined up for free dinners. That meal was organized by the Community for Creative Nonviolence, whose leader, Mitch Snyder, estimated that 500 to 1,000 meals would be served before the day ended. ''We're here to remind people and the President that for millions of Americans this is not a very happy Thanksgiving,'' he said. ''Millions are unemployed thanks to Reagan's budget cuts. Our message to him is: There is a cost to your program, Mr. President. Those aren't just statistics; those are human beings.'' Mr. Snyder, who has been feeding and housing the poor in Washington for 10 years, found one bright note. ''We've never seen as many volunteers, offering turkeys, offering time.'' ''There's just more need in the community,'' said the Rev. Thomas Nees of the Community of Hope Church of the Nazarene in Washington, in a run-down neighborhood less than two miles north of the White House. For years the church had given away food at Thanksgiving, but this year for the first time it served meals. ''A New Reality'' ''There's a new reality of economics and distress out there,'' Mr. Nees said. ''We're seeing a lot of people who a year ago wouldn't have been asking for food. That's where our increase is coming from.'' In Detroit, lines of people stretched for blocks Wednesday waiting for 12,000 boxes of food. ''It's been years since I've seen anything like this,'' said the Rev. William Bonner, pastor of Solomon's Temple Church. In downtown Miami, Camillus House, a Catholic refuge that regularly serves meals to the poor, said it had its biggest Thanksgiving Day ever. Hundreds of unemployed people, many of them homeless, were waiting in a line that stretched around the block when the center opened its doors at 10 A.M., and 1,259 men women and children were fed. In Tucson, Ariz., the Salvation Army's Hospital House drew about 1,200 people for free dinners, compared with 870 last year, said Maj. Neil Saunders. He noted that many of the new people appeared to be in their 20's and 30's, with families. Managers at an aircraft assembly plant in Palmdale, Calif., cooked turkeys and 1,600 employees provided the trimmings for a massive feast Wednesday in an aircraft hangar. The plant will be idled by 1984 because the Lockheed Corporation is phasing out the L-1011 Tri-Star jetliner.

460-> SCOUTING; Help for Athletes
So you want to major in engineering, play hockey and attend a small college in the Northeast. Where do you go? Who's the athletic director? What's his telephone number? How good is the team? What is an athletic scholarship worth? Seven years ago, when he was an all-state high school pitcher in Vermont, those questions bedeviled Timothy R. Callahan. Now, he is the publisher of his hometown weekly in Essex Junction, and he gets the impression that they're still bedeviling people. The result, for the student-athlete who has everything but answers: ''Callahan's Compact College Guide to Athletics and Academics in America.'' It lists 247 colleges that replied to such questions, and it's the result of ''a pipe dream'' by a man who says: ''I knew there was a need. Up here in Vermont, there isn't a lot of recruiting. You think you can go to the New York Public Library and get the answers. I talked to a lot of kids who were asking the same questions I had asked counselors and coaches. I wrote to a lot of coaches. It blew my mind.'' Callahan's Compact Guide introduces each school briefly before listing the vital statistics. Iowa State: ''Nestled in a tree-lined, collegiate setting in Ames, Iowa State is a state-supported institution with an emphasis on engineering, science and humanities and agriculture.'' Pan American University: ''Located in the scenic, subtropical Lower Rio Grande Valley, Pan American is a liberal arts college with a strong business administration school.'' ''The book doesn't have all the answers,'' Mr. Callahan says. ''But it's a first step.''

462-> RETAILERS OF WOMEN'S APPAREL UNEASY AS PRICES FALL SHARPLY
Markdowns on women's apparel at leading department stores across the country are exceeding those for any Christmas season in the recent past. Retailers are expressing concern about what the trend bodes for merchandising, and some even suggest it could change the face of fashion retailing. According to sellers of moderately priced and high-priced women's apparel, the retail climate appears to be worse than that in the recession of 1975. They attribute the situation to markdowns of 20 to 40 percent that were taken as early as August, in advance of the usual sales periods, and to what they see as a chronic decrease in consumer purchases. Many say they are fearful that they face what may be the bleakest holiday season in 25 years in view of third-quarter sales decreases of 10 percent or more from last year. Even though the stores do not preclude the possibility of a turnaround during the holiday season, they are increasing the scope of markdowns to keep up with last year's sales. All this has fueled speculation among retailers that the very nature of the merchandising of higher-priced fashions will change if the economy does not improve. How, they ask, can they maintain a high-price, high-fashion image if goods must continually be put on sale? ''Some stores are going back to what they were doing in the 40's before they were concerned about their fashion image,'' said Ira Neimark, president of Bergdorf Goodman. ''They are promoting heavily and pounding away with incredible sales. ''We saw the bad business coming, and our idea was to batten down the hatches, cut our expenses, not promote heavily and wait for the economy to change. But some other stores are running with all their sails out ahead of the storm. As a result they seem to be changing their personalities entirely from that of fashion stores to that of promotion-minded stores. That could change fashion retailing as we know it.'' Given the general picture, most retailers are more reticent than ever to discuss sales figures. More than usual they fall back on jargon to describe the current climate. Many stores in the Northeast, Southwest, South and the West would report only that apparel sales for the third quarter were flat, tough or ''even with last year.'' With few exceptions those stores that were willing to be identified - among them Macy's and Bloomingdales's in New York and Neiman-Marcus in Dallas - said that increases in third-quarter sales of women's apparel were in the range of 3 to 6 percent over the same period last year, which, given the rate of inflation, means that they have not achieved any real increase. While Lord & Taylor reported similar weak increases for August and September, its executives added that October sales had increased 14 percent. Henri Bendel reported an October increase of 30 percent, attributed by its president, Geraldine Stutz, to its first mail-order catalogue, which created $750,000 worth of business in one month. 'Huge Increases' Evaporate The October results of Lord & Taylor and Bendel were anomalies in what is by and large a gloomy picture. Robert T. Sakowitz, chairman of Sakowitz Inc., a chain of 15 specialty stores based in Houston, reported: ''We have gone from huge increases of 18 to 30 percent last year at this time to anywhere from even to minus sales on a store-tostore basis.'' ''For a long period of time specialty stores and high-quality fashion goods held out and were not affected by the economy,'' he continued. ''Now they're beginning to feel the crunch. The stores that are making their projected sales figures are only managing it with unbelievable off-price sales, which we do not think is the way to go. There is an old saying in retail: 'Count each day as lost in which millions are sold at cost.' Not only have big designer names crested, but there is every reason to believe that a number of department stores will go out of business in the 80's.'' The trend to marking down large quantities of new merchandise before traditional sale periods shows no sign of abating. ''The advertising linage in the media that we are devoting to markdowns and special sales has increased dramatically over the past three months,'' said Jack Schultz, executive vice president of Bloomingdale's. ''It's well in excess of 50 percent over the same period last year.'' At the same time merchants are concerned that continued markdowns will again yield inflated sales figures that may be difficult to match or surpass next year. They are also concerned that extended periods of markdowns, with goods sold at little more than cost, will undermine the credibility of high list prices; the fear is that customers who have not always shopped for price will join those who have usually waited for sales. ''There is always the fear whenever you are on sale for too long that you destroy the credibility of your prices,'' said Mr. Sakowitz. ''We are trying not to do that because we are concerned with the perception in women's minds that we could have offered clothing at really low prices all along, which is absolutely incorrect.'' However, Mr. Schultz of Bloomingdale's said: ''Customers are not adverse to buying merchandise at promotional prices, so who are we kidding about image? If we could put everything out at 20 percent less, it would enhance everything. If one can buy first-quality goods at a lower price, so much the better. Wouldn't you be more tickled to buy it at a lower price at Bloomingdale's in our gift box, with our stamp of fashion approval, than to buy distressed goods from a discounter?'' Nonetheless, in the view of retail executives, Mr. Sakowitz's fear is not totally unfounded. While the higher-priced stores are not faring well, discount stores seem to be weathering the retail storm, which represents something of a reversal of the situation that prevailed not long ago, when little was selling but costly merchandise. Indeed, the discounters may be siphoning off some of the business of what are known as the better stores. According to George P. Kelly, chairman of Marshall Field in Chicago, ''the low-margin retailers, the discounters, have exploding business.'' Filene's, the prominent discounting chain that originated in Boston, is experiencing sales increases, according to its chairman, Merwin F. Kaminstein, although he was among those who would not divulge sales figures or percentage increases. ''Consumer confidence is high in New England,'' he said. ''Unemployment is lower here than the rest of the country. We have not had to increase our advertising. More important, the gap between the time department stores get merchandise and the time we get it is narrowing. We are attacking the same customer.'' What exactly, then, is selling? The trend that retailers noticed last summer seems to be continuing. Replacement merchandise - that is, basic styles bought when garments wear out - have been most hurt. Moderate-priced clothing is being called a disaster area, as is lower-priced sportswear. Expensive evening wear continues to do well, however, as does clothing that qualifies as new and exciting fashion. While some retailers maintain that designer sportswear has lost its sales cachet, a number of others find that their strongest results for the third quarter were in that area. Designers that appear to have fared well during the last three months include Perry Ellis and Calvin Klein, especially their overcoat divisions; Gloria Sachs, Blassport and Blass; Zoran, Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco Ferre; Evan Picone's higher-priced sportswear, and Ralph Lauren, who is making inroads with his more casual clothing. At Bloomingdale's alone, sales of Lauren designs, though not the high-priced line, increased 30 percent during the third quarter. Some Brand Names Fare Poorly On the other hand, most of the designers listed have experienced increases of no more than 6 percent in sales and some well-known brand names are doing poorly. For example, during the first 22 days of October the Missoni line at Bloomingdale's was down 80 percent from the year before. If retailers have been marking down more extensively than before, why is women's wear still not selling? According to some retailers, the answer is that people would simply rather not buy regardless of price reductions. ''Consumer confidence is down,'' said Joseph E. Brooks, chairman of Lord & Taylor. ''They are only buying in season and only if they need it. We have reached a period where people want to be debt-free and are buying less on credit. The consumer has not benefited from the surge in the stock market or by the drop in interest rates. The tax rebates did not go into the auto industry or housing or into clothing. Never has so much money been placed in money-market funds. People do not want to spend. They want to save.'' Despite all this gloom and doom, some retailers can manage to poke fun at the situation. The running joke among leading retailers is that someday a store may be able to run an advertisement saying: ''One week only: Everything in the store at regular price.''

467-> HOW MANHATTAN DEMOCRATS PICK STATE SUPREME COURT CANDIDATES
To the Editor: The upcoming elections for the New York State Assembly and Senate provide an excellent opportunity for voters to ask candidates why no progress has been made to reform the court system of this state. All experts agree that New York has an inefficient, wasteful, overlapping court structure in need of streamlining and simplification. Some members of the Legislature have introduced a constitutional amendment to consolidate the courts and to institute a system of merit selection for all judges of the newly merged courts. This effort has been supported by the Governor, the Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals and a large number of civic and goodgovernment groups, including the League of Women Voters and the Committee for Modern Courts. Our association urges that voters ask candidates what they have done or intend to do to treat our ailing court system. Court reform can be an election issue, if voters show their concern. LOUIS A. CRACO, President, Association of the Bar of the City of New York, New York, Oct. 8, 1982

468-> COMPANY NEWS; Chrysler May Add To Foreign Parts
The Chrysler Corporation is considering a more than 300 percent increase in the quantity of foreign parts in Chrysler cars by 1990, a company official said. A Chrysler engineering staff memorandum says the ''expressed objective'' of J.D. Withrow, company vice president for engineering, ''is to increase the foreign content of our vehicles from the current 7 percent to as much as 25 percent by 1990,'' The Detroit Free Press reported. The memo, written in January, reports on a meeting of top Chrysler executives who discussed the ''higher quality'' and ''higher technological content'' of Japanese cars, according to J.L. Sauter, its author.

469-> AROUND THE WORLD; 6,000 Salvadoran Troops Move on Rebel Positions
Officials said that about 6,000 Salvadoran troops moved on rebel positions in northern El Salvador today while 2,000 Honduran soldiers lined up across the border to block escape. Local commanders in Chalatenango's capital, which is 42 miles northeast of San Salvador, reported heavy combat north to the Honduran border, where guerrillas hold 10 towns. But the commanders said the operation was advancing slowly. No casualty reports were available. In San Vicente province, leftist guerrillas dynamited a power line near an electrical dam, leaving three-quarters of the nation without power, including the capital.

470-> G.O.P. LACKS VOTES ON EARLY TAX CUT, PRESIDENT IS TOLD
Republican Congressional leaders told President Reagan today that their party lacked the votes in the House of Representatives to speed up the 1983 tax cut by six months, a possibility mentioned yesterday by Mr. Reagan as a means of stimulating the economy. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee and Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois also told reporters after meeting with Mr. Reagan that they expected Congress to demand cuts in the President's proposed military budget and to reject Mr. Reagan's renewed call for further reductions in nondefense spending. The Republican leaders declined to say how bluntly they had put this bad news to the President in their private one-hour meeting. Election Losses Noted But their public message, as stated in an impromptu news conference on the White House lawn, seemed to be that Republican losses in the House in this month's elections had cost Mr. Reagan his ability to dictate economic policy to Congress and that its members intended to take a strong hand in the budget process, even if it meant defying the President's economic philosophy. Senator Baker, the Senate majority leader, said he intended to meet with House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Democratic leader, to devise a public-works job program, probably to be financed by a 4-cent increase in the Federal gasoline tax. The President has been told by Martin S. Feldstein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, that the road rebuilding plan could hurt employment because the higher gasoline tax would take money away from other businesses. (Page D16.) A Congressional aide said that Senator Baker's optimistic statement about the drafting of a bipartisan job bill for consideration in the special session of Congress, which starts Nov. 29, suggested that Senator Baker got a signal today from Mr. Reagan that he would go along with such legislation. On another sensitive matter, Representative Michel, the House minority leader, acknowledged today that the Republicans lacked the muscle to deal with restructuring the Social Security system during the special session. He said he intended to press the Democrats to complete action on Social Security by Easter. The Congressional aide said that Representative Michel and Senator Baker had discussed their differences with Mr. Reagan firmly but politely. The aide remarked: ''They said to the President, 'What we've been told by the electorate is we've got to do something about curtailing unemployment and creating jobs. We've got to send a signal that we know how to tackle these problems. We can't afford to sit back and let the Democrats seize the initiative.' '' Publicly, both men linked their doubts about the tax-cut speedup to its effect on the budget deficit. White House officials acknowledge that moving the 1983 tax cut to Jan. 1 from July 1 would reduce tax revenues by an estimated $14 billion during those six months. But Mr. Reagan asserted yesterday that such a step ''would further stimulate the economy.'' Today, however, Senator Baker said that another increase in the deficit could, by expanding the Government's demand for credit, set off another upward spiral in interest rates. ''Interest rates are like a hand at our throat,'' Senator Baker said. Representative Michel also said he had painted for the President a bleak picture of the speedup plan's political chances in Congress. ''Well, I just said that we don't have the votes,'' Representative Michel responded when asked what he had told Mr. Reagan. Later, Larry Speakes, the deputy White House press secretary, seemed to suggest that Mr. Reagan wanted to back away from the idea. ''This tax bill story has gotten somewhat out of hand in the press,'' he said. ''The President has not made a decision.'' The President's only comment on the matter, made during a picturetaking session, seemed confusing. ''I think cutting taxes in a recessionary situation such as this one - I mean, of raising taxes - that would be, in effect, raising taxes,'' Mr. Reagan was heard to say, in response to a question, before his voice trailed off. Mr. Speakes said the President had not decided whether to support an increase in the gasoline tax. Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis is promoting such an increase to help finance the creation of 170,000 jobs in a program to rebuild the nation's bridges and highways. Mr. Speakes said the President was still firmly committed to the increased defense appropriation in his budget for the fiscal year 1983.

474-> GENSCHER IS PICKED BY GERMAN PARTY
A meeting of the Free Democratic Party reelected Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher as its chairman today after hearing criticism of the way in which he led the party into a new coalition with the Christian Democrats. After a day of occasionally heated debate, delegates to the liberal party's 33d congress gave Mr. Genscher 222 votes and his challenger, Uwe Ronneburger, the candidate of the party's left wing, 169. Although Mr. Genscher won by a relatively comfortable margin, the vote underscored persistent differences among the Free Democrats that could not be masked by considerable polemics about the need for party unity. A motion approving Mr. Genscher's decision to abandon Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's Social Democratic-led Government in September and switch alliances to the conservative Christian Democrats passed only narrowly, by 210 votes to 181. Party in 'Deep Crisis' Another motion condemning the manner in which Mr. Genscher brought about the alliance change, without consulting the party's base, passed easily with a show of hands. A separate vote implicitly criticized the new Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, for failing to include Gerhart Baum, the party's Interior Minister under Mr. Schmidt, in the new Government. ''The liberal party will die if it bargains away its identity,'' the popular Mr. Baum warned in a fighting speech to the 400 delegates from all over West Germany. Expressing a sentiment echoed by many other speakers, he said that the Free Democrats were ''in a deep crisis within and without.'' The continuing divisions within the Free Democratic Party and clear signs of demoralization among the delegates are dark omens as the party faces a challenge to its survival in national elections that Chancellor Kohl has pledged to hold on March 6. In recent state elections the party has failed to win the 5 percent of the vote needed for parliamentary representation, and it has been displaced as the nation's third party by the Green @antinuclear movement. Two recent opinion polls, however, have shown the Free Democrats improving their share of the popular vote. First Challenge to Genscher The candidacy of the 55-year-old Foreign Minister appeared to draw little deep enthusiasm, and his 70-minute keynote speech before the vote was only tepidly applauded. Economics Minister Otto Lambsdorff, a strong Genscher backer, asked the delegates, ''Who would vote for us if we let this chairman fall?'' Mr. Ronneburger, the party's leader in Schleswig-Holstein, ran against Mr. Genscher to focus discontent over his leadership and to prevent dissidents from leaving the party. It was the first time that Mr. Genscher had been challenged for the chairmanship since he took over the party from Walter Scheel in 1974. In a speech in which he almost apologized for running, Mr. Ronneburger accused Mr. Genscher of damaging the credibility of the Free Democrats, who were elected in 1980 along with Mr. Schmidt and the Social Democrats. Without calling for a withdrawal from the new coalition, Mr. Ronneburger said that in January the Free Democrats should consider their options again in light of the elections, and he demanded that in the next government the party regain the Interior Ministry portfolio. 'Image of a Divided Party' Acknowledging that the Free Democrats presented ''the image of a divided party,'' Mr. Genscher attributed the breakup of the Schmidt coalition to the left wing of his Social Democratic Party, which the Foreign Minister said had betrayed Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Genscher devoted a large part of his speech to West Germany's foreign policy, suggesting implicitly that his defeat at the congress would put it at risk. But to appease the party's vocal left wing, the Foreign Minister promised that he would give the Free Democrats a special report before any decision was made on deploying American medium-range missiles next year.

476-> AROUND THE NATION; Witness Says Baby Sitter Told Sister She Killed 5
Christine Falling, a 19-year-old baby sitter accused in the deaths of three children, told her sister at a meeting last July in a Tallahassee mental health facility that she had killed five children who died in her care, an agent in the Florida Department of Law Enforcement testified today. The agent, Jerry Harrison, said in pretrial deposition hearings here that Miss Falling's sister, Carol Phillips, made the disclosure at a meeting with state and Taylor County investigators on Aug. 23. He said the meeting took place at the mental health unit of Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical Center, where Miss Falling was undergoing psychiatric evaluation. She is to go on trial Dec. 14 in Perry on a first-degree murder charge in the death of 8-month-old Jennifer Daniels, who died in July 1981 while at a Perry grocery store with her mother and Miss Falling. She is also charged with the deaths of two Blountstown children and is scheduled for trial in Calhoun County on Jan. 24. Charges have not been filed in the two other deaths.

479-> JERSEY'S SENATE REJECTS AN INCREASE IN THE SALES TAX, KEEPING IT AT 5%
A bill that would have increased New Jersey's sales tax by 1 percentage point, making it 6 instead of 5 percent, failed in the State Senate tonight despite hours of negotiations by party leaders. The proposed tax increase was intended to offset a predicted $150 million budget deficit. The bill, which would have raised $290 million over a full year, received 18 votes, with 21 votes needed for passage. Senate President Carmen A. Orechio, a Democrat from Nutley, who voted against the bill, kept the voting machine open for more than an hour to give backers of the measure time to try to persuade their colleagues to provide the votes needed for passage. The Assembly minority leader, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Republican from Scotch Plains, who was a co-sponsor of the bill, said the Democratic majority had promised him seven votes for the measure but delivered only five. Democratic Votes Missing There were 13 Republican votes for the bill. If the Democrats had provided the seven promised votes, he said, the Republicans would have come up with the 21st vote. The defeat of the sales-tax increase, despite Governor Kean's pledge to sign it, was a victory for those in favor of increasing the state income tax for people earning more than $50,000 a year. While there could be another attempt to pass the sales-tax increase, attention has now shifted to the income tax, which has bipartisan support in the Senate. Assembly Speaker Alan J. Karcher, a Democrat from Sayreville, who is a sponsor of the income-tax increase, said he will post his bill for a vote in the State Assembly on Thursday. The Joint Appropriations Committee met at 10:40 P.M., after the failure of the sales-tax boost, to release Mr. Karcher's bill and the Senate version of the income-tax bill, which was introduced earlier this year by Senator Wayne Dumont, a Republican from Phillipsburg. Graduated Tax on Earnings The income-tax bill would retain the present 2 percent tax on gross incomes up to $20,000 annually, and 2.5 percent on incomes between $20,000 and $50,000. However, it would increase the tax to 3.5 percent on incomes over $50,000; 4.5 percent on earnings over $60,000; 5.5 percent on earnings over $80,000 and 6.5 percent on earnings over $100,000. The new income-tax schedule, if enacted, would raise $330 million on an annual basis. Governor Kean, who has announced a package of budget cuts designed to reduce state spending by $150 million starting Jan. 1, unless the Legislature comes up with more revenue, has not closed the door on the income-tax increase. But he has said he believes it will hurt the state's economy and slow programs designed to attract new industry and create new jobs.

480-> Ginnie Mae Suit by U.S.
The Justice Department sued a Puerto Rican mortgage company today charging that it had defrauded the Government National Mortgage Association of more than $2 million. Attorney General William French Smith said that the loss was the largest ever suffered by the Government-owned corporation, commonly known as Ginnie Mae, in the history of its mortgage-backed securities program. The Government's charges were contained in a civil suit filed in San Juan against James T. Barnes of Puerto Rico Inc., James T. Barnes & Company, the Midland Mortgage Company, and various officers, directors, shareholders and related entities. James T. Barnes of Puerto Rico Inc. was an issuing mortgage banking company in the mortgagebacked securities program. The Justice Department charged that the defendants had defrauded the Government by engaging in false practices that forced Ginnie Mae to pay out under its guarantees. The Puerto Rican-American Insurance Company was also named a defendant. In a separate action, the department filed a proposed consent decree that would end its civil antitrust suit against two manufacturers of paper used in magazine and book publishing. The two defendants in the suit who agreed to the decree are British Columbia Forest Products Ltd. of Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Mead Corporation of Dayton, Ohio. The Government said that the civil suit, which was filed on Aug. 17, 1978, charged that the acquisition of the Blandin Paper Company by British Columbia Forest Products reduced competition in the coated groundwood paper business in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.

481-> Inferno Is Closed For Back Taxes
The Internal Revenue Service halted the operation of the Phoenix Inferno of the Major Indoor Soccer League today because of the franchise's failure to pay more than $110,000 in back payroll taxes. Four I.R.S. officers served papers on General Manager Norm Sutherland, confiscated all the cash in the team offices and padlocked the doors. The I.R.S. and the Arizona Department of Revenue recently placed liens on the franchise's financial and property holdings. I.R.S. officials said the club owes $110,975 in back payroll taxes. The M.I.S.L. office in Philadelphia has guaranteed the Phoenix players their pay Wednesday. Officials of the club said it planned to play here Friday night against San Diego.

482-> Dow Climbs by 5.52, to 1,024.28
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.52 points, to 1,024.28 yesterday, after having fallen 38 points in the three previous sessions. Although issues that declined in price slightly outnumbered advancing stocks, investor sentiment was aided by a slight recovery in video game stocks. Turnover contracted to 63.1 million shares from Friday's 86.4 million. Warner Communications, trading more than 2.4 million shares as the volume leader, rose 1 1/2, to 36 1/4. Last week, it plummeted 19 5/8 points after the company said that fourth-quarter profits would run below expectations, reflecting sales of its video game cartridges and coin-operated arcade games. In February, Warner's shares traded at a record price of 63 1/4 - up from 1 7/8 eight years earlier. Mattel, another major producer of video games, gained 1 5/8, to 18 3/8. Mattel tumbled 7 1/4 points on Friday, following the company's statement that it would show a loss for the final quarter. The chilling news from two of Wall Street's recent favorites had the effect of casting a pall upon the entire market late last week. Blue Chips Move Up However, a number of prominent blue chips - the stocks that have been favorites of institutional investors since midsummer - moved higher. Among components of the Dow industrials, there were gains of more than a point each in International Business Machines and the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. Chrysler gained 1/4, to 14 1/2, after striking employees of the automobile maker in Canada approved a new contract. Federal Express dropped 3 points, to 69 3/4. The company said it expects profits for the recently ended November quarter to at least equal, or exceed slightly, the profits a year earlier of 95 cents a share. Federal Express, which does not pay a cash dividend, has displayed strong earnings growth in recent years. Payless Cashways fell 2 1/2, to 43 1/2, after disclosing plans for a public offering of 700,000 shares. Proceeds will be used mainly for a proposed acquisition. Precious-metal stocks, reflecting higher prices for gold bullion, were strong. ASA Ltd. rose 2 5/8, to 65 5/8. Brokerage issues generally moved ahead. Merrill Lynch gained 3/8, to 63. Meanwhile, a call option to buy Merrill's stock at a set price of 30 until the contract expires next month rose a point, to 33 5/8. In early August, when the stock was trading at 21 1/4, this option sold at 7/8. U.S. Home fell 2 1/4, to 22 7/8. The decline was attributed partly to uncertainty about November's new-order rate for the home builder. Shaklee Corporation dropped 2 3/4, to 37, in response to reports of a Federal Trade Commission investigation of a possible violation of a 1974 consent order. In over-the-counter trading, Reeves Communications plummeted 8 1/4 points, to 29 1/2. The company said it expects earnings for the current quarter and for the fiscal year ending next June 30 to run about the same as results a year earlier. The Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.52, to 233.33. On the American Stock Exchange, Bowne & Company dropped 1 1/8, to 16 1/4, responding to a published report that the company faces increased competition in the financial printing field. The Amex market value index gained 0.93, to 335.30.

485-> Allied to Purchase Majority of Bendix
The Allied Corporation said yesterday that it would proceed with its purchase of a majority stake in the Bendix Corporation and a 39 percent interest in the Martin Marietta Corporation, following a Justice Department decision clearing the way for the $2 billion takeover. The department said it had told the companies that it had completed an investigation of the transactions and had decided not to challenge them on antitrust grounds. Allied's chairman, Edward Hennessy Jr., said that he was ''very pleased'' by the Government's decision and that his company would proceed with the proposal to buy most Bendix shares and a 39 percent stake in Marietta on Dec. 21. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Allied closed at $33.75, down 37 1/2 cents. Bendix closed at $80.75, up $1.125; its stock had traded at around $60 in mid-September. Allied and Bendix officials also scheduled stockholder meetings for Jan. 31 to formally approve the second phase of the takeover. A four-way merger war began Aug. 25 when Bendix's chairman, William M. Agee, began a hostile takeover bid for Marietta, a Bethesda, Md., missile maker. Marietta resisted and began a counteroffer for Bendix. The United Technologies Corporation and Allied later entered the fray with competing bids for Bendix. A peaceful settlement was negotiated Sept. 24 after Bendix and Marietta wound up owning huge chunks of one another's stock but with neither able to exercise effective control. Allied, a chemical and oil concern based in Morris Township, N.J., agreed to acquire Bendix, an automotive parts and aerospace electronics company based in Southfield, Mich., for $2 billion in securities. The agreement also provided for Allied to own a 39 percent stake of Marietta but with restricted rights for 10 years to sell or vote the shares or buy more shares.

486-> Walter Reade Sues Columbia Pictures
The Walter Reade Organization said yesterday that it had filed suit against Columbia Pictures Industries, a Coca-Cola Company subsidiary that owns 30.9 percent of Reade's stock and has two directors on its board. The suit follows the announcement Tuesday that Columbia would support the effort by Michael S. Landes and Albert Schwartz, cochairmen of RKO Century Warner Theaters, to acquire control of Reade. Mr. Landes and Mr. Schwartz, who own several companies that together control more than 140 theater screens in the New York area, already own 11.1 percent of Reade's shares. Under their agreement with Columbia, Mr. Landes and Mr. Schwartz said earlier, the motion picture company would obtain a 50 percent interest in a joint venture to own and operate certain Reade properties. Reade operates 10 theaters in New York, including the Ziegfield, Coronet, Baronet, New Yorker and Waverly, as well as one suburban theater. Columbia is the largest shareholder in Reade, which is traded regionally over the counter. Reade emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 20 months ago. Reade seeks an injunction to prevent Columbia from buying more shares. Last week, Walter Reade filed suit against Mr. Landes and Mr. Schwartz, RKO Century Warner and their two other theater companies, seeking to enjoin the defendants from acquiring control of Reade. Columbia declined to comment on the suit, which seeks a Jan 7. hearing on a motion for an injunction.

487-> Blackledge Ponders Pros
Todd Blackledge, Penn State's quarterback, said today that he would turn professional next year instead of playing one more season for Penn State if he were to be selected in either the first or second round of the National Football League draft in April. ''I don't think I would be likely to go pro as a third-round draft choice or lower if I knew I would be higher the next year with one more season at Penn State,'' Blackledge said. Blackledge will earn a bachelor's degree in May, meaning that he will be a graduate student playing football if he remained at Penn State in 1983. He has one more year of college football eligibility because he was red-shirted as a freshman in 1979, when he was injured. National Collegiate Athletic Association rules state that a player has four years of eligibility in a span of five consecutive years.

488-> THE REGION; Kean and 7 Mayors Discuss Taxes
Governor Kean met with seven urban mayors today to gather support for a tax package to avert $150 million in state budget cuts due to take effect next week. The mayors proposed a 5 percent sales tax on gasoline that would expire when the Federal gasoline tax increase takes effect April 1 and an increase in the state income tax to 3 percent on incomes above $50,000. They also proposed an increase in the state sales tax of from 5 percent to 6 percent and a rise in liquor taxes, which comes before the State Legislature for a vote tomorrow. Mr. Kean said the new proposals were ''worthwhile discussing,'' but he did not endorse them. Attending the meeting were Mayors Arthur Holland of Trenton, Kenneth A. Gibson of Newark, Gerald McCann of Jersey City, Frank X. Graves of Paterson, Thomas Cook of East Orange, Steven Capiello of Hoboken and Dennis Collins of Bayonne. Mayor Randy Primus of Camden spoke with the Governor by telephone.

489-> TV: KIRK DOUGLAS ROLE
''REMEMBRANCE OF LOVE,'' NBC's television movie at 9 this evening, is an unsettling experience for reasons having nothing to do with the intentions of the producers. Harold Jack Bloom's script uses - and that is the precise word - the 1981 World Gathering of Holocaust Survivors in Israel as the basis for a romantic melodrama. The result is questionable entertainment drenched in facile sentimentality. In one of his rare television appearances, Kirk Douglas plays Joe Rabin, a New York widower who was born in Poland and spent time in the Auschwitz concentration camp. He is going, somewhat reluctantly, to the survivors gathering with his daughter, Marcy (Pam Dawber), an aspiring writer. By means of flashbacks, we learn that Joe is troubled by thoughts of a woman named Leah, from whom he was separated during World War II. She had been pregnant with his child. In Israel, Joe finds survivors from all over the world trying to make contact with people they had known during the war. Urged on by Marcy, he begins making inquiries about Leah. The chances of finding her would seem dim but, suddenly and quite unbelievably, she walks past him in a government office. Now an attractive middle-aged woman, played by Chana Eden, she tells him that she is married and has been living in Israel since the war. Joe and Leah seem set to resume their youthful romance. And at the same time, Marcy begins having an affair with an Israeli security officer (Yoram Gall). On one level, ''Remembrance of Love'' is a glossy advertisement for Israel, beginning in the New York offices of the El Al airline, continuing to the corridors of the Jerusalem Hilton and wandering off to some of the more popular tourist attractions. There are passing references to possible terrorist attacks but, for the most part, this a milk-and-honey image that is being sold. In case somebody missed the point, an ebullient Joe Rabin pounds his chest and exclaims: ''What a country! I came here old. Now I feel young!'' Then, of course, there is the subject of the Holocaust. The romantic melodrama keeps switching to the ceremonies connected with the world gathering, and the material never fails to be profoundly moving. But in this instance, the use of the material comes too close to seeming only a convenient device for generating stock moments of drama. It is a bit too easy, too calculating. In addition, there is an underlying righteousness of tone that rings ever so slightly hollow, following the last year's events in Lebanon and the questions being raised about the role of Israel, being raised no least by the Israelis themselves. ''Remembrance of Love'' is just too crafty by half. It is rarely more than pedestrianly predictable, right down to noting that Joe's dead wife was not Jewish, a neat ploy to widen the potential for audience identification. The subject of the Holocaust deserves, indeed demands, a far more sensitive context than this romantic contraption.

490-> 10 Nations Join African Bank
Ten non-African countries today joined the African Development Bank, allowing it to raise lending for development projects. The 10 countries, mostly from the West, took an 18.3 percent stake, and 24 more hope to become members soon, officials said. Wila Mung'Omba, a Zambian who is the bank's president, said the bank's authorized capital would be increased to $6 billion from the current $2.7 billion. Officials said the bank aimed to approve loans totaling $7.26 billion between 1982 and 1986. Kebby Musokotwane, Zambian Finance Minister and chairman of the bank, said the per capita income growth of half the bank's African members had fallen in recent years.

491-> White-Collar Cuts by Ford
The Ford Motor Company is planning to cut some management-level jobs and downgrade others in product development to save money and improve communications, a spokesman for the auto maker said. The number of jobs involved in the reorganization, Ford's first major move to cut white-collar costs since it reduced wages and benefits in March, has not been determined, James Olson said. The spokesman said the changes were not expected to spark widespread layoffs, and staff cuts over a four-year period would come through attrition. Top Ford executives - vice presidents and higher - will not be affected, but he said the changes would touch middle managers in all areas of future product development: car engineering, body and assembly, power train and chassis, truck operations, the electrical and electronics division and climate-control division.

492-> FRANKFURTER PAID TRIBUTE AS CITY COLLEGE REMINISCES
Felix Frankfurter - Supreme Court Justice, lawyer, scholar, mentor and a graduate of City College's class of 1902 - was honored yesterday by his alma mater at a luncheon marking the centenary of his birth. The occasion consisted largely of reminiscences, as former Frankfurter clerks recalled the late jurist as a man of brilliance, curiosity, exuberance and loyalty. The occasion also served to link City College's storied past with its continuing role as educator of America's aspiring immigrants. The 14-year-old Frankfurter enrolled at City College, then an allmale school of less than 4,000 students at Lexington Avenue and 23d Street, in the fall of 1897, three years after he arrived in America unable to speak any English. Like so many of his classmates, he was poor but bursting with enthusiasm. Similarities to Frankfurter's Day Now, with nearly half of its students foreign-born, City College, though much larger, has in some ways returned to the kind of school Frankfurter encountered. For this reason, his many accomplishments - as a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, counsel for Sacco and Vanzetti, teacher of generations of lawyers, confidant of Presidents, and one of the nation's most noted jurists -are of far more than historical interest here. ''Many of us here at the college feel very close to this Felix Frankfurter,'' said Haywood Burns, vice provost and dean for urban and legal programs, as he recalled Frankfurter's fight against bigotry and his commitment to justice. ''In so many ways, his life is emblematic of what this college stands for, how it has always opened the way through its commitment to excellence and to opportunity.'' It is a theme that Frankfurter, who entered City College when he was unable to muster the $100 tuition at Horace Mann School, was to reiterate. C.C.N.Y. as a Symbol ''In common with thousands upon thousands, C.C.N.Y. fills me with affection and gratitude for giving us an education, intellectual and moral, unsurpassed, I believe, by that afforded by any college in the land,'' he wrote to a friend in 1941. ''To me our college has been all these years not merely an alma mater. She has symbolized eloquently our democratic faith by recognizing that there must be no economic or racial or religious barriers to adequate opportunities for higher education.'' Throughout Frankfurter's life, his personality and his conservative approach to his role on the Supreme Court - usually characterized as ''judical self-restraint'' - earned him the admiration and enmity of many, and the debate continues unabated. In a recent intellectual psychoanalysis of Frankfurter, for instance, Prof. H. N. Hirsch of Harvard called him ''intense, nervous, arrogant, domineering,'' and ''a textbook case of a neurotic personality.'' Hailed by His Former Clerks There were, however, few dissenters from the Frankfurter faith at the luncheon. Instead, the speakers, including Dean Albert J. Rosenthal and Prof. Louis Henkin of Columbia Law School, represented another, equally impassioned breed: young men who were profoundly influenced as Frankfurter's law clerks. ''Felix Frankfurter was a lawyer's lawyer, a teacher's teacher, a judge's judge, but this was somehow all blanketed and saturated by F.F. as a man and as a friend,'' said Professor Henkin, who called him ''one of the most extraordinary and unique human beings of this or any other century.'' Among the guests was Frankfurter's 87-year-old sister, Estelle Frankfurter. Frankfurter, short of stature and infinitely energetic, was a familiar figure on the City College campus. He was vice president of his senior class, assistant editor of the school humor magazine, Quips and Cranks, and, as a star debater, led the Clionia Society to victory over its archrival, Phrenocosmia. He finished third in his class, and, at graduation, gave a talk entitled ''The Perversion of the Law.'' The Justice's career was retraced by Jerome Siegel, Thomas G. Karis and Kaikhosrov D. Irani of the City College faculty. There was also a display of Frankfurter memorabilia, including his senior year grades -nearly perfect in history and geometry, lower in philosophy - and a letter he wrote in 1903 declining a post as assistant tutor in arts. ''Having already entered upon the study of law, I cannot now break off without great loss to myself nor continue without violating an implied faith,'' he wrote. Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the City College historian, acknowledged that in some respects history had not treated Frankfurter kindly. Referring to the publication in recent years of the Justice's diaries and letters, which give instances of pettiness and sycophancy on Frankfurter's part, Mr. Schlesinger called some of the Justice's wounds ''self-inflicted.'' ''One of the problems with Frankfurter is that history has not yet provided a means of capturing the essence of a person's personality,'' Mr. Schlesinger said. ''Frankfurter's impact on his times was as much the result of his personality as of his opinions or his writings.''

493-> 4 Giants Are Named To Pro Bowl Team
Lawrence Taylor, Harry Carson, Mark Haynes and Dave Jennings of the Giants were named today to play in the Pro Bowl, all as National Football Conference starters. At the same time, their coach said he thought the voting procedure for the Pro Bowl ''is a farce, to a certain degree.'' Taylor was named as an outside linebacker for the second time in his two pro seasons. He was the only unanimous choice in either the National or the American Conference. Carson was picked as a middle linebacker (the teams use 4-3 defenses) for the fourth time in five years. Jennings will be the punter for the fourth time in five years. Haynes, a cornerback, was chosen for the first time in his three pro seasons. Another Giant, Brad Van Pelt, a five-time Pro Bowl outside linebacker, is a second alternate. Fun Game in Hawaii The Pro Bowl, matching all-star teams from the two conferences, will be played in Honolulu on Feb. 6, the Sunday after the Super Bowl. It is a fun game, especially because the players are allowed to take their wives, all expenses paid. More than that, the Pro Bowl rosters actually represent allconference teams as chosen by the coaches and players. Coach Ray Perkins of the Giants said he did not like the way the voting was done. On each club, there are two votes -one by the coaching staff and the other by the players collectively. They vote only for their conference team, and they cannot vote for members of their own team. ''All our guys who made the team are deserving,'' said Perkins. ''But once players make the Pro Bowl, then make it two years in a row, now they're good for eight years in a row. Whether you play against them or not, you vote for them.'' The Giants' votes came from separate meetings Monday of coaches and players. ''We try to give our players some direction,'' said Perkins, ''who's playing good, who's playing bad. We think it's important enough. Some clubs don't.'' Carson Likes System Carson did not agree with his coach that the voting was a farce. ''That could be the case in some instances,'' said Carson, ''but I don't think so in general. People recognize true talent when they see it. That's why Mark Haynes got in this year. ''At our meeting, we went over a list of everybody at each position. For instance, we asked the offensive linemen for their opinions on certain defensive players they played against, and we asked them about other offensive linemen. Everyone I voted for, I played against or saw him on film or on television.'' ''Bobby Jackson of the Jets should have made the American Conference team,'' said Taylor. ''Richard Todd should be in. But a lot of guys don't get in because maybe someone doesn't like them. Someone says, 'These guys beat us, so I don't want to see him in the Pro Bowl.' '' Eagles Pick 6 Giants But the Philadelphia Eagles, who took a 23-7 beating from the Giants three weeks ago, leaned in the opposite direction. The Philadelphia players voted for six Giants - the four who made the team, plus Gordon King at offensive tackle and Leon Bright as punt returner. The N.F.C. team has 20 players on offense, 17 on defense and three specialists. The only clubs that supplied more players than the Giants were the Dallas Cowboys with seven and the Washington Redskins with five. Joe Theismann of the Redskins was named the starting quarterback and Danny White of the Cowboys the alternate. Each will appear in his first Pro Bowl. The starting running backs are Tony Dorsett of the Cowboys and William Andrews of the Atlanta Falcons. Randy White, the Cowboys' defensive tackle, and Matt Blair, the Minnesota Vikings' outside linebacker, were named for the sixth consecutive year. ---- Neill Doubtful Against Eagles Bill Neill remained doubtful for Sunday's regular-season finale against the Eagles in Philadelphia, a game the Giants must win to preserve their faint playoff hopes. Neill, the starting nose tackle when healthy, is still not at full strength after arthroscopic knee surgery. ... The wide receivers Johnny Perkins (back spasms) and Floyd Eddings (bruised ribs) remained questionable. The linebackers Byron Hunt (bruised left wrist) and Mike Whittington (broken hand) were upgraded from questionable to probable. ---- Klecko Remains Sidelined Special to the New York Times HEMPSTEAD, L.I., Dec. 30 - Joe Klecko went into a defensive stance against a teammate today for the first time since his knee surgery last September. But when he lined up against John Roman, it was just a minimal workout, indoors in the weight-training room. Klecko remains out of Sunday's game at Kansas City, for which he was eligible to return off the injured-reserve list. ... Another all-pro, Marvin Powell, has been upgraded to ''questionable'' from doubtful for the game. Powell, the right tackle, has a sprained ankle. ... The Chiefs are likely to have their regular running backs, Joe Delaney and James Hadnot, available. ... The Jets are putting extra distance on Pat Leahy field goals and conversions. Normally, he kicks from 7 yards behind the line of center. But the holder, Pat Ryan, has stationed himself 8 yards back of the snapper, Joe Fields, in order to give Leahy more time to kick.

497-> TRANSIT SYSTEMS BARGAINING TO HOLD DOWN UNION GAINS
Many mass transit agencies around the country, operating in a poor economy and facing reduced Federal assistance, have begun this year to hold down workers' gains in bargaining with unions. In seeking concessions from unions, manaaement negotiators have concentrated on cost-of-living provisions, which create regular, and sometimes even quarterly or monthly, pay increases to keep pace with inflation. Some such clauses are decades old. Union leaders want the clauses kept because simple wage increases of 6 or 7 percent a year are often consumed by rises in the Consumer Price Index, a leading measure of inflation, while cost-of-living clauses, which are based on the index, protect real gains in living standards. Other cost savings won by operators involve the right to hire more part-time workers, to farm out some operations and streamline through new work rules. Union concessions, recently more and more common in industry, gained as a practice in the public sector in the late 1970's after tax-cutting and resultant tightening in local and state operating budgets. Mass transit agencies, which began receiving new, substantial Federal subsidies in the early 1970's, are experiencing austerity later than most public agencies did. Aid Is to End in 1985 Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis and Arthur E. Teele Jr., his transit administrator, worked out a policy of gradually eliminating Federal subsidies for transit operations by 1985, and that policy is now part of the Federal budget. This would eliminate a primary source of revenue for local systems, and they are using the policy change as a weapon against the unions. ''The cutbacks and threats of cutbacks have had a definite effect on negotiations,'' said Arthur Fitzgerald, a lawyer for the Cleveland Regional Transit Authority, which has won an end to cost-of-living increases, an 18-month wage freeze and affirmation of its right to use part-time workers. Similar changes have been won by transit agencies from the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority and Los Angeles's Southern California Transit District to agencies in Lynchburg, Va., and Spokane, Wash. The New York employees won yearly increases of 7 percent, 6 percent and 7 percent in base pay in each of three years, but management won new work rules, elimination of the cost-of-living clause and clearer control on overtime, according to Arthur Perfall, a spokesman for the transit agency. Mr. Teele, who heads the Urban Mass Transit Administration, reported an ''increased incidence of part-time bus drivers, reduced percentages of cost-of-living adjustments and other settlements designed to improve productivity.'' 'Settlements Rather Than Strikes' Jim LaSala, executive vice president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said, ''We have been getting settlements rather than strikes, but it has been mostly because our locals have been more reasonable in their demands.'' ''The reason why there have been no strikes to speak of,'' said Robert Manz, manager of transit in Springfield, Mass., ''is that when you have a job and are making $9.77 an hour in a community like ours, and in this economy, you use other strategies to fight, such as the courts.'' Unions have sought arbitration to wrap up difficult negotiations but have kept working. In Nashville, Mr. LaSala said, management ''forced an agreement at first for a full year at no pay increase,'' adding, ''Now they are trying to roll back the pay to 1979 levels.'' Among the cities that have rolled back, frozen or eliminated costof-living adjustments are, according to the records of the American Public Transit Association, Cleveland; Denver; Lynchburg, Va.; Nashville; New York City; Vancouver, Wash,; Clearwater, Fla.; Toledo; Portland, Ore.; San Diego; Jacksonville, Fla., and Salt Lake City. A Switch for Milwaukee This year Milwaukee persuaded its transit union to switch from monthly to quarterly cost-of-living adjustments. Using part-time employees is considered an important way to increase service at low cost. Richard S. Page, the general manager of the Washington, D.@C., transit system, said that his agency would press next year to raise the ceiling on part-timers, possibly as high as 35 percent of its work force. The system now has a 10 percent limit. In the nation's capital, bus drivers are paid $11.93 an hour, exceeding the New York City figure of $11.24 for subway motormen and $10.57 for bus drivers. ''Part-time drivers are especially useful at peak rush hours,'' said Albert Engelken, a spokesman for the American Public Transit Association. ''They need not be on the payroll in nonpeak periods.'' Transit officials say union leaders have never bargained vigorously for protection or benefits for part-timers. Labor leaders, instead of trying to block hiring of part-timers, have sought percentage ceilings. according to Mr. LaSala. New or expanded authority to use part-time workers has been won by managements in Gary, Ind.; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Peoria, Ill.; Kansas City, Mo.; South Bend, Ind.; Youngstown, Ohio; Los Angeles; Denver; Spokane, Wash.; Portland, Ore., and suburbs of Philadelphia and Chicago. The Losses for Los Angeles The pressures for cost reduction are obvious, said James Smart, a spokesman for the Los Angeles transit district. ''We have lost $20 million in Federal funds because of budgetary cutbacks,'' he said. ''We calculate that we could lose another $60 million over the next year, compared to what we would ordinarily expect from the Federal Government.'' L.A. Kimball, general manager of the Denver transit system, said: ''Cost-of-living clauses produced uncontrollable costs, and that made planning very difficult. Part-time workers increased the costeffectiveness of our workforce so that made part-time hiring a natural priority.''

500-> WOMEN GET ADVICE ON REPULSING AN ATTACKER
THE woman was walking home from a neighborhood store one evening when a man approached her from behind and suddenly gripped her elbow with a force that broke the skin and sent an arrow of pain coursing through her arm from shoulder to wrist. After taking a split second to assess the situation, she swiftly brought her forearm up and over his thumb and then swung her arm down behind his hand, breaking his grip. She ran a dozen yards away and screamed at the top of her lungs, frightening him off and attracting a crowd. If she had remained in his grip, screaming, he might have used his other hand to smash her face, swing her against a wall or to the ground. This and other simple, effective self-defense tactics have been taught to hundreds of women by a Memphis police lieutenant, who is angered by what he perceives as a nation that has given over its streets and parks to attackers and has forced its citizens to barricade themselves in their homes. On a recent swing through Fairfield County, Lieut. James A. Bullard demonstrated in a series of two-hour lectures, primarily aimed at women, strategies that have produced reliable results in numerous communities, including Memphis, the 14th largest city in the United States, where ''crime is practically nil,'' he said. The moves he teaches may merely ward off an assailant or they may disable him temporarily, maim him permanently or kill him. ''When you can't escape him, or the room he has you in, you'll just have to kill him,'' Lieutenant Bullard told his audience. A woman's weapons may be the stiffened fingers of one hand jammed into the attacker's trachea (a man's most vulnerable area), a ball point pen or a car key wielded backhand across the eyes. Lieutenant Bullard said he tries to keep ''the killing moves,'' as he called them, out of circulation. ''If they are widely publicized, it only follows that they will be less effective,'' he said. ''Attitude is the important thing,'' he contended. ''Women have been preconditioned to be victims by police departments, by rape crisis people, security firms, churches and worst of all, by loved ones. How often have you heard someone say, 'If you were dressed like that, no wonder you were attacked,' or 'Nine o'clock at night in a hospital parking lot, what did you expect?' '' ''What it amounts to,'' he said, ''is never park your car, avoid neighborhoods populated by people and never leave the house after 6 P.M.'' In a demonstration during the lecture, the lieutenant acts as the attacker and a female volunteer, trained in Memphis, the victim. The techniques are employed to physically unbalance a mugger, disconcert a man with a gun or knife, escape from a two-handed grip on the throat or break the wrist of someone grasping the shoulder of the victim's dress or jacket. Twelve years ago, Lieutenant Bullard was assigned by the Memphis chief of police to draw up a self-defense course for women in an effort to minimize crime. The lieutenant said he realized that the course, which was modeled after similar programs around the country, ''was doing the opposite of what it should. We were encouraging fear,'' he said. The course was changed to teach people how to resist, to get descriptions of attackers and cars, to get involved, and to get angry. ''When an offense is committed, be offended,'' he said. ''Never go with an attacker. If you go with him into the cornfield, you will be the only witness to his attack and he will be inclined to kill you. Even if he doesn't, and he returns you to the place where he abducted you, you remain a threat to him. ''In a close face-to-face confrontation,'' he said, ''clapping him over both ears with the palms of the hands will sound like a bomb going off in his head. Then push straight up under his chin with the heel of the hand and he will sprawl backward to the ground.'' Often an angry shout, ''What do you want!'' will send a would-be attacker packing, Lieutenant Bullard said. When a caller whispers obscenities over the phone, various remedies were suggested. Quietly depressing the button will cut him off without the thing he wants most, a response. Keeping him on the line while you find a loud, shrill whistle, then blowing it full blast into the transmitter has also proved effective, he said. Lieutenant Bullard spoke in the auditorium of the Greenwich Public Library, before an audience of women who work for major corporations, banks and municipal governments, and who had been invited there by the Stamford Area Commerce and Industry Association. He and his volunteers appeared as part of a comprehensive Self-Protection for Women project supported by the City of Memphis. An 88-page booklet, ''Looking Forward to Being Attacked,'' written by Lieutenant Bullard and illustrated with photographs, may be obtained by sending $6 to the Memphis Police Department, Memphis, Tenn. 38103. The booklet has been distributed in 31 states and several foreign countries, including Japan, Australia, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Egypt and Colombia.

501-> THE REGION; Do-or-Die Day For People, Propositions
Polls and pundits last week continued to predict down-to-the-wire races in some contests for governor and the United States Senate in the tristate region. In New York, however, Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, appeared to take a sizeable lead over his Republican opponent, Lewis E. Lehrman, as the week ended. But as Mr. Lehrman noted, most polls had shown Mr. Cuomo trailing in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in September. In New Jersey, Frank R. Lautenberg, the Democratic candidate for the Senate, had made up 18 percentage points on Representative Millicent Fenwick since September, and polls showed the two running almost even. A close finish was also projected in the Connecticut Senate race between Representative Toby Moffett, the Democrat, and Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the two-term Republican incumbent. Polls gave Gov. William A. O'Neill a good lead over Republican challenger Lewis B. Rome. Besides deciding major races, voters will cast ballots on several propositions, bond issues and local issues. They include: New Jersey Prison construction bond - $170 million to build two medium security prisons and to upgrade existing county and state facilities to relieve overcrowding. Nuclear freeze resolution - calls for a mutual United States-Soviet Union nuclear weapons freeze as a first step toward a balanced arms reduction and recommends that some of the money saved be used to reduce taxes. Similiar resolutions will be on ballots in nine states and the District of Columbia. Community development bond -$85 million for projects to revitalize older urban commercial centers and encourage business expansion in rural and developing areas. Connecticut Constitutional amendment - to keep or abolish the 18-member grand jury used to determine probable cause to indict a person accused of a capital crime which could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment. The grand jury would be replaced by a ''probable cause'' hearing before a judge. Nuclear freeze resolution - in nine towns. New York City Public utilities referendum - to decide whether to establish a municipal agency, the Public Utility Service, to buy and distribute low cost hydroelectric power from the new state generating plant at Niagara Falls. If approved, service would begin in 1985 and would use existing Consolidated Edison power lines. The agency would furnish slightly cheaper power by providing about 30 kilowatt-hours a month to households using about 250 kilowatt-hours. Suffolk County Non-binding proposition on nuclear energy - asks whether Suffolk should oppose issuance of an operating license for the Lilco nuclear plant at Shoreham until it undergoes a ''complete physical inspection and design review by Suffolk County.''

502-> WHAT'S NEW IN FOOD: A GOURMET BOOM; PEDDLING PATE IN PALO ALTO
With supermarkets fighting back in the fancy-food wars, some of the specialty stores are taking a new tack and branching out. Food shops like the Silver Palate, Dean & Deluca and Trois Petits Cochons were established in New York City with minimal capital in the 1970's. Now, buoyed by their success in the Big Apple, these three establishments - unlike many of their culinary counterparts - are marketing their own gourmet food products nationally. The Silver Palate, the Upper West Side shop that emphasizes American cuisine, has developed a line of 95 hand-prepared items - including chutneys, mustards and brandied fruits - which are shipped to 600 stores, including Marshall Field of Chicago and Macy's in California. Industry sources estimate that the shop's food line, in national distribution for just under two years, will gross $1.5 million in 1982. The Silver Palate was founded in 1977 by Julee Rosso and Sheila Lukins with a $21,000 investment. This year, its revenues, from retail sales, catering and wholesale operations, are expected to exceed $3 million. The growth continues in spite of deluxe prices: A 15-ounce jar of raspberry fudge sauce, for example, retails for about $10. Miss Rosso and Mrs. Lukins have further capitalized on the popularity of their food line with the publication last spring of ''The Silver Palate Cookbook,'' which has sold 150,000 copies and is now in its fifth printing. And the two partners do not believe they have tapped all their market yet. In fact, they are planning to export their foods to Tokyo, London, Paris, Hong Kong and South America, perhaps as early as next year. Dean & Deluca, a specialty food shop in SoHo, which was started with $150,000 in 1977, has joined the Silver Palate as one of America's leading gourmet wholesalers. Several months ago, Giorgio Deluca, the store's co-founder, signed a joint-venture agreement with A.&A. Richter Brothers, a leading food distributor based in Carlstadt, N.J., under which Richter markets Dean & Deluca's line of 93 imported products across the country. Since July, Richter has sold the shop's selection to some 800 specialty and department stores. Mr. Deluca estimates that one-third of Dean & Deluca's $8 million in total sales for 1982 will come from his wholesale import business, begun in 1980. Unlike the Silver Palate, which produces its own foods in America under its own label, Dean & Deluca prefers to import and sell merchandise. During several trips to Europe each year, Mr. Deluca chooses his products, which are then shipped to this country and marketed nationally under their original ''old world'' brand names. A small label on each item notes that it has been endorsed by Dean & Deluca. ''I'd rather be a food selector than a manufacturer,'' says Mr. Deluca. ''It's more honest that way. I can't pretend I know as much about olive oil as the Italians.'' Few people in America, however, probably know as much about pate as Jean-Pierre Pradie, co-founder of Trois Petits Cochons, a small Greenwich Village charcuterie. Four years ago, he and Alain Sinturel began shipping their homemade pates, which had gotten rave reviews in New York, to several stores around the country. Today, they oversee a 10,000-square-foot plant in New Jersey that hand-produces almost 750,000 pounds of pate annually, which are distributed to 2,500 American gourmet shops. Trois Petits Cochons estimates that it will gross more than $2 million from its wholesale pate business in 1982.

504-> BUYING A WOK, PLAIN OR FANCY: WHAT TO LOOK FOR AND AVOID
THE wok has been the basic Chinese cooking utensil for centuries. And why not? The design of this vessel is simple but superb: its generous, rounded shape permits quick searing of large or small quantities of food by stir-frying; it accomplishes deep frying with less oil than possible in a straight-sided pot; it accommodates steamer baskets of various sizes, and it may even be used to braise or smoke whole fish, chickens or large pieces of meat. The smooth, round shape simplifies cleaning and the metal conducts heat evenly and effectively. Chinese cooking pots were originally hammered cast iron, and while these are still available, today woks are usually made of lighter, less brittle spun steel. American manufacturers and distributors of cookware, however, are not content to leave well enough alone. Stores are filled with woks in various sizes, contours and finishes - to the bewilderment of shoppers. While a modification in the shape of a wok, flattening the bottom, might be necessary to make it more adaptable to an electric range, other changes are gimmicks that raise the price and certainly do not improve it. ''People are trying to make it more than it is,'' said Ken Hom, the chef and author of ''Chinese Technique'' in describing what's happening to the wok. Most Chinese cookbooks and instructors of Chinese cooking suggest buying the simplest, often the cheapest, carbon steel wok, the type that is frequently available in Chinatown supermarkets for around $7. They advise against purchasing woks packaged with accessories, since these are invariably too small and may be skimpy or even unnecessary. One wok set sold in department stores comes with 100 irrelevant bamboo skewers. When buying a wok, it is important to evaluate the material, size, shape and handles. Purchase the proper accessories separately. For gift-giving you may prefer a wok in a box, but pay close attention to the other utensils that may be included. Material. Spun carbon steel is the only material that is unqualifiedly recommended. It effectively conducts the high heat necessary for proper stir-frying. Since it will rust, the wok must be seasoned and cared for. Stainless steel is not an acceptable alternative since it does not conduct heat well. Nonstick finishes such as Mirro's Silverstone are inimical to wok cookery because they prevent the oil from coating the surface. Woks with smooth-gray protective finishes such as Calphalon are acceptable for Chinese cooking, do not require seasoning, will not rust, but cost close to $100. Calphalon is very heavy and the Magnalite Good Cooking wok is quite light. Copper woks lined with stainless steel or nickel are expensive and not recommended, because it is not advisable to allow them to stand empty over high heat the way most stir-frying recipes begin. The black anodized steel wok by Taylor & Ng is rust-proof and does not require initial seasoning, but it will react with acidic food and may eventually have to be seasoned. Mr. Hom, one of several instructors interviewed, was the only one who found the black steel wok acceptable, and he still preferred the traditional spun steel woks. Atlas Metal Spinning of San Francisco, which manufactures woks for restaurants, makes many of the better woks sold in Chinatown as well as some of those carried by Broadway Panhandler and Bazaar de la Cuisine. Taylor & Ng is another reliable brand, usually sold in gift sets, and the slightly lighter woks imported from Taiwan and sold under the Hoan label are also acceptable. Shape. The traditional wok with its rounded bottom that fits snugly into the opening of a Chinese brazier is less stable on an American gas or electric range. Some teachers, admitted purists, prefer roundbottom woks for all types of stoves. Others, including Karen Lee and Norman Weinstein, recommend that their students select woks with flattened bottoms, even for gas stoves, unless the pattern of their burner grids cradles the wok with some stability. Try taking a burner grid with you when you shop for a wok, to test for stability. If you buy a flat-bottom wok in Chinatown make certain it is smoothly molded and not ridged. A ring to accommodate the wok is often included with round-bottom woks, but these can raise the wok too far from the flame. Florence Lin of the China Institute feels a flat bottom is better than a ring. Eileen Yin-Fei Lo, who also teaches at the China Institute, customtailors her rings with metal shears. She also suggests keeping an extra ring or two on the kitchen counter for resting a hot roundbottom wok that has been removed from the flame. For an electric range she advises that two burners be kept going, one high and the other medium to low, and that the wok be moved from one to the other to regulate the heat. None of the Chinese cooking instructors interviewed approved of electric woks except as chafing dishes. ''Your average electric skillet works better,'' said Dr. Jacqueline Newman of Queens College, who specializes in Chinese cooking. One solution to the problem of fitting wok to stove is a Chinese stove, which can accommodate round-bottom woks from 12 to 24 inches in diameter, heating them with a roaring flame. These stoves are fueled by propane, however, so they can be used only where a propane tank can be installed on the outside of a building in a manner conforming to local fire department codes. A gas line runs through the wall and connects to the stove. K.O. Restaurant Supply, 99 Bowery, has one priced at $325. Size. The widely available 14-inch size is the most practical for home use since it will cook a small amount of food as well as larger quantities. It should be about four and a half inches deep so that a whole chicken will fit in it. Handles. Woks come either with a pair of small bent-metal handles, sometimes insulated with wood, or with a single long wooden handle on one side and a small metal one on the other. The long handle facilitates maneuvering the wok, but on a round-bottom wok may also make it less stable, especially if the wok is not used with a ring. Test it in the store by setting the wok on a flat surface, out of the ring. The long handle is fine on flat-bottom woks. Accessories. The ring is optional, but a domed cover is essential. Also necessary are one or two long-handled Chinese spatulas with wooden ends that are securely fixed, a shallow Chinese ladle with a generous bowl and a large-size skimmer (much larger than is normally included in sets), either the wood-handled Chinese variety or of stainless-steel. Small wooden or metal steamer racks or bamboo steamer baskets come in handy, too, as will a pair of extra-long cooking chopsticks and a bamboo brush for cleaning the wok. Accessories for wok cooking generally range in price from $1 to $7, except for the steamer baskets, which start at about $10. To season a carbon steel wok, first scrub it thoroughly inside and out with hot water, scouring pad and detergent to remove the protective film of nonedible oil. Keep washing it until you can dry it without discoloring a sheet of paper towel. Set it over high heat and when the wok is hot, apply about a teaspoon of cooking oil and rub it in all over the interior of the wok with a heavy wad of paper towel. The metal, expanded in heating, will actually soak up the oil and the wok will begin to blacken at the bottom. After rubbing the oil in, remove the wok from the heat and allow it to cool down. Repeat the heating and oiling once or twice more. The black spot on the bottom of the wok is desirable and with use it will expand until the entire wok acquires a black patina. Wipe off any excess oil, rinse the wok in hot water, dry it thoroughly, heat it again briefly and it is ready to use. After a wok has been seasoned, it should be rinsed in hot water immediately after each use, dried thoroughly and reheated briefly. Never scrub it with detergents or abrasives. ''A quick way to season a wok is to use it for deep frying,'' suggested Eileen Yin-Fei Lo. ''Make a batch of french fries before you start your Chinese cooking.'' Norman Weinstein of the Hot Wok advises owning two woks, one to be used for frying and the other reserved for steaming or cooking with large amounts of liquid so it will not have to be reseasoned constantly. B. Altman, 34th Street and Fifth Ave- nue, 689-7000. Although the cookware department is currently running a sale on fine Taylor & Ng round-bottom wok sets ($20 for two metal handles, $25 for the long wooden handle), the sales personnel tend to push gimmicky, no-stick and stainless-steel woks. Take advantage of the sale. Bazaar de la Cuisine, 1003 Second Avenue (53d Street), 421-8028. Four different round-bottomed steel woks, all with two small handles but two of them with wooden insulation, are priced from $22.95 to $32.95 depending on the number of accessories. No bargains but no nonsense either. The store has Taylor & Ng, Atlas and a good Hong Kong import. The heavy Calphalon wok is also available for $95. Bloomingdale's, Third Avenue at 59th Street, 355-5900. A somewhat limited inventory of woks includes Taylor & Ng boxed sets from $22.95 to $29.95, all carbon steel 14-inch with two handles, and all on sale. Flat and round-bottom styles are available. A simple three-piece set (14-inch carbon steel round-bottom wok with ring and cover) by Hoan is $14.94. Broadway Panhandler, 520 Broadway (Spring Street), 966-3434. Aside from the expensive Joyce Chen woks, which are not recommended, this shop carries round or flat-bottom carbon steel woks from Atlas, both 14 inches and both with two handles insulated with wood for $11.50. Covers, rings and other accessories are sold separately. Kam Man, 200 Canal Street, 571-0330. The woks sold on the lower level of this food market come in boxes suitable for gift giving. For $14.95 the 14-inch round-bottom steel wok with metal handles comes with a ring and cover, and the flatbottom style with a single wooden handle is $13.95. Macy's, Herald Square, 695-4400. Not counting electric woks, Macy's had no fewer than 16 different wok sets on display last week. Prices for 14-inch carbon steel woks range from $18, the sale price for a seven-piece Taylor & Ng singlehandle wok set (round bottom), to $40 for a set loaded with such items as potholders and booklets. The flat-bottom Magnalite wok with a gray finish is $92. Many of the woks appear to be discounted from the list price. You can't go wrong with either Taylor & Ng or Hoan or the wok labeled Macy's Own Brand, so it's a matter of deciding shape and handles and then comparing prices relative to the number of accessories. Pottery Barn, locations throughout the city. A serviceable carbon steel wok, 14 inches in diameter, is sold boxed with ring and cover for $14.95 in the round-bottom style with two insulated handles, and $19.95 for the flat-bottom wok with the single handle. The wooden handles are red. Quong Yuen Ching, 32 Mott Street, 962-6280. Several basic styles of woks are hung on display in this little import shop. Fourteen-inch round-bottom steel woks with two insulated handles are $11, including cover and ring, or $10 in the flat-bottom version without ring. The single wood-handle style is $14 for the round bottom with cover and ring and $13 for the flat bottom without ring. Wing Woh Lung Company, 50 Mott Street, 962-3459. This Chinatown food market stocks good-quality, utilitarian 14-inch carbon steel woks by Atlas Spinning in three styles: round bottom with metal handles ($6.95) or with a long wooden handle ($11), and one of the better flat-bottom woks in Chinatown with a wooden handle ($13.95). Basic accessories and utensils are also available. Zabar's, 80th Street and Broadway, 787-2000. The store has good steel woks in boxed sets by Taylor & Ng and Hoan at prices ranging from $13.95 to $27.95, depending on the accessories.

505-> LONG SHOT BY BOSSY GIVES ISLANDERS TIE
With 3 minutes 43 seconds left in the game tonight, Mike Bossy of the Islanders scored on a wobbly 65-foot shot to tie the Bruins, 1-1, in Boston Garden. Bossy's shot from just outside the blue line was not a strong one. He got just a bit of wood on it because it was rolling when he took a pass from Bryan Trottier. But the puck wobbled enough to confuse the goaltender, Pete Peeters. Peeters partly stopped it with his glove, but the puck continued on its way into the net. On the goal, Trottier registered his 500th career assist. Barry Pederson, a center, scored the Bruins' goal on a power play 12:17 into the second period. It was an exceptionally well played game with good checking, but Al Arbour, the coach of the Islanders, said: ''I'm glad to take the tie, but we still have a lot of work to do. We wasted too many scoring chances.'' ''They played a good game,'' said Bossy, who has 20 goals, ''but we're better than we played tonight. We're still making mistakes, and they're costing us.'' Roland Melanson, the goaltender for the Islanders, 31 shots and Peeters stopped 18. This was the second of three scheduled meetings between the teams. The Bruins won the first game last Thursday at Nassau Coliseum. The first period was well played, with the Bruins' forechecking bottling up the Islanders in their zone. The action in the second period was loose, but the third period was all tight-checking action, paced fast and with few whistle interruptions. The Islanders got off only four shots in the third period to the Bruins' 9. In the third period, a shot by Billy Carroll, a center for the Islanders, hit the post, and it looked so good for a few instants that the goal judge turned on the red light to signal a score, but the referee, Bryan Lewis, ruled it was no goal. In the scoreless first period, the Bruins took 13 shots on goal to the Islanders' 10. Boston dominated, keeping most of the action in the Islanders' end. Melanson made acrobatic saves on shots by Bruce Crowder, Marty Howe, Peter McNab and Craig MacTavish. Stefan Persson, an Islander defenseman, also made a save on one of McNab's shots The Islanders gave Boston a power-play opportunity and then proceeded to kill the penalty. Immediately afterward Clark Gillies stole the puck from Mike Milbury and got off two shots on net, with Peeters stopping both. The flurry of the Gillies attack got the Islanders going, and from there to the end of the period they skated and shot vigorously, intensifying their attacks on Peeters. The second period was livelier than the first before the play turned cautious and then became ragged and uneven. Melanson stopped a strong shot by Tom Fergus early in the period. The Bruins took a penalty at 6:41, Randy Hillier for tripping. Not only did the Bruins kill the penalty, but they also came close to scoring a short-handed goal when Pederson sailed in on Melanson and shot from close range. Melanson partly blocked the shot and Persson was there to knock away the puck. McNab's 500th Career Point But Pederson was not through. A few minutes later he did score, this time on the power play while Brent Sutter was in the penalty box for hooking. The play started with a passout from the left corner by McNab. The score was Pederson's seventh goal of the season and McNab's 500th career point in the National Hockey League. The Islanders now have won only 3 of their 12 games this month, lost 6 and tied 4. They had lost three in a row on the road. The Bruins now are 5-1-2 in their last eight games, with three consecutive victories at home. ---- Leveille in Montreal MONTREAL, Nov. 25 (UPI) - Normand Leveille, the Bruins' left wing who underwent surgery for a brain hemorrhage last month, has been moved from Vancouver General Hospital to Montreal Neurological Institute. Leveille, who is from Montreal, was in a coma for several days after collapsing in the Bruins' dressing room in Vancouver, British Columbia, Oct. 23. His condition is now listed as ''fair and very stable.''

506-> Walter J. Detmar Jr., 78, Dies; Retired City Building Official
Walter J. Detmar Jr., a retired director of building management in the New York City Public Works Department, who helped plan city receptions for dignitarities, died Wednesday at Catskill (N.Y.) Memorial Hospital. He was 78 years old and lived in Windham, N.Y. He was born on Staten Island and studied at Pratt Institute. He started working for the city as a draftsman in 1923, when the agency was known as the Department of Plant and Structures. Mr. Detmar, who was designated as keeper of the flags for City Hall and other public buildings, was called the Architect of the Grandstands by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Mr. Detmar retired in 1966. He is survived by his wife, Hazel; a son, Bruce, of Chester, N.J.; a daughter, Laura Brace, of Succasunna, N.J.; two brothers, Albert, of Staten Island, and Arthur, of Denver, and five grandchildren.

507-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Searle Appoints Head Of Its Sweetener Group
G.D. Searle & Company of Chicago has announced plans to form a separate business group to manage its Nutrasweet low-calorie sweetener and has named Robert B. Shapiro to head it. The formation of the group, scheduled for Dec. 1, ''shows we take this market very, very seriously,'' said Mr. Shapiro, who has been serving as vice president and general counsel at Searle. ''This could be our fast-growing product during the next several years.'' Nutrasweet is the trade name for the sweetener that is generically called aspartame. The sweetener was discovered 17 years ago and is one of the only nonsaccharin artificial sweeteners available. Although it has been used in 27 countries since 1979, its domestic use as a table-top sweetener and as an additive in dry foods was approved by the Food and Drug Administration only in July 1981. Searle is now awaiting approval for its use as a beverage sweetener. Aspartame contributed $13 million in sales to Searle in 1981, and analysts project sales of about $60 million this year, $500 million by 1986 and more than $1 billion by 1990, which would double the size of Searle. As president of the division, Mr. Shapiro will be responsible for managing the product's retail operations, including its use as a food additive. Searle's pharmaceutical/consumer products group will continue to market table-top sweetener products called Equal and Canderel, which contain Nutrasweet. The job will be a departure for Mr. Shapiro. After earning his law degree from Columbia University in 1962, Mr. Shapiro joined the Washington law firm of Poletti, Friedin, Prashker, Feldman & Gartner. In 1967, he joined the Department of Transportation as a special assistant to John E. Robson, now Searle's executive vice president. Mr. Shapiro taught law on the faculties at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and Northeastern University from 1969 to 1972, when he joined the General Instruments Corporation as vice president and general counsel. He joined Searle as vice president and general counsel in 1979.

508-> Genentech Sees Loss in Quarter
Genentech Inc. said today that it expects to report a third-quarter loss but that it still planned to break even by the end of the year. Genentech said that quarterly results could fluctuate widely but that ''these fluctuations, including this quarter's results, have no significance on the long-term growth and earnings of the company.'' In 1981 Genentech's net income, including tax credits, was $503,010, or 6 cents a share.

509-> KARLE AMEND'S SCENIC DESIGNS ON VIEW
THE business rather than the show of show business is the subject of ''Behind the Scenes: the Theater Art of Karle O. Amend,'' an exhibition at the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, through Feb. 28. Karle Amend worked as a scenic artist during the 1920's and 30's, designing sets for seven editions of Earl Carroll's ''Vanities'' and decorating the elaborate interiors of the S.Z. Poli chain of vaudeville houses in Connecticut. The designs, some of them refined Art Deco decors, some gaudy and rustic sets, fill the Vincent Astor Gallery of the library, which is at the northeast corner of Lincoln Center. It can be reached from Lincoln Center Plaza or from Amsterdam Avenue (No. 111), and weekends it is open Fridays and Saturdays from noon to 6 P.M. ''We're trying to show the typical production of the 20's and 30's, the honest craftsmanship,'' explained Thor Wood, chief of the Performing Arts Research Center, which mounted the exhibition. ''There are a lot of living rooms, because drawing-room comedy was what was being done.'' From Columbus to the East Living rooms, however, represent just a fraction of Amend's career. Born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1889, the son of German immigrants, he began as a magician, mimic and vaudevillian, part of a team that billed itself as ''German dialect, singing and dancing comedians.'' Among his memorabilia is a pince-nez, with a bulbous red nose attached. He first worked as a scenic artist in 1912, moving gradually from Columbus to the East Coast. The Columbus Sunday Dispatch of Jan. 30, 1916, featured Amend on an entertainment page he shared with the pianist and composer Percy Grainger and with Giulio Gatti-Cassazza, then head of the Metropolitan Opera. The article told of his transition from actor to scenic artist, an interest he developed from his hobby as a painter. In World War I, the designer was a pioneer in the art of camouflage, working as an instructor at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station where equipment was painted. After the war, he established his own scenic-construction studio in North Bergen, N.J. In 1925, he did his first work for Earl Carroll. Over the years, Amend designed for Carroll's ''Vanities'' such sets as a Cafe de la Paix in Paris, a factory yard, St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow, with its crazy-onion domes, a Scottish village and a Pullman sleeping car. For the ''Vanities'' of 1932, directed by Vincente Minnelli, he was paid $1,904 for four decors. Offer to Eleanor Roosevelt Despite the popularity of the ''Vanities,'' Earl Carroll went broke during the Depression and failed to pay his bills to Amend, who in turn fell into debt. Amend's business folded, and he tried to find work, writing to Eleanor Roosevelt and offering to turn his scenic studio over to the Work Projects Administration so that scenic artists could have a place to work. Until he died in 1944, the rest of his life was a desperate struggle to earn a living, reflected in such efforts as writing a minstrel show in the early 1940's. Among his last works were the sets for J.B. Priestley's ''When We Are Married'' and murals for the Coconut Grove nightclub in New York. Because Amend was an early member of the United Scenic Artists, the union donated the reception and modest catalogue for the exhibition.

511-> HUGH SHANNON, 61, SINGER AND PIANIST IN COCKTAIL LOUNGES
Hugh Shannon, a cocktail pianist and singer, died of cancer yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital. He was 61 years old. When Mr. Shannon returned to New York in 1963 after a career in Rome, Capri, Paris and the Virgin Islands, John S. Wilson wrote in The New York Times: ''Mr. Shannon's special musical area is the sophisticated torch song, with particular emphasis on the emotional problems of the wealthy and overprivileged. Sitting behind his piano, the choirboy gleam of his round face given a moradant cast by deepset, seemingly hooded eyes, he sings such songs of disenchantment as Cole Porter's 'Down in the Depth on the 90th Floor.' Mr. Shannon's specialties included the songs of Porter, Rodgers and Hart and Noel Coward.'' Mr. Wilson described Mr. Shannon's voice as ''aged in saloon smoke and worn to a glowing hoarseness.'' He was born in DeSoto, Mo., and attended the University of California at Los Angeles and the Harvard Graduate School of Business. During World War II, he was a lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. He married the late Betty Sundmark Dodero in 1951. Mr. Wilson called Mr. Shannon, ''the last of the great saloon singers'' and the progenitor of a new generation of piano singers. There are no survivors.

512-> AIR FLORIDA THINKS SMALLER
Air Florida, once known as the little airline that could, has discovered that sometimes it can't. Between 1977 and 1982, the carrier catapulted from an intrastate puddle-jumper in Florida to the third-largest airline serving Miami. In the process, it became a darling of Wall Street analysts, who cited it as a model of how to run an airline in the era of deregulation. But now Air Florida, like many other airlines, is fighting for survival. High overhead aggravated by rapid expansion, together with intense competition and a recession that has cut passenger travel have combined to bring the airline - whose only concern at one time was where to fly next - back down to earth. Air Florida's landing has been less than smooth, as shown by its financial results. Today the airline reported a third-quarter net loss of $33.7 million, capping a 12-month string of deficits totaling $83.4 million. The fourth quarter is not likely to be much better, the company acknowledged. Program of Restructuring In recent months, however, Air Florida has begun a program that dramatically reverses the expansive course it chose in its highflying days. If the strategy succeeds, the airline's management believes it can become profitable again as early as the first quarter of 1983. The expenses of the restructuring program have been partly responsible for the airline's recent series of losses. ''Remarkable progress has been made in restructuring the company to make it a smaller, more cost-efficient airline,'' Donald Lloyd-Jones, Air Florida's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement today. In 1979 and 1980, Air Florida achieved record profitability. Under the leadership of Eli Timoner, the chairman who founded the airline in 1972, and C. Edward Acker, the president who became head of Pan American World Airways in August 1981, Air Florida's revenues increased from $7.8 million in its fiscal year ended July 31, 1977, to $304 million for the calendar year 1981 (the first full year in its present accounting chronology). Wall Street responded to the carrier's growth, and its stock, traded over the counter, reached a high of 17 1/2 bid in last year's second quarter. It closed today at 2 1/16 bid. An Eye on Others' Schedules Mr. Acker was adept at studying the schedules of other airlines and finding niches for his own carrier, which often filled its planes by charging lower fares. For a time Air Florida was able to grow - particularly in the heavily traveled New York-to-Florida market - because other major carriers such as Delta Air Lines did not match its lower fares. But a major change came in late 1981 and early 1982 when Delta, which in the past had been reluctant to resort to discounting, set off a fare war that dropped the one-way weekday New York-Miami fare to as low as $77 from $135. Although Air Florida joined in the cuts, its executives complained that nobody could make money at such levels. Mr. Acker's forte, said Nick Babounakis of Oppenheimer & Company in New York, was making deals and selling seats. ''What he didn't do,'' the analyst added, ''was build up a very strong organization on the operating level.'' So Air Florida lost its fare advantage, and its smaller planes could not match the service of the wide-body jets that other carriers often threw into the market. Equipment and fuel costs mounted. Then Air Florida was hurt by the Washington plane crash that killed 78 people last January. Meanwhile, the entire aviation industry was beginning to feel the effects of the deepening recession. Fewer Planes, Fewer Workers To correct its overexpansion, the airline has reduced its fleet and cut its work force. The streamlined Air Florida now has a fleet of 17 aircraft, compared with 30 in March, with 30 percent fewer seatmiles available than last year. Now there are one-third fewer employees, down to 1,847 from 2,657. No further layoffs are expected, Mr. Lloyd-Jones said, but he added that there would probably be no major recalls either. ''The basic work force we have today will be the work force right through the winter,'' he said. Mr. Lloyd-Jones is concentrating on strengthening Air Florida's core and eliminating its peripheral assets -such as Western Airlines stock, which was sold last week - that are ''not necessary to operation of the airline.'' Even at its reduced size, Air Florida remains competitive with Eastern Airlines, said James Ashlock, an Eastern spokesman, ''but not to the extent they once were,'' He added: ''They still are a factor to be reckoned with. They're a pretty nice airline.'' Eastern and Pan Am (which declines to comment on its competitors) are Miami's leading air carriers. A Different Fare Strategy Another significant change in Air Florida's philosophy is a less aggressive position on air fares. The airline, once known for undercutting prices, recently joined other carriers in a 5 percent fare increase, effective next week. ''Clearly, at the present time, it is not our policy to be a fare cutter,'' Mr. Lloyd-Jones said. ''All you do when you cut fares is lower everybody's.'' Mr. Lloyd-Jones appears to be doing ''the right things,'' Mr. Babounakis said. ''The question is: Does he have enough time to turn it around?'' The Oppenheimer analyst said Air Florida's image, although strong in Miami, is weak elsewhere. The company now offers scheduled service to more than 40 destinations, including cities in Florida, the Northeast, the Caribbean, Central America and Europe. Air Florida also provides charter service to points in the United States, the Caribbean, Europe and Mexico. On Nov. 15 the airline will add service to Philadelphia and will increase the frequency of its Northeast-Florida and Miami-Caribbean/Central America flights. A second La Guardia-Fort Lauderdale nonstop flight will be introduced. The airline currently offers four flights between New York and southern Florida. Less Reliance on One Market This is fewer than last year, when about 40 percent of Air Florida's service was in the Northeast-Florida market. In a move to eliminate dependency on any one market - a lesson learned after the fare wars forced the carrier to sell seats in this market at less than cost - Air Florida has reduced those routes to just 19 percent of its total. Results in the fourth quarter are expected to be much like the rest of the year, but Mr. Lloyd-Jones said operating revenues should improve. He also suggested that profitability would turn around in December. Assuming that air traffic will not get better, that the nation's economy will not get worse and that fares will not go up beyond the November increase of 5 percent, Mr. Lloyd-Jones anticipates a profit for the first quarter of 1983. It's a far cry from Air Florida's halcyon days in a sunnier business climate. ''The world has changed,'' Mr. Lloyd-Jones said. ''One thing you have to realize is that, when it has changed, you have to live in that changed environment.''

513-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Protest Over Dailey
About 25 pickets were outside Chicago Stadium last night to protest the presence of Quintin Dailey, the Bulls' rookie guard, who has pleaded guilty to assaulting a student nurse at the University of San Francisco, where he was an all-American. Nettie Sabin, a spokesman for the group, said, ''We're here because we want to let everyone know we don't accept him as a role model for anyone.'' Earlier, about 100 members of the state and local chapter of the National Organization for Women protested outside the Bulls' offices. ... To thank the Golden State Warrior fans who supported him the last two National Basketball Association seasons, Bernard King placed ads this week in Bay Area newspapers. They read: ''With gratitude and appreciation for your support. Thanks for the memories.'' King was traded to the Knicks Oct. 22.

514-> THE REGION; Fiscal Fears Coming True
Until the Legislature flexed its muscle and finally passed expensive new programs over Governor Carey's objections in July, the lawmakers and the Governor fiercely debated the condition of New York's fiscal health. Legislators, with programs to protect, contended that it was fair; Mr. Carey insisted that it was poor and would get worse if the lawmakers had their way. Last week there was more evidence that Mr. Carey may have been closer to the mark. A letter sent to underwriters of state bonds disclosed that for the first time in seven years New York may be forced to borrow short-term funds within the next three months to meet its daily obligations. The letter, signed by Comptroller Edward V. Regan and C. Mark Lawton, the budget director, said that the state's general fund was short $175 million in tax revenues as of Oct. 1 and noted that further ''reduced receipts'' were expected. Earlier in the month, Governor Carey had predicted a $579 million budget deficit in the current fiscal year and, perhaps, a $1.8 billion gap in the following one. Mr. Carey blamed the national recession for the state's fiscal problems. New Jersey has also suffered a loss of sales, income and corporate business tax receipts. But Governor Kean, who had been considering calling a special session of the Legislature after the election to deal with the problem, last week seemed to decide against it. Mr. Kean did mention taking ''drastic action'' if revenues, down $59 million in the first two months of the fiscal year, continue to decline. While avoiding specifics, the Governor said he was considering further cuts in state programs and using emergency powers to cut state aid to education and localities.

515-> NO PRICE INCREASE SEEN ON MOST MEAT
There will be good news for consumers of beef and broiling chickens in the next four months. Large supplies of both will be arriving on local meat counters at prices expected to be the same as those last year or lower. The same cannot be said of hog supplies, which are declining rapidly, though the continuing recession and competition from beef and poultry may also hold down retail pork prices. These trends have led the Agriculture Department to predict that in all of 1983 retail meat prices will rise 2 to 5 percent, far less than the annual increases of 8 to 10 percent in the last five years. In November a surprisingly large number of beef cattle were being fed for market as hard-pressed ranchers had to sell off some breeding stock to pay their bills. The Agriculture Department said 14 percent more cattle were going through the five-month feeding cycle than a year ago. Twenty-seven percent of these were new placements, the largest number to come into the feed lots in one month since 1978. Average Beef Price of $2.38 In its mid-November survey of retail beef prices in 19 cities, the National Cattlemen's Association found an average price of $2.38 a pound for five representative cuts. This was well below the year's peak of $2.64, reached last June, and the same as the average fivecut price in mid-November 1981. The number of animals now in the feed lots indicated that supplies of fattened cattle would continue to increase in the first three months of 1983, Tom Beal, an association economist, said Wednesday. ''So we expect retail beef prices to stabilize at where they are now and to stay that way until the sell-off by the cattle raisers ends,'' he said. The National Broiler Council reported Wednesday that production of broiling chickens would be up 3 percent over this period last year, insuring ample supplies into the winter. ''Consumers can count on a good supply of broilers at reasonable prices,'' said William P. Roenigk, the council's director of research. Broilers Are Best Buy Broilers are the best buy at the meat counter, Mr. Roenigk said. The poultry industry expects this to continue at least until next spring. In contrast, the supply of hogs, declining all year, is at the lowest fall level since September 1975. Also, farmers have reported to the Agriculture Department that they expect to reduce the number of pigs their sows produce in the next three months. In normal times such a decline would lead to increases in the prices hog raisers receive and to sharply higher retail pork prices. But farmers' prices have been declining for the last two months, and retail prices have followed them. This unusual trend, according to Agriculture Deparment livestock specialists, was caused by two factors: the decline in beef prices, to which hog prices are directly related, and the slackening of consumer demand because of the recession and the rise in unemployment. Even so, Agriculture Department analysts expect the sharp drop in supplies of pork to force up both farm and retail prices in the coming four months. How much they rise will depend on when a national economic recovery begins and employment increases, said Ralph Gann, a livestock specialist with the department. Pork Producers in Debt The increase in broiler supplies and the resulting leveling off of retail poultry prices can be absorbed by the large processors and the farmers who raise broilers for them on contract. But the continuing decline in stockyard hog prices was discouraging news for pork producers, many of whom are still heavily in debt from recent years of very large hog supplies and unprofitable prices. For the cattlemen, today's market outlook offers only the prospect of another year of meager earnings or outright losses. Mr. Beal of the Cattlemen's Association warned that by early next spring, when the large number of cattle now being made ready for market have been consumed, the total beef supply will drop sharply. If consumer buying power has improved by then, he said, there could be a rise in retail beef prices. This could also pull up pork and poultry prices, and everything in the meat counter could cost more, he said.

516-> WINE
They are using classic French technology, equipment and skills, as well as grapes of French origin grown in northern California vineyards, to make products that they refuse to call Champagne, for they know that the only true Champagne comes from France. Their refusal is influencing other California producers, and someday, perhaps, the practice of borrowing the French name will be abandoned altogether in this country. Angelo Papagni, the patriarch of Papagni Vineyards, which produces substantial quantities of sparkling wine in Madera, Calif., disclosed that he will soon eliminate the Champagne name from all of his products in a move that may be emulated by others. Mr. Papagni knows that Champagne is a geographical French name to which American producers have little legitimate claim. It has been applied to American sparkling wines for generations, however, by numerous producers who know that most consumers in this country are unaware that the name is geographical, just as Bordeaux, Burgundy, Chablis, Cognac and virtually all other French wine names are geographical. Calling an American wine Champagne is akin to calling a French wine California or Napa or Sonoma, which the French would never do. Yet the use of borrowed wine names is so entrenched in this country that it surely will endure for generations more - perhaps with the exception of Champagne, now that Piper and Moet are showing the way. It all started in the early 1970's when Moet acquired land in Yountville in the Napa Valley, planted vines and began building a winery. The first sparkling wines from this effort, made under the supervision of Edmond Maudiere, a consulting oenologist for Moet & Chandon, were released in late 1976 and sales in 1977 totaled 20,000 cases, or 240,000 bottles, modest by French standards. The wines were called Domaine Chandon Napa Valley Brut and Cuvee de Pinot Noir, and they proved that French methods and expertise could be successfully transplanted in California. Their quality was extraordinary - in fact, superior to virtually all other so-called ''champagnes'' made in California. Partly as a result, other California producers felt competitive pressures to upgrade their own products with superior grape varieties and techniques. The general quality level of California sparkling wines has risen substantially in the last decade, thanks largely to Moet's efforts with Domaine Chandon. Production of Domaine Chandon climbed steadily in response to soaring consumer demand. Shortages ensued and the wine occasionally had to be put on allocation. This year, roughly 2.4 million bottles will be sold and 4.2 million will be made, with production of 5 million scheduled for 1983. (Two years pass between production and sale.) Moet has enhanced its presence in the Napa Valley by establishing a large, highly acclaimed restaurant at the winery in Yountville. It has become so popular that reservations for lunch or dinner are necessary well in advance, and it is regarded as one of the halfdozen best eating places in the Napa Valley. Other French producers have enviously watched Moet's track record in California, but Piper-Heidsieck was the first to join the battle. In 1980 Piper entered a joint venture with Renfield Importers, which controls Sonoma Vineyards in Windsor, in the Sonoma region west of the Napa Valley. Piper's chef de caves, Michel LaCroix, and other staff members were dispatched to Windsor to work hand in hand with Rodney D. Strong, the respected wine maker of Sonoma Vineyards. In an effort to do something that Moet had not done with Domaine Chandon, they decided to produce vintage sparkling wines, made from grapes produced entirely in one year. A vintage wine is not necessarily better than a nonvintage wine, especially when it comes to Champagne. In fact, the vast majority of genuine Champagne is a blend of two or more years with no dates on the labels, and most French producers are convinced that Champagne is primarily a product of the blender's art. But it is also true that the most expensive Champagnes, the socalled special cuvees such as Dom Perignon, Taittinger Comtes de Champagne and Perrier-Jouet Fleur de Champagne, are vintage wines that many connoisseurs regard as the best of all, commanding prices of $40 a bottle and up. So well established was Domaine Chandon in the American market as a nonvintage wine that it was logical for Piper to seek to do something different as a marketing device. So the decision was made that Piper's American clone would be a vintage wine. The new product, Piper Sonoma 1980, went on the market earlier this month, 30,000 cases in all, and is already attracting attention among devotees of American sparklers. It is much lighter and drier than Domaine Chandon and is perhaps the most elegant sparkling wine made in this country, in line with what seems to be an American preference for such products. But, as such, it is less similar to most real Champagne. It is neither better nor worse than Domaine Chandon, for the wines are equally well made and their differences are no more than stylistic. Consumers who prefer their sparkling wines superdry and superelegant will probably opt for Piper Sonoma. Those who like their wines slightly fuller-bodied and more flavorful, with more character, will drink Domaine Chandon. Both are made with the classic methode champenoise, or Champagne method, which involves fermentation inside the bottles that eventually reach the consumer, rather than in large fermenting tanks. Bottle fermentation enables the bubbles of carbon dioxide that set sparkling wines apart from still wines to be captured. Most California ''champagnes'' are made with variations of the Charmat process, developed in 1910 by Eugene Charmat, whereby the fermenting tanks themselves are sealed and pressurized to capture the gas. This method is never used with genuine Champagne in France, although it is responsible for a great deal of very pleasant sparkling wine. Meanwhile, other California producers are taking careful note of the competition between the two French-oriented concerns. Their decision to use chardonnay, pinot blanc and pinot noir as their basic grape varieties, as in France, is putting pressure on others to abandon the grapes of lower cost and quality that have traditionally been used. Such excellent small California wineries as Schramsberg, a strict adherent of la methode champenoise with traditional Champagne grape varieties, are more popular than ever. And the consumer is benefiting from the competition, for never before has more good sparkling wine been available in this country. JOHN LUND

517-> TOWN'S INDIAN NAME REFUSES TO DIE; The Talk of Jim Thorpe
It was an Indian summer day here, and if the town seemed squeezed in the narrow gorges between mountains that autumn has brushed with gold, there was nothing cramped of spirit among the Thorpians basking once more in a renown drawn from their illustrious namesake and renewed attention to a pair of related issues. The heat of a national political campaign seemed far away, and if there was a hotbed of anything here, it was at Weiksner's Bar. Weiksner's, as Steve Duffy, one of its aging habitues, put it, is a sort of warm bed of Chunkerism. ''We are all Chunkers here,'' said Mr. Duffy, grasping one of the daily beers that seem never to have thickened either his lean frame or his sharp tongue. ''Well, maybe one or two Thorpers,'' he grudgingly acknowledged. He and his fellow denizens of Weiksner's, the only public drinking establishment on his side of the river, are still disconsolate, after 28 years, over a vote by their borough of Mauch Chunk, pronounced ''mock chunk,'' to become Jim Thorpe in honor of the famed Oklahoma Indian athlete. New Issue of Thorpe's Spirit The issue has stirred debate over the years and, in the 1960's, two failing referenda to recapture the old name. More recently, a related issue has arisen: whether the spirit of Jim Thorpe, whose body was also brought here, can rest easily in these alien mountains. Thorpe's heirs and his tribe contend that it cannot and want the body moved to Oklahoma. The division of Thorpers and Chunkers was revived recently when the International Olympic Committee voted to restore the medals Thorpe won 70 years ago, when he was acclaimed ''the world's greatest athlete.'' He had been stripped of the medals for playing some semiprofessional baseball. It was an action 42 years after his Olympian feats that spawned the issue of the heritage of Jim Thorpe the man, whom a few of Weiksner's more elderly patrons still refer to as merely ''a dead Indian,'' and the town's old Indian name, which refuses to die. In 1954, after a promotion by Thorpe's widow, Patricia, the boroughs of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk, separated by the Lehigh River and long rivalry, voted to merge and take the name of the great athlete. Mrs. Thorpe was attracted to the town after hearing of an unusual industrial development promotion that might pay to perpetuate the memory of her husband, the only man ever to win both the pentathlon and the decathlon. Businesses Keep Old Name The people down at Weiksner's and a few other older residents still argue for Mauch Chunk, the Indian name for Bear Mountain. Many old businesses keep the old name and many new businesses have adopted it. Al Weiksner, owner of the bar, listed 22 businesses and places that had taken the Mauch Chunk name since the town became Jim Thorpe. For example, there is both a Jim Thorpe National Bank and a Mauch Chunk Trust Company. Many of the sights in the town of 5,500 people are now tourist attractions, including the mansion of its most famous resident, Asa Packer, the coal, barge and railroad baron who founded Lehigh University. Another tourist attraction is the red granite mausoleum that contains Jim Thorpe's body. Thorpe, a member of the Sac and Fox tribe of Oklahoma, was born on a farm near Stroud, and until his death in 1953 of a heart attack in California, he had never seen the mountains of Mauch Chunk. As part of a deal formalized in a contract between a town committee and Mrs. Thorpe, his body was brought to rest here in an appropriate monument. Money From the Nickel Fund ''That hurt a lot of people,'' Mr. Weiksner said, adding that the mausoleum's cost of $11,926.18 was paid out of a nickel-a-week fund to which each resident contributed. ''That was money we were raising for industrial development.'' Both he and Mr. Duffy acknowledge that theirs is a forlorn cause. ''A whole generation has grown up that has known nothing but Jim Thorpe,'' said James Walker, 70 years old, ''They wouldn't stand for it.'' Mr. Walker, the last Mayor of Mauch Chunk and the first Mayor of Jim Thorpe and now Recorder of Deeds, is on the Thorpe side, along with Francis Helferty, who followed him, and Michael Hichok, the current Mayor. ''Of course, a lot of promises were made that were never kept,'' Mr. Walker said. But that, he said, might have been mainly because of the death of the former National Football League commissioner, Bert Bell, an old friend of Thorpe's who was involved in the deal. Among the attractions held out to the Chunkers before their vote were proposals for a heart hospital, a Football Hall of Fame here and an annual professional football game for the area. None ever materialized. Tribe Sought to Move Body Mr. Hichok said that he had received a feeler in a letter in 1979 from the Sac and Fox tribe about moving the body and had received a few other letters since the Olympic committee's action, some supporting the move. He noted that family members had been quoted recently as saying they worried that Thorpe's spirit could not rest easy while his body was here. ''No way,'' Mr. Hickok said. ''We took him without the medals. His family seemed satisfied, pleased about it. We're sure not going to give him up now. Besides, this is old Indian country. Where else could an Indian's spirit rest easier than in the majesty of these mountains?'' ''Where were they all these 28 years?'' asked Mr. Helferty, who was a Borough Councilman when the deal was made. ''You know, it wasn't like we went out begging. They had to sell the idea to us.'' At the Asa Packer mansion, Bertha Herman, the caretaker, had mixed feelings. ''I liked the name Mauch Chunk much better,'' she said, ''but a lot of schoolgirls that work here would kill me for saying it.'' As for moving the body, she added: ''I think he can rest fine. Let him stay were he is.''

519-> THE WORLD; Violence, With A Vengeance, Strikes Ulster
The election of an Assembly in Northern Ireland 10 days ago was supposed to establish the beginnings of political order. Instead, what the chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Sir Jack Hermon, called ''debased tribalism'' was once again governing relations between the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority. Among the victims of a new wave of violence last week were three policemen, blown up by 1,000 pounds of remote-controlled explosives as they were proceeding along a road near Belfast in an armored car. The election, a first step toward self-rule, produced a Protestant majority in the 78-seat Assembly that is opposed to cooperation with Catholics. To the further dismay of British officials and moderates on both sides, the Catholic victors included five who speak for the Sinn Fein, the political arm of the outlawed Provisional Irish Republican Army. The results simply exacerbated the climate of extremism and a bloody week followed. A Protestant was abducted by Catholic militants and then a Catholic by Protestant forces. The body of another Catholic was found in Armagh with multiple ax wounds and with all his teeth pulled and his throat cut. A third Catholic had his right hand sawed off by two men who broke into his apartment. Then came the attack on the three policemen, for which the I.R.A. claimed responsibility. The I.R.A.'s political wing attacked the new Assembly as a threat ''to the political well-being of the Irish people.'' But the British insisted the Assembly would convene next month as planned.

520-> 4 INDICTED BY U.S. IN ESCAPE OF JOANNE CHESIMARD IN '79
Four persons were accused in a Federal indictment yesterday of having helped the black activist Joanne Chesimard to escape from a New Jersey prison in 1979. Miss Chesimard, a former leader of the Black Liberation Army, had been serving a life term for the slaying of a New Jersey state trooper. She escaped from a women's prison after three visitors seized two guards at gunpoint and commandeered a prison van. Since then, an intensive search by law-enforcement officials has turned up few traces of her. In the indictment, the four accused persons - Mutulu Shakur, Nathaniel Burns, Sylvia Baraldini and Susan Rosenberg - were charged with conspiracy and racketeering in connection with the escape. They were not directly charged with aiding an escape or kidnapping, and Federal authorities refused to elaborate on that. Additional conspiracy charges refer to allegations that they participated in a series of robberies and attempted robberies of armored cars and banks committed around the country. Link to Brink's Robbery Kenneth P. Walton, deputy assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the charges grew out of a continuing investigation of the $1.8 million Brink's robbery in Rockland County in 1981, in which two police officers and a Brink's guard were killed. All four suspects have been charged in that robbery. Mr. Walton said that since Miss Chesimard escaped, the bureau had only found one piece of confirmed evidence of her whereabouts: a fingerprint found last spring in an apartment used by underground fugitives in Pittsburgh. ''We have no idea where she is right now,'' he said. Mr. Burns, who was arrested after a shootout in Queens, is facing trial with five other suspects in Rockland County in connection with the Brink's robbery. He has refused to attend pretrial hearings, saying they are illegal. He is 38 years old. Miss Baraldini, 34, was arrested on Nov. 9 on charges that she had conspired to commit three robberies. At the time of her arrest she was described as a legal assistant to Susan Tipograph, who is the lawyer for Judith A. Clark, a defendant in the Brink's robbery. The two other persons indicted in Miss Chesimard's escape - Mr. Shakur, 32, and Miss Rosenberg, 26 -are fugitives. The indictment provided few details about the escape. It says that the defendants ''did plan and assist the escape,'' and ''together with others committed the kidnapping of a prison guard and a prison matron in Clinton, N.J., in violation of New Jersey statutes.'' Other Crimes in Indictment The other crimes mentioned in the indictment included the attempted robbery of an armored car in Pittsburgh in 1976; a $521,000 armoredcar robbery in the Inwood section of Manhattan in 1980; the robbery of a credit union in Arlington, Va.; three attempts to rob an armored car in Danbury, Conn., the Brink's robbery and three attempted holdups of armored cars in Nanuet, in Rockland County, in 1980 and 1981. From the time the suspects in the Brink's robbery were identified as former members of the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army, investigators had theorized about a possible connection with Miss Chesimard. Yesterday's indictment is the first indication of such a connection. Law-enforcement officials said the charges involving Miss Chesimard's escape were based on new information that had become available during the last few weeks, They would not say whether the information came from informants, but the indictment also charged that Mr. Shakur and several others had threatened to murder Samuel Brown, a defendant in the Brink's robbery, and Yvonne Thomas, who, prosecutors said, was charged with bank robbery in Georgia. Convicted in March 1977 Miss Chesimard was convicted in March 1977 in New Brunswick, N.J., for the slaying in May 1973 of a New Jersey State trooper, Werner Foerster, 34, and the wounding of another trooper, James M. Harper, when a car she was riding in was stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike. One of her associates was killed in the shootout and another was convicted of the murder. In addition to the four persons accused in Miss Chesimard's escape, those indicted yesterday on conspiracy, racketeering and other charges were: Cecil Ferguson and Edward L. Joseph, who were arrested last March, and Cheri Dalton, a fugitive. Three other persons, Dr. Alan Berkman, Iliana Robinson and Nilse Cobeo, were also charged with being accessories after the fact in the Brink's case.

521-> IOWA FARMERS GLOOMY ON OUTLOOK, BUT SEEN TO BEAR REAGAN NO ILL WILL
Even if recovery is in sight, as President Reagan asserts, the farmers, small-town merchants, and country bankers in this once prosperous area believe it will take up to two years for them to recoup from the worst recession they have endured in 42 years. If they are right, this could cause problems for Mr. Reagan in the agrarian Middle West, should he choose to run again. But these days in west central Iowa, as in many other areas of the Corn and Wheat Belts, little public anger or resentment is being expressed toward the President. Some farmers and merchants thought the uneasiness of many Iowans might be reflected in a Democratic upset in the race for governor, in which Roxanne Conlin, a former United States Attorney, appears to have overcome some early stumbles and is closing on Lieut. Gov. Terry Branstad, the Republican. But they said they could not sense any upsurge of opposition toward two of Iowa's three Republican Congressmen, who have been supporting most farm-relief measures as avidly as their Democratic challengers. Only in the Third District in north central Iowa did they see a chance that this time Lynn G. Cutler, the Democrat, might unseat Representative Cooper Evans, whom she nearly defeated in 1980. 'Don't Know Whom to Blame' John Chrystal, head of the Iowa Savings Bank in Coon Rapids, an active Democrat, said President Reagan had done ''a masterful job of blaming all our troubles on the Democrats.'' ''Certainly people around here are unhappy and some of them are plain scared,'' he asserted. ''But they don't know exactly whom to blame for their problems.'' One reason for the despondent outlook can be seen on either side of any road in Iowa, where today the combines are scooping up the largest corn and soybean crops ever grown in the United States. These are being added to last year's record grain production, and farmers' prices are dropping to the lowest levels in a decade. With a surplus of this magnitude building up, no one expects much improvement in grain farmers' earnings this year or next. The other reason for this long-range gloom is the area's high degree of dependence on the well-being of its farm-related industries. Economy Is Farm-Dependent More than 30 percent of the people in the Corn Belt make or sell products to farmers. Local manufacturers have been losing money and laying off workers for two years and neither they nor the small town merchants have any hope of recovering until farmers have money to spend. ''Maybe the recession is bottoming out like the President thinks,'' said Mr. Chrystal, the banker. ''But I can't conceive of what's going to bring the economy back this year or next. With the amount of grain we're piling up, too many farmers are still dangerously in debt and the retail merchants in my area are in even worse shape.'' Earlier this week the Agriculture Department announced that a record 2.37 billion bushels of corn, a third of a year's supply, were still in storage before this year's record crop had even started into the bins. Another Layoff at Deere At the same time, Deere & Company, one of the country's largest farm implement makers and this state's largest employer, announced it was laying off 1,300 additional employees at its plant in Waterloo, bringing to 4,800 the number of workers who have left Deere in the last year. ''We're looking at a 25 to 50 percent drop in the modest profits we were making a year ago,'' said John Grettenberg, the Coon Rapids dealer for the already troubled International Harvester Company. ''You're talking two years at least before we see any relief,'' he went on. South of Coon Rapids, where he raises hogs and cattle on the gently rolling hills near Villisca, Dave Williams said those of his neighbors who were not too heavily in debt were surviving the recession, but just barely. 'Nothing Going to Change' ''The rate of bankruptcies and farm sales around here is not much higher than usual,'' Mr. Williams said. ''But the recession has gone on long enough to cause a big shakeout among the farmers. We've stopped buying anything but the necessities and there's nothing I can see that's going to change that in less than two years, even if the so-called recovery starts tomorrow.'' To the east of Coon Rapids, Max Naylor was maneuvering a huge combine through one of the best crops he has ever grown and listening to the radio in his cab reporting that corn prices were falling below $2 a bushel, about $1.40 less than this time last year. Stopping long enough to talk with a visitor, he said that with exports dropping and the numbers of hogs and cattle declining, he could not expect any measurable decrease in the huge surplus that had been pulling his prices down since early spring. ''About half of the farmers around here who aren't already too far in debt are breaking even,'' he said. ''But it's going to be a long time before we'll see the country banks around here having any money to loan at anything near reasonble rates of interest. There's no way we can expect to buy anything we don't absolutely have to have and we can't foresee that picture changing in less than two years.'' They Detect No Resentment But all these men said they had heard little anger or resentment toward President Reagan for the situation. The President's recent announcements of moves he said would improve the farm economy - an offer of limited guarantees of increased grain deliveries to the Russians and a pledge to use $500 million Congress has authorized for export promotion - have brought few cheers from this area. Mr. Williams said these actions were long overdue and would have little effect. ''They were only political talk that everybody saw through right away,'' he said. ''There was nothing there that helped raise the price of corn or soybeans or nothing that will move us out of this recession any faster.''

524-> St. John's Takes Its 6th Holiday Festival
Forty-two seconds into the second half last night David Russell scored on a layup from the low post. He went on to score six more baskets in the half to lead St. John's to a 72-65 victory over Wake Forest in the final of the Holiday Festival at Madison Square Garden. St. John's, which has won more Festivals than any other team, made it two in a row and six over all. It was the 11th victory this season for the undefeated Redmen and the first loss in eight games for the Deacons. Led by Russell, St. John's came up with a strong second-half its 22d appearance in the 31 years the Eastern College Athletic Conference has sponsored the tournament. Russell had 17 points in the second half, shooting 7 for 9, and finished with 21 points. He was voted the tournament's most valuable player, an award he also won as a freshman in 1979. Only two other players have ever been voted m.v.p. twice in the Festival - Tom Gola of La Salle, in 1952 and 1954, and Jimmy Walker of Providence, in 1965 and 1966. St. John's had previously won the Holiday Festival in 1958, 1964, 1972 and 1979, in addition to last year and this year. In the consolation game , St, Joseph's defeated Brigham Young, 68-65. Russell's performance brought an ovation from the crowd of 13,785. He hit seven of nine field-goal attempts in the second half after having scored only 4 points in the opening half. Foul trouble forced him to sit out the final 9:39 of the opening 20 minutes. Coach Lou Carnesecca removed Russell after he had picked up his second foul. St. John's was leading at the time, 18-10; but by halftime, without his rebounding, the Redmen struggled and maintained a 30-27 advantage. Russell scored 8 of the Redmen's first 11 points in the second half, all on passes from Chris Mullin, last year's tournament m.v.p. They enabled St. John's to build a 41-31 advantage that Wake Forest could never lower to less than 6. ''I knew I was in trouble when I got the second foul,'' said Russell, who put on his show before a jury of pro scouts that had projected him as a first-round draft choice. ''When I got back into the game I tried to get myself going, and got a lot of help. The guys were finding me and giving me the ball in the right place. My first two baskets were on fast break layups.'' Russell's second-half shooting and 12 points and 12 rebounds by Jeff Allen, the 6-11 center, made up for poor shooting by Mullin and Billy Goodwin, two of the Redmen's best scorers. Mullin was 5 for 14 from the field and Goodwin shot 5 for 12. ''That's a good club,'' said Carnesecca of Wake Forest. ''They are strong and very quick. We got off well and then began to struggle. I think what helped most through the first half was our experience.'' Redmen Build Lead Delaney Rudd, a sophomore guard, scored the first basket of the game, a 10-foot baseline jumper after 65 seconds of play. It was the only lead Wake Forest had in the first half until John Toms made one of two free throws with 2:23 remaining. In between, St. John's blew three 10-point leads, the last, 24-14, with 6:33 left. The Redmen regained the lead on Bill Wennington's jumper off a pass from Goodwin with 2:02 left and they led, 30-27, at halftime. After Rudd's opening basket, Russell scored two baskets and Mullin pulled up for a foul-line jump shot, and he made it a 3-point play by hitting on a free throw to give St. John's a 7-2 advantage. Two baskets by Jeff Allen, combined with a second 3-point play by Mullin, boosted the Redmen lead to 14-5. After Goodwin scored for St. John's, Wake Forest went into a press that bothered the Redmen. St. John's began to force shots and missed easy ones. Wake Forest followed with 10 straight points and moved to within a two-point deficit, 24-22. Mullin increased the lead with a basket, but the advantage was quickly erased by 6 straight points. Russell was back at forward at the start of the second half and he quickly made up for lost time. He scored half of a burst of 10 straight St. John's points to enable the Redmen to open a 37-27 lead. Wake Forest did not get its first basket of the half until Rogers scored with 18:23 left. With 15 minutes remaining, Russell had 13 points, 9 within a fiveminute span, to help his team build a 45-37 lead. St. Joseph's at 5-4 Six free throws in the final 53 seconds, four by Tony DiCaro and two by Bob Lojewski, enabled St.Joseph's to hold off Brigham Young (3-8) and bring its season mark to 5-4. The Hawks did not score a field goal after Lojewski put in a rebound off a missed free throw to put St. Joseph's ahead.

525-> MANITOBA EAGER TO SELL ELECTRICITY
This prairie province, which produces a surplus of the cheapest electricity on the continent, is eager to expand its capacity still further. Manitoba's hope is to export electricity to utilities in the Middle West, where questions about thermal and nuclear plants are inhibiting the growth of power capacity. Howard Pawley, Manitoba's Premier, returned recently from visits to London and New York, where he discussed with bankers the financing of the new dams needed to increase hydroelectric power and sell it across the border on a cost-sharing basis. As he explained it in his office, the Middle Western utilities would pay Manitoba Hydro, the provincially owned utility, a rate equal to half the difference between the cost of the Canadian power and the cost needed to acquire that power from either a nuclear or thermal plant. Mr. Pawley said there has been considerable interest expressed by utilities in Nebraska, Illinois and California, and from investment bankers at Salomon Brothers, First Boston and Merrill Lynch, with whom he conferred. Construction of Dams Wilson Parasiuk, the province's Minister of Mines and Energy who accompanied the Premier on his visit, said that what his office was suggesting was the construction of up to nine dams on the Churchill and Nelson rivers, which would greatly augment surplus power that could then be sold to United States utilities. ''We see the transborder sale of power as a way to enable United States utilities to take a breather, to carefully decide just how they want to expand,'' he said. ''In the meantime we could offer them, say, 1,000 megawatts of power for a period of 25 years at a predictable price and split the difference with them between what our electricity was costing and what it would have cost them had they built either a thermal or nuclear plant.'' The project would emulate the operation of James Bay facilities used by Quebec Hydro to produce power and sell it to utilities in the northeastern United States. Mr. Pawley said that, even though Middle Western utilities were reporting sagging demand, the investment bankers saw ''clear advantages in the Manitoba situation.'' Opposition to Power Lines South of the border, however, there is less optimism. Opposition in South Dakota to power lines traversing farmland, for example, has at least temporarily blocked the project by tying it up in the courts. Another problem is the weak demand for electricity in the states where the power would be sold. ''There is an interest, but not momentarily an appetite,'' said a spokesman for one New York investment house that the Premier visited. ''And the appetite comes before the financial package.'' The Nebraska Public Power District, the main utility discussing the deal with Manitoba Hydro, may have difficulty selling the idea - and a share of the business - to neighboring utilities. The others seem to be holding out to see who else will join. ''They're going to have to show a benefit to the intermediaries to get a right of way,'' said Dan Witt, manager of transmission planning for the Omaha Public Power District, a neighboring utility. ''We're standing on the sidelines. Everyone is holding back to see if it is going to fly, if it has support.'' Investment House Support But another investment house spokesman was supportive. ''It's an idea with quite a bit of promise,'' he said. ''The United States's power needs are far from resolved in any long-term sense. There has been a general reduction in growth of demand, but I don't think demand is declining.'' He asked not to be identified because, he said, his company's discussions with Manitoba Hydro were continuing. Mr. Parasiuk, the Minister of Mines and Energy, said independent studies showed the cost to residential customers of 1,000 kilowatt hours of Manitoba Hydro power to be $25.29 (United States), compared with $59.28 in Chicago, $81.43 in Detroit, $88.98 in Philadelphia, $95.19 in Boston and $154.57 in New York City. In Manitoba, he said, electricity was already less expensive than oil for home heating and it was only slightly more expensive than natural gas. Sales Precedent At the headquarters of Manitoba Hydro, Dan Blachford, the president and chief executive officer of the facility, explained that there was a precedent for sales across the border: the system now supplies small amounts of electrical power to utilities in Minneapolis, Duluth, Minn., and Grand Forks, N.D. He said there had been considerable interest from utilities in the Los Angeles area to buy power from the grid network, which could be replaced by inputs from Manitoba. Manitoba Hydro was among the pioneers in the development of high voltage transmission, having built a 650-mile high-voltage line from the Nelson River to Winnipeg, where 60 percent of Manitoba's million people live. As for Manitoba's benefits from the deal, both Premier Pawley and Mr. Parasiuk said the eventual revenue would maintain low power costs here while also helping to support a network of social programs. But the immediate benefit, they contend, would be in the jobs created by construction of dams, which could require as much as $2 billion and take up to six years to complete.

526-> Leader in Attica Riot Is Slain
A leader of the 1971 prison uprising in Attica, N.Y., who later waged a one-man war against narcotics traffic in his neighborhood, died in an ambush by angry drug pushers, the police said today. Bernard Stroble, 42 years old, who used the African name Shango, was killed by a shotgun blast after parking his car outside his mother's home Wednesday. Investigators said Mr. Stroble had tried to prevent drug addicts from using an apartment above his shoe repair shop in a building owned by his family. He also tried to stop drug dealers from using his mother's restaurant across the street as a hangout. Mr. Stroble was sentenced to Attica after confessing to murder, kidnapping, assault, arson and robbery charges. In 1975, he was acquitted of charges that he and four other leaders of the uprising executed two prison informers after a mock trial during the 1971 uprising. In all, 43 people died in the revolt, including 39 who were shot to death when the State Police stormed the prison. Mr. Stroble, who spent most of his life behind bars, reportedly left prison influenced by revolutionary black philosophy and an interest in radical politics. Two days before he was slain, he reportedly attacked three drug addicts he found in the apartment above his shop. His friends said that less than an hour later young men driving Mercedes-Benzes and Cadillacs converged on the block, brandishing guns and vowing revenge. The police said that shortly after the fatal shooting, Mr. Stroble's shop was burglarized and the apartment upstairs was back in use as a so-called shooting gallery where addicts inject drugs.

527-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Guess Who's Guest?
In the 14 years that Tony Basileo has operated Mimmo's Restaurant in Westbury, L.I., he has come to be friendly with many trainers and drivers from Roosevelt Raceway, the harness racing track he says is ''just across the street.'' Last August he paid $45,000 to Lobell Farms for a 3-year-old pacer named Elmer Lobell, thus becoming an owner. In eight starts since Sept. 8, Elmer Lobell finished second three times and finished third once. Last Thursday he won the third race at Yonkers by a nose, with Rene Pulin driving for Jean Drolet, the trainer. ''I kept saying that when Elmer Lobell won a race, I would throw a big party for him,'' said Basileo. ''I'm thrilled that it's happened at last,'' said Basileo. ''Now we can have the party.'' So the guest of honor at 2:30 P.M. today at Mimmo's will be Elmer Lobell, reined in the parking lot near the kitchen. Basilio has asked his chef, Pepe Perez, to prepare a special meal for the pacer. ''He will have artichokes, corn, carrots, lettuce, wheat and grain,'' said Basilio. ''I would have liked to have served him steak, meatballs or lobster, but they tell me he doesn't go for those things. ''And I will have a cake for him with three candles on it. It will have a message on it: ''Congratulations to Elmer Lobell, from Tony.''

529-> FOLK SONG: BURL IVES AS EVER
BURL IVES'S kindly folk music is so deeply ingrained in the national psyche that it is very easy to take him for granted. And at his sold-out concert at the Herbert H. Lehman College Center for the Performing Arts yesterday afternoon, it was clear that a large portion of the audience had been brought up listening to his children's records. There was a time when Mr. Ives's gentle acoustic style of folk and his apolitical point of view were synonymous with the unhip. And indeed, yesterday's concert had its moments of unabashed corniness. But it also revealed a voice and a quietly authoritative stage manner that have remained remarkably unchanged over the years. Mr. Ives's program touched on at least half-a-dozen folk genres, from cowboy songs to children's tunes. His ''Streets of Laredo'' was a beautifully enunciated, detached story version that brought out the simple eloquence of the tune. And his musically inflected recitation of the Yeats poem ''The Wandering of Old Angus'' rang with unexpected passion. Right from the beginning of the program, the singer had the audience in the palm of his hand, leading it through several uncomplicated sing-alongs. Clearly, Burl Ives remains as much a folkmusic institution as ever. He is an American sentimentalist in the tradition of Carl Sandburg and Norman Rockwell. Stephen Holden

531-> Advertising; Planning For Cable's Acceptance
NEXT year could be the year that cable television comes of age and becomes a recognized advertising medium, Kay Koplovitz, president of the USA Network, firmly believes. One of the ways she will prepare her network to take advantage of the recognition will be through a big advertising campaign aimed at increasing the number of subscribers (15 million by the end of the year) to the 2,600 affiliated systems that already carry the network. A byproduct, she hopes, will be an enhanced USA image in the advertising community. Marsteller Inc., USA's agency, will come up with the network's first TV advertising, as well as with material for radio, newspapers and magazines. Advertising will run in 28 spot-TV markets, the markets with the greatest penetration by cable. Since the network gets money from the systems for each subscriber the systems sign up, as well as money from advertisers, the campaign should be doubly rewarding. On her usual Tuesday in town from her Glen Rock, N.J., headquarters, the cable executive explained that the reason she is so optimistic about 1983 is that 1982 saw cable television become ''a legitimate part of media plans.'' ''There was some of that in 1981, but much more in 1982,'' she said. ''All 50 of the top 50 advertisers are in the medium,'' she added,''and probably 85 percent of the top 200.'' As far as her own USA Network goes, the beer and automobile companies, as well as makers of men's leisure wear, have long been advertising in the sports programming, while soft drinks, Wrigley and video games have been tied in with the youth-oriented shows for some time. But much more recently, packaged goods advertisers, such as Clorox, Pillsbury, General Foods, General Mills, Kellogg's and American Home Products, have been moving into the daytime women'stype shows and Mrs. Koplovitz said, ''They look strong going into 1983.'' At first glance it sounds as if USA, the oldest network after Home Box Office, is programmed very much like the broadcast networks, and in a broad sense it is. But it is more targeted as to audience, Mrs. Koplovitz is quick to note. As far as she is concerned, the ad agencies that are most heavily involved in cable in terms of either developing programming or getting clients in as advertisers, or both, are Young & Rubicam; Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn; Doyle Dane Bernbach; Dancer Fizgerald Sample; D'Arcy-MacManus & Masius ''to some degree''; Foote, Cone & Belding; Leo Burnett, and Backer & Speilvogel. Mrs. Koplovitz, 37 years old and formerly of Milwaukee, graduated from the University of Wisconsin and received a master's degree from Michigan State, where her thesis was on satellite technology and its implications. After a brief turn at the Federal Communications Commission, she put in four years at Comsat. Then, for a while, she edited and operated trade magazines where, she says, she learned a lot about business itself and the bottom line. After that, she opened her own consultancy and was doing that when retained by U A-Columbia Cablevision Inc. to set up the cable network that began in 1975 as the Madison Square Garden Network and became the USA Network that is now owned equally by Time Inc., MCA Inc. and the Paramount Pictures Corporation. In addition to all of the technical knowledge she accumulated along life's career path, she also picked up experience in programming in both sports and children's areas for a home-town station while she was between college and graduate school. In effect, she was ready for anything. ''When satellite technology and cable television were wed in 1975,'' she recalls, ''it's what I had been waiting for.''

532-> JONATHAN SCHWARTZ CONNECTS IN SONG
JONATHAN SCHWARTZ is a man who knows his own mind. ''There are two kinds of music - good music and bad music,'' the 41-year-old author, radio personality and singer said the other day at his home in the Chelsea section. ''And I know what the difference is. I'm not going to go on the stage with laziness accompanying me. I'm going to go with intelligence, hard work and talent. I won't sing an untrue rhyme like 'home and alone.' I turn up my nose and my heart to 'home and alone.' '' These are contentious words, because they reject most American pop written since 1960 as unfit in terms of craft. But Mr. Schwartz, who is now playing his eighth engagement at Michael's Pub, backs them up with a taste in song that is probably unequaled among today's pop singers. His current program, titled ''Connections Missed or Otherwise,'' includes 14 songs, many of them little known, that are all gems of craft. The composers include Jerome Kern, Rodgers and Hart, Irving Berlin and, especially, Arthur Schwartz, the singer's father. Among the show's high points are Mr. Schwartz's quietly despairing rendition of his father's ''I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan,'' which Frank Sinatra once recorded in a harder up-tempo version; ''You and I Know,'' from the 1937 musical ''Virginia''; ''Got a Brand New Suit,'' which was cut out of the movie ''The Bandwagon,'' and ''Why Go Anywhere at All,'' a sultry invitation to adultery from the 1961 musical ''The Gay Life.'' Jonathan Schwartz's singing style, though modeled closely after the mid-50's Frank Sinatra, is no shadowy imitation. Where the mature Sinatra can be brutally aggressive in stamping his personality on a song, Mr. Schwartz is more reflective and analytical. His exquisite taste is matched by his reverence for good melodies (particularly by Jerome Kern) and a view of the popular song as a precious literary artifact. A Capote-Sinatra Similarity ''Since I'm also a writer, I know a lot about punctuation.'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''It's fun to read a story by someone like Truman Capote just for the punctuation. Sinatra's punctuation you can listen to in the same way.'' A central irony in Mr. Schwartz's musical career lies in the fact that this archtraditionalist used to be one of the country's most influential rock disk jockeys. Between 1967 and 1976, at WNEW-FM, he became the rock disk jockey of choice among New York's young hip intelligentsia. There, his boyish enthusiasm, combined with his image as a cultivated, sensitive romantic made him a most persuasive spokesman for rock music's seriousness. Was Mr. Schwartz merely pretending all that time to care about music that he now says he scarcely follows anymore? ''My taste hasn't changed at all in the last 10 years,'' Mr. Schwartz maintained. ''I'm a composer's son. I grew up around craft. Hard rock is another matter entirely. There are different standards. What happened in the 60's was that the songwriter became the interpreter. He took to the stage and plugged in his instrument at the same time that there were all kinds of sexual and political explosions. But in the 70's, rock just got less and less interesting. ''I respect Bruce Springsteen's performance more than his songs. It's thrilling the way his music builds and builds, and his songs are great for the job they do in concert. But when you ask me about singer-songwriters, except for a very few, like Joni Mitchell, I feel these people have no experience and no scope. They've read no books and have no frame of reference.'' Took Sabbatical for Novel During five of the years he worked at WNEW-FM, Mr. Schwartz also played traditional pop on WNEW-AM. And when he finally took a sabbatical from radio to finish his novel, ''Distant Stations,'' he received 8,000 letters, half from his FM and half from his AM audience. Today, Mr. Schwartz is a star personality on WNEW-AM, where he enjoys tremendous creative freedom. His Sunday morning program, which he compiles assiduously at home, is a free-form music show in which he can segue pop, classical and jazz as he pleases. How important is Mr. Schwartz's singing career in his overall scheme of things? ''I have no interest in being a singer professionally or in touring, beyond playing Michael's Pub, because it's a lonely life and because what I do onstage is so New York-oriented,'' Mr. Schwartz maintained. ''I've always thought of myself as a writer first, and then as a radio man. And I have a fourth career, which happens to be the most lucrative, doing commercial voice-overs. Passion for His Hobby But even if Mr. Schwartz's singing career is, as he says, ''a serious hobby,'' he brings to it a passion that gives every performance an aura of intense physical and emotional concentration. ''I love my father's music and want it to be perpetuated,'' he said. ''Quite frankly, part of my scheme is to keep the line going, not only my father's but the larger line, with him at the center of the action. The tradition, which began around 1915 and involved maybe 45 to 50 very gifted writers, is not going to end. The songs by these individuals will always be the very fabric of music.'' Jonathan Schwartz will be at Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, through Dec. 4. There are two sets nightly, Tuesday through Saturday. Show times are approximately 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. There is a $10 minimum. The number for reservations is 758-2272.

533-> Timing of Honduran Exercise Is Affected by Reagan's Trip
Plans for joint United States-Honduran military maneuvers are continuing but their timing has still not been decided, Administration officials said today. They said that once President Reagan arranged to go to Costa Rica early in December it was decided to make sure the maneuvers did not take place around that time. Some officials view the maneuvers as a way to show American resolve to intimidate the Nicaraguan Government but others argue that they would serve no practical purpose.

534-> AIR FORCE ALTERS ITS MX BASING PLAN
The Air Force has modified its plan for putting all the proposed MX missiles close together, asserting that the changes will make the missile silos nearly invulnerable to airbursts of even very powerful Soviet nuclear weapons. There are two major changes in what is called the closely spaced basing plan for the missiles, according to Brig. Gen. Gordon E. Fornell, the Air Force special assistant for the MX. One is to use new methods of greatly reinforced construction of the silos holding the MX missiles. The Air Force says this will increase the ability of a silo to withstand pressures of more than 10,000 pounds per square inch from nuclear explosions in the air. The other modification, General Fornell said, is to change the shape of the proposed missile field from a nearly triangular trapezoid to a ''long, slender column'' about 14 miles long and one mile wide. The closely spaced basing, informally known as a ''dense pack'' system, is meant to protect a majority of MX missiles from destruction by taking advantage of an effect by which the blast, radiation and debris from the first enemy warheads would destroy or deflect other warheads arriving shortly afterward. Critics have argued that there may be a number of ways for Soviet military planners to overcome this missile-killing effect, called fratricide, and to undertake a nuclear tactic that would prevent the launching of United States missiles for many hours. General Fornell said the changes in the basing plan were meant to make it more difficult to destroy the proposed fleet of 100 operational MX's; to make the tactic of pinning down American missiles more costly and difficult for the Soviet Union and to ''compound the fratricidal effect.'' The most revolutionary element of the modified plan, however, is the assertion that silos can be made nearly immune from even large and relatively accurate nuclear explosions in the air. Some Pentagon sources readily acknowledged that another hope for the modifications was to make the MX acceptable to Congress and to critics so President Reagan's plan to begin construction of the first few missiles would be approved. The President has been instructed by Congress to propose a basing method for the MX by Dec. 1. Although Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger has not yet made a final recommendation to the White House, closely spaced basing is now regarded as all but certain to become the Administration's proposed policy. If serious flaws in the basing plan emerge, Congressional opponents of MX will probably renew their argument that it is imprudent to spend $26 billion or more on a missile system that does not have a secure operating base. About 30 Basing Plans Dropped Since the MX, which stands for ''missile experimental,'' was proposed in the early 1970's, more than 30 basing plans have been offered and then discarded because of mililtary, political, environmental or other objections. The new alignment of the proposed missile field to a long column and the modifications in reinforced silo construction, known as ''hardening,'' have followed what General Fornell called ''herculean efforts'' by scientific personnel in the Defense Department and by outside committees and individuals. Critics of the closely spaced basing plan, exemplified by the physicist and military consultant Richard L. Garwin, have said the concept is flawed in a number of ways. Dr. Garwin recently said the Soviet Union would be able to ''pin down'' the MX force by exploding nuclear weapons at altitudes of 60 to 120 miles above the earth so that MX's flying out would be destroyed by X-ray energy from the explosions. Dr. Garwin also said the narrow corridor through which missiles would fly out from the base meant that Soviet planners could achieve a pindown by exploding one megaton a minute, or 300 hundred megatons for a five-hour immobilization of the American force. An explosion of a megaton is equivalent to a million tons of TNT. Withstands Much Larger Blasts Changing the shape of the field from what was roughly a triangle to a slender line, General Fornell said, would force the an enemy to expend 10 megatons a minute in pindown explosions. ''When you start talking about 10 megatons a minute,'' the general said, ''you start exhausting his resources and drive him to development of new warheads larger in yield.'' Until General Fornell made the modifications public in an interview, it had been known that the Air Force was planning to place the MX missile in silos hardened to withstand pressures of 5,000 pounds per square inch from explosions on the ground and 10,000 pounds per square inch from explosions in the air. An assistant to General Fornell, Lieut. Col. Bob McMains, described that as the ''nickle and dime'' silo and said much higher levels of reinforced construction were now believed to be possible. The Air Force officers said airbursts occurring very close to an MX silo would ''fuse'' or melt its silo roof shut and destroy the missile. But they said the new construction techniques would permit missiles to survive many airbursts previously thought effective. Making MX silos more secure from nearby nuclear airbursts has considerable military significance. General Fornell and Colonel McMains acknowledged that ground-burst explosions would create very large craters that would probably destroy one or more nearby silos. Said to Bar Cratering Attack But Colonel McMains said an enemy ''can't do a cratering attack'' in a closely spaced MX base. ''If he does that he is locked out for several hours'' in trying to continue the attack, he said. The two officers said the large amounts of earth thrown into the sky by a cratering attack would deflect or destroy any Soviet warheads arriving for a minimum of two hours later. The officers described, in general terms, some of the techniques that would be used in strengthening the MX silos. These include careful choice of geological conditions, including dry, sandy soil and certain bedrock and water table levels. Solid steel walls, probably in layers, and greater steel reinforcement of concrete are also envisioned. A major element, they said, would be designing what is called ''deformable headworks'' near the top of the silo or capsule. This, they explained, would enable the capsule to undergo controlled, planned-for crushing that would not destroy the missile and its cannister. The MX will be launched inside a barrel-like metal cannister that will pop out of the silo before the rocket motors fire. The long, slender shape of the field would consist, the officers said, of rows of two silos, then three, then two, then three and so forth. Each silo would be about 1,800 feet from its neighbors, and seen from above all but silos on the edges of the field would have six neighbors arranged in a hexagonal shape around it. The field would be aligned north to south, along the expected trajectory of incoming enemy missiles. Would Force a Longer Attack ''It will compound fratricide and force the Soviet planners to pace an attack over time,'' said General Fornell, asserting that this would make for ''survivable'' basing for the missile. Suvivability of the new missile has been a controversial and major element of debate over whether to build it. Dr. Garwin and other critics of closely spaced basing have argued that there may be a number of ways for the Soviet Union to overcome it. Most of them involve achieving simultaneous explosion of groups of incoming warheads so fratricide will not occur. But General Fornell said Air Force studies indicated that achieving such simultaneous explosions was not technologically possible now.

535-> PRIVATE COLLEGES REPORT DROP OF 3.8% IN FRESHMAN CLASSES
Full-time freshman enrollment at the nation's private colleges and universities is down 3.8 percent this fall, an academic research group has found. The National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities said Thursday that its survey indicated the overall enrollment on private campuses was down by less than 1 percent because of a surge in part-time undergraduates. John Phillips, the president of the institute and its companion association of 1,500 private colleges and universities, said the freshman figures pointed to an ominous trend. ''It is clear that the sluggish economy combined with Federal cuts in student aid and the threat of deeper cuts are forcing new students to abandon their plans to attend independent colleges,'' he said. ''Instead, they are postponing their higher education or, more often, opting for less expensive, government-run institutions.'' Data From 1,200 Campuses The institute surveyed its 1,500 members and got enrollment data from nearly 1,200 of them. Julianne Still Thrift, the institute's executive director, said the drop of 3.8 percent in full-time, firsttime freshmen meant that there were about 16,000 fewer freshmen on those campuses this year. That will translate to a loss of $250 million in tuition revenue in the next four years for the private colleges, she said. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that enrollment at all colleges rose this fall by 100,000 to a record 12.5 million students. It said that 2.75 million of those students, or 22 percent, attended private colleges. The institute said its survey found that full-time private undergraduate enrollment was down 1.35 percent; part-time undergraduates, up 2.8 percent; professional degree students, up 0.5 percent, and all graduate students, down 0.65 percent. Over all, enrollment on private campuses fell 0.8 percent. Sixty-three percent of the colleges reported declines in enrollment, including a third where the freshman class shrank by more than 10 percent. Freshman enrollment was up at 37 percent of the campuses, Declines in East The regional losses in freshmen enrollments were most severe in the Middle West, where enrollment was down 5.6 percent, and the Middle Atlantic states, where it fell 6.1 percent. Freshmen enrollments fell 2 percent in the Northeast, 1.8 percent in the South and 2.1 percent in the West. Comprehensive private colleges and universities and less selective liberal arts campuses suffered the deepest losses, more than 5 percent. The College Board estimates that it costs $7,475 in tuition, room, board, books and supplies to attend the average residential private college this fall. The comparable figure for public colleges is $4,388.

536-> FEW SURPRISES EXPECTED IN CITY COUNCIL ELECTIONS
Voters will select 35 district members for the City Council next week, but only a handful of the incumbents have challengers strong enough to threaten them, according to Council and city officials. There will be new faces on the Council, though, because two incumbents did not seek re-election, and three others lost in last month's Democratic primaries, although one of the three is running on the Liberal line. In addition, the Council added two new district seats. Democrats hold 32 of the 33 existing district seats on the Council, and they seem assured of maintaining firm control. The Democratic primary winners in the two new districts - one in Queens and one covering parts of Staten Island and Brooklyn - are also given excellent chances of victory. Moreover, the lone Republican holding a district seat, Angelo J. Arculeo of Brooklyn, has a Democatic challenger, Sal F. Albanese, who some officials believe is capable of winning. Although Mr. Arculeo has represented the 31st District, centered on Bay Ridge, for 20 years, the new district lines adopted by the Council eliminated the Staten Island part of his district. The Staten Island area was long an important part of his Republican majority. Changes Favor Challenger In addition, the area in the Brooklyn portion of the district is changing; the neighborhood has attracted more-affluent, younger people, generally considered more liberal. This is thought to favor Mr. Albanese, who won the Democratic primary and also holds the Liberal party nomination. In addition to the Republican line on the ballot, Mr. Arculeo holds the Conservative and Right to Life nominations. On the other hand, a Republican, David A. Goldstein, is given a chance by many Council members and observers of winning the Seventh District, on Manhattan's Upper East Side. A good part of the district coincides with the districts of Representative Bill Green and State Senator Roy M. Goodman, both Republicans. Mr. Goldstein, who also has the Liberal line, and the Democratic incumbent, Robert J. Dryfoos, are each spending about $75,000 in a campaign that has been expensive and bitter. The two men have traded harsh personal charges, and several weeks ago aides for each of them had a brief scuffle. Mr. Goldstein has filed a lawsuit that says Mr. Dryfoos is guilty of official misconduct, while Mr. Dryfoos says that Mr. Goldstein's campaign literature is libelous and that he will sue. Primaries May Be Springboards Other races generally involve incumbents running against relative unknowns, although some of the challengers are hoping that they earned enough recognition in the Democratic primary to pull off upsets in the general election by running on the Liberal line. In Brooklyn's 30th District, for example, Thomas J. Cuite, the majority leader since 1969, must run again against Stephen DiBrienza, whom he narrowly defeated in the Democratic primary. Mr. DiBrienza, a local district leader, is running on the Liberal line; Mr. Cuite also has the Conservative and Right to Life nominations. The Republican candidate is Anna Walsh. The incumbents defeated in the primaries were Leon A. Katz of Brooklyn, Gilberto Gerena-Valentin of the Bronx and Robert Rodriguez of Manhattan. Mr. Gerena-Valentin narrowly lost the initial primary, but the courts ordered a second primary because of voting irregularities. He lost by a substantial margin the second time to Rafael Castaneira Colon, who has the backing of the county organization and the Liberal nomination. Mr. Katz, now the incumbent in the 24th District, was solidly defeated by Noach Dear in the 31st District primary. Because he had no other lines, Mr. Katz will be out of the Council. Confident Despite Loss Mr. Rodriguez has said he believes he can win the 8th District, which covers a sliver of the South Bronx in addition to part of Upper Manhattan, by running on the Liberal line. He lost the primary in the traditionally Hispanic district to Carolyn Maloney, who is white. The question of the racial composition of the Council is an important one, if only because the Justice Department ruled last year that the Council had been unfair to minority voters in its initial redistricting. The Federal action caused last year's elections to be postponed, and the members have remained in place. The Department said the Council, which has eight minority members, could redraw its lines to give black and Hispanic candidates good chances of winning 12 districts. Based on the primary results, Council leaders now believe that the number of minorities will increase by only one, to nine. In another indication of the Council's scrambled election calendar, this year's ballot does not include races for the 10 at-large members. Federal Judge Edward R. Neaher in Brooklyn has ruled that the present system of electing two members from each borough violates the United States Constitution's provision of one man, one vote because of the wide disparities in the boroughs' populations. At-Large Members Remain Judge Neaher has left the fate of the at-large members to the Charter Revision Commission, which is expected to make its recommendations next spring. The current at-large members remain on the Council in the meantime. The two incumbents who did not seek re-election were Stephen B. Kaufman of the Bronx and Theodore Silverman of Brooklyn. Both men charged that their county leaders used redistricting to force them out of the Council. Like Mr. Katz, both Mr. Kaufman and Mr. Silverman were committee chairmen - Mr. Katz of Governmental Operations, Mr. Kaufman of Education and Mr. Silverman of Rules, Privileges and Elections. A scramble for those positions is expected. The advantages of chairmanship are several, including directing investigations of mayoral agencies and being paid several thousand dollars a year above the Council salary of $35,000. Other committee changes are likely also as members seek to get on committees that interest them more than their current positions. No major moves are thought to be in the offing, however, unless Mr. Cuite should lose his seat.

537-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Choice Draftee
When the North American Soccer League has its annual draft of college and high school players tomorrow in New York, one of the early selections is expected to be Gerry Reardon of Adelphi. Reardon, a 5-foot-8-inch, 135-pound sweeper, has several elements working against him in the draft, but is expected to overcome them simply on the basis of his superb skills. The 22-year-old standout, who placed third behind Joe Ulrich of Duke and Gregg Thompson of Indiana in the voting for the Hermann Award, given annually to the best college soccer player, was born near London to Irish parents. N.A.S.L. teams must carry at least four American citizens, so foreign nationals have traditionally done poorly in the draft because there are so many other foreign players from whom to choose. Another handicap for Reardon was the 6-12-2 record of Adelphi. Last week four scouting directors of N.A.S.L. teams previewed the draft by releasing their combined guess of the order of selection. On that list, Reardon tied for third with Billy McKeon of St. Louis. Thompson was first and Ulrich second. ''That scouts' preview is good news to me,'' Reardon said last week from Tulsa where he was the outstanding offensive player yesterday in the Senior Bowl Soccer Classic. ''Because I played on a losing team, I didn't think too many people would consider me. Playing professional soccer for a while before I go to law school is appealing to me.'' When he was 16 years old, Reardon was touring in Connecticut with an English team when he was spotted by a soccer buff who called Bob Montgomery, the coach at Adelphi, and recommended that Adelphi pursue him. Montgomery checked with some friends in England and then, sight unseen, awarded Reardon an athletic scholarship. ''He's the best player I have coached in college,'' said Montgomery, ''and definitely the top college player I have seen in the last few years. He has an excellent left foot, possesses deceptive acceleration and reads the game so well that he seems to be two jumps ahead of everyone else on the field. In addition, he's a dean's list student.'' Reardon was voted to the all-America team in his freshman year and received honorable mention as a sophomore. Strained ligaments in his knee limited his play in his junior year, but he returned in fine form as a senior. Thomas Rogers

538-> STANFORD WINS; MARYLAND VICTOR
Willie Joyner, a running back who lost his starting job a week ago, came back today and scored two touchdowns in leading Maryland to a 31-24 upset victory over North Carolina before 51,319 stunned fans at Kenan Stadium. North Carolina (5-2) entered the game ranked first among major colleges in rushing defense (43 yards a game) and total defense (155.7). The longest gain it had allowed was a 24-yard pass by Vanderbilt. Joyner, a junior from Lafayette High School in Brooklyn, had a big day, rushing for 240 yards. He led the Terrapins on three consecutive scoring drives in the second half. The victory, its sixth straight since nonconference opening losses to Penn State and West Virginia, put Maryland in position to challenge Clemson for the Atlantic Coast Conference title. The Terrapins have capitalized on an explosive, unpredictable offense and a defense especially tough against the run. ''It was the biggest win I've been associated with,'' said the first-year coach, Bobby Ross, who served four years as an assistant with the Kansas City Chiefs. ''I said this game would make or break our season.'' Trailing by 17-10 with 5 minutes 44 seconds remaining in the third quarter, Maryland began the winning drives that spanned only nine plays, eight of them runs. The first run was a short burst up the middle by Dave D'Addio, the fullback. On the next play, the 5-foot-10-inch, 196-pound Joyner broke round right end, shed several tackles and raced 55 yards before being dragged down from behind. D'Addio then took a pitchout 18 yards round left end for the tying touchdown. The drive lasted 56 seconds. Tar Heels Strike Back Carolina, which had entered the contest with the nation's fourthbest offense, responded with a 12-play, 75-yard march that culminated with Rod Elkins's third touchdown pass of the day. It was a 3-yarder to the tailback Kelvin Bryant with 14:50 left in the game. Brooks Barwick's extra point made the score 24-17. With Maryland behind for the third time, Joyner ran for 5 yards and the quarterback Norm (Boomer) Esiason passed for 16 to Rick Badanjek. Then, on first down at the Carolina 49, Joyner swept over right tackle, cut to the sideline and outraced the defenders to the end zone. Carolina moved to the Maryland 35, then had to punt. Joyner and his mates quickly decided the issue. Facing third-and-1 at his 16, Esiason handed off to Joyner on a slant off left tackle. A blitz was on, and Joyner, once past the line of scrimmage, had virtually clear sailing on an 84-yard touchdown sprint. Jeff Atkinson's 42d consecutive extra point made it 31-24. Surprised by His Speed ''Joyner probably surprised us with his speed and his explosiveness,'' said Carolina's defensive coordinator, Denny Marcin. ''There were holes and I just went through them,'' said Joyner, who went into the game as Maryland's leading rusher with 474 yards. ''Everybody played as if this was the last game of their career.'' Joyner's rushing total was 18 yards short of the total rushing yardage compiled by Carolina's six preceeding opponents, including Pittsburgh. Bryant, a senior plagued with injuries throughout his career, gained 130 yards on 34 carries, bringing his career total to 2,722 yards.

539-> RANGERS TOP LEAFS IN 6-5 SEESAW GAME
In a brief flashback to the heyday of their partnership on ice, Ulf Nilsson and Anders Hedberg combined to produce the winning goal for the Rangers last night. New York beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 6-5, at Madison Square Garden, for their seventh victory in the last nine games. Nilsson, who is 32 years old, and Hedberg, who is 31, were highscoring linemates for the Winnipeg Jets of the World Hockey Association before they came to the Rangers in 1978. But injuries to both have cut their ice time with the Rangers. This season, Nilsson had played only two shifts since the seventh game, until last night. Bounces Off Goalie Late in the third period, he was centering on the power play because Mark Pavelich's flu worsened, and he had to stop playing. From the right side of the goal, Nilsson fired a pass toward the slot that deflected off the stick of Michel (Bunny) Larocque, Toronto's goalie, to Hedberg, who lifted it into the net with 5:02 left. With 24 seconds left, a shot by Toronto's John Anderson beat the Ranger goalie, Steve Weeks, but hit the right post. After that, the Rangers managed to hold off the Leafs, whose streak without a victory on the road stretched to 24 games (0-21-3). ''It seemed like the last shot was going to win it, and that's not a fun kind of game,'' said Nilsson, who also scored a goal. It was the one that gave New York a 2-1 lead early in the second period, but by the end of the game it seemed like a distant memory because the lead had changed hands 10 times. The Maple Leafs had beaten the Islanders at home the night before, and they played much better in this game than they had in their first two losses to the Rangers. Last night, the Rangers' lackluster first-period performance brought harsh words from their coach, Herb Brooks. 'An Absolute Disgrace' ''I told them the first period was an absolute disgrace, a disgrace to the National Hockey League's caliber of play, a disgrace to our team and a disgrace to our players' God-given abilities,'' said Brooks. ''We've made mistakes this season, but they've been errors of commission instead of omission. Tonight, they were errors of omission.'' Brooks made essentially the same comments to the team between the first and second periods. ''He said, 'I don't want to come in here and start yelling and screaming like an idiot, but I want to say the first period was a disgrace, and you should know it,' '' said Nilsson. ''There's a lot of talented players here, and on paper, we should beat Toronto,'' said Barry Beck. ''But you've got to be ready to play. We're not so good we can go out and just go through the motions. We've got to work hard against every team, no matter who it is.'' PICK UP ADD F.S. RANGERS Hedberg on Hot Streak Hedberg is one Ranger who has been working hard. Last night's gamewinning goal was his second goal of the game; he has six goals and nine assists in the last 10 games. A Toronto power-play goal by Walt Poddubny tied the score, 3-3, late in the second. Mike Rogers got his 14th goal 1:25 into the third period. That encouraged the Rangers, who believe their conditioning has helped them near the end of close games. This time, though, they let the Leafs score again 20 seconds later, as Peter Ihnacak pounced on a loose puck for his second goal of the game. Don Maloney broke the 4-4 tie with his 14th goal, but 1 minute 22 seconds later, John Anderson tied it at 5-5. Didn't Help His Average ''It seemed like every time I wanted to make a big save, bing!, the puck went in the net instead,'' said Steve Weeks, who allowed five goals on only 28 shots and now has a 4.33 goals-against average. ''I don't think I came up with the big saves when I should have.'' ''I don't think a game like this was fair to Weeksie,'' said Nilsson. ''I'm just glad that at least we won it.'' Nilsson has missed 18 of the season's 27 games, first with a groin-muscle pull, then with the flu. He was scheduled to be sent to the Rangers' affiliate in Tulsa this week to get back into shape. But with Pavelich's condition uncertain, Brooks said Nilsson will probably go with the team on its two-game road trip, to meet Chicago Wednesday night and Washington Friday night. Pat Conacher (sprained shoulder) might be able to play Wednesday night. Brooks said Eddie Johnstone (bruised pelvic bone) probably would be able to play by Friday night.

540-> ELECTION IN SRI LANKA CAPITALISM VERSUS SOCIALISM
The eight million voters of this tropical island republic will choose in Wednesday's presidential election between free-wheeling, high-growth capitalism and something very near to a classic form of welfare socialism. Seldom has the choice between the two basic, alternative approaches to economic development in the third world been so clearly cut. Sri Lanka has tried both and each is seen as having demonstrated virtues and faults. At the same time, the election is the first referendum in this part of the world on the replacement of the parliamentary form of democracy inherited from the British, in which control is in the hands of a Prime Minister and Cabinet responsible to Parliament, by a presidential system, in which power is held by a strong, independently elected central executive. Proponents of the change say it is intended to impart more stability to an oscillating political system that up until now has seen the incumbent national leader turned out of office in all but one of this country's last seven elections. Incumbent President Favored Should President J.R. Jayewardene, the 76-year-old incumbent, win a six-year term in Wednesday's election, he will be seen as having a mandate to continue the westward-looking capitalistic policies that are widely credited with having transformed the economy of the country since he turned it away from low-growth, welfare socialism five years ago. Mr. Jayewardene, who is known familiarly as ''J.R.,'' is favored to defeat his principal opponent, Hector Kobbekaduwa, a leftist, in a six-candidate race. Mr. Kobbekaduwa has pledged to do away with the presidential system and return to a parliamentary democracy if he wins. He would also be expected to undo as much of the capitalist revolution as possible. President Jayewardene is not regarded as being totally safe from Mr. Kobbekaduwa's challenge, because a number of segments of the population have been hurt by the abrupt economic shift that he has brought about. For years until 1977, Sri Lanka operated as a socialist welfare state. The Government owned many industries. Its basic policy was to redistribute wealth from the richer to the poorer strata of society at the expense of the investment that spurs economic growth. It provided universal free education and medical care and subsidized food for the poor. It restricted imports and imposed price controls. Economy Stagnated But by 1977, under the leftist Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, the economy had stagnated so badly that severe food shortages were the rule. Families commonly had to rise at 4.30 in the morning to stand in long lines. Unemployment was rife, with rates soaring to well over 20 percent. In that year, Mr. Jayewardene's United National Party won a fivesixths majority in Parliament, defeating Mrs. Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party. With such an overwhelming mandate, Mr. Jayewardene moved to reverse the Bandaranaike Government's policies. He ended a six-year state of emergency, under which civil rights had been abridged. He won adoption of a new Constitution, installing the presidential system, in 1978, and was named President. He severely crippled the opposition by stripping Mrs. Bandaranaike of all rights to political participation because of abuses of power. To spur the economy, the Jayewardene Government lifted price controls and cut business taxes. It removed import restrictions, so that industry could import materials and merchants could bring in consumer goods. It redirected Government expenditures from food and transport subsidies - while leaving free education and medical care alone - to capital investment in three major development projects aimed at facilitating long-term economic growth. These were a $2 billion hydroelectric and irrigation project, establishment of a free trade zone to attract foreign industrial investment and a major program of housing construction. Development Loans Obtained At the same time, it sought and received large development loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The results of these policies have been dramatic. Unemployment has been cut nearly in half. The food lines have long since disappeared. Businesses are flourishing. Stores are full of consumer goods. The very look of the place has become more Western. Brand names in stores read Schick, Gillette, Hoover, Heinz, Sanyo, Sony, Nescafe and Kraft. Tape cassettes of Village People, Rod Stewart, Crystal Gayle, Donna Summer and Pink Floyd sell briskly. But, although the positive results may have been dramatic, the economy has now overheated. Inflation has soared to the range of 20 to 40 percent. The poor, who no longer get food subsidies, are suffering. Civil servants, pensioners and others on fixed incomes have suffered a drop in purchasing power. The competition of food imports has hurt some farmers. Foreign-exchange and domestic budget deficits have mounted. Some cutting back is going to be necessary, the report says, and Sri Lanka is consequently ''entering a difficult period'' from which it could emerge a few years hence ''with a strong foundation for future growth and stability.''

541-> TV: 'THE GREEN TABLE,' JOOSS'S ANTIWAR BALLET
''The Green Table,'' created by Kurt Jooss in Germany in 1932, was brought into the repertory of the Joffrey Ballet in 1967. The work remains one of the company's outstanding achievements, and it can be seen, tonight on public television's ''Dance in America'' series. Very likely the most powerful antiwar statement ever devised for dance, ''The Green Table'' was first presented in Paris at a choreography competition. The ballet won first prize. A year later, in 1933, Mr. Jooss was forced to flee Nazi Germany because he refused to purge his company of Jewish and half-Jewish members, among whom were F.A. Cohen, composer of the music for ''The Green Table.'' With one world war in the recent past and another looming on the horizon, Mr. Jooss constructed his work around the imagery of a medieval Totentanz, or Dance of Death, in which the figure of Death would dominate, stamping out the thumpingly irresistible rhythm of the ballet. He is the single grim victor in this ''Dance of Death in Eight Scenes.'' The choreography provides a superb example of the kind of ''expressive dance'' that was being championed by Mr. Jooss. The movement is as stylized as the form. The scenes evolve into a series of vivid tableaux, the carefully composed images at times seeming to be frozen for an eternity. Except for an occasional prop, the stage is bare. The music is played on a piano only. In the first scene, a diplomatic conference is taking place around a large table covered with a regulation green cloth. The diplomats wear masks. Formal courtesy competes with threatening gestures until finally war is declared. Death appears, beginning his hypnotic dance. The standard scenario unfolds, from the stirring call to arms to eventual devastation on the battlefield. The final scene returns to the conference table, where the diplomats resume going through the same grisly charades of negotiation. The basic conception is all the more powerful for being so stunningly simple - and therefore, very suited to the small television screen. In this Joffrey production, Death is danced by Philip Jerry. Gary Chryst, a company veteran, is impressively silky as the Profiteer. But for the most part, this is an ensemble effort, and the entire cast is given an opportunity to excel. The dancers and the dance have been served well by ''Dance in America.'' Judy Kimberg was the producer, Emile Ardolino the director. Robert Joffrey and Anna Mackard, daughter of Mr. Jooss, served as consultants. The 40-minute performance is followed by a biographical profile of Mr. Jooss. Written by Tobi Tobias, it is narrated by Michael Tolan. Mr. Jooss died in 1979 in an auto accident. Only four of his ballets remain in repertory. While the others are minor, ''The Green Table'' is an indisputable masterpiece.

542-> SOCIAL SECURITY PANEL WARNS OF $150 BILLION 7-YEAR GAP
The 15 members of the National Commission on Social Security Reform agreed today that Congress must come up with $150 billion to $200 billion in cuts in benefits or in additional revenue for the Social Security program in the next seven years. But the bipartisan group put off the politically troublesome question of how to come up with the money for 1982 through 1989. The commission met in a Ramada Inn in Alexandria today, Veterans Day, because Federal buildings in Washington were closed to the public. President Reagan, in responding to a question relating to the commission at his news conference tonight, accused the Democrats of using the Social Security issue to frighten the elderly in the recent election campaign. He said the two parties needed to work together to solve the program's problems. At the commission meeting, Alan Greenspan, who was chief economic adviser to President Ford and who heads the panel, introduced a new idea into the debate on how to eliminate the deficit that has been draining the Social Security oldage trust fund, from which benefits are paid. Mr. Greenspan suggested that because projections of Social Security's revenue rest on economic assumptions that may prove to be faulty, the commission might propose to Congress that it adopt ''fail-safe mechanisms'' in addition to specific measures to eliminate the operating deficit. Congress Cool to Idea By that, Mr. Greenspan told reporters later, he meant ways to raise more revenue or reduce benefits that would take effect automatically if the old-age trust fund fell below a specified level. Congress has in the past been extremely reluctant to adopt such so-called economic triggers. Sources close to the commission said it was likely that the panel's final report to Congress and President Reagan, due by Dec. 31, would list various ways to end the deficit and would say the choice was essentially a political matter to be decided by the lawmakers. Some members of the panel, including Mr. Greenspan, have said the most useful thing the commission could do would be to give Congress an agreed appraisal of the size of the Social Security problem. The cash needs through 1989 are the short-term part of the problem. In addition, the commission discussed the outlook for 1990 to 2020 and the long-term prospect beyond 2020. Lobbyists representing the elderly, the United States Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, as well as Congressional aides, reporters and television camera crews, filled the ballroom used for the hearing. The tension that prevailed when the session started at 10:15 A.M. soon drained away as it became clear that the discussion was to be largely technical and unemotional, not political. Officially, the meeting was scheduled to continue Friday and Saturday, but aides said they doubted there would be a Saturday discussion. Need for Public Confidence In a low-key way, the members affirmed that part of their task was to help restore the confidence of the American public that Social Security will endure and that workers paying into the fund now will receive benefits when they retire. Representative Claude Pepper, the 82-year-old Florida Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, said people working now should be reassured that when they retire they will receive ''the level of benefits that prevails at the present time.'' The commission agreed that Congress should close a projected deficit in the old-age trust fund over the next 75 years as part of an effort to strengthen public confidence. The long-term deficit was projected as averaging 1.82 percent of taxable payrolls each year. So adding 1.82 percent to scheduled combined employer-employee taxes would produce the needed revenue. The present rate is 6.7 percent each for worker and employer. Thirteen of the members endorsed a proposition that Social Security be removed from the overall Federal budget to separate it from the annual Congressional budget exercise. Mr. Greenspan and Senator William L. Armstrong, Republican of Colorado and chairman of the Social Security subcommittee, expressed reservations but indicated they might join the majority Friday.

543-> Army Plans to Review Rules On Placing Ashes in Arlington
The Army is preparing to review its regulations for Arlington National Cemetery since the interment there of the ashes of a demonstrator who had threatened to blow up the Washington Monument. A Pentagon spokesman, Henry Catto, said today that the Army would review its regulations to preclude recurrence of interment of such a person in the nation's foremost military cemetery. The ashes of Norman David Mayer, fatally shot by the police Dec. 8, were put into a columbarium at the cemetery late last week over the protest of the Secretary of the Army, John Marsh. Mr. Marsh said that the Army had had no choice under existing regulations. The columbarium was opened in April 1980, with 5,000 niches. Eventually 50,000 niches will be provided.

544-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
HERE, in roughly ascending order of expensiveness, is a roundup of books that, whatever else their merits or flaws may be, seem plausible for proffering as gifts this year. Build Your Own World by I.J. Starworth (Perigee; paper, $14.95). The ultimate to date in build-it-yourself books, this is nothing but a straightforward 16-inch-diameter paper globe. Want to feel godlike? ''Place the Northern Hemisphere on the North Pole and, while supporting the outer surface with the fingers of one hand, with the other hand break the 24 equatorial tabs inward to a 45-degree angle. Set aside the Northern Hemisphere on the North Pole.'' Fishing Dry Flies for Trout on Rivers and Streams by Art Lee (Atheneum, 284 pages, $19.95). An excellent primer that emphasizes the basics without patronizing the reader, by one of the better young writer-anglers around. Under Sail: Equipment for the Serious Sailor, edited by Tony Meisel, illustrated by Peter Milne (Macmillan, 192 pages; $24.95). A kind of whole sea catalogue, this elegantly laid-out volume recommends the best of everything for sailboats from heads to cleats. No, I don't own a sailboat either, but it sure is fun to fantasize. Any or all of the volumes thus far available in the Library of America, the collected works of America's foremost authors in uniform hard-cover editions (Viking; $25 each). So far published are Herman Melville: Typee, Omoo, Mardi, edited by G. Thomas Tanselle (1,333 pages), Harriet Beecher Stowe: Three Novels, edited by Kathryn Kish Sklar (1,477 pages), Walt Whitman: Poetry and Prose, edited by Justin Kaplan (1,392 pages), Nathaniel Hawthorne: Tales and Sketches, edited by Roy Harvey Pearce (1,493 pages), Mark Twain: Mississippi Writings, edited by Guy Cardwell (1,084 pages), William Dean Howells: Novels, 1875-86, edited by Edwin H. Cady (1,217 pages), Jack London: Novels and Stories, edited by Donald Pizer (1,191 pages), and Jack London: Novels and Social Writings, edited by Donald Pizer (1,020 pages), with many yet to come. The only shame is that there never is time to sit down and read them all straight through. But in the meantime, these handsome compact volumes sure do look good up there on the shelf. Almost as good looking on the shelf, as well as satisfying to read, are the uniform volumes in Clarkson N. Potter's annotated series. Three additions this year, at $25 each, are The Annotated Mother Goose: Nursery Rhymes Old and New, arranged and explained by William S. Baring-Gould and Cecil Baring-Gould (350 pages), The Annotated Huckleberry Finn, with introduction, notes and bibliography by Michael Patrick Hearn (378 pages), and The Annotated Oscar Wilde: Poems, Fiction, Plays, Lectures, Essays and Letters, edited, with introduction and notes by H. Montgomery Hyde (487 pages). The three volumes would seem to cover a fairly wide spectrum of potential gift recipients. The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States by Eugene Ehrlich and Gorton Carruth (Oxford, 464 pages; $29.95). Hawaii? Rupert Brooke went to Oahu in 1913 and wrote the sonnet ''Waikiki,'' which is reprinted in the guide. Whittier, Calif.? Maxwell Anderson became head of the Whittier College English department in 1917. And Samuel Clemens was everywhere. Richly illustrated with photographs and carefully organized by regions, this guide reveals, among other curiosities, the peculiar restlessness of American writers. The American Medical Association Family Medical Guide, Dr. Jeffrey R.M. Kunz, editor in chief (Random House, 831 pages; $29.95). Divided into four sections - the healthy body, symptoms and self-diagnosis, diseases and other disorders and problems, and caring for the Sick - this indispensable and unusually lucid guide contains a staggering amount of welcome and unwelcome information. The two most presentable all-purpose food books this year seem to me Favorite Restaurant Recipes: 500 Unforgettable Dishes from the R.S.V.P. Column of Bon Appetit (Knapp, 248 pages; $25), which contains recipes for everything from the Coach House's unbeatable black-bean soup to Taillevent's spectacular vegetables in puff pastry with lobster sauce; and Entertaining by Martha Stewart (Potter-Crown, 310 pages; $35), which, aside from being generally intimidating in its lavishness and constituting a glorious advertisement for the author's catering concern, nevertheless contains a lot of good ideas for feeding large groups of people. The most appealing photographic book of the year seems to me Photography, History of an Art, by Jean-Luc Duval (Skira-Rizzoli, 269 pages; $60). The author is dean of the Ecole Superieure d'Art Visual in Geneva and a lecturer in art history of the University of Geneva, and his emphasis is on esthetics rather than technique. The most seductive art book is The World of Henri Rousseau by Yann le Pichon, translated by Joachim Neugroschel (Viking, 285 pages; $75), a psychological study of the great French painter, which concludes that far from being a great naif, the douanier was a selftaught professional who worked in the mainstream of avant-garde French culture. Finally, to go from the sublime to the comics, let me recommend as a gift to the child in all of us who grew up in the 1940's or 50's Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge McDuck, His Life and Times, written and drawn by Carl Barks (Celestial Arts, Millbrae, Calif., 374 pages; $159.95). Twelve episodes are gloriously recolored in the life of Scrooge McDuck, that singular plutocrat created by Carl Barks, whom fans of Walt Disney Comics always referred to as ''the good artist.'' With autobiographical text and other personal comments. And a Merry Christmas.

545-> U.S. DRUG AGENTS ARREST 13 AFTER MAJOR HEROIN INQUIRY
Narcotics agents arrested 13 suspects in a series of raids in the New York area Wednesday night and yesterday morning in the culmination of a major 16-month undercover investigation of heroin trafficking by organized crime. Heroin sales in the millions of dollars, automobile chases and high-stakes gambling in an Atlantic City casino were all part of the investigation, according to the Federal arrest complaints filed in the case. Two suspects were arrested at First Avenue and 55th Street on Wednesday at 11:30 P.M. when ''they delivered approximately 20 pounds of pure heroin'' to an undercover agent who had arranged to buy it for $1.6 million, Federal authorities said. They added that ''the retail street value of the heroin was $20 million.'' The series of overnight arrests captured ''numerous high-level organized-crime heroin traffickers,'' according to a joint announcement by John S. Martin Jr., the United States Attorney in Manhattan, and Bruce E. Jensen, the head of the New York Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration. 'Major Blow' Against Trafficking William H. Webster, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in Washington that the investigation ''strikes a major blow'' at narcotics trafficking by organized crime. He added that more arrests were expected. ''These defendants have a history of violence and represent some of the country's major traffickers,'' Mr. Webster said. Mr. Webster went to the Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters for the announcement to emphasize the Reagan Administration's campaign against narcotics and organized crime. The ring was believed to have brought heroin into the country at a rate of 20 to 25 kilograms a week, said Kevin Gallagher, the heroinsection chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration. There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram. Members of the Bonanno and Lucchese ''crime families'' operated the ring, law enforcement authorities said. They added that the operation was a major source of heroin in the New York area. Confidential Informant Involved An undercover drug-enforcement agent, Gerald Franciosa, infiltrated the operation, according to the arrest complaints filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The complaints disclosed that the agent had been introduced to suspects by a confidential informant, who was identified only as ''Source No. 1.'' The investigation culminated Wednesday night when the arrests began with the two suspects accused of delivering 20 pounds of heroin on East 55th Street. They were identified as Oreste Abbamonte, 34 years old, of Port Washington, L.I., and Joseph Delvecchio, 39, of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. In addition to seizing the heroin, the arresting agents said, they found $23,000 in cash in the trunk of the Cadillac that Mr. Abbamonte had been driving. They also said he was carrying a loaded .38-caliber pistol when arrested. As he was being arrested, Mr. Abbamonte threatened the agent, a Federal prosecutor said yesterday afternoon at a long bail hearing for the suspects in Federal District Court. ''You are a dead man,'' the prosecutor, James B. Rather, quoted Mr. Abbamonte as having told the agent. ''I never said that,'' Mr. Abbamonte muttered in response. Magistrate Leonard Bernikow set bail of $1.5 million for Mr. Abbamonte and $1 million for Mr. Delvecchio. He set bail ranging from $5,000 to a high of $3 million for the others arrested. The highest bail was set for William J. Irizarry of Manhattan, a 56-year-old suspect regarded as a leader of the operation. His cousin, Frank Irizarry, also of Manhattan, was held in $200,000 bail. One Suspect Still Missing All the suspects were charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics. They included one woman, Bernice Castillo, 62, of Manhattan. The others were identified as Lorenzo Di Chiara, 43, of Brooklyn; Rafael Gonzales, 44, of Manhattan; Frank Genovese, 39, of Brooklyn; Armand Casoria, 62, of Fort Lee, N.J.; Benjamin Mallah, 57, of Manhattan; Gerald Salerno, 52, of Dix Hills, L.I.; Anthony Torres, 60, of the Bronx, and Frank Fuentes, 52, of Manhattan. A missing suspect, Francisco Solimene, lost large amounts of cash gambling at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, the arrest complaints said. The complaints added that the undercover agent had seen him on Sept. 22 ''betting thousands of dollars on a roll of the dice.'' Mr. Solimene, who later disappeared, told the agent that he had lost more than $100,000 in that one day and ''over $1.5 million at this casino in one year.'' Much of the money belonged to his heroin source, he told the agent. He also told the agent that organizedcrime figures ''told me, if I don't stop gambling, they will kill me.''

547-> LAPCHICK TOURNEY RULED BY ST. JOHN'S
Lou Carnesecca, the St. John's basketball coach, says, ''I'm happy that the Army can still keep some secrets,'' but he would prefer to know more about the West Point team that is in the Lapchick tournament starting tonight at Alumni Hall in Queens. ''We haven't scouted Army, we haven't seen them,'' he said of the Cadets, who have a new coach and presumably a new style. ''After the first jump ball, they may sock us so hard they'll bring us down to earth.'' Carnesecca has warned his players of the imponderables all week in an effort to temper their confidence after the 78-74 victory over North Carolina, the defending national champion, last Saturday in their season debut. But he himself finds it difficult to believe that Army, St. Mary's of California or Ohio University will be able to run with his seasoned, nationally ranked squad. St. John's and Army start at 7 P.M., followed by St. Mary's and Ohio in the eighth edition of the tournament, named for Joe Lapchick, the late St. John's coach. The finalists meet tomorrow night about 9 o'clock, after the playoff for third place. St. John's has won the tournament all seven previous years. Counting on Freshmen The visiting teams, in one way or another, approach the prospect of playing St. John's as ''a great opportunity.'' Translation: ''It's nice to visit New York.'' ''Not everybody gets a chance to play a team ranked so high,'' said Les Wothke, the new Army coach. ''Unfortunately we're starting our season against the best. If we don't go out and get intimidated right away, maybe we can play with them. It's a game of psychological factors when you play at St. John's. All my players watch TV, and most of them can read; they know that St. John's is loaded.'' The Redmen have such offensive stalwarts as David Russell, Billy Goodwin and Chris Mullin. ''We'll count a lot on our freshmen,'' said Wothke. ''Randy Cozzens, a 6-5 sophomore, will give us our scoring punch, and Paul Mongan, our only senior, provides the maturity and leadership we must have.'' Howard Harband, an assistant coach at St. Mary's, also speaks of the ''privilege'' of playing St. John's. ''It will be a great chance for our players to face a team of that caliber,'' he said. ''But we're not looking past Ohio. ''Our coach, Bill Oats, has been on the job 20 years and prides himself as an outstanding defensive teacher. We also have a legitimate all-America candidate in Peter Thibeaux. At 6-6 and 220 pounds, he's a great candidate for the pros.'' Ohio Is Experienced Coach Danny Nee, a Brooklyn native who played at Power Memorial in the era of Lew Alcindor (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), has an experienced Ohio squad, with 12 lettermen and four starters from last year. The leader is John Devereaux, a junior center who ranked 13th in the nation in blocked shots last season and won honorable mention on the Mid-American Conference all-star team. Carnesecca hopes to correct a flaw he detected in the game against North Carolina. ''Too many turnovers,'' he said. ''We've got to do a better job with that and with boxing out. But I have a lot of kids who've been in pressure games, very unselfish kids. I think they can come through.''

550-> Braniff Is Allowed To Keep Terminal
A Federal judge has upheld a ruling that the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport board cannot evict grounded Braniff International from its terminal, cargo building, maintenance hanger and other facilities. The board had argued that it needed to reassign the facilities to other airlines to insure efficient use of the airport. Braniff attorneys said the terminal was essential to the success of any reorganization of the airline, and noted that Pacific Southwest Airlines, which plans to lease some of Braniff's planes, may use gates in the Braniff terminal. Federal District Judge Eldon Mahon, acting Monday, refused to set aside a ruling that Braniff had not violated its lease agreements.

552-> SOUND; A NEW CIRCUIT BROADENS A RECORDER'S SONIC RANGE
It seems historically appropriate that one of the most remarkable cassette recorders made today is of Danish origin. After all, it was a Dane - Hans Christian Oersted - who first discovered the relation between electricity and magnetism back in 1820, and yet another Dane - Valdemar Poulsen - who invented magnetic recording at the end of the last century. Poulsen's primitive device, using piano wire magnetized by the voice current from a telephone, emitted only feeble sounds and could not compete for popular acclaim at the time with Edison's blaring tin horn. Still, it established the principle of recording sound in the form of electrically induced magnetic patterns; and though scarcely remembered today, Poulsen knew a moment of glory when his invention was shown at the Paris World's Fair of 1900 and caught the fancy of the visiting emperor of Austria. It is ironic that Franz Joseph, that venerable monarch who so resented the intrusions of modernity into his ancient realm that he never spoke on the telephone or rode in a motor car, thus became the first ruler to preserve his voice through the medium of electrical recording. Eight decades later, Bang & Olufsen's unique Beocord 9000 proves that the Danes still lead the field. This unique design incorporates an exclusive circuit that enables cassettes to carry musical signals of greater dynamic range than has so far been feasible. In essence, the method is a variant of the well-known Dolby principle designated as Dolby HX PRO. Born of a collaborative engineering effort and cross-licensing of patents between Bang & Olufsen and Dolby Laboratories, the HX PRO tackles an obstinate bottleneck in cassette recording: the tendency to overload the tape (with attendant distortion) when the upper frequencies reach high levels of loudness. The new circuit monitors the music being recorded and, whenever it detects potentially distortive elements, it automatically compensates for this by continuously readjusting bias and equalization. More of the music can thus be fitted within the load capacity of the tape. A trumpet call or cymbal crash with its added burden of strong upper frequencies thus receives different electronic treatment than, say, a subdued string passage. The result is that a wider range of sonic intensities can be imparted to the tape. In effect, the HX PRO extracts better performance from any tape formulation than one would normally expect from it, and even an ordinary (and inexpensive) ferric tape sounds almost as well on the Beocord 9000 as a premium chrome tape. As with many recent advances in sound technology, the audible improvement is subtle rather than dramatic. Given the generally high level of technical achievement in any good audio equipment today, it stands to reason that increments in quality are necessarily small. Even so, the Beocord 9000 achieves the sort of sound seldom heard from cassettes. Thanks to the dynamic margin provided by Dolby HX PRO at the upper end of the frequency spectrum, there is a feeling of natural openness, of unforced brilliance, and an eminently satisfying absence of tonal constriction even in the more climactic aspects of music. Another unique feature of the Beocord 9000 is that it analyzes its own distortion. This is rather like a jogger taking his own pulse and adjusting his running speed accordingly. The Beocord 9000 compares what has actually gone on the tape with a self-generated reference signal. A built-in computer than uses this information to automatically reset the recording-level meters so that their zero point represents the true permissible limit of recording level for the tape type actually in use. In other words, the meter doesn't just guess the signal strength the tape will accept. It measures the tape's actual response in terms of resultant distortion. Consequently, the meter reading remains accurate and reliable no matter what tape is being used. Combined with other forms of automatic analysis which accomplish all the necessary adjustments for whatever tape type is placed in the recorder, this automatic meter calibration means, in effect, that the Beocord 9000 just won't let you do a bad recording job. This is not to say that the Beocord 9000 is simple. It is, after all, a machine intended for knowledgeable listeners who demand flexibility of functions and are not likely to be intimidated by an elaborate set of controls. In any case, an uncommon extent of computer-aided automation makes the many control options quite easy to use after an initial period of familiarization. For example, a single touch suffices to initiate and complete all functions of tape analysis, and a real-time counter indicates the time elapsed in a recording or the time remaining on the tape. The same timing mechanism also lets you locate and cue up, to the precise second, any point on the tape. Another useful and unusual control automatically returns the tape to the beginning of the last selection recorded - extremely convenient if you want to do a retake. In addition to its unique Dolby HX PRO, this model also features the standard Dolby formats (B and C) so as to be compatible with other recorders and also has an ajustable head, enabling the listener to compensate for tapes made on other machines whose heads may possibly have been misaligned. Basic performance specifications are what one would expect of a deck that unabashedly aims for the ultimate, and the only fly to be found in this particular ointment is the lack of facilities for off-the-tape monitoring. The originality of thought and overall level of refinement evident in this recorder are reflected in its $1,800 price tag. Clearly this is not an item for casual hobbyists but a design that probes the limits of technical possibility, has few peers and no betters. And, as with anything made by Bang & Olufsen, it is a joy to look at.

553-> Technology; Toxic Waste Disposal
AS public fear mounts over industrial waste buried in landfills, and as regulation of the construction of landfills is toughened, many companies are investing heavily in new technologies for waste disposal. The Government estimates that chemical companies, textile manufacturers, metal fabricators and other industrial concerns produce 43 million tons of hazardous waste a year. The waste includes several hundred substances that are easily combustible, extremely corrosive, highly toxic or poisonous, causing cancer or other diseases. These wastes do not include radioactive materials - which pose a separate set of problems. The magnitude of the problem was reflected this month by Anne M. Gorsuch, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, who called the nation's hazardous waste landfill sites ''ticking time bombs.'' On Dec. 20, the agency ordered 418 sites cleaned up, including 65 in New Jersey and 26 in New York. Few engineers believe landfills can be made completely safe unless they contain thick-walled subterranean vaults to contain the waste. Some toxics remain dangerous for centuries, and experts say the costs of landfills built to prevent leakage for that long would be very high. Thus, a growing number of companies are searching for ways to dispose of hazardous waste without burying it. The most important of these procedures include recycling the waste, incinerating the toxic materials and neutralizing dangerous components by altering their molecular or genetic structure. Paradoxically, tougher environmental laws have contributed to a rapid growth in industrial waste that requires special disposal: As industrial concerns were required to install more effective water treatment plants in the mid-1970's, they began to accumulate far greater amounts of hazardous materials filtered out of their waste water. Previously, these solid or sludgy hazardous materials had been allowed to flow into rivers, lakes or public sewer systems. Beginning next month, the Government will begin requiring all new hazardous waste landfill sites to be lined with plastic. Although the plastic liners are regarded by many as more effective and durable than the widely used clay insulation, they ''fall short of a perfect solution,'' said Michael Cook, deputy director of the E.P.A.'s office of solid wastes. ''The economics still favor land disposal,'' he added. ''But in an ideal world, we'd like to see landfills eliminated.'' Much of the effort to find alternative disposal methods is concentrated in the chemical industry, which produces 60 percent of the nation's hazardous wastes. The Monsanto Company, for example, produces dibasic acid, a highly toxic byproduct of the manufacture of herbicides. Until two years ago, the company said, it was disposing of the acid in a landfill, but Monsanto has since found that the toxic substance is effective in removing the environmentally hazardous sulfur emissions from power plants. As a result, the company now turns over some of the dibasic acid to Cities Utilities of Springfield, Mo., to be used in the scrubbers for the utility's smokestacks. Other companies are expanding their use of large incinerators to burn hazardous wastes. The Dow Chemical Company, a leader in incineration technology, said it used landfills for only 1 percent of the hazardous waste retained as byproducts of the petrochemicals, plastics, solvents and other chemicals it makes. Dow said most of the waste that must be disposed of was burned in a large rotary kiln incinerator at its Midland, Mich., plant. Allan Wolf, a company spokesman, said the incinerator resembled a large, revolving tank on the bed of a cement mixing truck. It rotates constantly to enable extremely high heat to be distributed evenly through the materials being burned. The ashes, which retain some toxicity, are disposed of in a landfill, Mr. Wolf said. Incineration, however, is largely limited to treating hazardous substances that contain organic or flammable materials. Many waste materials, such as the dangerously toxic metallic residue left over after metal plating and steel fabrication, cannot now be incinerated effectively. A more advanced and potentially more effective solution may result from genetic engineering. And a number of companies are experimenting with altering the molecular structure of hazardous wastes so their toxic properties can be consumed by bacteria or other organisms. The Batelle Memorial Institute, a nonprofit research organization, said it began working in this area after examining disposal sites in Georgia that contained large quantities of the highly toxic 2-4-D herbicide used in World War II. In the more than three decades since the herbicide was buried, Batelle scientists found, bacteria in the soil had transformed and consumed a large part of the toxic material. Potentially ''every organic or inorganic material'' would be subject to a similar process if its chemical properties could be transformed through molecular or genetic engineering, asserted Anthony Dennis, Batelle's manager of medical molecular biology research. He added that future disposal might involve above-ground tanks in which bacteria devoured the toxic components in waste, or larger landfills in which the bacteria or other organisms were altered genetically to consume the toxicity of wastes deposited.

554-> JEWISH DAY SCHOOL ENROLLMENT RISING
Bolstered by an influx of immigrants and a renewed interest in religious education by young Jewish couples, enrollment at Jewish day schools in the New York area has been rising for the first time in a decade, according to a group that monitors Jewish education. The group, the Board of Jewish Education of Greater New York, says the number of students attending the day schools, called yeshivas, has increased 12 percent in the last two years. The schools devote half the day to teaching Jewish studies and half to a secular curriculum that parallels that of the public schools. ''We wanted a school that gave our kids a sense of who they are, to know what being Jewish is all about,'' said Margy-Ruth Davis, who has two children in a Manhattan yeshiva and who runs a Jewish education program for adults. ''We also want them to contribute to the American way of life, so we looked for an education that would also prepare them for college and teach them about American culture.'' Attended by 60,000 The 197 day schools in New York City and Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties have an enrollment of 60,000, an estimated 20 percent of Jewish children of school age, according to the Board of Jewish Education of Greater New York. It said that about 75 percent of the students came from Orthodox Jewish families, 10 percent from Conservative families, 2 percent from Reform families and 13 percent from nonobservant Jewish families. All the yeshivas require students to learn Hebrew, although secular courses are taught in English. In some schools, such subjects as sex education are taught and classes are coeducational. In addition, higher education is a goal and students are not discouraged from being active members of the non-@Jewish community. In the more traditional schools known as ''ultra-Orthodox,'' the sexes are separated, higher education is discouraged and graduates mingle with the outside world only enough to earn a living. ''We teach them you can be a good, ultra-Orthodox Jew and a computer programmer,'' said Rabbi Moses Kessler, the principal of the Bobover yeshivas in Brooklyn. ''If college would be only for education and not mixed up with social life and all kind of leisure, we would encourage,'' Rabbi Kessler said. ''We feel colleges, coed and the way they smoke pot and use low language, is definitely not for our children.'' Male students at the Bobover schools are taught some vocational subjects, in addition to computer programming, including accounting and diamond cutting. ''Why not be up-to-date?'' Rabbi Kessler said. In high school, girls are taught cooking and sewing along with academic subjects. The increase in enrollment at yeshivas comes as many public school systems in the area are experiencing a drop in students and as enrollment at other private schools has remained stable. One reason enrollment has risen at the day schools is the return of a ''surprisingly large number of young Jews'' to Orthodox Judaism, according to Dr. Norman Lamm, the president of Yeshiva University, which runs two day schools in Manhattan. For these young parents, he said, ''there's been an intensification of Jewish feeling - taking religion more seriously than in the 1960's.'' And the parents have been sending their children to the yeshivas. Dr. Alvin I. Schiff, the executive vice president of the Board of Jewish Education, said that the high birth rate among Orthodox Jewish couples was also a factor in the rising enrollment. Another factor is the influx of immigrant children, who are actively recruited through programs in synagogues and community centers. About 4,000 Soviet children, 2,500 Israelis and 500 Iranians are in yeshivas in the New York area, according to the Board of Jewish Education. Despite the increase in enrollment, the day schools are plagued with problems common to other private schools - keeping tuition costs down and teacher salaries up. About 65 percent of students do not pay full tuition, which averages $2,500. Extensive Financial Aid Tuition at the Ramaz School on the Upper East Side, for instance, ranges from $1,800 a year for nursery school to $4,800 a year for high school. Fifty-three percent of the students receive some financial aid, according to the school. With an annual budget of $2.5 million, it must raise a substantial sum each year. Finances are also a concern of the United Lubavitcher Yeshivoth in Flatbush, an ultra-Orthodox boys' institution. The Lubavitcher Hasidic sect, which came from Russia, has an aggressive recruiting program and has been particularly successful in attracting newly arrived Soviet Jewish children - it has about 135 Soviet students currently enrolled. Rabbi Moshe Bogomilsky, the school's administrator, said that the parents of fewer than 10 percent of the students paid full tuition, $1,250 a year. The parents of most Soviet students are unable to pay even part of the tuition, he said. Most yeshivas have difficulty finding qualified teachers, Dr. Schiff said. Salaries average $15,500. Created at the turn of the century by immigrant Jews, early American yeshivas also had dual programs, with the English-language component expanding as parents saw the need for greater cultural integration. The schools grew until 1970, when enrollment began to decline - ''the result of a leveling of the birth rate,'' Dr. Schiff said. The birth rate started to increase, in the late 1970's, he said.

555-> WOMEN'S ELECTION ROLE IS DISTURBING TO G.O.P.
Women's votes appear to have cost Republicans a few key elections this month, polls conducted by television networks indicate. While the number is small, party leaders and experts remain worried about the tendency of women to vote for Democrats more than men do. As Republican governors gathered here for a meeting, some of them plainly defeated by women's votes, the issue stirred argument, frustration and concern about 1984. This month, in 73 of the 85 Election Day polls the three television networks conducted among voters who had just cast ballots in statewide races, women voted for Democrats more than men did. But in most races the ''gender gap,'' as politicians call this difference, did not exceed the margin of victory. Weight of Men's Votes Moreover, in some key races the more decisive Republicanism of men's votes outweighed the women's Democratic leanings to produce Republican victories. The beneficiaries of those victories included Paul Trible in the Virginia Senate race, George Deukmejian in the California governorship race and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in the Connecticut Senate contest. But there was little satisfaction among the Republican governors because losses among women appeared to have cost them New York and Texas, and perhaps Michigan and Connecticut as well. Moreover, as it was expressed by Robert M. Teeter, a leading Republican poll taker here for the post-mortem discussions on how Republicans fell from 23 governorships to 16, the problem is closely connected to voter perceptions of President Reagan. Forecast for 1984 ''If he's on the ballot in 1984,'' Mr. Teeter said, ''it will show up in his race and carry over into other races, maybe a lot more than it did this year, unless we get some changes made.'' Republicans are not inclined to view their weakness among women and strength among men as a simple tradeoff. Because the two sexes have voted alike in the past, Republicans and many independent analysts see the current patterns as evidence that women are shifting to Democrats while men continue to vote as they have in the past. Another factor in the Republican unease is the fact that women, who outnumber men, are now voting in proportions equal to those of men. Mr. Reagan's poll taker, Richard B. Wirthlin, and John Deardourff, a leading producer of campaign commercials, disagreed about the issue of the shift in women's voting at a private breakfast with the governors Monday. Several people present said Mr. Wirthlin had contended that the gap was caused largely by women who gave Mr. Reagan less credit for reducing inflation than did men. He suggested this problem would eventually go away as women came to believe that the Administration had succeeded in this area. Mr. Deardourff disagreed, saying that women of all ages and conditions had been given a variety of substantial reasons to be unhappy with this Administration and thus with the Republican Party. Seeking 'Good Handle' on Problem Today, Gov. Christopher S. Bond of Missouri, who was not up for election this year, complained that party strategists had failed ''to have a good handle'' on the problem. ''I'm not persuaded by the inflation argument,'' he said. ''The first thing is to identify why there is a divergence.'' But Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee offered some suggestions. He was re-elected by a margin of 60 to 40 percent, and his own campaign polls showed him doing as well with women as with men, although a CBS News poll of exiting voters indicated that fewer women than men supported him, a margin of 3.5 percentage points. Mr. Alexander said the party needed to be aware of the role of working women and the larger number of single women. ''It may be that the Republican Party leadership hasn't been as sensitive to that development as it ought to be,'' he said, observing that single working women were falling into poverty faster than any other group. The national New York Times/CBS News Election Day exit poll found that unmarried women were decisively Democratic in their voting in House races. They split 64 percent for Democrats and 33 percent for Republicans, while unmarried men voted Democratic by a somewhat smaller margin, 58 to 38 percent. Married people of both sexes were less inclined to vote Democratic, and there was no statistically significant difference between the margin of 49 to 47 percent by which married men favored Democrats and the edge of 50 to 45 percent that married women gave Democrats. The issue does not arouse interest among the Republican leaders alone. Eleanor Smeal, the retiring president of the National Organization for Women, an intense critic of the Republican Party, said in a telephone interview that the results showed that the difference by sex in voting had helped the Democrats. ''It wasn't huge, but it was there,'' she said, asserting that it had been caused largely by women's feelings of economic insecurity. Gap Closed as Election Neared Patrick H. Caddell, a leading Democratic poll taker, said it should come as no surprise that the gap on Election Day was not so wide as it was in some early pre-election polls. He said his data showed that for the first time ''men converged toward women,'' adopting their heavier inclination to vote for Democrats. ''Men have always been the lead group politically,'' he said. ''This year showed that women can also lead.'' In some races, however, Republicans adopted strategies that appealed successfully for women's support. In some early polls, for example, Gov. James R. Thompson of Illinois had support from women that was 10 percentage points below his rating among men. But his television advertising stressed issues such as education and the elderly and presented him as a caring Governor. On Election Day, ABC News showed him getting the same share of the vote with both sexes, NBC News showed him getting two percentage points more support from men, and CBS News found him with four percentage points more support from women. No 'Monolithic Constituency' Today he told the governors that Republicans must not make the mistake of treating women as a ''monolithic constituency'' whose votes they could not win. He said that there was no single ''women's issue'' but that women were united in a sense of protest against ''economic inequality'' when measured against men. Exit polls, in which voters leaving polling places are given questionnaires to fill out, are the only way to measure sex differences in voting. While some population groups, such as blacks or the elderly, may dominate certain neighborhoods whose vote totals can be analyzed, men and women do not live in separate precincts. Drawing their respondents from a limited number of precincts in a state, exit polls have higher margins of sampling error than national telephone polls with same number of respondents. However, both Mr. Teeter and Mr. Caddell said it was clear from the preponderance of polls showing women's preference for Democrats that the problem of sampling error did not undermine the overall conclusion. And, in fact, no two exit polls, even where they found the same difference in how men and women voted, had exactly the same results on a given state race. But in several they shared a clear message. In New York, where Mario Cuomo won by 3.2 percentage points, CBS News had found women giving him nearly twice that margin, 6.5 percentage points. ABC News saw the gap as seven points and NBC News, eight points. In Virginia, Mr. Trible would have lost if only women had voted, polls showed. Instead he won by 2.4 percentage points as CBS News found men 11.5 points more favorable to him, ABC News found a nine-point edge and NBC News found a six-point gap. How the 'Gender Gap' Affected Elections Following are races in which at least two of the television networks tallied by sex the preference of voters on Election Day. The ''gender difference '' column reflects the number of percentage points in each poll by which women's votes for Democrats exceeded men's votes for that party's candidates, or, in three of the polls (indicated by minus signs), by which men voted Democratic in greater proportion than women. A zero indicates no difference in the way the two sexes voted and a dash indicates that a network conducted no poll in the state. ifference Party of in Three Winning Margin of xit Polls State/Race idate ctory CBS ABC NBC ALA./Gov.

556-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; Executive Named To New Conoco Job
E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company announced yesterday that Wilfred P. Schmoe would become chief operating officer of its Conoco Inc. subsidiary, a newly created position, in May. Du Pont took over Conoco a year ago and paid $7.5 billion for the company, winning out over Joseph E. Seagrams & Sons and the Mobil Corporation. Mr. Schmoe, 55 years old, is currently responsible for Conoco's coal and mineral operations as Conoco's vice chairman. Ralph E. Bailey, 58, continues as chairman and chief executive of Conoco, which is based in Stamford, Conn. ''My reading is that this is an evolutionary process and seems fairly normal,'' said William R. Young, senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, an analyst who follows Du Pont. ''Bailey is getting up there in age and he is starting to pass the reins over to other people. Both are astute and capable managers.'' Constantine S. Nicandros, 49, group executive vice president for petroleum products, will become president for petroleum operations. Michael B. Morris, 62, who currently holds that position, plans to retire April 30 ''in accordance with longstanding plans,'' Du Pont said. Mr. Schmoe and Mr. Nicandros have been nominated for election to the Du Pont board at Du Pont's annual meeting May 2. Mr. Morris will not stand for reelection. Mr. Schmoe joined Conoco in 1953, the year he graduated from Oklahoma State University. Mr. Nicandros, a graduate of the University of Paris Law School and Harvard Business School, has been with Conoco since 1957. Mr. Morris, a Conoco employee since 1948, has been in charge of worldwide petroleum activities since 1978.

557-> CYANIDE IS FOUND IN 8TH PILL BOTTLE
An eighth bottle of Extra-Strength Tylenol has been found to contain cyanide, Illinois Attorney General Tyrone Fahner announced tonight. The 50-capsule bottle, believed to have been purchased at Frank's Finer Foods in Wheaton, a western suburb of Chicago, was returned by a consumer to the Wheaton Police Department. A litmus test conducted by laboratory technicians of the McNeil Consumer Products Company indicated the probable presence of cyanide. The bottle, now at a McNeil facility at Fort Washington, Pa., will be taken to the laboratory of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington on Tuesday for laser analysis and detection of fingerprints. The bottle will then be sent to a Food and Drug Administration facility in Cincinnati for trace analysis of cyanide. One other bottle of contaminated Tylenol was found among the bottles returned by consumers; one was found among the bottles pulled from the store shelves, and five were connected with the seven Tylenol deaths. Earlier today The Chicago Sun-Times reported that an unidentified relative of one of the seven victims is being investigated in the deaths. However, Cmdr. Kenneth Curin, head of the Chicago Police Department's investigation, said that there was still ''no prime suspect'' in the case. A spokesman for the state task force investigating the poison deaths had no comment, and an investigator for the State Department of Law Enforcement refused to give much credence to the report. That development, one of a long series of initially credible leads to be reported in the Chicago press, is only one of many being investigated. 'Violent Argument' Reported The relative, possibly one of eight or nine leads from a shifting list, is said to have had a ''violent argument with his kin'' late in September. The poisonings occurred from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1. The suspect is also said to be a ''long-time friend'' of Roger Arnold, a 48-year-old Chicagoan arrested on firearms charges and questioned Oct. 11 about the Tylenol poisonings, according to The Sun-Times. Mr. Arnold appeared for a while to be a promising lead in the investigation because of his interest in poisons, his collection of literature on killing people, and his employment at Jewel Food Stores, where Howard Fearon Sr., the father of one victim, Mary Reiner, also works. ---- Man Who Took Excedrin Is Ill By The Associated Press William Sinkovic, 33 years old, of Aurora, Colo., was in critical condition last night in Denver after taking three extra-strength Excedrin capsules that initial tests indicated might be contaminated with toxic mercuric chloride, a chemical used in mercury batteries. The announcement was made last last night by Dr. Barry Rumack of the Rocky Mountain Poison Control center. The Federal Food and Drug Administration ordered all Colorado stores to remove Excedrin from their shelves. Harry Levine, a spokesman for the Bristol Myers Company in New York, manufacturer of Excedrin, said early today that he was still getting information from Colorado and would have no immediate comment. Earlier yesterday, Mr. Rumack's agency said an odd-looking aspirin capsule turned in by a suspicious consumer contained the rat poison warfarin.

562-> EX-PREMIER CLAIMS IRISH VICTORY; BID FOR COALITION CABINET EXPECTED
Former Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald claimed victory early today in the Irish election and said an attempt to help settle the ''desperate tragedy of Northern Ireland'' would be one of the highest priorities of the new government that he would try to form next month. Neither of the major parties commanded a clear majority in the tabulation of Wednesday's voting, the third Irish election in 18 months that has produced an inconclusive stalemate. Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, whose Fianna Fail Party actually led in the voting, did not formally concede defeat, but he said he assumed Mr. FitzGerald would head the next government. A Coalition Is Possible It was expected that the Fine Gael Party of Mr. FitzGerald, who served as Prime Minister from mid-1981 to last February, could form a coalition with the Irish Labor Party. With 157 of the 166 races settled, Fianna Fail had 70 seats, Fine Gael had 67, Labor had 16, and independents had 5. The projected totals gave Fine Gael and Labor a combined total of 86 seats, a solid majority in Parliament. In the old Parliament, Fine Gael and Labor had a total of 77 seats. Speaking on Irish television early today as the votes were being counted more than 30 hours after the polls closed, Mr. FitzGerald described as ''intimidating'' the task of dealing with Ireland's serious economic problems. ''In the past when you won an election you looked forward to the fruits of victory,'' he said. ''Now, under these circumstances, we look forward to a long tough struggle ahead to fend off the worst and try to get our finances in order.'' He said he hoped he would be given time to stabilize his government and arrive at policies to deal with Ireland's pressing economic problems. Parliament to Meet Dec. 14 Parliament will meet Dec. 14 to elect a Prime Minister, and the weeks ahead will be filled with maneuvering as the major parties try to form a new government. It is considered highly unlikely that the Labor Party will join in any effort with Fianna Fail as long as Mr. Haughey continues to lead it. It was also presumed here that Mr. Haughey could not attract enough guarantees of support to head a minority government. Mr. Fitzgerald, a 57-year-old former professor of economics, was Prime Minister from mid-1981 to early this year. His coalition was formed with Labor and it, too, collapsed when Labor withdrew its support from the economic package he proposed to help reduce Ireland's huge budget gap and balance of payments deficit. Mr. Haughey is in for a struggle just to remain leader of Fianna Fail. Twenty-two party members voted against him in a party rebellion that he was able to put down last month, and there will almost certainly be a renewal of the effort to oust him if the party falls from power. ''We are living in different times now,'' he said Thursday night on television. ''Governments are falling all over Europe. In times of very deep and serious economic recession it's very difficult for a government to stay in office.''

563-> ADVERTISING; Stern Ingalls Venture Gets Nature's Organics
Ingalls Associates of Boston and Nelson Stern Advertising of Cleveland teamed up to win the $8 million account of Nature's Organics Plus, a Paramus, N.J., manufacturer of hair care products. And now the two agencies are going to set up a joint venture called Stern Ingalls here in Manhattan - in a hotel at first - to serve the consumer end of Nature's business. The Stern shop was already the agency for Nature's trade advertising and collateral material and when its president, William Stern, heard that the consumer part of the account might be coming loose from Kurtz & Tarlow here, he called his former workmate at Ogilvy & Mather, Brendon Kelley, senior vice president, creative services, at Ingalls, and suggested the joint pitch. There is already advertising for Henna Shampoo and Jojoba Shampoo. Waiting in the wings for a February national introduction is the new Natural's line, which will be supported by print, network TV and spot TV in 30 markets. Stephanie Powers will be spokesman.

Sidney A. Wolff, a labor arbitrator and trial lawyer, died yesterday at his Manhattan home after a short illness. He was 77 years old. He had served as an impartial chairman for the nursing home, newspaper and hotel industries and had been a special referee to State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He had arbitrated cases involving department stores, bakeries, mass transit, the textile industry and government. He was a member of the American Arbitration Association, the New York State Mediation Board, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Public Employment Relations Board of New York and the Public Employment Relations Commission of New Jersey. He was a founder and senior partner of the law firm of Goldstone, Wolff & Seminara. Mr. Wolff was born in New York City and was a graduate of City College and the Fordham University Law School. During World War II, he served in the Army in the judge advocate general's department, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Mr. Wolff is survived by his wife, Lillian, and two sons, Michael, of New York City, and Peter, of Washington.

565-> NEEDIEST CASES INSPIRE DONORS ACROSS THE U.S.
Distance is no deterrent to those who want to join the effort to help New York City's poor, distressed or friendless. Many contributors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund have been visitors to the city, and others are New Yorkers who have long since moved away. Mr. and Mrs. Roger McGuire of Asheville, N.C., contributed $500 to the fund's 71st annual appeal because they said they were enriched by their visits to the city. ''We get to New York occasionally, but not often enough, and we usually take away more than we give,'' Mrs. McGuire said in an interview. ''This year, particularly, there are more people in need of help.'' Michael Dolphin, a former New Yorker who has given for four years, this year donated $30 from Bangkok, Thailand, where he said he was working with Khmer refugees. ''You see some dramatic cases,'' he wrote, but, he added, ''I try to remember that this does not lessen the plight of my fellow New Yorkers.'' Nancy H. Ross, writing from Cordova, Alaska, sent a check for $25 and a note that said, ''Though I am no longer living in N.Y.C., I'm happy to make my fourth contribution to your worthy fund.'' From Ruth and Leslie Wareham of Walnut Creek, Calif., came a donation of $20 and a note that said, ''We pause to help light a candle, so to speak, in this season when thinking of others should be a main concern.'' With a donation of $25, Mrs. Charles M. Lyman of Palo Alto, Calif., wrote, ''This is the time of the year when I wish more than ever that I had a lot of maney and could make you a huge check.''

566-> U.S. SAFETY BOARD CITES CONCERNS ON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER TRAINING
The National Transportation Safety Board said yesterday that a special inquiry into the training of air traffic controllers had ''revealed some specific safety problems which the board believes require immediate corrective action'' by the Federal Aviation Administration. The board voiced particular concern about its findings that new controllers hired to replace those dismissed after the strike in August 1981 were immediately being used to train other recruits without undergoing formal training as instructors. The aviation agency was urged to ''cancel immediately'' a one-year waiver it issued last May that permits such practices at airport towers and other facilities that do not have the resources for ''administering appropriate training courses.'' Training Turnaround Assailed ''In some instances,'' the safety board report said, ''developmental controllers were certified on a position in the morning and were conducting on-the-job training at that same control position for another developmental controller in the afternoon of the same day.'' An F.A.A. statement responding to the report began: ''The Federal Aviation Administration is as concerned about the need for safe air travel as is the N.T.S.B. In that regard, it is noteworthy that, in issuing its recommendations, the N.T.S.B. did not find any specific instances of unsafe air traffic control operations caused by the training methods initiated as part of the recovery of the air traffic control system since the Patco strike.'' Patco is the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, the defunct union whose members struck last year over pay and working conditions. The Reagan Administration, calling the strike an illegal action by Government employees, refused to negotiate with the union and dismissed all but a handful of the 11,400 strikers. The aviation agency has since been conducting an accelerated recruiting and training program for new controllers. The F.A.A. statement added that the lack of specific examples of unsafe operations supported the conclusion reached by the Flight Safety Foundation, a consulting group, and its own officials that training and operations were ''progressing safely.'' The aviation agency did, however, pledge to carry out any of the recommendations the agency found to be related to continued safety. In its recommendations, the safety board urged the aviation agency to make sure the assignment of training duties did not overload controllers, based on the ''work load and the complexity of the traffic being handled.'' The board also suggested the agency make wider use, where appropriate, of the training program used at La Guardia Airport in New York City, which impressed its survey team. Interim Report Issued The safety board's findings were contained in an interim report growing out the board's second study of the safety of the air traffic system since the walkout. In the first study a year ago, the safety board said the strike had not resulted in unsafe operations, but warned that stress and fatigue experienced by the curtailed work force could eventually prove to be a hazard. Since the strikers were dismissed the nation's commercial airways have been monitored by 5,800 nonstrikers, 2,000 supervisors, a sprinkling of controllers who came out of retirement, borrowed military personnel and new recruits. The aviation agency has placed a high priority on rebuilding the controller force so that air traffic can be restored as quickly as possible to its prestrike level. Volume Remains Lower The volume of air traffic is about 83 percent to 90 percent of that before the walkout. J. Lynn Helms, the head of the aviation administration, an agency of the Department of Transportation, has promised that traffic will return to the prestrike level by next spring. The latest safety-board inquiry, which began in October, is headed by Ron Schleede and is based on a survey of 50 facilities. The final report is expected next March. The interim report's greatest emphasis was on evidence that newly trained controllers, fresh from the F.A.A. school in Oklahoma City, were giving on-the-job training to other new employees without going through the special instructors' course that had been required before the strike. The board said it was also concerned aobut the amount of time that individual controllers, even those with instructional training, were spending on training new controllers.

567-> Soprano Sings Marta on Short Notice
Muriel Costa-Greenspon, a mezzo-soprano who had only hours to learn her part, was called on to fill the role of Marta in last evening's performance by the New York City Opera of ''Mefistofele'' at the New York State Theater. Both the scheduled singer and her understudy were taken ill. Jane Shaulis suffered an attack of food poisoning Wednesday night that required hospitalization, according to Daniel Rule, the company's managing director. In addition, her understudy, Judith Christin, was suffering from acute laryngitis. Miss Costa-Greenspon, who agreed to learn the part yesterday at 4:30 P.M., three-and-a-half hours before the performance, sang from the orchestra while Miss Christin mimed from the stage.

568-> FLOW OF NEW OFFERINGS SLOWS A BIT
The flow of new corporate and tax-exempt bonds continues to be heavy but should be less than the November pace. According to Salomon Brothers, $3.8 billion of corporate notes and bonds were sold in November, but only $1 billion of new issues have been scheduled in the next four weeks. A record $9 billion of new tax-exempt bonds were sold last month, and this month's total is expected to be lower, but still far above the $3.8 billion monthly average during 1981.

569-> Coach's Condition Is Improving
Bill Foster, the South Carolina basketball coach, remained in guarded condition today, but doctors said his heart had ''stabilized nicely'' since Sunday. Foster, who is 52 years old, was taken to the cardiac-care unit at Providence Hospital Saturday night after suffering a moderate heart attack during the Gamecocks' 59-53 upset of Purdue. Dr. Richard Umbach, Foster's cardiologist, said he took the coach off blood thinners and other medication this morning. He also removed pacemaker wires that were inserted in Foster's chest as a precaution. The doctor's evaluation was released through Tom Price, sports information director for the university, who described Foster as healthy but ''a very hyper person.''

570-> ACTION ON CHINATOWN JAIL PUT OFF AFTER PROTEST
A plan was approved for selling apartments in city-owned buildings to their tenants for $250 each. Page B2. Twelve thousand demonstrators poured out of Chinatown and past the courthouses of Foley Square to City Hall yesterday to protest plans to build a jail in their neighborhood. Hours after the protestors with their dancing dragon and their drums and cymbals went home, their side won a partial victory.The Board of Estimate voted early this morning to defer until December a decision on the $101 million jail project on the outskirts of Chinatown and Little Italy. The Board began formal consideration of the jail plan shortly before 9 last night. As the hearing went into the night, the crowd that packed the board chamber applauded opponents of the plan, starting with the State Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, and jeered proponents, including Benjamin Ward, the City Correction Commissioner. Residents and community political leaders contend that the jail will harm a neighborhood that, with the Tombs and the courthouses nearby, already has a ''disproportionate'' share of such institutions. The jail is to be built on a site bounded by Centre, Baxter, Walker and White Streets. Heralded by the thumping of a big drum on wheels, the marchers turned up shortly after noon on a warm, hazy day. The police counted 12,000 of them and, although cheerful and well-mannered, they spilled out into the streets so that traffic had to be temporarily blocked from entering the Brooklyn Bridge. ''There was gridlock back there in Centre Street,'' Capt. Charles Roge said as he stood next to the winking red light of a squad car on the bridge approach in front of the Municipal Building at Chambers and Centre Streets. A Compromise Suggested ''We're against it all, the whole thing,'' said Charles Wang, cochairman of the Citizens Coalition for Lower Manhattan, which organized the march. As Mr. Wang shouted over the piercing clang of cymbals, someone suggested that Board of Estimate members might compromise by canceling plans to house juveniles in the jail. In testimony before the Board of Estimate - which is made up of the Mayor, the City Council President, the City Comptroller and the five borough presidents - Nancy Hoving of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a civic group, said it was unwise ''to stack one institution on top of another.'' The Koch administration is planning to put the 126-bed jail for juveniles on top of the 500-bed adult institution. In protest against the plan to combine the two institutions, the city's Commissioner of Juvenile Justice, Paul A. Strasburg, surprised the Koch administration by quitting on Wednesday. Court Order on Jail The city is under court order to close the Men's House of Detention on Rikers Island. By building a new jail next to the remodeled Tombs, scheduled to open next spring, the city says it will be able to move prisoners to court more quickly and cheaply. The juvenile center would be one of two to replace the aging Spofford center in the Bronx. Community Boards 1 and 3 have recommended against the plan, but the City Planning Commission approved it and sent it to the Board of Estimate. Meanwhile, Corrections Commissioner Ward said after the Board of Estimate meeting last night that crowded conditions in city jails could force prisoners to be put ''out on the street'' within two weeks. Mr. Ward said that because of the strike by Legal Aid Society lawyers, the prison population had reached 110 percent of capacity. Speaking at City Hall after testifying at the Board hearing. he said he was seeking to get the state jails to accept as many city prisoners as possible. The board adjourned shortly before 1 A.M.

571-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; COSELL SAYS, 'I'VE HAD IT'
HOWARD COSELL'S disaffection with boxing did not begin as he broadcast the Larry Holmes-Tex Cobb mismatch 10 days ago. That event was merely the catalyst for him to call for the end of professional boxing, one of the most public criticisms the business has ever taken. Ten years ago, Cosell testified before a Senate subcommittee that boxing should be placed under Federal control. Now he laughs bitterly when critics say boxing can be improved from within. ''I was always deeply troubled by boxing,'' Cosell said in a telephone conversation over the weekend, following his revelation to Dave Kindred in The Washington Post last week that he was walking away from boxing. ''Nothing ever changes,'' Cosell added. ''I've done all I can. We've seen the thumbless glove, we've seen Earnie Shavers and Ray Leonard hurt their eyes, I've seen Benny Paret and Willie Classen and Cleveland Denny and Duk Koo Kim die. ''Yet we still have laissez-faire. You've got two championships. The networks must take some responsibility for that. You've got sleazy promoters. You've got reporters who are afraid to look at boxing. I've had it. No more.'' As things often are with Howard Cosell, his ''decision'' is multilayered. For one thing, Cosell will announce the 1984 Olympics and he also admits: ''I am loyal to my company, and if they asked me to do a Holmes-Cooney rematch, I would do it.'' For the past quarter-century, he has been ABC's most visible boxing product, more durable than the fighters themselves. When ABC underwrote mismatches, Cosell was sometimes critical, sometimes not. When bizarre decisions took place, he was sometimes critical, sometimes not. His public persona helped sell boxing, helped sell the sponsor's product, helped boost the ratings. ''I now favor the abolition of professional boxing,'' Howard Cosell says. ''I have a right to my opinion.'' His voice weary from too many red-eye flights, Cosell traced his love and disaffection for boxing: ''I was introduced to boxing by Bill Heinz, a great writer and a friend of boxing. I became fascinated with Floyd Patterson, with his background, hiding in a hole in the subway. I visited the Wiltwyck School with him, I ran a dinner for the school. ''I met Sugar Ray Robinson, Archie Moore did fights with me, I read Bob Lipsyte's columns about Dick Tiger. Then along came Ali, who gravitated easily from the ghetto to the White House. There was a whole new culture, the movement against an unwanted and unending war. My own daughters saw Ali as an antihero. ''Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Larry Holmes. Beautiful people. I love the earthiness, the courage, the honesty, of boxers. Later there was Tom (Sarge) Johnson, the Olympic coach who taught Sugar Ray Leonard how to fight. He died in the Polish air crash. I loved that man and I loved the Olympics, a triumph of U.S. spirit, and I will do the 1984 Olympics because Olympic boxing has a mandatory 8-count and headgear.'' Cosell, a former lawyer, has often testified to Congressional subcommittees against franchises being moved, the use of public funds to build stadiums and monopolistic control of sports leagues. After his 1972 appearance before a Senate subcommittee, Cosell recalls, ''I could see where Don King and Bob Arum were recreating the control that the courts had ruled illegal years before. But I stayed with boxing because I loved the boxers.'' Cosell says he began to get bad feelings about boxing in 1980 when Roberto Duran willingly cast himself as the villain, making crude remarks and gestures toward Ray and Juanita Leonard before the fight in Montreal. ''At the weigh-in, I was standing with my wife, Emmy, and Budd Schulberg,'' Cosell says. ''I heard people cheering Duran and booing a crestfallen Ray Leonard. I was repelled by Duran, and I turned to Budd and I said, 'I don't like this crowd. There's something wrong here.' And that's where it began for me.'' Cosell says he was saddened by deaths in the ring and by the beating Alexis Arguello suffered against Aaron Pryor. Although critical of the pairing, Cosell agreed to do the Holmes-Cobb fight because he is a company man. (''They have given me more than I can ever give back; they have made me a multimillionaire.'') Here is where Cosell is caught in the ambiguous role of television. Newspapers cover events like boxing matches; they should expect their reporters and columnists to keep a critical distance from what they cover. Television networks support boxing matches; they expect their announcers to push the product and still sound like journalists. After Cosell criticized the Holmes-Cobb fiasco, his numerous critics savaged him for not questioning the fighters and the referee afterward. But even a towering personage like Howard Cosell is tied into the decisions from the corporate maze. And Cosell asks how many print journalists would dare criticize their newspaper in public? ''The Cobb fight did it for me,'' Cosell says. ''I was leaving the ring and people were shouting, 'Hey, Howie, that Texan sure can take a punch, can't he?' I said, 'Don't they realize what's happening here?' Four days or four weeks or four months or four years later, that man is going to pay for the pounding he took.'' His response was to publicly announce his move away from boxing. He is open to the charge of using the violent trilogy of Kim-Arguello-Cobb to lighten his work load and focus on his excellent Sunday ''Sportsbeat'' show. Cosell could also be accused of trying to come down on the right and/or popular side of a controversy. But isn't it also possible that Howard Cosell has had a change of heart about a business he has observed for 25 years? There have been reasonable arguments why boxing should not be abolished: other sports are also dangerous; society has no right to end a business that men enter with eager consent; it is better to work for reform from within. Cosell says reporters have helped prolong boxing's abuses by arguing against Federal intervention. He said last week the networks should ''declare a moratorium on boxing'' until some form of unified control is imposed. He added: ''I'm not presumptuous to think I can kill boxing by myself, but I've had it.'' In quiet conversation away from the microphone, he never used his famous expression, ''Tell it like it is.'' Yet that is exactly what Howard Cosell is doing.

GUATEMALAN VOWS TO AID DEMOCRACY SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras, Dec. 5 (Reuters) - President Efrain Rios Montt of Guatemala, a country where all political activity has been suspended, has pledged to issue new laws on the formation of political parties and the electoral process by next March 23. At a news conference here after his talks Saturday with President Reagan, General Rios Montt said elections in Guatemala would probably be held before the end of next year. The general came to power after a military coup last March 23 and his Government has since been accused of responsibility for largescale massacres of civilians in antiguerrilla action by the Guatemalan Army. The criticism grew after General Rios Montt imposed a state of siege under which all political activity was suspended and civil liberties curtailed. 'Open Up the Political Process' ''New laws will be isued on March 23 governing the formation of political parties and the conduct of elections,'' the general said in a statement distributed to the press. ''These will open up the poltical process to a degree unprecedented in Guatemala. ''For example,'' the statement said, ''we will allow all selfproclaimed socialist parties to be recognized, and we will guarantee their participation in the electoral process.'' The general was asked to comment on reports that the Guatemalan Army was pursuing a scorched-earth policy in areas where guerrillas have been active by destroying villages suspected of harboring the rebels. ''We have no scorched-earth policy,'' the general said. ''We have a policy of scorched Communists.'' ---- Reagan Supports Rios Montt WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 (Reuters) -President Reagan says President Rios Montt has received a ''bad deal'' because of allegations that his military-led Government is reponsible for extensive human rights abuses. Mr. Reagan made his remarks on Air Force One on his way home from Honduras, where he conferred with General Rios Montt at the end of his five-day tour of Latin America. General Rios Montt has been accused by Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization, of permitting massacres of peasants in military operations against rebels. ''I very frankly think that they've been getting a bad deal,'' Mr. Reagan said of the Rios Montt Government. ''You know, he was elected President in 1974. He was never allowed to take office. So, when this particular coup came, the officers who conducted the coup gave him the office he'd been elected to.'' ---- Hatfield Opposes Arms Aid WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 (UPI) -Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, vowed opposition today to any move by President Reagan to provide military aid to Guatemala because of the country's human rights record. Mr. Hatfield, interviewed on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' said: ''I think where you introduce instruments of violence - military weaponry - in an area that has such overwhelming social problems, where people are hungry, where people are illiterate, those are the causes of violence. That is the seed bed for war.''

574-> EXCERPTS FROM PROPOSED LETTER ON NUCLEAR ARMS
Here are excerpts from the proposed pastoral letter on nuclear arms drawn up by the Committee on War and Peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops: In the nuclear arsenals of the United States or the Soviet Union alone, there exists a capacity to do something no other age could imagine; we can threaten the created order. For people of faith this means we read the Book of Genesis with a new awareness; the moral issue at stake in nuclear war involves the meaning of sin in its most graphic dimensions. Every sinful act is a confrontation of the creature and the Creator. Today the destructive potential of the nuclear powers threatens the sovereignty of God over the world he has brought into being. We could destroy his work. Today the possibilities for placing political and moral limits on nuclear war are so infinitesimal that the moral task, like the medical, is prevention: As a people we must refuse to legitimate the idea of nuclear war. We seek to encourage a public attitude which sets stringent limits on the kind of actions our Government will take on nuclear policy in our name. We believe religious leaders have a task in concert with public officials, analysts, private organizations and the media to set the limits beyond which our military policy should not move in word or action. Under no circumstances may nuclear weapons or other instruments of mass slaughter be used for the purpose of destroying population centers or other predominantly civilian targets. Practical Moral Conclusion Aware of the controverted nature of the issue, we nonetheless feel obliged, as a matter of practical moral guidance, to register our opposition to a policy of attacking targets which lie so close to concentrations of population that destruction of the target would devastate the nearby population centers. The relevant moral principle in this case is the disproportionate damage which would be done to human life. We are moved to specify this practical moral conclusion because recent policy proposals seek to justify attacks on militarily related industries situated in populated areas. Retaliatory action which would take many wholly innocent lives, lives of people who are in no way responsible for reckless actions of their government, must also be condemned. Our condemnation applies especially to the retaliatory use of weapons striking enemy cities after our own have already been struck. Retaliation in such circumstances would serve no rational or moral purpose and might be considered to be only an act of vengeance. No Christian can rightfully carry out orders or policies deliberately aimed at killing noncombatants. We do not perceive any situation in which the deliberate initiation of nuclear warfare, on however restricted a scale, can be morally justified. Nonnuclear attacks by another state must be resisted by other than nuclear means. Some have argued that at the very beginning of a war nuclear weapons might be used, only against military targets, perhaps in limited numbers. Indeed, it has long been American and NATO policy that nuclear weapons, especially so-called tactical nuclear weapons, would likely be used if NATO forces in Europe seemed in danger of losing a conflict that until then had been restricted to conventional weapons. Difficulties of Limitation Whether under conditions of war in Europe, parts of Asia or the Middle East, or the exchange of strategic weapons directly between the United States and the Soviet Union, the difficulties of limiting the use of nuclear weapons are immense. Expert witnesses advise us that commanders operating under conditions of battle would not be able to exercise strict control; the number of weapons used would rapidly increase, the targets would be expanded beyond the military, and the level of civilian casualties would rise enormously. No one can be certain that this escalation would not occur, even in the face of political efforts to keep such an exchange ''limited.'' The chances of keeping use limited seem remote, and the consequences of escalation to mass destruction would be appalling. The danger of escalation is so great that it is an unacceptable moral risk to initiate nuclear war in any form. The danger is rooted not only in the technology of our weapons systems but in the weakness and sinfulness of human communities. We find the moral responsibility of beginning nuclear war not justified by rational political objectives. It would be possible to agree with our first two conclusions and still not be sure about retaliatory use of nuclear weapons in what is called a ''limited exchange.'' Technical opinion on this question, and the writings of moralists remain divided. The issue at stake is the real as opposed to the theoretical possibility of a ''limited nuclear exchange.'' We recognize that the policy debate on this question is inconclusive and that all participants are left with hypothetical projections about probable reactions in a nuclear exchange. The issue of limited war is not simply the size of the weapons contemplated or the strategies projected. The debate should include the psychological and political significance of crossing the boundary from the conventional to the nuclear arena in any form. To cross this divide is to enter a world where we have no experience of control, much evidence against its possibility and no justification for submitting the human community to this risk. Deterrence in Nuclear Age In the past the idea of deterrence itself has not posed a unique moral problem, but the nature of the deterrent in the nuclear age has raised the most severe moral questions for Catholic teaching on warfare. The moral problem of nuclear deterrence relates to the method by which prevention is accomplished. The moral questions about deterrence focus on five issues; 1) the possession of weapons of mass destruction; 2) the accompanying threat and/or intention to use them; 3) the declared, or at least not repudiated, willingness to use such weapons on civilians; 4) the moral significance of the prevention of use of nuclear weapons through a strategy which could not morally be implemented; and 5) the continued escalation of the nuclear arms with its diversion of resources from other needs. The new concern about the danger of nuclear war provides a rare opportunity for a sustained political-moral assessment of our nuclear policy. Such an assessment must address, as we are doing here, the ''hard-case'' of deterrence which is central to prevailing U.S. strategy. For some the fact that nuclear weapons have not been used for 38 years means that deterrence has worked and this fact satisfies the demands of both the political and the moral order. Others contest this assessment by highlighting the risk of failure contained in continued reliance on deterrence, and specifying the catastrophe which one failure would be in political and moral terms. Or they point out that the absence of nuclear war is not necessarily proof that the policy of deterrence has prevented it. Indeed some would find in the policy of deterrence the driving force in the superpower arms race. Role of 'Intention' Still other observers, particularly in the Catholic tradition, which places a high value on the role of ''intention'' in moral action, have stressed that the deterrent effect, however significant, should not be achieved by any intention to strike civilian centers. Many argue that the deterrent prevents the use of nuclear weapons. As we noted above, that argument is not subject to conclusive proof or disproof. We are skeptical of it, but not to the point where we can simply dismiss its implications. As clearly unsatisfactory as the deterrent posture of the United States is from a moral point of view, use of nuclear weapons by any of the nuclear powers would be an even greater evil. We face here, then, the paradox of deterrence in the modern world. We cannot approve of every weapons system, strategic doctrine or policy initiative advanced in the name of strengthening deterrence. Progress toward a world freed of the threat of deterrence must be carefully carried out. But it must not be delayed. There is an urgent moral and political responsibility to use the ''peace of a sort'' we have as a framework to move toward authentic peace through nuclear arms control, reductions and disarmament. Of primary importance in this process is the need to prevent the development of destabilizing weapons systems on either side; a second requirement is to insure that the more sophisticated command and control systems are no less open to human intervention; a third is the need to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the international system. In light of these general principles we oppose some specific proposals for our present deterrence posture: 1) The addition of weapons which are likely to invite attack and therefore give credence to the concept that the U.S. seeks a first strike, ''hard target kill'' capability; the MX missile might fit into this category; 2) The willingness to foster strategic planning which seeks a nuclear war fighting capability: 3) Proposals which have the effect of lowering the nuclear threshold and blurring the difference between nuclear and conventional weapons. Recommended Actions We recommend: support for immediate, bilateral verifiable agreements to halt the testing, production and deployment of new strategic systems; Support for negotiated bilateral deep cuts in the arsenals of both superpowers, particularly of those weapons systems which have destabilizing characteristics; Support for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; Removal by all parties of nuclear weapons from border areas and the strengthening of command and control over tactical nuclear weapons to prevent inadvertent and unauthorized use. These judgments are meant to exemplify how a lack of unequivocal condemnation of deterrence is meant only to be an attempt to acknowledge the role attributed to deterrence, but not to support its extension beyond the prevention of use of nuclear weapons. The need to rethink the deterrence policy of our nation, to make the revisions necessary to reduce the possibility of nuclear war and to move toward a more stable system of national and international security will demand a substantial intellectual, political and moral effort. Rejection of some forms of nuclear deterrence might therefore require a willingness to pay higher costs to develop conventional forces. Leaders and peoples of other nations might also have to accept higher costs for their own defense if the United States Government were to withdraw any threat to use nuclear weapons first. We do not in any way want to contribute to a notion of ''making the world safe for conventional war,'' which introduces its own horrors. It may be, however, that some strengthening of conventional defense would be a proportionate price to pay, if indeed this will reduce the possibility of nuclear war. We must re-emphasize with all our being, nonetheless, that it is not only nuclear war that must be prevented, but war itself, the scourge of humanity.

576-> PURCHASE CONTINUES BATTLE OVER ZONING
PURCHASE TO Charles G. Balancia, a Town Councilman of Harrison, ''zoning is forever'' and this is why, he says, the town must move cautiously in deciding the future of the Pforzheimer property here. The property is the subject of a major zoning dispute in this area of large estates and country clubs where residents have been fighting for years to prevent corporations that want to construct new offices from swallowing up their quiet, almost rural neighborhoods. ''It is probably the last potential site for any kind of office development, so we must be very careful in handling this site,'' said Mr. Balancia, who was influential in a recent move by the Town Board to reject a plan for the property, at least temporarily. ''We don't want to do anything that impacts negatively on that community.'' The Pforzheimer property is a 404-acre tract in the heart of the Purchase area south of the County Airport owned by Carl H. Pforzheimer Jr., a wealthy investment banker, and his wife - one-time Purchase residents who now live in Greenwich, Conn. The property is now zoned for residential use, and the Pforzheimers want to have it rezoned to permit both residential and commercial development - with the latter including an ''office park'' and a 500-room conference hotel on 159 acres near the airport. But the owners are facing opposition by groups in the town, including the Purchase Association, a homeowners unit that has a history of battling unwanted commercial encroachment into the community. In addition to estates and country clubs, Purchase has two college campuses, the State University of New York's Purchase campus and Manhattanville, and a number of park-like corporate headquarters, including those of Pepsico and Texaco. In the minds of many officials a land-luse battle over the Pforzheimer property could affect the future growth of the area near the airport -long regarded by Westchester planning officials as a logical place for the next major phase in the expansion of office development in the county. The property is the subject of a court suit brought by the Pforzheimers against the town of Harrison four years ago to break the zoning pattern and open the land to development. On Oct. 15, the Pforzheimer's lawyers filed a ''conceptual plan'' for the property's development worked out by a White Plains planning firm, J. Michael Divney Associates. It was submitted with the intention of resolving the dispute. But the Harrison Town Board, taking it up five days later for what was expected to be a routine referral to the Town Planning Board, abruptly rejected it. Some of the board members said that it did not conform to the town's master plan and they urged the property owners to resubmit the plan after making some changes. The rejection had followed 45 minutes of heated discussion of the case among board members and the audience, which obviously contained many people opposed to the plan. After the meeting, town officials indicated that they might meet with representatives of the Pforzheimers to discuss possible modifications of the proposal. The plan proposed office buildings and the 500-room ''conference hotel'' near the County Airport to be served eventually by a new east-west parkway; 220 units of clustered housing on an adjacent 245 acres and a 100-acre ''open space preserve.'' In submitting his plan, Mr. Divney told Harrison officials it was ''compatible with the long-range interests of Harrison and the Purchase community and the high standards of land use set by the Pforzheimer interests.'' He saw a number of benefits, including the retention of open space, reduced traffic on residential streets with the proposed new parkway, more tax revenue, construction jobs, improved access to the state university campus, land-use ''compatible with the airport and Interstate 684'' and ''fulfillment'' of the 1972 master plan. He said his planning firm had used criteria to ''assure a proper balance between the preservation of important neighborhood values and the realization of an economic and marketable use of the land.'' The suit by the Pforzheimers, according to their lawyer, Davis M. Zimmerman, was initiated to get the town to make the property immediately south of the airport usable for office park development on the basis that residential zoning was made ''obsolete'' by the airport and Interstate 684, which cuts through Purchase. While the airport land is zoned for some business offices, the Pforzheimer property and other properties near it are zoned ''R 2.5/1,'' meaning development is limited to residential development on lots of one acre or two-and-a-half acres. One-acre lots could be developed when public water supplies and sewers were provided and two-and-a-half acres when they are not. Presumably rezoning to permit commercial use would render the property more valuable. The lawsuit against Harrison was filed by the Pforzheimer interests in June 1978, according to Mr. Zimmerman, and has not yet gone to trial. Although dormant, it nevertheless had an impact on the town's zoning, according to some Harrison officials, influencing the town toward its adoption of one-acre zoning and clustered housing concepts in May 1981. To accomplish the plan, the Pforzheimer interests had asked the town to rezone 159 acres near the airport from residential to Special Airport Business, authorize attached, clustered housing and extend water and sewer authority. Mr. Balancia, the Councilman, led the attack when the plan came before the Town Board, contending that it ''does not comply'' with the master plan, which he helped write in 1972 as a Planning Board member. His motion to reject eventually carried despite the efforts of the Harrison Town Supervisor, John A. Passidomo, who favored sending the proposal to the Planning Board for its review and recommendations. In an interview, Mr. Balancia said he was specifically opposed to a proposed conference hotel, calling it an ''encouragement to the airport expansionists'' - a reference to concerns over growth of the airport. He was also opposed to permitting attached homes and to the expressway's location, he said. ''I'm not against sensible office development,'' Mr. Balancia said. ''But it's got to conform to the community's needs.'' At the board meeting, Mr. Passidomo had contrasted the Pforzheimer plan with the attempts by the Nestle Company to locate a new headquarters in residential areas of Purchase in 1977. While the Nestle proposal was against ''all of our theories of what we wanted Purchase to become,'' Mr. Passidomo argued, ''this is different. It's a whole plan.'' He described it as the region's first ''total-concept plan.'' But Alan Bernhard, president of the Purchase Association, the homeowners group, called the proposal ''ruinous.'' ''The Planning Board shouldn't be considering a proposal that is so thoroughly destructive to an area,'' he said. ''You might as well make Purchase a cloverleaf.''

578-> U.S. Insurance Of Thrift Units
The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said today that it was considering charging federally insured thrift institutions variable-rate, risk-related insurance premiums. Thrift institutions currently pay a flat premium equal to onetwelfth of 1 percent of their insured accounts. The board said this system was unfair because well-managed institutions bore the risk costs of poorly managed ones. The plan under consideration calls for a premium of up to oneeighth of 1 percent in addition to the premium already charged. Thrift units posing less risk to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Fund would receive larger premium rebates, the board said. Risk evaluations probably would be based on a unit's vulnerability to fluctuations in interest rates, it added.

580-> TOOTSIE TAUGHT DUSTIN HOFFMAN ABOUT THE SEXES
While he was preparing to film the movie ''Tootsie,'' Dustin Hoffman spent months learning to transform himself into a credible semblance of a woman for the female character he would play, and doing a succession of screen tests to assess how convincing he looked. At one screen test, he - as Dorothy Michaels, the soap opera star he plays in the film - was improvising in front of the camera when he was asked whether he thought he would ever have children. In her soft Southern voice, Dorothy said no, she thought she wouldn't be having children. Her interrogator persisted: Why not? ''I think it's a little late in the day for that,'' said Dorothy - and, suddenly overwhelmed, she burst into tears. ''I felt so terrible that I would never have that experience,'' says Mr. Hoffman, his voice still filled with wonderment. ''Nothing like that has ever happened to me. I've been acting for -what, nearly 30 years? - and I've never had a moment like that before in my life.'' Already a Parent Indeed, Mr. Hoffman is a parent several times over: He considers himself the father of his first wife's child by a previous marriage as well as the child they had together, and he has another child with his second wife, who is now pregnant again. But the role of Dorothy Michaels was a powerful personal experience for Mr. Hoffman, plunging him into an intensive self-examination that has changed him in many ways. ''I really liked her,'' he says fervently. ''I started to feel about her the way I had never felt about a character before. She made me very emotional, very emotional. I still haven't understood it completely.'' At 45, Mr. Hoffman has long been known for his versatility as an actor, playing parts ranging from a college student to a convict to a 120-year-old man to a crippled street hustler. But in ''Tootsie'' he took on perhaps the greatest challenge of his acting career. He plays Michael Dorsey, an unemployed actor who resorts to impersonating a woman in order to get work, and lands the role of Dorothy Michaels, the dignified but feisty middle-aged actress who becomes a cult heroine to millions of viewers by standing up for her own and other women's rights in her role as a hospital administrator in a soap opera. Mr. Hoffman - who helped to develop the character and the script with the playwright Murray Schisgal and a succession of other writers -became fascinated by some of the questions raised by the film: What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be a woman? What would a given individual be like if he or she were to change gender? Some Gnawing Questions The actor has been preoccupied with such issues for three years now, ever since he finished ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' and began working on ''Tootsie.'' And although that film has now opened, Mr. Hoffman continues to worry those questions like a terrier with a bone, gnawing at them and fretting over them with obsessive interest. The issue of physical appearance was a major one, both for the film and for Mr. Hoffman; the discovery that he might portray a woman convincingly but that he could never turn himself into a pretty one was shattering. The next step was outrage over how he was treated by men; while Mr. Hoffman freely admits that he, as a man, has been guilty of the same sin, he was devastated that his homeliness as a woman rendered him next to invisible to many men. ''I got to the point where I could fool people, when I was exploring the ways women and men related to me as Dorothy,'' he explains, ''and I'd never been related to that way before in my life - having men meet me, say hello and immediately start looking over my shoulder trying to find an attractive woman! I could feel that number printed on me, that I was a 4, or maybe a 6. And I would get very hostile: I wanted to get even with them. But I also realized I wouldn't ask myself out: If I looked the way I looked as Dorothy, I wouldn't come up to myself at a party.'' He shakes his head. ''What a waste. Look at all the people I might have passed up because they had to fit a certain visual thing that's part of the way I was brought up. I think it's because most men don't feel attractive. There's this tremendous repressed narcissism, because we want to be more attractive, so we get a good-looking girl next to us to get rid of the Dorothy feeling. Because most people are Dorothys - that's why we veer away from the Dorothys at a party.'' Knowing Versus Admittings Mr. Hoffman readily acknowledges that while he is far more aware of the interaction between men and women now, he is also more honest about some things he knew in his pre-Dorothy days but wouldn't have admitted. ''Men know a lot of things they don't admit,'' Mr. Hoffman observes. ''We tend to try to take advantage of what we can take advantage of, until the people we're trying to take advantage of don't want to let us any more.'' Before he began to inhabit Dorothy's mind and accoutrements, Mr. Hoffman's sense of any advantage in being a woman revolved primarily around the discrepancy in the functions of a mother and a father. ''There's a lot about being a woman I've always felt robbed about,'' he notes. ''I can't carry children, I can't bear children, I can't breast-feed. When it comes to all that, I've always felt like a stagehand. There's a sadness attached to it, of living one life and not experiencing a whole load of things. We as men do not know what we don't experience by being a woman.'' He discusses such subjects now with the urgency of a new convert. ''I'm telling you,'' he says passionately, ''if you are a woman for a month, the world is a different experience in ways you would never imagine.'' Mr. Hoffman believes that he has been changed by the experience. ''My wife tells me that playing the part altered me,'' he reports. ''She says that with 'Tootsie' I was much less impatient, more tolerant of mistakes, particularly my own. Whenever a mistake happens I panic and get angry. If I spill something or make the wrong turn on the freeway, the first thing I feel is that I'm weak, and it shouldn't happen, and if I could I'd blame it on somebody else. But when I was doing this part, those things would happen and I'd react the way my wife would: I wouldn't slam the dashboard and curse, I'd say, 'That's all right, we'll get off at the next exit.''' 'Poker a Masculine Sport' But if Dorothy Michaels provided a breakthrough in Mr. Hoffman's understanding of the roles he has unconsciously played as a man, acting itself has been the most important catalyst for that evolution over the years. ''One of the things about being a man in this society is giving away as little as possible,'' Mr. Hoffman notes. ''Part of manhood is not to be taken advantage of. Poker is a masculine sport, where the whole thing is bluff and knowing where someone's vulnerability is so you can attack and try to take something away from them.'' One of the reasons Mr. Hoffman identified with Dorothy was his own harrowingly vivid memories of being thought unappealing as an adolescent. ''I was very upset by it when I realized that I wasn't attractive enough - as Dorothy - for me to want to go to bed with myself, and I guess it must have reminded me of a lot of things about being a kid, when I couldn't get a date in high school,'' he says. ''A big reason I went into acting was social: it was to meet girls. I wasn't athletic, I was a very bad student, there wasn't anything I felt I could do. Acting was the first time in my life when I felt attractive, the first time I felt as though I knew what I was doing. I loved it. I was home. It was like finding a new family.'' The pain of early rejections has stayed with him, however, at times providing a powerful resource for his acting, as with his role as the crippled hustler in ''Midnight Cowboy.'' ''Ratso Rizzo was not character acting,'' Mr. Hoffman says, his voice suddenly suffused with pain and bitterness. ''That was just an autobiography of subjective feelings about oneself.'' At present he remains fascinated by the issues raised in ''Tootsie,'' and when enthusiastic fans tell him they loved Dorothy and ask him to do a sequel, he does not preclude the possibility. ''But I wouldn't want to do it unless I could top it,'' he muses. Then he brightens. ''If I could give birth...''

581-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Shift to Riches
What Darrell Waltrip calls ''a typical rags-to-riches story'' has now definitely reached the ''riches'' era. The 35-year-old stock car driver from Owensboro, Ky., recently won the Grand National Winston Cup for the second consecutive year, accumulating record purses of $878,118 en route to the top spot in Nascar competition. He also won the Olsonite driver-of-the-year title for the third time. Last week in New York, he picked up checks totaling $187,000 for his driving achievements in 1982. But Waltrip remembers the ''rags.'' ''When I started in 1973,'' he said last week, ''I had one car, very little money and a sponsor with very little money. My wife, Stevie, and I slept in a truck, ate pork and beans, and borrowed money from friends to keep me racing on scrubby tracks throughout Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi. ''We were on the bottom. But I think that you have to be on the bottom once to be able to succeed. It spurs you on, it gives you the determination and desire to make it to the top. Since I was a little kid, I've had the determination that I would someday be the best driver there ever was. I may not have reached that yet, but I've been the most successful Nascar driver over the last 10 years.'' Waltrip's fascination with auto racing began when he was 6 years old. He would sneak out of bed at 6 A.M. on Sundays and phone his grandparents. ''Don't forget to call me and ask me to go to the auto races,'' he would say. His parents would not permit the youngster to go to either of Owensboro's two dirt tracks unless his grandparents took him. ''I loved the cars and all the noise and commotion. Racing is all I ever wanted to do since then,'' he said.

584-> HUSSEIN AND ARAB LEAGUE GROUP ARRIVE IN CHINA FOR MIDEAST TALKS
King Hussein of Jordan and an Arab League delegation arrived in China today, hopeful of winning Chinese support for a Middle East peace compromise. King Hussein and the delegation arrived from Pakistan, where they dined with President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq during a 17-hour stopover en route from Moscow. The tour is aimed at winning support from the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council for the Arab League peace plan agreed upon at Fez, Morocco. King Hussein will travel to the United States this month. China's new Foreign Minister, Wu Xueqian, met the delegation, and talks with senior Chinese officials were expected to begin Monday. 'There Are Many Questions' At a 15-minute airport news conference in Islamabad, King Hussein raised the possibility of a compromise between President Reagan's plan for Middle East peace and the eight-point plan drafted by Arab heads of state at Fez. ''This is what we are attempting to ascertain during the coming phase and hopefully the situation would become clearer as we proceed and progress,'' King Hussein said. ''There are many questions we would like to receive answers to.'' King Hussein did not specify on which points in the Reagan plan the Arabs would seek clarification. China has consistently supported the Palestine Liberation Organization and opposed Israel. The Arab League's eight-point proposal calls for a full-fledged Palestinian ''state'' on Israelioccupied territory, while Mr. Reagan's plan calls for a Palestinian ''homeland'' linked with Jordan. Held Talks With Andropov King Hussein is believed to be exploring the attitude of world leaders toward an affiliation between Jordan and the P.L.O. In Moscow, King Hussein and the Arab delegation held talks with the new Soviet Communist Party leader, Yuri V. Andropov, who said the Reagan plan was useless. King Hussein was asked in Islamabad how he would procede now that Mr. Andropov had rejected the Reagan plan and Washington had opposed the Fez plan. ''Our mission has been to explain the eight-point Fez plan,'' the King said. ''This is what we have concentrated upon throughout our visits so far, and once we have a complete picture we will put it together to see where do we go.''

587-> WIDE NEW SEARCH FOR LIFE IN SPACE IS SET TO BEGIN
a quest that nearly died under the weight of Congressional criticism - is being revived in a new and vastly improved form. It will be the most sensitive and thorough exploration for life on other worlds ever mounted by man. The renewed search, several million times more extensive than past efforts, will use three giant radio antennas spaced around the globe, exploiting the most advanced signal processing techniques to extract, from all the radio waves impinging on the earth, any that might originate from other civilizations. ''Astronomy has shown that there are enormous numbers of stars like the sun and that the abundances of chemical elements are much the same everywhere,'' the National Academy of Sciences said in a recent report on the value of such extraterrestrial research. ''It seems possible, therefore, that there are habitats for life scattered throughout the universe.'' Whether life has actually originated there, it added, can only be determined by observation. A relatively modest allocation of $1.5 million in the 1983 budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is designed to cover the first of five years of research and development on signal processing equipment for the project, known as SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). One factor greatly moderating the cost is that the search will employ existing antennas, normally used for communication with space probes and located near Madrid, at Tidbinbilla, Australia, and Goldstone, Calif. Early tests will be conducted at Goldstone next summer, using a multichannel spectrum analyzer being developed at Stanford University. The prototype will simultaneously scan 74,000 channels, or frequency ranges. The received signal on each channel, in onesecond increments, will then be analyzed. Once the developers feel they have achieved the optimum design, additional units will be produced to raise the capacity, in about two years, from 74,000 to eight million channels. Use of this device will be like scanning one spot in the sky with eight million receivers. If, heaven forbid, there were disk jockeys at the other end of each of those radio channels, one could receive them all at once. In fact, Prof. Allen M. Peterson, in charge of the project at Stanford, hopes the figure can go to 100 million when new very large integrated circuits and computer microchips become available. The output of this device will be fed into a computer provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, which operates the Goldstone center. The computer is being programmed to search for repetitive signals or other manifestations of artificiality while weeding out the flood of emissions from human activity in space as well as on earth. The Stanford analyzer will be able to scan channels only a single hertz wide - a frequency band whose width is only one cycle per second. According to John H. Wolfe, scientific director of the search project at NASA's Ames Research Center here, observations so far confirm that no natural processes in space produce radio emissions in such narrow bandwidths. While atoms in distant sources emit radio waves at characteristic frequencies, they are never that narrow, in part because motion of the atoms alters the frequencies. Human activity produces numerous narrow-band signals, and scientists postulate that other civilizations might do the same, either for such local purposes as television transmission or possibly as beacons to signal their presence. Every television station transmits horizontally a narrow-band carrier frequency. These transmissions radiate beyond the horizon into space. Their combined effect, for a region of concentrated television stations like the Northeast, is to sweep the heavens as the earth rotates, like an airport beacon. It is only the unchanging carrier signal (against which the picture-@ and sound-producing modulations are matched) that is likely to carry over interstellar distances. Scarred by Budget-Cutting The SETI program nearly died when it was dropped from the space agency's 1982 budget. Largely at the initiative of Senator William Proxmire, the budget ruled out any funds for such a project. This action came after a magazine article ridiculing the program was published under the title ''NASA Flimflams Congress.'' Like Senator Proxmire, some scientists have opposed the program because they think there is an absence of evidence that life has appeared anywhere else and because of the distances that must separate civilizations if any exist - distances so great that exchanges of messages might take centuries. Nevertheless, last October, 69 scientists, including seven Nobel laureates, from a dozen countries published a letter in the journal Science urging ''organization of a coordinated, worldwide and systematic search for extraterrestrial intelligence.'' ''We represent a wide variety of opinion on the abundance of extraterrestrials,'' they wrote. For example, they said, they were not of one mind on the skeptical argument that we would already have heard from other intelligent beings if there were any. ''But we are unanimous in our opinion,'' they continued, ''that the only significant test of the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is an experimental one.'' The signers included such diverse figures as Lee A. DuBridge, former president of the California Institute of Technology and science adviser to President Nixon; the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, president of Notre Dame University; Roald Z. Sagdeev, director of the Institute for Cosmic Research in the Soviet Academy of Sciences; Leo Goldberg, former director of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, and Jan H. Oort of Leiden University in the Netherlands, both of whom are past presidents of the International Astronomical Union. Almost at the same time, the National Academy of Science issued its report supporting SETI. The study was done by a blue-ribbon panel convened by the academy to propose guidelines for astronomy in the 1980's. Led by George B. Field, former director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the panel listed a long-term search program ''at a modest level'' as one of seven priority projects for this decade. The new search is being organized by the Ames Research Center, under the direction of John Billingham, and by a group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory led by Michael Klein. The strategy is twofold. The project will sweep the entire sky and will also concentrate on 773 stars that lie within 80 light years and resemble the sun sufficiently to make evolution of life on a nearby planet seem plausible. The search will cover four times more stars than in all the three dozen searches carried out since 1960, and it will sweep a range of frequencies three million times greater. The planned frequency range is from 1.2 to 3 gigahertz (billion hertz), with spot checks up to 10 gigahertz. Special attention will be paid to stars within 20 light years that appear to be single. There have been doubts regarding the habitability of planets orbiting in multiple-star systems. Automatic devices will switch the antenna from star to star, permitting unmanned operation. This search will examine the frequency range being explored in increments of 74,000 hertz. The multichannel spectrum analyzer will split each such increment into 74,000 channels of one hertz each, plus channels 32 and 1,024 hertz in width. The broader channels will detect weaker signals than the narrow ones. Each increment of the spectrum will be monitored for 10 to 1,000 seconds. The strength of the signal in each channel will be converted to digital form and stored for 1,000 seconds so the computer can watch for pulses, signals drifting in frequency or other suspicious features such as polarization of the wave motions. In the all-sky search less time will be spent on each spot because of the vast area to be covered. Full coverage of the heavens is expected to take three years. Since briefer observing of each area means less signal energy received, the narrowest frequency band scanned will be 32 hertz. The band from 1.2 to 10 gigahertz will be swept, with spot observations up to 25 gigahertz. This will permit 300 times greater sensitivity and 20,000 times more frequency coverage than in past searches. Special attention will be given to globular clusters, the Milky Way and its core, as well as nearby galaxies. Using Ever-Larger Antennas Late this year, after initial tests at Goldstone, the detectors are to be moved to the world's largest antenna at Arecibo, P.R. Ultimately the 110-foot dishes of the Deep Space Network are to be used, with Goldstone covering 80 percent of the heavens and the Australian site the rest. The frequencies chosen lie in or near the ''waterhole,'' a part of the radio spectrum in which there is the least loss of signal strength across interstellar distances. It includes the frequencies emitted in space by both hydrogen and hydroxyl, which, when combined, produce water. Civilizations might find that part of the radio spectrum a logical rendezvous, or ''waterhole.'' The project leaders are concerned that radio interference from an electronic countermeasures test center at nearby Fort Irwin will handicap the Goldstone monitoring. An added hazard is the increasing use of frequencies near the ''waterhole'' by communications satellites in high, hovering orbits above the Equator. By the end of the century, according to Dr. Wolfe, as many as 100 such satellites may ring the earth. ''It's going to be a nightmare,'' he said.

589-> SKETCHES OF THE ASTRONAUTS ORBITING EARTH TODAY ABOARD THE SPACE SHUTTLE
Vance D. Brand In the final moments of his last trip into space, Vance Devoe Brand, commander of the current flight of Columbia, was made unconscious for almost a minute by noxious nitrogen tetroxide fumes that were sucked into the cabin. The incident occurred on the descent from an otherwise flawless nine-day mission in 1975 in which an Apollo spacecraft made a successful rendezvous with a Soviet Soyuz. Mr. Brand and the other two Apollo astronauts, Maj. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford of the Air Force and Donald K. Slayton, were hospitalized for three days. The descent was unusually noisy with much radio static and excessive sound from the jet thrusters and the rush of air around the capsule. At 30,000 feet, in the midst of all this, Mr. Brand failed to hit two switches. One would have turned off the thrusters that controlled the spacecraft's attitude in space, which were unnecessary in the atmosphere. It was gas from the thrusters that entered the cabin. The other switch was to activate the automatic system that deployed the spacecraft's parachutes. ''I was surprised when they didn't come out, and I quickly punched the manual button,'' Mr. Brand said. The Apollo then floated down to a perfect landing in the Pacific. A veteran of nearly 7,000 hours flying time in military aircraft, Mr. Brand, blond, gray-eyed, 5 feet 11 inches tall and now 51 years old, is described by a colleague as ''brilliant, with a reservoir of calm, unflappable confidence'' and a boyish grin. He lists running, hiking, skiing and canoeing as recreational interests, but admits that training for a space flight leaves little time for such things and not even as much time as he would like for his family. He is married to Beverly Ann Whitnel and has five children, four by a previous marriage. Mr. Brand was born in Longmont, Colo., attended high school there and majored in business administration at the University of Colorado, graduating in 1953. He was also commissioned in the Marine Corps and soon entered flying training. After several assignments, including a tour as a fighter pilot in Japan, he returned to civilian life as a flight test engineer and experimental test pilot for Lockheed. In 1960 he earned a bachelor of science degree in aeronautical engineering at the University of Colorado and, in 1964, a master's degree in business administration at University of California at Los Angeles. He joined the space program in 1966. He was a support crewman for the Apollo 8 and 13 missions; backup command module pilot for Apollo 15 and backup commander for Skylab 3 and 4. He believes the Apollo-Soyuz mission was a remarkable demonstration of international technical cooperation. ''We demonstrated that the two sides could coordinate scientific minds and very complicated systems and make it all come off very well,'' Mr. Brand said. He does not expect anything like it to happen again soon. Robert F. Overmyer Early in his career Col. Robert Franklyn Overmyer of the Marine Corps, co-pilot of the Columbia in its fifth orbital mission, seemed destined to fly a space station. In the 1960's he was headed for participation in the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory Program, and after that program was canceled he joined the space agency's astronaut corps in 1969. Had the Overmyer home not been in the path of planes at the Cleveland airport, he might have chosen another career. The lowflying air traffic instilled an obsession with flying in him. ''I went into the Marine Corps and became a jet pilot,'' he said recently. ''I became an aeronautical engineer. I decided I wanted to be a test pilot.'' His first assignment with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was to aid in the engineering development of Skylab, the space laboratory that was launched in 1973 and dropped out of orbit in 1979 after being used by three astronaut crews. He then came tantalizingly close to going to the moon, serving on the support crew for Apollo 17, the last lunar mission. It was Colonel Overmyer's voice, as ''capsule communicator,'' that reassured those aboard the spacecraft as it soared into orbit. He played a similar role for the Apollo-Soyuz project that led to the docking of Soviet and American spacecraft in 1979. He acted as the American capsule communicator at the space center near Moscow. While there, he said recently, he heard a strange ripping sound as he tilted his chair back. Underneath he found torn wires that he assumed had served an eavesdropping device to the floor. Cleveland Suburb Is Home Robert F. Overmyer, now 180 pounds and almost six feet tall, was born July 14, 1936, in Lorain, Ohio, on the shore of Lake Erie. He considers his home Westlake, on the outskirts of Cleveland. In 1954 he was graduated from Westlake High School and went to Baldwin-Wallace College in Berea, Ohio, where he was awarded a bachelor's degree in physics in 1958. He then joined the Marine Corps, took flight training and studied aeronautical engineering at the Naval Postgraduate School, where he received a master of science degree in 1964. The next year he attended the Air Force Test Pilots' School and was selected as an astronaut for the Air Force's abortive Manned Orbiting Laboratory. He is married to the former Katherine E. Jones of Pittsburgh, and they have three children, Carolyn Marie, 16, Patricia Ann, 14, and Robert Rolandus, 12. Colonel Overmyer, his wife and oldest daughter are fliers, and he expects the same of his other children. In astronaut training, Colonel Overmyer was introduced to a new diversion. To prepare himself for the weightlessness of space, he was required to work underwater, wearing scuba equipment. Plunging into the sea off California's Catalina Island has now become a favorite pastime. ''Diving down and swimming through the kelp there is like being in a cathedral,'' he said in a recent interview, adding that the kelp ''stretches from the ocean floor out over the top, about 90 feet high.'' The colonel also enjoys acrobatic flying in open-cockpit biplanes. Joseph P. Allen 4th While his colleagues roamed the valleys of the moon a decade ago, Joe Allen sat in the space center in Houston with headset and microphone, talking to them on the radio. He was ''Capcom,'' the link between America's early space explorers and their earthbound supporters. He vicariously shared their joys, miseries and adventures while envying them their experience. But now, after 15 years of wishing to travel in space, the wish has become father to the deed. Joseph Percival Allen 4th, a 45-year-old physicist who obtained his doctorate at Yale University in 1965, is one of the group of several scientist-astronauts that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration selected over the last two decades. And he is one of the two mission specialists who are accompanying the flight commander and pilot aboard the space shuttle Columbia on its latest mission. The designers of the shuttle had to modify the seating arrangement aboard the space shuttle this time to accomodate four people instead of two, which gave Dr. Allen's colleagues the opportunity to remind him, as often as possible, that there would be no trouble in finding suitable places to stow his 5-foot 6-inch, 125-pound frame. The space agency's records show that, of all the male astronauts, Dr. Allen is the smallest. 'Nifty Experiments' in Space In 1967, while working as a research associate at the University of Washington's nuclear physics laboratory, he was recruited by NASA to join the space program. Dr. Allen saw the opportunity to be a part of the new scientific frontier in space. Referring to experiments in space, he said in a recent interview: ''Anybody that has an interest in that sort of thing would be naturally attracted. Any number of nifty experiments can be done in that frontier, so I was professionally intrigued.'' Before becoming an astronaut, Dr. Allen was a staff physicist at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory at Yale and was a guest research associate at Brookhaven National Laboratory. 2,700 Hours of Flying Time As part of his early astronaut training, he completed a 53-week course in flying at Vance Air Force Base in Oklahoma. So far, he has logged more than 2,700 hours of flying time. The astronaut-physicist was born in Crawfordsville, Ind., and is married to the former Bonnie Jo Darling. They have a 14-year-old son, David, and a 10-year-old daughter, Elizabeth. In pursuing a life that is as physically active as time will permit, Dr. Allen enjoys handball, squash racquets, skiing and wind surfing. He describes wind surfing as something like learning to ride a bicycle. ''You get pretty discouraged at first because you keep falling off,'' he said. ''But then something clicks and you start moving in one direction pretty well. The next thing you know, you're moving all over the lake.'' William B. Lenoir William B. Lenoir, mission specialist on the Columbia's fifth flight, began his career as an astronaut by mailing a coupon, clipped from the journal Science, to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The space agency was advertising for scientistastronauts; Dr. Lenoir, then an engineering professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he thought it was ''time to get a little breath of air.'' ''I had decided to take at least a couple of years away from M.I.T.,'' Dr. Lenoir said. Since his research had been in the remote sensing of earth from satellites, he decided to give space a try. After filling out ''three reams of paper'' the space agency sent in reply to his coupon, Dr. Lenoir joined NASA in 1967. As an astronaut, he learned to fly jet aircraft and now has more than 2,900 flight hours in them. But the liftoff yesterday marked his first trip into space, Was in Skylab Program He served as backup astronaut in 1973 for the second and third manned missions in the Skylab program, Skylab 3 and Skylab 4, In 1974-76 he was leader of the NASA Satellite Power Team, concerned with investigating the potential of large satellite power systems to generate power for consumption on earth. His duties on the Columbia includes overseeing the launching of the two commercial satellites the shuttle took aloft. Dr. Lenoir acknowledges an occasional career conflict with his wife Elizabeth, who is now serving her second term as Mayor of the Texas town of El Lago (population slightly more than 3,000). Explaining that El Lago politics are nonpartisan, he says he shares his reactions to political issues with Mrs. Lenoir, but takes a back seat in campaigns, when he works ''on the grunt level, you know, hammering in signs and passing out handbills.'' Until he became the object of publicity for the fifth shuttle flight, he says, he was known to some of his wife's associates not as an astronaut but only as the Mayor's husband. The Lenoirs have two children, William Jr., who is 17, and Samantha, 14. Educated at M.I.T. William Lenoir was born March 14, 1939, in Miami, where his father, Samuel S. Lenoir, still lives. He attended primary and secondary school in Coral Gables, Fla., and then went to M.I.T., where he received his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1961, his master's degree in 1962, and his doctorate in 1968. He was an instructor there at M.I.T. in 1964-65, and in 1965 was appointed assistant professor of electrical engineering. Dr. Lenoir is a registered professional engineer in Texas. Asked if he was excited about his Columbia assignment, he said ''It's unprofessional to be excited.'' ''Interested and very much agog in anticipation,'' Dr. Lenoir added, were the more appropriate expressions for his state of mind.

592-> SAVINGS INSTITUTIONS ARE HEALTHIER BUT NOW FACE FURTHER CHALLENGES
The nation's thrift institutions, which only a year ago were facing the prospect of collapse, are in stronger shape now, thanks largely to the sharp decline in interest rates. But they still face a difficult future as banking practices grow more and more competitive. Even now, most savings banks and savings and loan associations are continuing to lose money. But, with the lower interest rates, the majority are expected to return to profitability in the new year. ''The worst is over, there's no doubt about that,'' said Senator Jake Garn, the Utah Republican who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. The damage, however, has been considerable to the industry, which has long been the main provider of home mortgage money. More than 800 savings and loan associations have gone out of business in the last three years, leaving about 3,900, according to the United States League of Savings Institutions. The number of savings banks has dropped to 424, down 39 in the past two years, the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks says. The two types of thrift institutions function similarly, accepting consumer deposits and financing the housing industry. A Loss of Jobs The problems have also had a personal toll. In cases where regulatory authorities forced the mergers because a savings institution was failing, the authorities usually required the resignation of the top officers. In addition, many other officers were squeezed out of their jobs. ''You don't need two corporate treasurers,'' one official said. Richard T. Pratt, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which supervises the savings and loan industry, says the thrifts have finally ''come through a life-threatening crisis.'' But he adds, ''A long period of rehabilitation is needed, probably five to ten years.'' Government officials, industry executives and financial analysts agree that the industry's problems are not over. The industry is undergoing basic changes. Most importantly, a landmark law, the Depository Institutions Act of 1982, gave the thrift units broader powers. They now are more like commercial banks and can make commercial loans. ''They now have the tools, everything they need, to compete,'' said Representative Fernand J. St Germain, the Rhode Island Democrat who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. Mr. Garn and Mr. St Germain sponsored the 1982 law. That law provides for emergency money for troubled institutions, a measure that is expected to reduce the number of mergers within the industry. Some analysts believe the measure also gave the industry a needed psychological lift after the spate of mergers had battered morale. Industry leaders complained that regulatory agencies, which often forced or encouraged the mergers, were heavy handed, but today most of them state that the regulators did a good job over all. ''We would have liked fewer mergers,'' said William B. O'Connell, executive vice president of the United States League of Savings Institutions. ''But in general the regulators handled it reasonably well.'' Fears of a Year Ago Only a year ago, many financial analysts feared that the entire thrift industry would collapse because of high interest rates. Now, short-term rates are in the area of 8 percent, more than six points below their level at midyear. The industry's problems came about when it had to offer higher rates to attract and retain deposits than it was earning on investments, which were mainly long-term mortgages made years ago when rates were far lower. For example, in the first half of this year, the average cost of funds in the form of deposits at the nation's savings and loan associations was 11.49 percent. That was more than a point over the 10.41 percent return on their mortgage portfolios, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Besides that, the thrift institutions had to pay salaries and rent and other costs. The decline in interest rates, however, has changed the equation. ''We turned the corner to profitability'' on Dec. 7, said Richard H. Deihl, president of Home Savings of America. ''It continues to get better day by day,'' he added. Home Savings is a $15.5 billion savings and loan association that is based in Los Angeles. Help Was Just in Time For some institutions, the decline in interest rates came just in time. In New York, for example, such savings banks as the Bowery and the Emigrant have almost run out of surplus funds - the amount by which their assets exceed their liabilities. Only a few months ago, they seemed doomed but now they have brighter prospects. The Bowery, for example, reported an operating loss of $43.2 million in the third quarter and its surplus amounted to only $49.3 million. Thus, if its rate of loss continued at the third-quarter level, and if it did not sell assets at a profit, it would have run out of reserves in the first quarter of 1983. ''Things are way, way better. There's no doubt about it,'' said Ellis T. Gravette Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of the Bowery. Mr. Gravette said the Bowery, by selling real estate and other assets it owns, would have survived even if rates had remained high. ''Now we can just do more things,'' he said. In fact, the Bowery now is trying to buy a savings and loan association in Florida. END OF LEDE THRIFT; deposit-insurance agencies to lend capital to thrift units that are running out of reserves. The agencies would issue capital certificates to troubled savings institutions, but the agencies would not have to lay out any actual money unless the institution failed. The act did not make certificates available to thrift units that had no chance of surviving on their own. The law broadened the powers of the thrift units by allowing them to make commercial loans and to accept demand deposits, thereby opening up a new market for them. Because the deposits mature in only a few months, compared with 30 years for a mortgage, it also means the institutions will be able to make short-term loans, which pose less serious problems when interest rates rise quickly. But the added powers can create problems in that the thrift institutions do not have experience in the new and difficult businesses. Some May Be Well-Positioned Some of the giant institutions that were produced by the forced mergers during the interest rate crisis of the past two years might be in the best position to meet the challenges of the new businesses because they are large enough to hire the new personnel and expertise needed. New York State's Buffalo Savings Bank, for example, was a $3 billion institution in late 1981, but its assets have surged to $9 billion with the acquisitions of several failing savings banks. Because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation provided capital to make the merger work, the savings bank's surplus was strengthened. Home Savings of America also expanded by acquiring failing savings and loan associations. The concern now has subsidiaries in Florida, Texas, Missouri and Illinois, besides California. ''We certainly have more potential, we're in more markets,'' said Mr. Deihl, its president. The problems that the thrift institutions carried during the time of high interest rates would have been far more severe if consumers had lost confidence in the thrift units and they had quickly withdrawn huge amounts of deposits. This would have caused the institutions to sell assets below face value. Such losses could have wiped out the resources of the two deposit insurance agencies - the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits in commercial and savings banks, and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits in savings and loans. A year or so ago, Alan Greenspan, a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ford and currently an adviser to President Reagan, estimated that the market value of mortgages held by savings and loan associations was about $100 billion below their face value. But depositors remained confident that the Federal agencies would protect their funds. Indeed, no depositor lost any money, even when deposits were greater than the $100,000 insured by the agencies. This was made possible by merging troubled institutions into stronger others to avoid a failure. Despite the improvement in the industry, most thrift spokesmen emphasize that the problems are not over. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation estimates that about 100 more savings and loan associations are so troubled that they cannot be saved. But for most of the savings and loans, the question is no longer one of survival. ''There are still problems,'' said Mr. Deihl of Home Savings. ''Money costs are still high. We're just doing a little better than covering our costs.'' Unknown Effect of New Account A big unknown is the effect of the new money market accounts on the earnings of savings institutions. These acounts, which were authorized by the Garn-St Germain bill, are not subject to interestrate ceilings. This allows the thrift institutions to compete for deposits more equally with money market mutual funds, which have not been subject to interest rate ceilings. While the thrift industry welcomes the improved ability to compete for deposits, it fears that the high-yielding accounts, which were introduced on Dec. 14, may draw a lot of money from their 5 1/2 percent savings accounts, thereby increasing their overall costs. ''The hope is that yields on the money-market accounts will stabilize around 9 percent or so,'' said Robert Chaut, a savings and loan analyst with A.G. Becker Inc., a New York securities firm. Some thrift units are currently offering more than 12 1/2 percent on these accounts. Senator Garn said he is ''very pleased with the much improved condition of the thrifts.'' But, he added, ''Having said that, there are difficult times ahead unless interest rates continue to go down and stay down.''

593-> GOVERNMENT SPENDING EXCEEDS $1,000 BILLION
Both the income and spending of Federal, state and local governments exceeded $1,000 billion for the first time in the fiscal year that ended in 1981, the Census Bureau reported today. Revenue increased 15.4 percent, to $1,075 billion. Expenditures went up more, 15.8 percent. At nearly $1,110 billion, they exceeded income by about $35 billion. Debts Up $117 Billion The census report said the debts of all governments, the Federal Government included, increased $117.4 billion to $1,400 billion. State and local government debt went up $28.3 billion, reaching $363.9 billion. The Federal debt was more than $1,000 billion. Another report made public today showed that spending by all govenments in pursuit of environmental quality in the fiscal year 1980 rose 15 percent, reaching $16.1 billion. The first report said tax revenue increased to $8 $650 billion, from $574 billion. About 62 percent of the tax revenue was raised by the Federal Government, 23 percent by states and 15 percent by local jurisdictions. Included were $332 billion in individual income taxes and $75.3 billion in corporate taxes, $134.5 billion from sales, gross receipts and customs taxes and duties, $75 billion from property taxes, and $33.5 billion from other sources. Tuition and Other Charges Counted The report said another $170.5 billion was received from such charges as tuition, postal receipts, hospital bills and interest earnings. Government-owned liquor stores produced $3.3 billion. Utility sales produced $26.6 billion, and insurance trusts $224.7 billion. State and local governments received $90.3 billion from the Federal Government, of which $1.1 billion was from the general revenue sharing program. Another $4.5 billion went to for local governments. Government spending in the fiscal year that ended in 1981, the report said, included $584.8 billion for current operations, $116.5 billion for capital outlays, $68.6 billion for assistance and subsidies, $101 billion for interest and $238.9 billion for insurance benefits and repayments. Included in the total for current operations was $273.8 billion for salaries and wages.

594-> POP: ANNE MURRAY AND BAND
Decorous, pleasant and reliable are apt adjectives to describe Anne Murray, the Canadian folk-pop contralto who has enjoyed a steady commercial success for more than a decade. But there are also moments when Miss Murray, who sang with a 30-piece backup Friday at Radio City Music Hall, can be downright compelling. Although Miss Murray is not an inventive interpreter, certain sentimental country-pop ballads bring out in her a quiet, unaffected dignity that transforms greeting-card homilies into touching personal statements. At Friday's concert, this transformation happened several times, most notably in Kenny Loggins's old-timey ballad, ''Danny's Song'' and Randy Goodrum's ''You Needed Me,'' two Murray staples that are ideally suited to her simple declarative phrasing and warm, beautiful contralto. But like any pop concert, this one had to have its changes of pace, and especially in the uptempo pop-rock numbers, Miss Murray wasn't nearly so interesting. Recently, she has adopted a mildly gritty timbre for more emphatic uptempo songs. But this concession to rock taste only called attention to her rigidity of phrasing and resolute modesty of expression. Stephen Holden

595-> PUBLISHING: NELSON ACQUIRES EVEREST
THOMAS NELSON PUBLISHERS of Nashville, which this year bought the 143-year-old Dodd, Mead company, has now purchased Everest House, a five-year-old adult trade book publisher. Everest House will become an imprint of Dodd, Mead, which will continue as a general trade publisher based in New York. Lewis W. Gillenson, founder and president of Everest House, has been named president of Dodd, Mead, succeeding S. Phelps Platt Jr., who recently retired. Meanwhile, Sam Moore, president of Nelson, said that the company was engaged in talks with the possibility of acquiring additional trade book publishers under the Dodd, Mead banner. Dodd, Mead is the longtime American publisher of George Bernard Shaw and Agatha Christie, and its backlist includes such authors as G.K. Chesterton, Joseph Conrad, Sigmund Freud and Stephen Leacock. Mr. Moore, an immigrant from Lebanon who sold Bibles and religious books door to door in the South in the 1950's, paid $2.6 million in 1969 for Nelson, a division of a venerable British-owned publisher. Today it is the largest publisher of Bibles in the world, one of two publicly held Biblical publishers in the United States, and about 80 percent of its $50 million annual sales are derived from the sale of Bibles, which come in some 500 styles. Mr. Gillenson, former president and chief executive of Thomas Y. Crowell, founded Everest House in 1977 under the auspices of the Ambassador Foundation of California, which also published Quest magazine. Since its first list appeared in 1978, the company has had two best sellers: ''Danse Macabre'' by Stephen King and ''They Call Me Assassin'' by Jack Tatum. New Allegations Made Against D.M. Thomas D.M. Thomas, the best-selling novelist and translator, has been accused by Carl R. Proffer, a professor of Russian literature at the University of Michigan, of having used many of Professor Proffer's notes ''without acknowledgment, word for word'' in Mr. Thomas's 1976 book-length translation of a poem by the late Anna Akhmatova, the foremost woman poet in modern Russian literature. The charge comes less than two months after Mr. Thomas, author of the best-selling novel ''The White Hotel,'' was accused by another scholar of having adapted much of his recent translation of a collection of poems by Alexander Pushkin from two earlier volumes of Pushkin translations into English, rather than from the original Russian. Meanwhile, Prof. James Fennell, author of one of the two volumes of Pushkin that Mr. Thomas is accused of having used as a source, has pointed to many ''striking similarities'' between his own prose translations and Mr. Thomas's verse renderings. Mr. Thomas vigorously denied that he had adapted rather than translated that collection, ''The Bronze Horseman: Selected Poems of Alexander Pushkin.'' Asked about the Proffer allegations, Mr. Thomas, speaking from his home in Hereford, England, said Wednesday: ''No comment. If I feel a comment is called for, I will make it in the proper way.'' The book now in dispute is Mr. Thomas's translation of Anna Akhmatova's '' 'Requiem' and 'Poem Without a Hero,' '' published by Ohio University Press in 1977. Mr. Proffer's translation of the same poem was published in Russian Literature Triquarterly in 1971, then in a book by Ardis Press (1973) and still later in ''Anna Akhmatova: Selected Poems'' (Ardis, 1975), edited by Walter Arndt, professor of Russian at Dartmouth College. Ardis Press of Ann Arbor, Mich., founded in 1971 by Mr. Proffer and his wife, Ellendea, publishes books in English and Russian, and facsimile translations of Soviet works. The Proffers also edit Russian Literature Triquarterly. In a telephone conversation, Mr. Proffer said that the Akhmatova poem ''is very allusive, so it demands annotation, and so many of the notes Thomas provided are actually my notes, stolen without acknowledgment, word for word.'' He added: ''Not all Thomas's notes were taken from my version, but a number of them were,'' including one that came from a private conversation that Mr. Proffer had had with Nadezhda Mandelstam, widow of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam and herself the author of ''Hope Against Hope'' and ''Hope Abandoned,'' both widely praised memoirs. Professor Proffer made a somewhat similar charge against Mr. Thomas four years ago, in reviewing Mr. Thomas's translation of the Akhmatova poem. ''Thomas's notes are nearly all derivative,'' he wrote in Russian Literature Triquarterly, citing three examples. ''At the time, I got a letter from Mr. Thomas saying something to the effect that we scholars have many sources and sometimes the file cards get misplaced,'' Mr. Proffer said. 'I laughed and threw the letter away. But when I saw Simon Karlinsky's review I was stunned.'' Mr. Karlinsky's review of the Pushkin translation appeared in the Sept. 26 issue of The New York Times Book Review. Mr. Karlinsky is professor of Slavic languages and literature at the University of California. Noting that Mr. Thomas acknowledged having been ''much influenced'' by the ''lucid prose'' versions of Mr. Fennell, whose anthology ''Pushkin'' contains Russian texts with plain prose translations of each poem, Professor Karlinsky said that ''influence seems hardly the right term'' to describe the author's dependence on Professors Fennell and Arndt. Professor Karlinsky continued: ''His reliance on the work of these two scholars (barely hinted at in the case of Mr. Fennell, unacknowledged in that of Mr. Arndt), is so wholesale that in all fairness Mr. Thomas ought to have at least named them as his co-translators.'' Mr. Thomas denied the charge vehemently and at length in the Oct. 24 issue of the Book Review. ''I was fired by love of Pushkin, not of his translators,'' he wrote. ''To have 'depended upon' scholars' translations would have negated my whole reason for making the translations, and killed my pleasure.'' He added that, ''where my selection overlapped Professor Fennell's - or rather, where my 'freer' forms overlapped his - some apparent dependence on the Fennell prose (I use 'apparent' and 'dependence' strictly here) was unavoidable in places. For we were both seeking the most accurate, most strightforward way of expressing Pushkin's sense.'' Mr. Fennell, professor of Russian at Oxford University and currently a visiting professor at Stanford University, has disclaimed any wish to enter into dispute with Mr. Thomas. But, he said, ''I would nevertheless like to point out that Professor Karlinsky has only mentioned a very small portion of the 'similarities'; indeed the tip of the iceberg.'' He added: ''I am not a poet and have no pretensions to be one. But now at least I feel that had I split up some of my 'plain prose' translations into lines, I might have passed them off as poetry - and even got away with it.''

597-> EDUCATORS DEBATE WAYS FOR COLLEGES TO SURVIVE
The issues of equal access to education and college survival in a era of shrinking resources dominated the discussion at the second day of the College Board's national conference at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan. Dr. John Brademas, president of New York University, opened the session with an attack on the Reagan Administration's ''new federalism.'' Warning the 900 educators at the conference that ''if we turn away from education, we face a dark and fearful future,'' Dr. Brademas criticized the Administration's actions as a ''mindless shifting of Federal burdens to local and state governments.'' Some of the most spirited debate came during a discussion of the future of ''need blind'' admissions - admitting students without consideration of their ability to pay college costs. Karl M. Furstenberg, dean of admissions at Wesleyan College in Macon, Ga., outlined Wesleyan's recent decision to modify its needblind policy. Mr. Furstenberg emphasized that Wesleyan had not denied any student admission on the basis of financial need, but had only made public its belief that financial strains might force the university to do so at some point in the future. Clarify Admissions Criteria Leonard C. Marino, director of guidance at Farmingdale Senior High School in Farmingdale, L.I., countered with a story of a young student who was denied admission to a school because of financial need. The student did not know why he had been rejected, Mr. Marino said, and he urged his listeners to make public their admissions policies, whether need-blind or not. ''What kind of ways are we going to be able to help kids if we don't know admissions criteria?'' he asked. ''I want to make sure that colleges accept their responsibility and share this information with their customers - the students.'' ''Need-blind admissions has never existed,'' argued Leon Botstein, president of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., and Simon's Rock of Bard College in Great Barrington, Mass. Dr. Botstein told a group of admissions officers and financial-aid administrators that he believed that no school completely ignored a student's financial status. But he warned that, in a time of increasing competition between public and private schools, colleges could not attract a good student body without a generous financial aid program. ''It's not a matter of altruisum, but the only way we can maintain a quality student body,'' he said. Limit on Financial Aid Some educators in the audience argued that it was fairer to admit qualified students but only give financial aid to some of them, rather than rejecting them because they could not pay. In a luncheon address, Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio, sketched four trends that he said would have broad implications for educational policy: the shift from an industrial society to an information society, the rapid growth of the South, increasing decentralization and a public longing for human contact in an age of high technology and dehumanization.

598-> STYLE; JUDGE DEMBITZ: A LIFE IN FAMILY COURT
Last week was Nanette Dembitz's final one on the bench as a judge of the Family Court of the State of New York and, she said, she was taking things easy. But when one is a self-proclaimed ''workaholic,'' taking things easy is not always so easy to do. So on Thursday, the day before she completed a 15-year career in which she became one of the best known and most respected Family Court judges, she did the following: She ordered a tearful 13-yearold boy, who had been arrested for possession of cocaine and had escaped twice from detention, back into secure custody; congratulated a troubled teen-age girl on her acceptance into the Manhattan group home of her choice, and ordered that the case of an abandoned baby boy come before the court again next February to determine if he could be adopted. A Threat to a Lawyer And in the case that took the most time, she threatened an absent lawyer in a paternity case with contempt of court because she thought he was stalling. ''These people have been in court nine times already,'' she said angrily after the hearing in her courtroom on the fifth floor of the Family Court building at 60 Lafayette Street. ''That lawyer is just waiting for a new judge to hear the case.'' A new judge will hear the case, because Judge Dembitz, who turns 70 on Nov. 22, faces mandatory retirement. She could have stayed until the end of the year, but she chose to leave Friday, ''because I wanted to leave when I wanted to leave.'' ''I didn't want to be the last leaf on a tree to be shaken off on Dec. 31,'' she said. Judge Dembitz, a cousin of the late Louis D. (for Dembitz) Brandeis, an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, became well known during her 15 years in Family Court mainly because of her stands on controversial issues and her prolific writing (legal opinions and articles, as well as letters to the editors of newspapers). 'Her Legal Scholarship Is Superb' ''Nanette looks so fragile and delicate,'' said Edith L. Miller, a State Supreme Court justice who is Administrative Judge of the Family Court in New York City. ''Yet she is so strong and courageous. She never ran from difficult or controversial decisions. She's a brilliant jurist and a prolific writer, and her legal scholarship is just superb. I wish I could give her 10 more years.'' Judge Dembitz, who earned $57,299 a year, was one of 15 women among the 39 Family Court judges in New York City. She was perhaps best known for her decisions that removed children from their parents when she thought their home situations were destructive. ''I was a very hated judge,'' she said during an interview over peach yogurt in the lunchroom of the Family Court judges. ''I have lots of enemies.'' Her words, in the slow Southern drawl she acquired in her native Washington, seemed incongruous coming from this very slender woman with big blue eyes, the high cheekbones of a fashion model, and Mamie Eisenhower bangs. ''But I simply do not agree with those who say that the mother should always keep the child, and that the child will always do better at home,'' she went on. ''My answer is that society and government have a duty to that child. Every time I see a delinquent child of 12, 13 or 14, I feel so acutely aware that he was born with the potential of being a constructive, healthy, untormented child. The thought that the mother should always have the right to take care of this child is part of the court's work that I'll be happy to not have a part of.'' Daniel Greenberg, a lawyer who frequently represents parents in Family Court hearings, has been one of Judge Dembitz's major detractors over the years. ''She opts for removing children from the home in far too many cases,'' he said. ''I think this is destructive to the children as well as the family; children rarely find stability in foster care or state-run institutions.'' When asked to recall some of her more memorable experiences on the bench, Judge Dembitz mentioned the case of a young woman who had been a prostitute and drug addict for 10 years, and then asked the court to return her child on the grounds that she had a job and was rehabilitated. ''I restored the child to her because I believed her,'' the judge said. ''Later, she married the father of her child, and I went to the wedding. Today they live in Boston, where she earns $20,000 a year as a secretary. I get a Christmas card from them every year.'' ''But,'' she added, ''that was a very spectacular case, because there are not that many prostitutes and drug addicts who can be rehabilitated.'' Judge Dembitz said that her other satisfactions included seeing to it that advice about contraceptives was provided to sexually active teen-age girls who came before her court; that halfway houses were used more for youths released from state training schools, and that infants will soon be placed for adoption at an earlier age rather than being placed in foster homes. One disappointment came in 1972 when, as a Democratic candidate, she lost in her bid to become the first woman elected to the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. All three Republican candidates were swept into office on Richard Nixon's coattails. ''I never expected to win,'' she said, ''but I must have had a few moments when I fantasized winning.'' Judge Dembitz, whose father and grandfather were lawyers, graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Michigan and got her law degree in 1938 from Columbia, where she was an editor of the Law Review. Appointed by Lindsay in '67 Before being appointed to the Family Court by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1967, she served for 12 years as volunteer general counsel to the New York Civil Liberties Union and was also on the staff of the Legal Aid Society in charge of Family Court appeals. Now that she has retired, she plans to become a volunteer appellate consultant for the City Corporation Counsel. ''Before I became a judge,'' she said, ''I have to admit, shamefacedly, that my husband supported me.'' He is Alfred Berman, a lawyer, whom she married in 1939 after a courtship that took place, in part, in the library of the City Bar Association. They have a son, Jonathan, a biochemist, and three grandchildren. Did she ever feel the conflict between work and family that seems to plague so many career women today? ''My generation of women didn't make that much fuss about it,'' she said evenly. ''That's just the way it was, if we were women with careers. Our consciousnesses weren't raised. We didn't view it as having it all. We just put up with a lot of stress and strain.'' Judge Dembitz and her husband live on East End Avenue and have a summer house in Lido Beach, L.I. She said she has always been too much of a workaholic to have hobbies, ''but I keep hearing a person is supposed to have hobbies, so I plan to look for some.''

600-> ISRAELI INQUIRY ON MASSACRE CLEARS HADDAD FORCES
The state commission investigating the Beirut massacre announced today that it had no evidence of any involvement by the Lebanese Christian militia commanded by Maj. Saad Haddad. The slaughter of hundreds of men, women and children in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps on the outskirts of Beirut last September was apparently the work of Christian forces of the Phalangist Party. Major Haddad, who has been a close ally of Israel for several years, has repeatedly denied allegations by Palestinian residents of the camps that his troops joined with Phalangists in the massacre. The commission's statement came in response to a request by the major that he be permitted to examine documents and question witnesses in view of the possibility that he might be harmed by the panel's findings. The commission has already advised nine of Israel's top Government and military officials, including Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, that they could be harmed by the final report. No Cause for Concern But Major Haddad had no such cause for concern, the panel announced, since ''according to the material in our hands, and the evidence brought before the commission,'' his forces were not included in the contingent that entered the camps. Therefore, the commission said, he would not be afforded the opportunity to examine witnesses and documents. Major Haddad deserted from the Lebanese Army during the 1975-76 civil war to set up his own militia in a narrow strip of territory bordering Israel. He called the buffer zone ''Free Lebanon,'' depended entirely on Israeli weapons and gave the Israeli Army free access to the area to use as a staging ground for attacks against the Palestine Liberation Organization. Mr. Begin is said to feel strongly that the major's militia should be strengthened and his area of control expanded as part of any security agreement providing for the withdrawal of Israeli troops. Since the Israeli invasion June 6, Major Haddad has extended his area of influence northward to Sidon. Testimony About Haddad Forces The commission has heard several references to Major Haddad's forces during testimony in public hearings. Defense Minister Sharon said he received a report Friday night, Sept. 17, ''that soldiers from one of our paratroop brigades had encountered Haddad men who had perpetrated killings or had harmed the population; they opened fire on them, killed one of them and captured two of them.'' In addition, a British physician, Paul Morris, of the Gaza Hospital in Beirut, testified that on Sept. 18 he heard an Israeli officer who was wearing the insignia of a brigadier general say that Haddad forces were in the area. ''He mentioned the Haddad men,'' Dr. Morris told the commission. ''And later on another soldier said that they were also Haddad men. But on the previous day, on the Friday, the people coming into the hospital were only mentioning the Kataeb. They did not mention the Haddad men at all. I never heard the name Haddad mentioned until we got into the Israeli compound.'' Kataeb referred to the Phalangist forces. Despite the three Haddad men who were intercepted by Israeli paratroopers, Mr. Sharon said, the Haddad forces as such were not involved. ''From time to time one of Haddad's men or another was found in the streets of Beirut,'' the Defense Minister said. But their relations with the Phalangists were tense. ''To the best of my knowledge,'' he said in his testimony, ''Haddad's men did not participate.'' Major Haddad also denied the involvement of his forces when he testified Nov. 17. In response to questions about Palestinian refugees' assertions that his militia participated, he noted that since both the Phalangists and his forces receive their uniforms from the Israelis, it is easy to mix them up. He denied that the three men caught by Israeli troops were members of his militia. He said they were part of a civil guard organized by the Israeli Army in the south and were on ''a private visit'' to Beirut to see relatives.

601-> REAGAN DECIDES TO SEND HABIB BACK TO MIDEAST
President Reagan, concerned about the slow pace of negotiations to withdraw all foreign forces from Lebanon, announced today that Philip C. Habib would assume control of Middle East peace discussions. Mr. Reagan told reporters after meeting with Mr. Habib in the Oval Office that the envoy would seek ''overall peace in the Middle East'' and coordinate United States efforts to obtain a pullback of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces from Lebanon. At a televised news conference tonight, Mr. Reagan said that new Israeli settlements on the West Bank and Gaza were a ''hindrance to what we're trying to accomplish'' in the Middle East. But the President added, in response to a question, that he was against cutting back aid to Israel. ''I don't think it would be useful,'' he said. At another point, Mr. Reagan said, ''I don't think it would be good diplomacy to be threatening.'' U.S. Plan 'Is Working' The President declined to give a date for withdrawal of the United States Marine force in Beirut. ''I can't speculate,'' he said. ''We think our plan is working. The important thing it is there in helping to bring about peace.'' He said that efforts to withdraw American marines from Beirut was ''one of the reasons Phil Habib is going back there.'' Mr. Habib, who dealt with the Lebanon crisis in recent months, will now be in charge of overall Arab-Israeli negotiations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In effect, the 62-year-old diplomat will serve as Mr. Reagan's chief Middle East negotiator, much as Sol M. Linowitz and Robert Strauss did for President Carter. Mr. Habib said he would remain in Washington for talks Mr. Reagan plans to hold with Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel next week and then leave for the Middle East to spur efforts on the withdrawal of foreign forces from Lebanon. On a broader scale, Mr. Habib will also press Mr. Reagan's proposal for peace in the Middle East, which appears to have bogged down in recent weeks. Plan Rejected by Begin The plan, announced Sept. 1, called on Israel to grant selfgovernment to the Palestinians on the West Bank and Gaza in association with Jordan, in return for Arab acceptance of Israel. Mr. Begin has rejected the plan, which also called for a freeze on new Israeli settlements on the West Bank. Some Arab leaders have expressed qualified support for the plan, but there has been no further indication of a willingness to recognize and negotiate with Israel, as is called for by the Administration strategy. Mr. Habib, speaking to reporters, said his goal was the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon by the end of the year. He said he would pursue the withdrawal as well as Middle East peace simultaneously. ''Don't think we can't succeed,'' he said. Mr. Habib denied Mr. Reagan's peace plan was in trouble, but acknowledged that ''there are problems,'' especially with Israel's plans for additional settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza. The settlements were announced last week by the Israeli Government. Settlements Called Detrimental Mr. Habib said that the new settlements were ''detrimental to the peace process.'' He said there was ''momentum'' for Mr. Reagan's peace plan and ''the President is absolutely dedicated to the maintenance of the momentum.'' In his new role Mr. Habib will be assisted by Morris Draper, the United States negotiator in Lebanon, and Richard Fairbanks, the United States representative at the suspended Palestinian autonomy talks between Egypt and Israel. ''We hope to get Lebanon stabilization as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Habib said, adding that this could be accomplished ''if we get all external forces out.'' There are now an estimated 8,000 armed Palestinians, 30,000 Syrians and 40,000 to 50,000 Israelis still in Lebanon. Mr. Reagan, in disclosing the appointment of Mr. Habib, brushed aside questions about whether his peace initiative was stalled. ''Let's just say it's always worked better when he's there,'' Mr. Reagan said.

603-> Take the Fiscal Crises in Order
It was clear in January, when Mayor Koch presented his budget plan for New York City's current fiscal year, that a budget storm was brewing. Now the economic downturn has begun to erode revenues. And the otherwise welcome decline in inflation means even less in tax collections. The first gusts are whistling through the trees. But so far public debate seems oddly focused on the future, when the immediate problem is the present. The Mayor and municipal union leaders are fencing over the prospect of layoffs and renegotiation of contracts agreed to only a few weeks ago. Yet these questions do not much bear on the current deficit; they are far more important for the larger deficit predicted for fiscal 1984. New York City's tax revenues are dropping painfully. In the first four months of this fiscal year, general corporation taxes collected dropped 3 percent below last year. They had been expected to increase - and the decline is accelerating. State Comptroller Regan now predicts that revenues for all of the fiscal year will fall more than $200 million below estimates. That's $70 million more depressing than his estimate at the end of September; it raises to $400 million the budget gap to be closed before next July. The Mayor's most urgent task is to make up that $400 million. The new two-year contracts impose heavy payroll increases on the city, but with the current fiscal year already one-third gone, a renegotiation of its wage increases would help only if the city and the unions are able to arrive at an agreement quickly. While that unlikely possibility should not be foreclosed, the city is probably better off concentrating on a schedule of temporary taxes and service cuts to close this year's budget gap while renegotiating the contracts' second year. The deficit for that year is estimated at $1.1 billion. Renegotiation won't be easy. The unions will surely point out that when inflation was increasing city revenues, they were not getting commensurate wage increases. Why should they accept commensurate limitations now? One answer lies in the nature of this fiscal crisis. Unlike the last one, in the mid-70's, this time the city must find its own way out. Neither Washington nor Albany, whose bond rating has just been sharply reduced, can do much more than commiserate. New York City's deficit will have to be closed by New Yorkers; even with revised labor contracts, tax increases will be needed. There's another way in which this fiscal crisis is different: it cannot be blamed on reckless borrowing or mismanagement. The villain is national and global economic conditions. If not necessarily less painful, that knowledge may make the shared sacrifice easier to bear.

Sixty people were arrested or given summonses yesterday in a police sweep of a six-block area in Brooklyn. Charges ranged from the sale of narcotics to drinking in public. The police said the area - Fulton Street in the Fort Greene and Bedford-Stuyvesant sections - was picked for a sweep because of community complaints about crime.

605-> SCOUTING; Millrose Games Sold Out Already
Indoor track and field meets may be disappearing at an alarming rate, but the Wanamaker Millrose Games continues to grow in popularity. Yesterday, Howard Schmertz, the Millrose director, reported that all tickets -more than 17,000 - for the Jan. 28 meet at Madison Square Garden had been sold. It was the earliest sellout in Millrose history. ''We've never sold out before the middle of January,'' said Schmertz. Competitors will be happy to learn that the Garden has rebuilt the entire inside third of its 11-laps-to-the-mile board track with new, higher grade plywood. Schmertz estimated the cost of the resurfacing and renovation at $20,000. A five-eighth-inch layer of plywood has also been put down on the pole-vault runway, which should add further speed for vaulters chasing the 19-foot barrier. ''The track was in a sorry state,'' Schmertz said. ''But these improvements should really give us one of the best tracks we've ever had.''

607-> STAGE: ANTIWAR MUSICAL
THERE is nothing subtle about ''The Boogie-Woogie Rumble of a Dream Deferred,'' Vinnette Carroll's antiwar musical at the Urban Arts Theater. But the show has so much heart, vitality and tunefulness that it could almost be forgiven for its many inadequacies. Complete with choreographed battle scenes and a United Service Organizations canteen sequence of soldiers wildly jitterbugging with their girls, the show at times threatens literally to burst the seams of the tiny theater. ''The Boogie-Woogie Rumble'' was adapted by Miss Carroll from Irwin Shaw's one-act play ''Bury the Dead,'' with the setting updated from World War I to the present. But even with its references to Nikon cameras, nuclear arms and pot smoking, the image of war that dominates is a pastiche of old army movies and musicals, from ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' and ''This Is the Army'' to ''The Deer Hunter.'' The show follows the fortunes of an Army platoon that comprises a classic cross-section of American types as they do intermittent battle with an unnamed enemy force on an unspecified front. The gimmick of the plot is that one day a bunch of slain soldiers rises from their graves and refuse to be buried. With faces and bodies draped in shrouds, they lurk about the battlefield, terrifying their surviving comrades and embarrassing the military brass. A woman war correspondent who drifts in and out of the action discovers the existence of these living dead and broadcasts it as ''the story of the year, the story of all time.'' Clergymen are summoned to try to coax the corpses back into the earth. When they fail, the women who were closest to the dead soldiers are called in, also to no avail. Ultimately the cavorting corpses come to represent an antiwar conscience that will not be stamped out. Even with its plot, the show is less a story musical than a revue made up of digressive set-pieces from assorted symbolic figures - foot soldiers, a general, a prostitute, a priest, a rabbi and a widow. The glue that holds the show together is Micki Grant's passionately melodic score, sung by a cast that is much stronger musically than it is dramatically; in fact, most of the acting is as crude as the dramaturgy. Miss Grant, who has proved herself a fine composer of gospel and blues-based show tunes in musicals like ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' has extended her range to embrace a Richard Rodgers-style melodiousness in several numbers. The show's most chilling song, ''I Ain't Had My Fill,'' is a cantorially flavored lament that recalls ''Soliloquy'' from ''Carousel.'' Grander and more sentimental, the waltz ''When Every Man Is Everyman'' is an inspirational polemic that hits home through the sheer sweep of its melody. These schmaltzier numbers offer a good contrast to Miss Grant's blues-and soul-inflected songs. The best of these include an amusing Bessie Smith-style blues song, ''Love Is Like a Water Faucet,'' a rap number that uses ''Sound Off'' as its springboard and a rousing pop spiritual, ''That's What the Bible Say,'' which opens the show. With only a few exceptions, the singers are strong, with the tenor Charles Abruzzo as a rabbi, and the baritone Harry L. Burney 3d as a priest outstanding. And the lusty ensemble singing by a cast of 26 rocks the theater to its rafters. There is also much that could be improved. The battle scenes are clumsily staged. The character of the war correspondent barely exists, and the archetypal prostitute must recite a worn-out compendium of bad double entendres. And there is a clumsy graveside exchange between a slain soldier's buddy and his girlfriend that drags the show to a halt. Talley Beatty's choreography is also too insistently busy for such a limited space. But even in a larger hall, all the writhing and leapfrogging would seem unimaginative. Still, for all its myriad crudenesses, ''The Boogie-Woogie Rumble'' still charms. Vinnette Carroll and Micki Grant and the exuberant cast have mounted a secular gospel polemic for peace that lays its heart and its soul right on the line. Rebellion of the Dead THE BOOGIE-WOOGIE RUMBLE OF A DREAM DEFERRED, a musical adapted from Irwin Shaw's play ''Bury the Dead''; conceived, adapted and directed by Vinnette Carroll; music and lyrics by Micki Grant; choreography by Talley Beatty and Ralf Paul Haze; costumes by Hope Hanafin; lighting by Richard Winkler; sound by Garland Thompson Jr.; George Broderick, music director-supervisor; Charles A. Johnson 3d, conductor; Jerry Campbell, assistant to Miss Carroll. Presented by the Urban Arts Theater, Miss Carroll, artistic director, and Anita MacShane, managing director.

608-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; PSA's Head Facing More Responsibility
If all goes well, Paul C. Barkley, president and chief operating officer of PSA Inc., may soon be presiding over an airline double the size of its current 30-plane fleet and flying over a much larger geographic area. PSA, also known as Pacific Southwest Airlines, and Braniff International, which shut down last spring and filed for protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, have announced a joint venture in which PSA would operate 25 to 30 of Braniff's grounded planes, hire a portion of its employees and take over its facilities at various airports. ''Mr. Putnam called here a few weeks ago and asked if we'd be interested,'' Mr. Barkley said yesterday, referring to Howard Putnam, Braniff's chairman and chief executive. ''This is an opportunity for PSA to almost double its product, so to speak, without a major capital commitment.'' PSA, which is 32 years old and based in San Diego, currently operates in California and to Reno, Las Vegas, Seattle, Phoenix and Tucson. Mr. Barkley said the Braniff proposal would represent a major eastward thrust for the airline. Mr. Barkley cautioned, however, that there were many hurdles to cross before the deal becomes reality, citing the regulatory authorities and bankruptcy court. He estimated that if there were no snags it might be done in 60 to 90 days ''but will probably take longer.'' The airlines would share start-up costs. Mr. Barkley, 53 years old, grew up in Minneapolis and started college at the University of Minnesota. He joined the Air Force as an enlisted man during the Korean War and when he returned completed his schooling at San Diego State University. From there he joined Arthur Young & Company, the accountants. PSA was a client and Mr. Barkley worked on its financial and tax affairs. The airline hired him as vice president for finance in 1967 when it entered the jet age and found itself doing big financing to buy planes. Mr. Barkley later became chief financial officer and then chief operating officer and executive vice president. He was made president in 1979. The airline is now the 14th largest in the nation in terms of passengers carried.

609-> SPORTS PEOPLE; A Farewell to Golf
Barney Thompson, who has been on the Professional Golfers' Association tour for nine years, has decided it is time to quit. ''It just got to the point where, when you do something for so long and aren't successful at it, you get tired of it,'' he said from his home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. ''This is my ninth year and I'm not doing well, so I just decided it wasn't any fun anymore. that it was time to move on. So, I'm gonna give it up.'' Thompson, who won the West Virginia amateur championship three times, earned only $7,000 this year, after earning $65,000 in 1981. Since he failed to finish among the top 125 money winners on the tour, Thompson lost his pro card, meaning he would have to play in qualifying tournaments to regain his card.

''We will adapt the tennis game to suit the needs of each individual at the clinic,'' said Mayer, who will play for the United States in the Davis Cup final against France Nov. 26 through 28 in Grenoble, France. ''For example, we'll change the number of bounces, lower the net and shorten the courts.''

613-> SCIENTISTS STUDY AIR IN L.I. SCHOOL CLOSED BY FUMES
Scientists from a specially assembled Federal team sampled the air today inside a Long Island high school that was closed Wednesday after the effects of a mysterious odor sent dozens of students and teachers to the hospital. The scientists, from the Environmental Protection Agency, wore thick protective suits and face masks as they carried sensitive hand-held instruments into the building, Hauppauge High School. Other members of the team huddled over battery-operated analyzers set up on hoods of cars in the school parking lot. But after a daylong series of tests at the school, they said they had no immediate indication of what the odor was, what had caused it or why students and teachers had suddenly been stricken with coughing, nausea and dizziness. School officials said they would close the school again Friday. ''We just can't take a chance,'' said Dr. Jerome Malkan, the superintendent. Four Remain a Second Night Four of those who were hospitalized Wednesday remained at Smithtown General Hospital today, where they were listed in fair and stable condition. Ronnie Benintendi, a hospital spokesman, said that doctors had decided to hold the four - a 17-year-old student, two teachers and an assistant principal - for a second night because they still felt sick. Wednesday's incident resulted in an intensive investigation by local school and health officials, who called in their state counterparts and also hired outside experts. ''It never hurts to get a second opinion,'' Dr. Malkan said today. The results of those tests were not available today. In turn, the State Health Commissioner, Dr. David Axelrod, asked the Federal agency to do the testing. ''We do not have all the portable equipment that they have,'' said Frances Tarlton, a Health Department spokesman. ''This is a fairly remote site and they could be dispatched more quickly.'' Task is Made Difficult The Federal team spent its time today walking through classrooms, opening closets, nosing around corners, studying windows and doors. School officials ordered the building aired out after it was evacuated yesterday, and officials said that probably made the team's work more difficult since it gave the fumes a chance to dissipate. The school is less than a mile from the Whiporwil Elementary School, which was closed two years ago after traces of the hazardous chemical vinyl chloride were found in heating ducts. The substance was thought to have seeped over from a landfill adjacent to Whiporwil, but school officials said they doubted that there was any connection between the landfill and the fumes at the high school. The day got off to a slow start for the Federal testing team. Fred Rubel, its 34-year-old chief, had ordered the eight-person group to gather at 5:45 A.M. at the E.P.A.'s offices in Edison, N.J. But on the way to Long Island, the caravan got tied up in rush-hour traffic and arrived later than he had planned. In the high school parking lot, the scientists and technicians pulled their equipment from suitcases in their cars. One tool used in the testing was a $5,000 photoionization detection device, which shows the level of potentially dangerous substances. Throughout the day Mr. Rubel wore a uniform that resembled a bright blue jump suit. When he gave the word to enter the building, the team members pulled on rubberized green suits, known in E.P.A. parlance as ''Level A.'' They seal out the outside environment and minimize the chances of exposure to hazardous substances. ''They're difficult and hot,'' said David Lipsky, another member of the team. ''You have full gloves and full boots and it's difficult to work the equipment.'' The team wore the green suits on its first two trips into the building because it did not know what it might find. When dealing with unknowns, Mr. Rubel said, he believes in taking every precaution. But for the third foray, the team switched to ''modified level B'' suits, which are white and resemble astronauts' flight suits. They provide less protection than the green suits, but by then the team members did not believe that conditions warranted the heavier suits. ''There are just not a lot of possibilities we feel we can come up with data on,'' Mr. Rubel said. ''Chances are it was a passing event. Something occurred, and as time goes on it becomes more remote that we'll be able to detect specifically what caused the problem.''

The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote Tuesday on whether to finance the MX intercontinental missile and the so-called dense-pack basing system that President Reagan has proposed for protecting the missiles. But in view of the long history of past wrangles over critical issues involving missiles, advocates and critics say they do not expect the fate of the MX - the name stands for missile experimental - to be quickly resolved. Some think the debate will probably be carried over into the next Congress. In 1969 Congress, by the narrowest of margins, let the Nixon Administration continue with an antiballistic missile system for defending Minutemen land-based missiles. Scarcely three years later, President Nixon agreed with Moscow to virtually eliminate ABM's. MX Debate Started in 1974 In 1974 Congress first began debating the MX missile as a new and more powerful successor to the Minuteman. In some of the subsequent years Administrations pressed Congress for action, in others not, and for the most part Congress did not want to make final decisions. The MX inched along in research and development. In 1977 Congress started to consider methods for the protective basing of MX missiles, but there was always something wrong with each plan. More than two dozen plans later, the Reagan Administration says it has settled on a plan of packing 100 MX missiles into a small area, an arrangement that proponents say will lead incoming Soviet warheads to blow each other up prematurely. Behind all the plans and votes lies 15 years of tough political debate. Practically nothing in that debate has been resolved since a Moscow parade in November 1967 commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. It was then that the Soviet Union unveiled its new SS-9 missile with its enormous nuclear warhead. Not long thereafter, first the United States and then the Soviet Union began testing missiles with highly accurate multiple warheads. Wider Interest in Issue The combination of increasing numbers of warheads with greater accuracy and destructive power transformed the public debate on nuclear deterrence. The arcane nightmares of strategic planners suddenly spilled into the newspapers and Congressional chambers. Were American land-based missiles vulnerable to a Soviet first strike by the giant Soviet missiles? Did the United States have to acquire a comparable missile to pose a comparable threat to Soviet forces? Was it now necessary to develop the ability to fight nuclear wars, much as an artillery duel, in order to deter nuclear war? The vulnerability issue was quickly put to the test by the Senate in August 1969. By a tie vote, the Senate allowed the Nixon Administration to continue developing an antiballistic missile system designed to defend the Minutemen missiles. ABM's as Bargaining Chips The hope of many was that the ABM system could be used as a bargaining chip in the strategic arms limitation talks with the Soviet Union, maybe somehow to limit the SS-9's. But Moscow would have none of this, especially since Washington would not entertain doing anything to limit its advantages in strategic bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. And the ABM Treaty of 1972 restricted deployment of defensive systems to the point where they would be of little or no value in defending hardened targets like missile silos. Worse still for those who worried about such matters, in the companion agreement limiting offensive missiles the Nixon Administration agreed to allow the Soviet Union to keep about 300 ''heavy missiles'' of the SS-9 size and to forgo even the right to build a missile of comparable size. The SS-9 was soon transformed into the SS-18 with multiple warheads. Also, Mr. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger, his principal national security assistant, failed to gain Soviet agreement on how heavy a light missile might be. It was a loophole through which Moscow was to drive the new SS-19 missile, another missile with silo-busting power. Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Nixon pledged to resolve these matters in the next arms limitations talks. Birth of the MX in 1974 Meanwhile, in 1974, Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger came up with the MX missile program. He was not interested in pursuing plans to defend land-based missiles, plans that then seemed too expensive and farfetched. But he believed it was vital for the United States to have missiles with silo-busting power comparable to the SS-18. His answer was, in effect, the MX. It was to be a missile the size of the SS-19, but with 10 powerful nuclear warheads, as many as the SS-18. Without this, Mr. Schlesinger maintained, others would ''perceive'' the United States to be inferior, and Moscow might seek to take diplomatic advantages in a crisis. Without the missile, he argued, Moscow would have more options to fight nuclear wars than Washington. The Soviet Union could strike American land-based missiles without expecting an equal American response. He concluded that this created a gap in American deterrence and that Washington needed to develop its own ''limited nuclear options.'' With this argument, Mr. Schlesinger carried forward a position first officially presented by Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara in 1962. Mr. McNamara wrote in his fiscal year 1963 Posture Statement that the United States should develop a force that could ''strike back, first, at the Soviet bomber bases, missiles sites and other military installations associated with their long-range nuclear forces to reduce the power of any follow-on attack - and then, if necessary, strike back at the Soviet urban and industrial complex in a controlled and deliberate way.'' ''Such a force,'' Mr. McNamara wrote, ''would give us the needed flexibility to meet a wide range of possible general war situations.'' Carter Approved Doctrine This nuclear war-fighting doctrine was to reach its zenith in 1980, when President Carter approved PD-59. This was a Presidential decision memorandum that would reportedly put the United States in a position to make nuclear exchanges over many weeks. The ability to do this, according to thinking in the Carter Administrtion, rested heavily on going forward with a system of protecting the MX missiles by shuttling 200 of them between 4,600 shelters. Ronald Reagan, as a candidate and as President, found this system too cumbersome, too expensive and unacceptable politically to those states that would have to find the land to deploy the new system. In the House debate Tuesday, all the old questions that underpinned previous debates can be expected to reappear. Is the MX needed to give Washington a missile of comparable destructive power to Moscow's missiles? Or will it be sufficient to upgrade the existing Minutemen and go forward with the planned deployment of the Trident II, a submarine-launched ballistic missile? New Bargaining Chip Needed? Is the missile needed as a bargaining chip in the strategic arms reductions talks with Moscow? Like the Nixon Administration, the Carter Administration failed in the second arms limitation talks to reduce or eliminate Moscow's heavy missiles. Thus far, the Reagan Administration shows no signs of being prepared to forgo new American strategic forces to gain reductions in Soviet heavy missiles. Like past bargaining chips, critics fear that the MX will end up being deployed. And how would killing the MX missile affect Western European willingness to accept deployment of new American medium-range missiles in Europe? Are land-based missiles truly vulnerable? Few dispute Moscow's theoretical ability to launch its force of 300 SS-18 missiles and destroy almost all 1,000 American land-based Minutemen missiles. But in the real world, are Soviet leaders likely to assume that such an attack could work perfectly when almost anything short of perfection would leave so many American missiles surviving as to make the attack worthless? Would they assume that an American President, who would know in minutes that a Soviet attack was under way, would leave the missiles in the ground to be destroyed, or would a President launch them before destruction? Would Soviet leaders believe that after such an attack, with 5 million to 20 million instant American fatalities, a President would simply surrender rather than retaliate against Soviet cities? The expectation among many members of the Administration and Congress is that until there is a good measure of agreement on the answers to those questions, they will not have seen the end of the MX debate.

618-> SEAVER RETURNING IN LATE INNINGS
year-old daughter, Annie, were browsing along the shops on Brompton Road and happened into a shoe store. A particular pair of brown shoes caught his pitcher's eye in the way he might notice a batter's weakness. He felt a little ripple of pleasurable expectation. As he held up the footwear for closer inspection, a voice behind him said, ''You won't be able to put spikes on the bottom of them.'' Seaver turned. The man was a stranger, but obviously an American. ''Yes,'' said Seaver, ''but I'd be the best-dressed player on the field.'' Seaver was relaxing in his home, a gentleman farmer's barn that he has converted into an elegant wood-beamed house in this woodsy, affluent area. He laughed as he recalled the incident, and the fact that he was recognized in such an unlikely place. ''But in New York,'' he said, ''it's fairly common for people to talk to me on the street. It doesn't seem that they've forgotten. Just the other day, I was in a restaurant in Manhattan and a guy comes over and says, 'When are you coming back? You know we've only put you on loan.' '' It seems the fan was right. Tom Seaver, who had been traded in 1977 from the Mets to the Reds, will be coming back to Shea Stadium. The Reds and Mets reached an agreement last Friday on a trade that requires the pitcher's approval and his passing a physical examination. After weeks of negotiation, the Mets will send the Reds at least two young players, probably minor-league pitchers. As a 10-year veteran with more than five years service with his last team, Seaver can veto any trade. But he seemed optimistic about returning to the Mets. ''I certainly hope we can reach an agreement on a new contract and I can finish my career with the Mets,'' he said. Seaver is earning $450,000 a year with the Reds. He indicated he would expect a new and longer contract with added money from the Mets. For nine and a half years, starting in 1967, Tom Seaver was the best pitcher the Mets had - arguably the best in baseball - and one of the town's most popular personalities as they rose from comedians to champions - winning the World Series in 1969 and winning the National League pennant but losing the Series to Oakland in 1973. Then in 1977, after a dispute with the Mets' president M. Donald Grant over his contract and the direction of the team - which had fallen on troubled times, Seaver pushed for a trade. Grant accommodated, and traded Seaver. But the fans remembered Seaver's professionalism, his small-boy's enthusiasm for the game and the way he pitched: broad-shouldered, cherubic-round face, a no-nonsense practitioner, getting the sign from the catcher, a smudge of dirt on the right knee of his white knickered uniform from dragging his leg in his low pitching delivery; then mustering great power in a compact area, and firing a hard overhand fastball. The first time he returned to Shea Stadium in a Reds' uniform, the fans rose and greeted him with a long and affectionate ovation. ''And every time I've pitched in Shea after that,'' said Seaver, ''the fans have always made me feel welcome. ''The Reds last season were 25 games out of first place, and I'm 700 miles from my family,'' said Seaver. ''It was hard to justify in my mind.'' The Reds wound up with 61 victories, one more than the Minnesota Twins. It was like a pennant race in reverse. ''By the end of the season,'' he said, ''all of us on the bench had our eye on the scoreboard to check the Twins.'' Seaver says he has no regrets about playing for the Reds. ''They were always in the race until last season,'' he said. ''They've treated me well. In fact, just the other day, Dick Wagner called to tell me who he has been talking to in regard to a possible trade for me.'' Wagner is the president of the Reds. ''I don't know any of the Mets very well, except for George Foster,'' said Seaver. Foster and Seaver were teammates on the Reds. ''And I know George well enough to believe he will start hitting again. He's too good not to.'' All of Seaver's friends and teammates with the old Mets are gone: Jerry Koosman and Bud Harrelson and Jerry Grote, among others. ''But from what I can tell,'' said Seaver, ''the Mets have some good young players.'' Seaver is now 38 years old, somewhat difficult to imagine when one remembers him as the centerpiece of the ''Miracle Mets.'' And he retains a boyish quality, with dark blond hair (except for a few strands of gray at the temple) and a hearty, youthful laugh. But in fact, he is somewhat long in the tooth for a baseball player, and having experienced the dreariest season in the 16 he has spent in the major leagues, there remains the question of whether he can still pitch winning baseball. ''Sure, you always have doubts when you're getting near the end of your career,'' he said. ''Well, you have doubts all along the way, certainly. Even when you're young. Lose a few in a row, maybe your arm gets tired or sore, and you begin to ask yourself, can I come back? Can I regain my form?'' Those questions gripped him last season when he was pitching his way to a record of five victories and 13 losses, with an earned run average of 5.50. He did not complete a game all season and he did not pitch in a game during the last six weeks. Winner of three Cy Young Awards - emblematic of the best pitcher in the league - Seaver is fifth among active pitchers with 264 victories. He has lost 156. He is sixth on the career strikeout list, 3,137, having passed such luminaries as Bob Feller and Rube Waddell. He has 54 shutouts, 10th highest in baseball. In the strike-shortened 1981 season, Seaver had one of his finest years, winning 14 and losing just two, coming in second in the Cy Young voting. Sports Illustrated magazine featured him on its cover, with the caption: ''Still Terrific After All These Years.'' But last season, the carefully constructed pitching apparatus that is a part of Tom Seaver seemed to come apart. ''One day in August,'' Seaver recalled, ''Pete Rose said to me, 'Tom, what's wrong? I was looking at your numbers, and that's not you.' ''I said, 'I know, Pete. I've got some problems.' '' His troubles began in spring training when he suffered a pulled thigh muscle. Then, when he was just getting over that, he came down with a severe case of the flu. He was eager to return to the mound, and did so in late April. But he didn't have much stamina. He tried, as he said, to rush it, then strained his back. In between, he had been hit on the left big toe with a line drive while pitching batting practice. He limped for four days. ''In the back of your mind, you're always worried about coming back too fast after an injury or illness, the way Dizzy Dean did, and it ruined his career,'' said Seaver. ''But you still want to pitch, and pitch well. The team is trying to get someplace, and you know they're counting on you.'' And a sense of ego is involved. ''One sets a standard of excellence for himself,'' he said, ''and then when you don't live up to it after you've had it for a number of years - well, boom, the bottom drops out.'' Pitching is a delicate undertaking, as Seaver perceives it, perhaps an art form of a kind; but he was just no longer able to put the subtle touch of shadings into his performance. ''What a pitcher tries to do,'' he said, ''is work on a batter step by step. Say I'm facing Jack Clark, who's a dangerous hitter.'' Clark, a right-handed hitter, plays for the San Francisco Giants. ''I'm thinking even before he steps to the plate what I want to do. Of course, it depends on the situation - how many outs, how many runners on, what I did against him the last time, and so on. This is the fascinating part of pitching; this is what I love about it. You're challenged and making an important decision every 20 minutes. ''O.K., so maybe I want to get the first pitch, a fastball, inside on Clark for a strike. The next pitch will be a slider away, off the plate. Maybe he'd swing and hit it off the end of the bat. If not, the count is 1-and-1. The third pitch would be a fastball inside for a strike, and then I might hope to strike him out on a changeup. ''That's how I pitched most of my career. But last season, I'd try to throw a fastball on the inside corner and it had no movement. It would just float up to the plate - and wind up a line-drive double off the wall. ''That's tough,'' he said. ''That's no fun.'' By the middle of August, he had decided that he'd have to go back to ''ground zero.'' ''My mechanics were all fouled up,'' said Seaver. ''My upper body didn't seem to be coordinated with my lower body. It was all out of rhythm. You wonder. I had been doing this for nearly 20 years, and what happens? How could I be so out of sync? ''Well one of the great things Billie Jean King said was, 'If it was so easy, everybody would be doing it.' And just because you had been doing it well doesn't mean it has become easy. ''You spend your whole career trying not to fall into bad habits, trying to be so disciplined that your good habits get cemented into your subconscious. Then one thing happens, then another, and you start pushing when you shouldn't be, and one day you wake up and realize you're a mess.'' Seaver and Bill Fischer, the Reds' pitching coach, watched numerous game films of Seaver when he was throwing well, and made comparisons. Then Fischer observed Seaver pitching on the sidelines and in the bullpen. Picture now a schematic drawing of the human anatomy. That's how they analyzed Seaver's pitching motion: ''We broke my body in half horizontally at the waist,'' Seaver said. ''Then we cut it in half vertically, so it was sectioned off into quarters. We analyzed each section separately. ''We came to the conclusion that I was pushing too fast. I had to slow up. First, I slowed up my arms, but that didn't work. Then we realized that it was just my left leg, the one I lift in my delivery, that had to be slowed up. And that did it. It took about a month to correctly get my pitching motion and delivery all together again. And I was back to where I could feel the ball coming off my fingertips again -whipping it - instead of feeling like I was a shot-putter. ''When you get that feeling back, you wonder how you could ever have lost it.'' Although ready to pitch with about 10 days left in the season, he decided that he was making such progress on the sidelines, and the team was so far behind in the standings, that it would be best from a mental standpoint not to throw in any more games in 1982. ''There's no pain in my arm now,'' he said. ''I guess some people were writing me off, but they did that eight years ago, when I had problems with my hip and left buttock.'' He finished that season with an 11-11 record, and was booed for the first time at Shea Stadium. ''But the next season,'' he said with a smile, ''I was fine.'' He won 22 games in 1975, to lead the league. In 1980 he developed tendinitis in his right, pitching shoulder, dropped to a 10-8 record, then came back the following season with the outstanding 14-2 mark. ''If I stay healthy,'' said Seaver, ''I think I can pitch effectively for about three more seasons.'' Seaver grips the red seams of the white baseball with thick fingers. Casually, smoothly, economically, he throws the ball into a netting and it falls onto a mat with several other balls he had thrown. Seaver is in the basement of his home. He has set up the net about 20 feet from the cracked plastic bucket filled with baseballs. He throws here for about 15 minutes every day of the winter. Nearby are exercise machines: one for his upper body, one for his lower body and an exercycle. He jogs 20 minutes every day. He also fells trees and chops wood on his seven-acre property - sometimes turning to see a deer who has stopped to observe his activity. He also recently made a flower bed and a walk and built a wine cellar. On a window sill, there were two baseball gloves. ''One is Nancy's,'' he explained. ''We played catch the other day. I love her, but she can't throw the ball across the street.'' What will he do when his pitching career is over? He thought about this now as he walked up his driveway, pointing out the dogwoods he had planted. ''Well, I might like to try broadcasting,'' he said. ''I've done a number of World Series on network television, and I think I have more experience than most so-called jocks. ''Or I might like to run a ball club, either from the front office or as a manager. I think that would be challenging, definitely challenging.'' But there are still questions to be answered about his pitching. It is one thing to throw well in batting practice or on the sidelines, another to effectively set up Jack Clark to strike him out. ''I remember when I first came up,'' said Seaver. ''In one of my first games, I was in St. Louis and I got these terrible stomach cramps in the first inning. I just couldn't pitch, had to be taken out. ''In the clubhouse a doctor checked me over and touched a spot, and I yelled with pain. He said, 'It's just a case of nerves. You'll be O.K. tomorrow.' ''I was, and not long after I was pitching in Atlanta and was facing Henry Aaron, who was my idol. ''The first time I faced him, I got him on a sinker inside, and he bounced it to the shortstop for a double play. I thought, 'Gee, the big leagues aren't so tough.' ''The next time up, Henry puts my sinker into the blue seats in Atlanta Stadium. It was home run Number 412 or something for him. ''That's when I revised my thinking about pitching in the big leagues. I decided it wasn't so easy after all.''

619-> FAILURE TO REACH ACCORD IN LEBANON WORRIES U.S. AIDES
Senior Reagan Administration officials said today that they were becoming increasingly concerned over the United States failure to initiate negotiations for the withdrawal of Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian forces from Lebanon. Because of the impasse, the officials said, it is virtually impossible that the troops would leave by the end of the year, the target date set by the State Department. The officials also said the presence of United States marines in Lebanon as part of an American-French-Italian peacekeeping force would probably be extended well into next year. When President Reagan sent the 1,300 marines to Beirut in September, he said they were going for ''a limited period'' that some officials said would probably mean no longer than the end of this year. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, however, has refused to offer a specific date for when the marines would leave. Increase in the Force Weighed The Lebanese Government has asked the United States, France and Italy to double the size of their contingents. Discussions are also going on with other nations to contribute to such a force. The purpose of an expanded multinational force would be to take up positions as Israeli, Syrian and Palestine Liberation Organization forces left. As a result of the failure to make any significant headway on the withdrawal of the Syrians, Israelis and Palestinians, the State Department announced Saturday night that Philip C. Habib, President Reagan's personal representative to the Middle East, and the special envoy Morris Draper were being recalled to Washington for consultations. Possibility of New Crisis American relations with Israel, which have been severely strained in recent months, have worsened in recent days because of the Administration's futile efforts to persuade the Senate Appropriations Committee to reject an amendment that would significantly increase the amount of foreign aid to Israel. In Jerusalem, the Israeli Cabinet issued a statement today saying it found the Administration's position on aid ''a bit astonishing,'' The Associated Press reported. An Administration official said that a new crisis could develop in Israeli-American relations if there was no change in the situation soon. This is because the Administration is holding Is- rael primarily responsible for the lack of progress by Mr. Habib and Mr. Draper. Another official said there would have to be a policy review by the Administration on the situation in Lebanon to see if the United States should undertake any new approaches. ''We have to review the bidding,'' an official said. According to the State Department officials, Mr. Habib and Mr. Draper, over the last several weeks, have reached an informal agreement with the Lebanese that there should be three sets of negotiations. The first would be between Israel and Lebanon, the second between Lebanon and Syria and the third between Lebanon and the P.L.O. All would be on the details of the withdrawal. Efforts to begin the Israeli-Lebanon talks have failed, a senior official said, because the Israelis have been demanding ''unacceptable political concessions'' from the Lebanese. The Israelis want to exchange their agreement to withdraw their 30,000 troops for a Lebanese agreement to normalize political relations with Israel. Israel wants the Lebanese to agree to open borders, tourism, business and regular political contacts, even though it is willing to forgo immediate diplomatic relations. Fear of Antagonizing Arabs In addition, the officials said, Prime Minister Menachem Begin has insisted that the talks take place alternately in Beirut and Jerusalem, thereby giving them political standing. President Amin Gemayel has told Mr. Draper and Mr. Habib that he cannot agree to the Israeli political demands for fear of antagonizing Syria, which has 70,000 troops in Lebanon, and of losing possible reconstruction aid from Saudi Arabia, which is reportedly adamant against the Lebanese holding negotiations in Jerusalem. The Arabs have refused to recognize Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem, captured in the 1967 war, and have argued that negotiating in Jerusalem lends implicit acceptance of the annexation. Mr. Gemayel wants the talks to be held in less conspicuous surroundings. He agreed to suggestions made by Mr. Habib that they be in the suburbs of Beirut and Jerusalem, but the Israelis rejected the plan. The Israelis also want security arrangements to be worked out in southern Lebanon to insure that guerrilla attacks cannot be made from there. American officials said the Lebanese were willing to work out such arrangements. Until the Israeli-Lebanese negotiations on withdrawal are completed, officials said, it is unlikely that Lebanon will be able to start talks with the Syrians and the P.L.O. Some 8,000 P.L.O. troops are in Lebanon, most of them inside Syrian lines. Simultaneous Withdrawal Sought The United States contemplates a more or less simultaneous withdrawal of all forces, in one of two stages. One problem is that the Israelis say they will not leave before the P.L.O. does, and the Syrians and the P.L.O. say the Israelis must go first. Senior State Department officials said in October that they were setting a target date of Dec. 31 for getting the Israeli, Syrian and P.L.O. forces out of Lebanon. Late last month officials were saying they would be satisfied with an agreement by the end of the year on the terms for the withdrawal. Now officials do not see an accord as likely that soon. Kenneth W. Dam, the Deputy Secretary of State, who is in charge of the Administration's interagency group on Lebanon, said in a speech on Thursday that while the United States supported the goal of eventual political normalization between Lebanon and Israel, it did not support Israel's attempt to attach it to the withdrawal. ''Progress toward more normal relations must be approached carefully lest it undermine Lebanon's credentials in the Arab world,'' he said. ''Moreover, ill-timed or forced normalization may actually threaten Israel's security if it should lead to the breakdown of the Lebanese national consensus, thereby inviting the return of hostile forces.'' Mr. Dam said that ''insistence on a Jerusalem venue should not be made an obstacle to negotiations.'' Aid Request of $2.5 Billion The Administration, in its foreign aid request for the 1983 fiscal year, asked for $2.5 billion for Israel. Of that amount, $1.7 billion would be in military credits, but of the military credits, $500 million would not have to be repaid. In addition, some $800 million was in the form of economic grants. Last winter the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in the authorization bill approved an extra $125 million in economic aid for Israel and added $350 million in military credits to the total of $500 million that was to be forgiven. The appropriations committee approved that amount last week, but only after heavy lobbying by the State Department against it. The department argued that increasing aid to Israel would mean that other countries would get less, since there was a fixed amount available, and that it would appear to Arabs that Israel was being ''rewarded'' for its invasion of Lebanon by the extra money, to help pay for the costs of the war. The Israeli Government has in turn accused the Administration of making ''unfriendly remarks'' about Israel. ---- Position Called 'Astonishing' JERUSALEM, Dec. 5 (AP) - The Israeli Cabinet finds the Reagan Administration's opposition to increasing aid to Israel ''a bit astonishing'' and considers it an important shift in United States policy, a Cabinet spokesman said today. But the spokesman, Dan Meridor, did not say what action, if any, Prime Minister Begin and his ministers had decided to take.

623-> AID IN REBUILDING, NOT DESTABILIZING, CAMBODIA
To the Editor: As a Cambodian, I am very disturbed by Stephen Morris's Op-Ed article of Dec. 15, calling as it does for United States intervention in Cambodia just short of sending in the Marines. Arguing that the United States should aid Sihanouk and Son Sann is an attempt to further involve the U.S. and publicly justify the present U.S. policy. So far, Washington has used the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to achieve diplomatic support for Pol Pot at the U.N. Material assistance is given to the remaining Pol Pot soldiers and the reactionary groups of Sihanouk and Son Sann at the Thai border through some ''humanitarian aid organizations'' and the military regime in Bangkok in order to destabilize the Heng Samrin Government. I spent 50 days in 1981 as part of a film crew which traveled all over Cambodia. What our people want most is peace - the peace that will permit them to rebuild their villages, towns and families. The tremendous achievement in rebuilding the country today is the result of the good policies of this new Government, of international aid and, above all, of the participation of the population itself. The Khmer people need spare parts, raw materials, fertilizer, animal vaccines and medical supplies. The U.S. can help them by recognizing the Heng Samrin Government and assisting with what is needed to rebuild the country. CHAN BUN HAN New York, Dec. 20, 1982

624-> RELATIONSHIPS; HOLIDAYS FOR A CHILD OF DIVORCE
YEAR-OLD Peter wants a video game for Christmas. His father w ould like to buy him one, but his mother says absolutely not. Such d omestic disagreements emerge every year at this time, and, somehow, c ouples manage to resolve them. What complicates the holiday for thisf amily and others like it is that Peter's parents are divorced. Holiday time can be a confusing and painful period for divorced parents and children. It is no wonder that even embattled couples try to postpone their separations until after the first of the year. Despite personal differences, parents want children to have one more Christmas or one more Hanukkah before the family circle is broken. Sooner or later, however, the parents must grapple with the many questions the holidays pose: Who will be with the children? How will the other parent survive? What about presents? And two sets of grandparents? And teen-agers who resent having parents plan their holidays? In the counseling of divorced parents and their children, professionals have developed a number of approaches to these problems. Some -but not all - require a measure of cooperation between the parties. Take the video-game case. Dr. Richard A. Gardner, a child psychiatrist who cited this example, insists that such issues can be resolved even though the mother and father disagree. The key lies in understanding that divorced parents may set different rules and that children will respect those rules. One solution, the psychiatrist suggests, would be for the father to buy the game and keep it at home. The mother could then tell Peter: ''Your father and I just don't agree. Video games are O.K. once in a while, but I don't want you to get hooked. In my house you can't plug your Atari into the TV set.'' As for presents, ideally the mother and father would agree on a list of suitable ones and divide the list, which avoids duplication and, worse, competition. ''If one parent is more affluent, he or she would do well to cool it,'' Dr. Gardner advises. ''Presents should not be used as a lure or as proof of greater affection.'' Where will the child spend the holiday? This is less of an issue in Jewish families because, as a mother noted: ''Hanukkah is a divorced parent's dream. It runs for eight days.'' There is only one Christmas day, though, and separation agreements usually specify where a child will be on Dec. 25. This does not necessarily mean that the other parent will always honor the agreement or that the child will like the idea. In Port Washington, L.I., a mother is fuming. She told Dr. Liane Leighton, a school psychologist who leads discussion groups for children of divorce, that she might not allow her daughter to visit her father in Florida, as planned. ''He's behind on the support money,'' the mother said. ''Why send her down there so he can play daddy on Christmas?'' Mindful that holidays tend to heighten differences between divorced parents, Dr. Leighton advised the woman to use a lawyer, not the child, to get her support payments. She also offered some advice to fathers who do not have custody of their children: ''Sometimes the father wants the kids to celebrate with his girlfriend and her kids. It would be nice if he could spend some time alone with his own children on this day so they wouldn't feel they're sharing his love with another child.'' Legal contracts seem to fall apart when teen-agers enter the picture. Teen-agers look forward to being with peers on holidays, of course, especially when they have been away at school. While they should be expected to put in an appearance at family gatherings, the professionals say, weight should be given to their wishes, and plans should be flexible. The saddest situation is that of the absent parent, typically the father, who has either chosen or been compelled to drop out of the child's life. The suggestion from the professionals is: Call, write, send a present, communicate in some way with the child despite hostile relations with the other parent. The professionals also stressed that the presence of both sets of grandparents can be comforting at this time. Said Dr. Lee Salk, the child psychologist: ''Every effort should be made to give children contact with the other parent and the grandparents, to give them that warm feeling of tradition and roots during the holidays.'' No amount of advice will make a parent feel good about being separated from a child at holiday time. ''The first couple of years you feel awful, '' said Suzanne Jones, director of the Single Family Project in Manhattan. ''Until you and the children start developing new ways of celebrating, Christmas on Dec. 26, say, or Thanskgiving on Friday, until then the old memories will be very powerful.'' Georgia Dullea

627-> NOTRE DAME PASSES DOWN NAVY, 27-10
Notre Dame's offense had more spark today than it had displayed in the last six weeks as Blair Kiel threw his first two touchdown passes of the season on the way to a 27-10 victory over Navy at Giants Stadium. Kiel completed 18 of 34 passes for 220 yards, threw six consecutive completions on an eight-play drive of 80 yards en route to the first touchdown and set a Notre Dame record of 34 attempts in a game without an interception. Yet the Notre Dame defense, with six interceptions, once again was the steadying influence that shut off Navy's passing game at critical moments and set up two Notre Dame touchdowns. Dave Duerson, one of the best safetymen in Irish history, made three of the interceptions as Notre Dame stole four of Tom Tarquinio's passes in the third period alone. Tarquinio, who tossed a touchdown pass and a 2-point conversion pass after Notre Dame got a 27-2 lead, started in place of Marco Pagnanelli, who broke a leg last week. Game Draws Crowd of 72,201 This Notre Dame victory before 72,201 persons, which was its first triumph in three weeks, was not so impressive that people began to think the Irish are able to beat Pittsburgh next Saturday. Larry Moriarty, Notre Dame's fullback, who caught the second of Kiel's scoring passes, said, ''That offensive performance will not beat Pitt, but that offensive team out there is capable of beating Pitt.'' With Pitt - led by its quarterback, Dan Marino - Penn State, Air Force and Southern California remaining on the Irish schedule, Coach Gerry Faust had his thoughts on the future moments after the Navy game and said, ''We'll have to improve to play the No. 1 team in the nation, Pitt.'' But for a while, at least, Notre Dame could relish the best attack it has displayed since its opening 23-17 victory over Michigan on Sept. 18, and relish Kiel's biggest day of the year. The Irish gained their fifth victory of the year against a loss and a tie. And this was Notre Dame's 46th victory in the 56 games played between Notre Dame and Navy in what is the longest, continuous intersectional football rivalry in the nation. Navy's record for the season is now 4-4. An interception by Duerson at the Notre Dame 5 and his 46-yard runback kept Navy out of the end zone in the first period when the game was scoreless. Then Notre Dame began to move. Smith Scores on Pass Kiel tossed the fifth of his six straight completions to Tony Hunter, the big tight end, on a perfect pattern, with Hunter charging over behind the linebackers to take the ball down to the Navy 3. From there, Kiel flipped his first touchdown pass to Chris Smith in the deep right corner of the end zone. ''At least that will get people to stop talking about my not throwing touchdown passes,'' Kiel said after the game. Notre Dame entered the game as only one of two major college football teams without a touchdown pass. The other one was Oklahoma. Mike Johnston, who has been the Notre Dame savior with enough field goals to win two games and gain last week's tie with Oregon, kicked two field goals in the last 35 seconds of the first half. The first, at 40 yards, was followed immediately by a Navy fumble of the ensuing kickoff. Notre Dame recovered, so Johnston could kick a 48-yard field goal for the longest of his career with one second left in the half. Then interceptions by Mark Zavagnin and Duerson in Navy territory set up Notre Dame for its last two touchdowns in the third period. The first of these was scored on Kiel's pass to Moriarty for 18 yards, with the fullback running the last 12. The last Notre Dame touchdown came on a 12-yard run by Allen Pinkett, the Irish tailback. Navy's Eric Rutherford sacked Kiel in the Notre Dame end zone early in the third period for a safety and Tarquinio threw his touchdown pass to Bill Cebak, the split end, in the fourth quarter. ---- In Memory of Red Smith During the intermission, the Notre Dame Alumni Club of Northern New Jersey and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority donated $1,000 each to Notre Dame for the purpose of establishing a Red Smith Writing Scholarship. The late Red Smith, a Notre Dame graduate, won a Pulitzer Prize as a sports columnist for The New York Times. The Rev. Edmund P. Joyce, executive vice president of Notre Dame, accepted the donations on behalf of the university.

629-> AROUND THE WORLD; Third Bulgarian Linked To Attack on the Pope
The Italian Foreign Ministry wants the diplomatic immunity of a Bulgarian Embassy employee lifted so that he can be arrested for complicity in the 1981 attack on Pope John Paul II, sources said today. The sources said Teodorov Aivazov, a cashier at the Bulgarian Embassy in Rome, was wanted on suspicion of being an accomplice in the shooting of the Pope on May 13, 1981. A Bulgarian Embassy spokesman said today that Mr. Aivazov was not protected by diplomatic immunity in his job as a cashier. He said, however, that Mr. Aivazov had ''certain rights'' as an embassy employee. He would not elaborate. The spokesman said Mr. Aivazov had been out of Italy ''almost a month,'' but he did not say if Mr. Aivazov still worked at the embassy. If an arrest warrant is issued, Mr. Aivazov would become the third Bulgarian national implicated in the attack on the Pope. Italian policemen arrested Sergei Ivanov Antonov, a Bulgarian airline employee, last week on charges of ''active complicity'' in the shooting. Judicial sources said Friday that an international arrest warrant had been issued for a former Bulgarian Embassy employee, Vassiliev Juelio Kolev, who is currently in Bulgaria.

631-> SCOUTING; When It Rains ...
Professional football fans might have missed eight weeks of games because of the players' strike, but New York area fans, television variety, are getting a chance in the final weeks of the season to make up for part of what they missed. Because the National Football League schedule has the Jets and the Giants on the road in the last three weeks of the regular season, area fans are able to see one extra television game each weekend. The league's television rules allow no extra television games if the home team plays at home on Sunday, but the television schedule expands to a doubleheader if the team plays elsewhere. The New York teams originally were scheduled to play on the road the last two weeks of the season. When a makeup game was added to the schedule for Jan. 2, the teams also wound up on the road for that Sunday. Val Pinchbeck Jr., the league's director of broadcasting, explained that television is one of the factors that put the Jets and Giants on the road last weekend and this coming weekend. Weather is another. ''We do a number of things in putting the schedule together to maximize for the fans what games they can get on television,'' Pinchbeck said. ''You also try to make it so that fans don't have to go to games in real cold weather.'' Weather also was one of the considerations in determining the matchups for the makeup weekend. Where possible, the N.F.L. scheduled games for warm-weather sites. The Giants play at Philadelphia, which was not a warm-weather site the last time anyone checked. But Pinchbeck explained that the Giants were in a position of playing in a cold climate no matter whom their opponent would have been. The Jets are playing in Kansas City because the Chiefs had to be at home that weekend to give them their fourth home game of the nine-game season. As a result, television fans will have an extra game that weekend, too. Murray Chass

634-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New Leader For Grace's Retail Group
Edward H. Tuton has been named group executive for W.R. Grace & Company's retail group, to succeed Robert H. Anderson, who is retiring Jan. 1. The retail group has grown rapidly, benefiting in part from its acquisition of several specialty retailers. In 1978, it had sales of $372 million. Sales this year are expected to reach $1.4 billion. Mr. Tuton, 58, is a senior vice president of Grace and has served as deputy group executive to Mr. Anderson, 63, since 1981. Mr. Anderson joined Grace in 1978 and guided the group through its heady growth period. Grace now owns a network of home improvement centers, known in the Northeast as Channel Stores. The home improvement centers are expected to account for $900 million of sales this year. Grace also owns Herman's World of Sporting Goods, J.B. Robinson Jewelers, Sheplers western wear and Berman's leather goods. ''Our first objective was to establish our position,'' Mr. Tuton said. ''Now we've reached critical mass, and our efforts will be to improve profitability and return on Grace's investment.'' Mr. Anderson is leaving a long career in retailing. He worked 36 years for Sears, Roebuck & Company, until 1975, when he was brought in as chairman of W.T. Grant just before it went into bankruptcy proceedings in an unsuccessful attempt to save the chain. He has also operated his own consulting firm and will continue as a consultant to Grace. Mr. Tuton, on the other hand, has spent most of his career at Grace, joining the company in 1958. He holds a degree in chemical engineering from Northeastern University. ''What's a chemical engineer doing in the retail business?'' Mr. Tuton said. ''My only pearl of wisdom is that I have a broad business background and the principles of business hold through every business I've been in. I'm supported by strong people and it's a very workable team.''

DARRYL SUTTER GETS 4 CHICAGO, Dec. 12 (AP) - Darryl Sutter celebrated his appointment as team captain by getting four goals tonight as the Chicago Black Hawks scored a 7-3 victory over the Quebec Nordiques. Tom Lysiak had five assists as the Black Hawks took over undisputed possession of first place in the Norris Division, 2 points ahead of the idle Minnesota North Stars. The 24-year-old Sutter, one of five brothers playing in the National Hockey League, scored the first Chicago goals in each of the first two periods. He finished the night with 13 goals for the season. The Black Hawks have now won 14 and tied five of their last 22 games. The Nordiques' loss was only the second in their last eight games. Midway in the opening period, Sutter scored on a 20-footer from the left face-off circle for the only goal of the period. Just 6:36 into the second period, Sutter outmaneuvered the Nordique goalie, Dan Bouchard, to score from close range. Early in the third period, Lysiak picked up a loose puck and fed Bob Murray, who uncorked a 60-foot slapshot that was tipped by Sutter into the net past Bouchard. Sutter's fourth goal came late in the game. Flyers 4, Penguins 3 PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 12 (AP) -Brad McCrimmon's first goal in a Philadelphia uniform was decisive. The Flyers continued their home-ice mastery over the Penguins, who are 0-15-2 in Philadelphia since Jan. 20, 1974. McCrimmon, acquired from Boston last summer in a trade for the goalie Pete Peeters, scored on a long slapshot at 7:49 of the third period to give the Flyers a 4-2 lead. The Penguins got within a goal on Tom Baxter's second goal of the game during a power play at 19:40 of the final period. Baxter had also scored midway through the second period. The Flyers outshot Pittsburgh, 45-22, in the hard-hitting game. Whalers 3, Sabres 1 BUFFALO (AP) - Ron Francis scored two goals to lead Hartford. Francis opened the scoring in the first period when he took a drop pass from Mark Johnson and beat the Buffalo goalie Bob Sauve to the far side. Blaine Stoughton scored in the second period and, after Hannu Virta brought the Sabres to within one goal late in the third period, Francis scored an empty-net goal. Capitals 4, Bruins 3 LANDOVER, Md. (UPI) - Dennis Maruk scored two goals as Washington extended its unbeaten streak to nine games. With the score 2-2 entering the third period, Maruk deflected a pass from Brian Engblom over the Boston goalie Mike Moffat. Bengt Gustafsson scored at 8:57 in the third to put the Capitals ahead, 4-2. Keith Crowder of Boston countered at 16:57. Red Wings 7, Flames 3 DETROIT (AP) - John Ogrodnick scored three goals as Detroit won its fourth straight. By winning, Detroit (7-17-6) increased its fourth-place margin in the Norris Division to 5 points over Toronto and closed the gap behind third-place St. Louis to 3 points. Ogrodnick put Detroit in front, 2-0, with goals at 7:29 and 11:17 of the opening period after taking setup passes from Stan Weir and Mike Blaisdell. The Detroit left wing got his 16th goal of the season 48 seconds before the end of the second period for the third three-goal game of his four-year career.

Celtics, Led by Bird, Overtake Nuggets BOSTON, Dec. 12 (AP) - Larry Bird scored 36 points, including 23 in the second half, as the Boston Celtics rallied to score a 126-112 victory tonight over the Denver Nuggets. The Celtics trailed until Bird hit a 15-foot jump shot with 7 minutes 9 seconds remaining to give Boston a 100-99 lead. The Celtics then went on a 14-6 spurt. Denver jumped to an early 8-2 lead and had a 29-23 margin at the end of the first quarter. The Celtics' Robert Parish, nursing a sore ankle, played only the first six minutes of the game and never returned. Rick Robey, who replaced Parish, picked up four fouls early in the second period, and Kevin McHale had three fouls at halftime. Denver led by 64-53 at intermission. The Nuggets extended their lead to 17 points in the third quarter. Bird sparked a 13-0 spurt, however, and Denver's lead at the end of the third period was only 4 points - 89-85. McHale scored 17 points, and Cedric Maxwell added 15 for the Celtics. Dan Issel led Denver with 25 points. Kiki Vandeweghe had 19 and Billy McKinney 18. Bucks 120, Pacers 108 MILWAUKEE (AP) - Bob Lanier scored 24 points, including a 3-point play with 1:43 remaining, as Milwaukee held off a fourth-quarter Indiana rally. Indiana, with the the rookie Clark Kellogg scoring 9 of his 19 points in the fourth period, closed a 92-81 deficit to 101-99 with 5:51 to go. Brian Winters and Junior Bridgeman then hit consecutive jump shots for the Bucks. Milwaukee's Marques Johnson led all scorers with 26 points, and Herb Williams led the Pacers with 22 points. The Bucks led by 62-50 at halftime, thanks partly to an 18-4 spurt in the second quarter that snapped a 44-44 tie. Blazers 99, Suns 94 PORTLAND, Ore. (UPI) - Jim Paxson scored 20 points as Portland rallied for the victory. Phoenix led by 92-85 with 4:20 to play, but the Trail Blazers scored 8 straight points, including a layup by Paxson with 2:17 to go, to take the lead.

Two Advance With McEnroe WEMBLEY, England, Nov. 11 (UPI) - Andres Gomez of Ecuador, seeded fourth, struggled to find his touch today before beating Tom Gullikson of the United States, 5-7, 7-6, 6-1, to reach the quarterfinals of a $200,000 Grand Prix tennis tournament at Wembley Arena. Earlier, Henri Leconte of France earned an easy passage into the quarterfinals when his fifth-seeded American opponent, Brian Teacher, walked off the court after complaining of a foot injury. Leconte was leading, 6-3, 1-0, at the time. Leconte's quarterfinal opponent will be John McEnroe, the topseeded player, who eliminated Mark Dickson of the United States, 6-3, 6-4, in the evening match. McEnroe, a three-time winner of the tournament, appeared to be under pressure only in the opening games of the second set, when he slipped to 0-3 after dropping his serve on some weak forehands. But from 15-40 on his serve in the fourth game, McEnroe became more aggressive and effective. Teacher Withdraws After pulling back to 3-3, McEnroe made the decisive break for a 5-4 lead with a series of excellent service returns and a precise baseline lob. Leconte produced flashes of his best tennis in breaking Teacher for a 4-2 first-set lead, and then passed his opponent with ease to break through in the opening game of the second set. Leconte, who hopes to play for France against the United States in the Davis Cup final at Grenoble later this month, looked perplexed as an apparently fit Teacher retired. ''This morning when I was practicing I felt a sharp pain in the ball of my foot,'' Teacher said. Gomez lost concentration when he appeared ready to take the first set against Gullikson. He allowed the left-hander to recover from 3-5 and win the set at 7-5, taking only 5 points in the last four games. Gullikson served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but lost the game as Gomez finally hit form. Gomez dominated the tiebreaker, and then overcame disputed line calls to swamp his opponent in the deciding set. ---- Rest of the World Team Gains ADELAIDE, Australia, Nov. 11 (AP) - Tracy Austin beat Sue Barker of Britain, 6-3, 6-4, and Pam Shriver defeated Wendy Turnbull of Australia, 6-1, 7-6, tonight on the second day of the $200,000 Toyota Tennis Classic. The victories by the Americans gave the Rest of the World team a 4-0 lead over a Commonwealth team.

For more than four decades, the covers of the annual National Collegiate Athletic Association guides in nine sports remained a source of speculation and interest. How and why was a particular athlete chosen for the cover? Last spring, the N.C.A.A. decided to drop the guides, opting for larger record books in football and basketball. The 1983 N.C.A.A. basketball book is off the presses (440 pages at a price of $5), and its cover may become a collectors' item: for the first time, a female athlete, Anne Donovan of Old Dominion, has joined a prominent male player, Ralph Sampson of Virginia, on the cover. ''It didn't seem to us that it was valid any longer to feature one or the other,'' Wallace Renfro, the director of publishing for the N.C.A.A., said yesterday. ''The book has features and records and schedules for both the men's and women's programs. We thought about going every other year, but nobody liked that. You never know when you're going to leave someone out.''

Literature and Politics J ason Epstein, editorial director at Random House, seems to be a magnet for the gubernatorially ambitious. In 1974, he brought out Mario M. Cuomo's ''Forest Hills Diary,'' a chronicle of the struggle over subsidized housing in that Queens community. Next year Mr. Epstein will publish a book on the gold standard by Lewis E. Lehrman, the man Mr. Cuomo defeated in the November election. The book is tentatively titled ''The End of Inflation.'' ''Neither one of them was a politician when he came to me,'' said Mr. Epstein. ''Mario was a lawyer, but I had never heard of him. Lew actually came to Random House through another editor, and no one here had any idea he was going into politics.'' He called Governor-elect Cuomo ''a spectacular writer - he's a natural.'' Mr. Lehrman's style, he said, ''is much more like his personal style -very quick and sharp.'' Mr. Epstein regrets that Mr. Cuomo's writing talents will now be spent on legislation and speeches, which he considers ''a loss to the literary world.'' Deirdre Carmody Laurie Johnston

647-> Barter With East Urged
Western companies will have to accept more deals with the Communist world involving payment in goods rather than in cash if East-West trade is to flourish, a senior United Nations official said today. East European countries, which lack hard currency and credits from Western banks, need to import Western technology, the official, Janez Stanovnik, chief of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, said in an interview. He is retiring this week after 15 years in the post. Since the cost of developing new technology keeps rising, Western companies will remain interested in exporting to all markets to lower research costs per unit, Mr. Stanovnik said. ''The West has an economic interest in maintaining East-West trade,'' he said, noting that such trade in 1982 totaled $100 billion. ''But it will have to make some concessions. It will have to pay more attention to compensation trade.'' About 15 percent of all Western exports to the Soviet bloc are now paid for through barter, according to estimates by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Barter has long been unpopular with Western traders because they say they have often received poor-quality goods. A widely used form of payment in the 1950's, barter had all but ended by 1973 when the surplus dollars of oil producers made credits available to most borrowers. Rumania returned to bartering in 1980 with a law stating that all trade must be on a barter basis. When Western banks began reducing their lending to Eastern Europe, other Communist states returned to bartering to conserve cash. Arguing that high-technology exports to Eastern Europe would help expand Soviet military power, the United States has been trying to limit such sales. In Eastern Europe, officials in several countries, sobered by the collapse of the Polish economy under its huge debts, have been arguing for less trade with the West. Mr. Stanovnik dismissed these developments as short-term factors.

648-> Technology; Computerized Phone System
IMAGINE if a person had a single phone number that would allow him to be reached anywhere, whether he was at home or at work or at a hotel in Chicago. The person could program his schedule into the telephone system, which would then automatically direct calls to the proper place. Such an intriguing service might be available in a year or two. It is one of many new services that would be made possible in the next few years by the gradual computerization of the telephone network. Although the computerization started years before the settlement of the Federal antitrust suit against Bell, the new services will become a factor in the increasing competition expected from the breakup of the Bell System. There are two aspects of computerization. One aspect is the computerization of the telephone system for setting up a connection between two phones. With a computerized system, instead of making the connection immediately, a data bank would be rapidly consulted to determine where to send the call. The data bank, for instance, might disclose that the person being called was in Chicago rather than in Los Angeles and the call could be rerouted. Also it might be possible to allow companies with many outlets to have a single nationwide phone number. A motorist stranded in a strange city, for instance, could call the nationwide American Automobile Association number and be connected to the nearest A.A.A.- affiliated service station. Earlier this year Bell introduced an enhanced 800 number service, which is similar in concept but somewhat more limited. The second aspect of phone network computerization is the transformation to digital transmission. Right now, conversations are conveyed through the telephone line mainly in analog fashion - as wavelike electrical signals. Gradually, however, the system is being converted to carry messages in digital form, as a series of sharp on-off pulses, or bits. That will make computer data transmission easier, since such data exist in the computer in digital form. Currently data must be converted to analog form to be sent through a telephone line, and at the other end the data must be converted back into digital form. Also, once voice is in digital form, it is virtually indistinguishable from data and can be mixed with data on the line and processed like data. ''A bit is a bit is a bit, as we engineers say,'' said Nathan Levine, director of the transmission engineering network center at the Bell Laboratories. In about a year or two, Bell plans to offer a digital service. It would be similar to an ordinary phone system and would use the existing wires. However, the digital lines will carry 56,000 bits a second, compared with 4,800 or 9,600 bits a second possible with analog transmission lines. Such digital lines could be used for high-speed facsimile transmission. An entire page could be sent in two to four seconds instead of the 20 seconds or more that it now takes. Anyone would also be able to interchange voice and data, making it possible to transmit a computer letter or a graph or even a photograph and talk about it with the person at the other end. Special terminal equipment, such as high-speed facsimile machines, would have to be developed to take advantage of the digital transmissions. But such equipment is already being developed for use in companies that have internal digital phone systems. Digitization is also being spurred by the gradual replacement of copper wires with optical fibers, which convey information through digital light pulses but have a far greater capacity than wire. Eventually, though it will take years, the phone system will be completely transformed into the integrated services digital network. There are still some uncertainties, though. The market for highspeed data has not developed as fast as originally predicted. In addition, the divestiture of the regional Bell operating subsidiaries could slow down computerization. After divestiture, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company will no longer be able to virtually dictate the structure of the phone system as it has in the past. It will have to get the operating companies to agree with its carefully laid plans. Nevertheless, the potential for new services and cost savings is expected to drive everyone down the computer route. For instance, the MCI Communications Corporation, Bell's principal long-distance competitor, is starting to switch from analog to digital transmission and is beginning work on a transcontinental fiber-optic system. The divested Bell companies and the independent phone companies face increased competition from cable television companies and from newly authorized services known as digital termination systems. Proponents of such alternatives say the existing phone system is a bottleneck when it comes to transmitting information at high speeds. But the new digital systems could turn the tables, transforming the existing copper phone wires from a bottleneck to a high-speed pathway. ''We'll be in a position to compete very well,'' predicted G. William Ruhl, division manager of network area planning for Bell of Pennsylvania. Charles Wohlstetter, chairman of Continental Telecom, an independent telephone company, agreed. New digital transmission, he said, ''is life and death.''

649-> RESTAURANTS; Before the curtain at Lincoln Center.
SERVICEABLE is the word that comes to mind when evaluating Centre Court, the new steakhouse just across from the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center. It is, in fact, only the highly visible location and the large and trendy young crowd it has managed to attract since it opened three months ago that make Centre Court worth reviewing. At first glance, there is much appeal in the moderate-price prime steaks and chops and in the glittering modern cafe setting, with its tennis theme. But half a dozen meals indicate that the promise is not fulfilled. What looks like a handsome cafe proves to be uncomfortably cramped, even in the prime area at the Columbus Avenue windows, and especially in other sections, such as the side gallery and the spillover into the deserted lobby of the building in which Centre Court is set. Glass-topped tables also become unpleasantly slippery and greasy when food is served. The prices seem bargains, with a big, tempting-looking chicken pie for $7.95, broiled meat or seafood brochettes for $9.75 and sirloin and filet @mignon steaks for $13.50. These prices include helpings from the salad bar, which is a sorry array of spoiled tomatoes, dried-out onion slices and limp romaine and iceberg lettuce. Dressings are the cloying bottled variety, and breads and rolls, also at the bar, are dried out and tasteless. There is passable herring in sour-cream dressing, very sweet cucumber salad, tough, woody cuts of carrot and stringy outer stalks of celery. If the salad bar were acceptable, the menu would represent a good value. Steaks and the chops of veal and lamb, though small, are consistently delicious and are broiled as ordered. Roast prime ribs of beef have a fine flavor but include a lot of waste fat. Chunks of filet mignon grilled en brochette with green pepper and onion prove a decent buy at $9.75, but seafood grilled on a skewer is dry and so are grilled scallops in a gratin dish. Other choices have been uneven. One night, chicken pie had a crisp crust, a huge amount of white chicken breast, nicely cooked carrots, onion and celery, a crisp flaky crust and a thin cream sauce that needed just a dash of salt and pepper. On another occasion, the crust was soggy and mostly unbaked, only three bits of chicken were in the pie, the sauce was pasty and huge slabs of nearly raw onion and carrot made up the filling. Similarly, one night spareribs were oversteamed and their sauce was thin and overpowered with vinegar. Another time, they were lean and meaty, and the spicy sauce clung to them properly. Broiled snapper was overcooked and watery, roast duck and barbecued chicken tasted stale, and so did the mushy and greasy calf's liver. A broiled chopped sirloin steak was gray and desiccated. Side orders of potatoes were equally disappointing. Baked potatoes were cold and limp, potato skins were covered with a waxy orange cheese sauce and french fries were tasteless. One night, onion rings were delicious; another they were cold and greasy. Fried zucchini was uniformly limp, creamed spinach had as much appeal as baby food and broccoli, though well cooked, tasted of garlic powder. The best vegetable is crisply fried cauliflower. At lunch and at late supper, there are passable hamburgers and omelets, but salads are wilted and topped with the same dreary dressings served at the salad bar. Desserts don't help the picture. Imagine something called stuffed ice cream - the flavor of your choice piled high in a glass and layered with M & M candy-coated chocolate drops. Pecan pie, cheesecake, carrot cake, chocolate-chip cake and cappuccino pie are not much better. What is refreshing at Centre Court is the staff's patience and helpfulness, qualities that make their lack of professionalism bearable. If you are seated far from the salad bar, waiters or waitresses will fetch salad and rolls, and they all quote prices for the off-menu specials they describe. And when the kitchen slows down, as it often does, they are most apologetic. They also make an effort to get customers out in time for Lincoln Center performances. A la Carte To lilting melodies on a harp, you can have a pleasant if slightly expensive Sunday brunch at Manhattan Market, 1016 Second Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets (752-1400). The $12 meal, served from 11 A.M. to 3:30 P.M. in a handsome and urbane dining room overlooking an enclosed garden, begins with a sparkling-fresh fruit salad that is especially good when cool, followed by a large, puffy omelet or a platter of assorted smoked fish. This platter looks meager, but you can have seconds, even thirds. Herring in dill sauce, cream cheese and, best of all, a delicious array of breads and Danish pastries made in the nearby bakery of David's Cookie Kitchen round out the meal and your figure. The extra charge of $1.50 for coffee seems an inhospitable touch for a brunch, but you can have as many refills as you want. The same is true for the famed, if now somewhat disappointing David's cookies. Two outstanding dishes turned out by Alain Sailhac, the chef at Le Cirque, 58 East 65th Street, between Madison and Park Avenues (794-9292), are a lusty, wine-dark civet of duckling with tiny ovals of potato and turnips (a Monday lunch and dinner special) and an appetizer of lightly sauteed duck or squab liver nested on julienne strips of radicchio and endive, sparked with fresh chervil and tarragon. Centre Court Fair 61 West 62d Street, corner Columbus Avenue. 586-1222.

652-> PANEL RECALLS SHARON FOR CROSS-EXAMINATION
Defense Minister Ariel Sharon has been summoned before the state commission investigating the killing of Palestinian civilians in Beirut to answer questions from the Director of Military Intelligence, the commission announced today. Mr. Sharon had told the panel that he did not wish to reappear, having given testimony in both open and closed sessions. But the military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Yehoshua Saguy, one of nine officials including Mr. Sharon who have been warned that they could be harmed by the commission's findings, has exercised his right to call and cross-examine witnesses and has included Mr. Sharon among them. The commission, headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Yitzhak Kahan, is charged with determining the scope of Israeli responsibility in the killings last September of hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children by Lebanese Christian Phalangists. The Phalangists were asked to go into the Beirut refugee camps by the Israelis. Hearings to Resume Sunday The commission has heard extensive testimony, both in open and closed sessions. Along with Mr. Sharon and General Saguy, the others who have been issued warnings include Prime Minister Menachem Begin, Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir, the Chief of Staff, the head of the Mossad, and others. All have been given the right to reappear, introduce further evidence and call and cross-examine witnesses. The members and staff of the commission met today with representatives of eight of the nine - Mr. Shamir was not represented - to work out a schedule of further proceedings. Hearings are to resume next Sunday with testimony in closed session by Mordechai Gur, a former chief of staff and now a Member of Parliament from the opposition Labor Party. He asked to appear, the commission said. Along with Mr. Sharon, other witnesses are to include General Saguy and the current Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Rafael Eytan; the head of Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Amir Drori; the head of the Mossad intelligence agency, whose name is kept secret, and Avi Dudai, an aide to the Defense Minister. 2 Doctors and a Nurse Saw Panel A spokesman for the commission said all Israeli citizens who had been asked to appear had done so, but that several foreigners had declined. He said representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Beirut had been invited, but they had said they would submit written material instead. All foreign medical personnel in Beirut's Gaza Hospital were asked, the spokesman said, but only three appeared - two doctors and a nurse. Thomas L. Friedman, the Beirut correspondent of The New York Times - the only American journalist to be invited - ''declined to come to Jerusalem,'' the spokesman said. Craig R. Whitney, foreign editor of The Times, issued the following statement in connection with the matter: ''Thomas L. Friedman, our Beirut correspondent, was invited to testify by the Israeli commission. Mr. Friedman had reported all the information at his disposal in the news columns of The New York Times. He and his editors decided he should decline the committee's invitation in keeping with the general policy of The Times of avoiding participation in activities of official investigative bodies by reporters when this is not necessary.'' A spokesman said that American diplomats in Beirut had neither been invited nor had offered to appear. The commission was understood to have been reluctant to ask any American officials, but had held out some hope that those with information might step forward. Asked whether any Phalangists had been invited to give testimony, the spokesman said, ''No comment.''

South Africa Pressing Inquiry Into Bombings CAPE TOWN, Dec. 20 (Reuters) - Security police and energy officials began an inquiry today into explosions at a South African nuclear power plant project over the weekend. No one was hurt in the blasts, and there was no danger from radioactivity to the public or to workers on the still unfinished Koeberg power station near Cape Town, a police statement said. The African National Congress, which seeks the overthrow of the Government, said in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that it was responsible. The group, which is banned in South Africa, has carried out other attacks on power plants, including a synthetic fuel plant at Sasolburg in June 1980. A statement by the group said the attack at Koeberg was intended as a salute to the African National Council members killed in a South African raid on Lesotho this month. ---- UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., Dec. 20 (UPI) - Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar said today that a United Nations team was being sent to Lesotho to investigate the killing of 42 people in a South African raid. South Africa said the raid had been aimed at hideouts of guerrillas of the African National Congress. The black African states said the raiders had killed refugees from South Africa. The Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the raid, demanding that South Africa pay reparations and asking the Secretary General to ''insure the welfare of refugees in Lesotho.''

656-> U.S. REFUSES WAIVERS TO 2 SEWAGE PLANTS
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency has turned down applications to reduce the required level of sewage treatment at two plants in the New York metropolitan area, agency officials announced yesterday. The applications for the Newtown Creek plant in Brooklyn and the Mamaroneck plant in Westchester County were denied because they failed to prove that less treatment would not hurt the quality of the waters the plants discharged into, agency officials said. The announcement comes at a time when environmentalists and some politicians are criticizing the agency as being too lenient in its interpretation of the statute under which the waivers were sought. That statute allows for plants discharging into marine waters to treat sewage less thoroughly than plants discharging into fresh waters. ''A lot of communities have been thinking you just apply for a waiver and you get it,'' said Frederick A. Eidsness Jr., the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for water. ''This is not true. There are very strict regulations that have to be met.'' 1979 Application Deadline Newtown Creek and Mamaroneck had applied for waivers to continue to remove less than the Federally required 85 percent of biological matter. Their applications were among about 70 that met a 1979 deadline. Before yesterday's announcement, 12 had been approved and one had been denied, subject to public review. Last year, Congress reopened the deadline for waiver applications and E.P.A. officials are expecting 350 to 400 before the Dec. 29 deadline. New York City plans to apply for waivers for two plants under construction - North River in Manhattan and Red Hook in Brooklyn. It will also ask to be allowed to reduce treatment to below Federal standards during the winter months at three other plants. E.P.A. officials refused to speculate on the fate of the city's other applications. City Officials Surprised New York City officials said they were surprised that the application for Newtown Creek had been turned down. ''We thought the E.P.A. was satisfied because they had previously asked us to meet certain requirements in our testing and we had complied,'' said Joseph T. McGough, the Commissioner of the City's Department of Enviromental Protection. Mr. McGough also said he had not expected an answer so soon. ''In our discussions with them, we were led to believe that they were waiting for all the applications to be in,'' he said. Both aplications had been approved by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation before they were passed on to Federal authorities. ''We have no technical evidence to change our minds about the approval,'' said Robert McManus, a spokesman for the state agency. Three Reasons Are Cited The E.P.A. rulings, which are subject to public review, cited three reasons for refusing the waivers: reduced treatment would worsen water and biological conditions; standards for dissolved oxygen, widely used to measure pollution, could probably not be met; and marine life and recreational activities would probably be harmed. Newtown Creek, which discharges into the East River, removes 75 percent of the biological matter from the 280 million gallons of raw sewage it treats each day. Andrew McCarthy, a spokesman for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said that construction needed to enable the plant to remove 85 percent of biological material would cost $275 million dollars, and it would cost an additional $900,000 a year to operate. The tests needed for the application cost the city about $1 million. The Mamaroneck plant, which discharges into the Long Island Sound, removes 35 percent of the biological material from the 17 million gallons of raw sewage it treats daily. William G. Borghard, the Westchester County Commissioner of Environmental Facilities, estimated county costs to bring the plant up to Federal standards at $50 million for construction and an additional $200,000 a year for operations. The application cost the county about $50,000. Both applications could be resubmitted under the new deadline, and city and county officials said that was being considered. Notification yesterday morning of the Federal decisions was by telephone, and the formal papers are yet to arrive.

660-> Levittown Division Wins, 7-6
Unbeaten Levittown Division defeated previously unbeaten Roosevelt, 7-6, to tie New Hyde Park for first place in the National League Conference I race with a 5-0 record. It was the 14th straight victory over two seasons for Levittown Division. Roosevelt had won four games. Trailing by 6-0 with 5 minutes 45 seconds left in the fourth period, Levittown Division rallied on a 7-yard touchdown run by Mike Galvin and an extra-point kick by Mark Shermansky. Roosevelt took a 6-0 lead in the opening period on a 5-yard touchdown run by Mel Fitchett, capping a 98-yard drive. Greg Polvere rushed for 149 yards and scored three touchdowns while Paul Gugerty completed 7 of 7 passes for 129 yards, including one touchdown, to lead Locust Valley to a 35-26 victory over Glen Cove. Marc Russo of Glen Cove completed 10 of 21 passes for 178 yards, including two touchdowns. Chris Spillane passed for three touchdowns to lead Elmont to a 29-13 victory over Seaford in another National Conference I game. Valley Stream South (4-0) took over undisputed possession of first place in the National Conference II-A race with a 14-6 victory over Levittown Memorial (3-1). Valley Stream South touchdowns were scored by Tom Murray on an 18-yard run and by Frank Tranquillino on a 15-yard pass from Wayne Mastrangelo. Oyster Bay (4-0) and Valley Stream North (3-0-1) continued 1-2 in National II-B. Oyster Bay blanked Carle Place, 27-0, and Valley Stream North downed East Rockaway, 14-0. Valley Stream North, which has not lost in 16 games, was led by Pat Mancini, who scored on a 66-yard run and passed for a 13-yard touchdown to Jim Buquicchio. Mancini passed for 120 yards and rushed for 112. Mike Freshour rushed for 130 yards and scored three touchdowns to lead Farmingdale (6-0) to a 37-8 American League Conference I-A victory over Freeport. West Hempstead (4-1) upset Hempstead, 16-6, to move into second place in American II-A. It was Hempstead's first loss in six games this season. The Tigers, 3-1 in the league, had won 14 straight regular-season games. Sewanhaka, which beat Bellmore Kennedy, 21-0, is in first place with a 4-0 record. Tom Engelke led Sewanhaka with an 11-yard touchdown run and a 58-yard scoring pass to Mitch Rosowitz. Dave Kurek rushed for 148 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead Calhoun to a 20-7 American II-A triumph over Long Beach. Lawrence defeated East Meadow, 34-14, to take over first place in I-B with a 3-0 record. East Meadow is 2-1. Garden City downed Wantagh, 33-6, and Bethpage trimmed Plainedge, 20-7, to stay tied for first place in the American II-B race with 4-0 records. Kevin Dougherty scored for Garden City on a 1-yard plunge and passed 16 yards to Rich Ironside for another touchdown. Todd Lawson rushed for 197 yards and scored one touchdown to lead Bethpage. Steve McClain scored on a 91-yard run to lead Carey to a 21-7 American II-B victory over Plainview District. Hewlett blanked Valley Stream Central, 18-0, and Great Neck South routed MacArthur, 30-0, to remain tied for first place in the Intra-League with 6-0 records. They meet next Saturday at Great Neck.

661-> AROUND THE NATION; U.S. Asks Court to End Carolina Jail Segregation
The Justice Department, accusing North Carolina of segregating prisoners by race at a state prison in Raleigh, today asked a Federal District judge to order the practice halted. Stuart Shadbolt, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections, said prisoners were still being segregated in cell assignments at Central Prison to ''cut down on problems.'' William Bradford Reynolds, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of civil rights, said the suit was filed after years of negotiations with the state. Jack Safron, the state's special Deputy Attorney General, said North Carolina had shown good faith by building a new facility ''all with single cells.''

662-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; New Lehrman Campaign?
Those Lehrman-for-Governor television commercials were so ubiquitous that it was no great surprise when one of them somehow got on the air 20 minutes after the polls closed. Probably did it on its own, out of habit, a few people suggested. In truth, it was nothing but a simple mistake, people at WCBS-TV said yesterday. From Mr. Lehrman's spokesman, John Buckley, came assurances that the commercial did not signal the start of the next campaign.

663-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; Transition Games
American basketball players with a touch of wanderlust have transported their highly polished skills to many foreign countries in the last couple of decades. Former college stars, unable to land berths in the National Basketball Association, have gone to such countries as Italy, France, Spain and Sweden to perpetuate their playing careers. But American-born players have recently been the focus of some incidents in Israel where basketball is second in popularity only to soccer. When the 12-team Basketball Association opened its season last month, 33 of 60 starting players were Americans, with a total of 41 on the teams' rosters. The league rules permit only one foreign player per team but many of the Americans took advantage of Israel's ''law of the return,'' which recognizes the right of all Jews to return to their homeland and grants automatic citizenship to Jewish immigrants and their families. The players who took advantage of that law claimed that they were motivated by a love for the country and its people, but many officials and fans felt that many of the players had used the law just to play basketball. ''It's revolting when they commercialize something so sacred as the Jewish religion,'' complained Uri Ben Ari, a Ramat Gan Maccabi player. ''Everyone knows they did it just for the game.'' Several Americans took advantage of the law without changing religions. Melvin Hobred of New York worked out in August with a team in Tel Aviv. He then flew to Cyprus, married an Israeli woman there in a civil wedding and then returned to Israel as a citizen eligible to play in the Basketball Association. Avner Kopel, the manager of the team, denied that his team had arranged the marriage. More outspoken was Carl Winfrey, an American who played last year for Upper Galilee Hapoel as its one permitted foreign player. ''Guys in the United States, they love to play basektball,'' said Winfrey in a television interview in Israel. ''You want to find a job anywhere in the world to play basketball. If you have to marry to remain in Israel to play, you marry somebody or you convert. Maybe you don't love the country and maybe you do love the country. If it could help you find a job, I'd convert and love the country because I love to play basketball.'' Abraham Zaif, the secretary general of the Basketball Association, has condemmed the abuses of religion, but claims that anyone who produces valid citizenship papers is eligible to compete. Isaac Ofek, the president of the Israeli Olympics Committee, has estimated that 90 percent of the players left the country after their basketball contracts had expired. Thomas Rogers

664-> A SOVIET NAVAL BUILDUP IN WEST PACIFIC REPORTED; Military Analysis
Western intelligence sources say there has been a slow but significant expansion of Soviet land, air and sea forces in the West Pacific this year. This development is reported in an area that American strategists have long considered of importance to the United States and to Japan and China. For example, Adm. Maurice F. Weisner told a Congressional committee three years ago that he believed ''the most critical sea lines of communication'' to be those that supply oil through the South China Sea and the Philippine Sea. He also cited ''those great circle routes from the United States which pass near the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula and the Kurile Islands.'' From the Japanese standpoint, there has been a marked deterioration of the situation in the Kuriles. An island chain seized by the Soviet Union seized from the Japanese in 1945, part of which Tokyo wants returned. Four of the Kurile Islands off the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido are now said to be garrisoned by a Soviet mechanized infantry division of 14,000 men. In late 1981, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said there were 10,000 Soviet troops on the islands. The disputed islands are also the site of a Soviet headquarters system capable of handling the operations of an entire army corps, according to Patrick J. Garrity, writing in Military Review, the publication of the Army's Command and General Staff College, In addition, the Soviet Union reportedly sent a squadron of 12 supersonic MIG-21 fighter-bombers recently to replace a squadron of subsonic MIG-17's on the island of Iturup, known by the Japanese as Etorufu. The Soviet explanation for the Kurile buildup, American analysts say, is that it responds to American plans for the deployment in northern Japan starting in 1985 of 50 advanced F-16 fighter-bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons. Some Western intelligence sources suggest another explanation. They speculate that the reinforcements in the Kuriles, which lie between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific, are part of a program to provide a barrier behind which Soviet submarines equipped with ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States could operate with relative impunity. The waters adjacent to Vietnam have seen the greatest increase in Soviet naval strength. Soviet task forces, usually led by a guided missile cruiser and including nuclear-powered submarines, are said to rendezvous at Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang. One task force of 10 ships was said to have been deployed early this year in the South China Sea. The Chinese Government, sensitive to these deployments, has accused the Russians of starting construction of another naval base, on Con Son Island in the South China Sea about 80 miles southeast of Vinh Loi in Vietnam. According to Mr. Garrity and Western intelligence sources, 5,000 to 8,000 Soviet military advisers and technicians are now in Vietnam. They repair and service weapons, predominantly of Soviet manufacture, train pilots and missile crews and operate and service radar installations at Tan Son Nhut airfield at Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, and at Da Nang, Bien Hoa and Cam Ranh Bay. Peking asserts that there are more than 4,000 Soviet advisers in Laos as well. The Soviet Union also provides Vietnam with military assistance now believed to be running at a rate of $1.3 billion a year.

665-> ART: KNOT-THEME SCULPTURES BY LYNDA BENGLIS
LYNDA BENGLIS'S new sculptures, on view at the Paula Cooper Gallery, 155 Wooster Street, though called ''Idols'' in Greek, are but more variations on the knot theme that has occupied the artist on and off for the last decade. They measure roughly two to three-and-ahalf feet across and are made of bronze wire mesh that has been gessoed and sprayed with a metal solution - bronze, aluminum or zinc or combinations thereof. Some knots are matte, some are shiny with lacquer and occasionally there's a splash of turquoise where the bronze has been allowed to oxidize. Each piece has its own character, but collectively they hang on the walls, singly and in clusters, like oversize, accordionpleated bow ties. Miss Benglis rose to fame in the late 1960's as a process artist taking her cue from Jackson Pollock by making sculptures out of liquid plastic poured on the floor. These were followed by a series of tinselly-looking knots, and it appears that the artist has, ever since, been alternating between the automatic and the deliberate. Her materials, however, have grown steadily more precious, culminating in the gold leaf she was using a few years ago. But no matter what the medium, Miss Benglis projects an irresistible blend of cleverness and a rakishness that often skirts cheapness. There's always the feeling that this is a sculptor who uses humor primarily to disguise her essential seriousness. Depend upon it, an enormous amount of very complicated associative thinking has gone into these innocent-looking bow ties. In some, such as the silvery-gray ''Hydra,'' which appears to be wet drapery of the classical Greek sculptors, there's a new elegance and sensuality. These are idols with a touch of the idyllic. (Through tomorrow.) Other shows of note this week: Will Barnet (Dintenfass, 50 West 57th Street): Will Barnet, painter and printmaker, is very well known for the sweetness of his subject matter -landscapes and interiors inhabited by maidens with decorative tresses and cats of character - and for the sweet and sourness of his color. Shapes are few and flat, after the Japanese manner, and the effect is primarily decorative. It's not until Mr. Barnet's portraits are gathered together, as they are here - nearly 20 of them dating from the late 1960's to the present - that he emerges also as an artist of some insight. He may stylize the character out of some elements - hands, for example - but he misses very little in his sitters' heads. In fact, beneath the crowd-pleasing prettiness of his style, the artist is sometimes getting away with murder, as when he places the tiny Frederick Kiesler at one end of a sofa and the wife who outweighs him two-toone at the other. He also has sneaked quite a lot of truth into the likenesses of the critic Katharine Kuh and of a woman named Dede Freeman, but in a way that is not unflattering and that tells something about the subject's life and tastes. Miss Kuh, with her gimlet eyes and brows like bird's wings, is posed against the Leger canvas she most admires. (Through Dec. 2.) James Rosenquist (Castelli Feigen Corcoran, 1020 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street): This is a small show of three fairly large new James Rosenquist paintings, horizontal in format, accompanied by related drawings on frosted Mylar. They may look like the posterish Rosenquists of yore, with their collagelike juxtaposition of organic and industrial shapes and textures, alternately playful and calculated. But, in fact, the artist is far more ferocious and willful than before. One work involves a huge finger with a lacquered nail doubling as a pen nib, which is suspended at a window behind a Venetian blind. Another, called ''Reflector,'' features a shape resembling a lump of ice resting on a ratchetlike device. This, in turn, reposes on a metal flange, while in a separate compartment to the right is a tree trunk metamorphosing into a drainpipe. In ''Deflector,'' the ice has turned into a mysterious shape wrapped in transparent pink plastic. No one can accuse Mr. Rosenquist -always the most violent and least penetrable of the Pop artists - of mellowing. (Through Jan. 8.) Joe Zucker (Solomon, 392 West Broadway): Introducing Joe Zucker's retrospective at the Albright Knox Gallery a few months ago, Robert Buck, the gallery's director, described the artist's 1960's works as ''rowdy'' and looking as if they had come ''from the wrong side of the tracks.'' The same may be said of the 10 new canvases here, although the cotton balls have been supplanted by shapes cut from foil, and there is evidence of brushwork. Still, the rowdiness, which seems more likely to be the result of studies at the Art Institute of Chicago than of the artist's blue-collar background, looks a bit strained. Most of the foil images pertain to characters in the ''Flash Gordon'' comic strip, and they are laid on canvases that are either stained in dark colors or are themselves covered in foil. Mr. Zucker's Rhoplex and pigment mixture which, a few years ago had the consistency of melted sugar, now looks more like mucus. This is an artist who is apparently determined to keep his considerable talent for the decorative at bay. (Through Dec. 1.) Richard Fishman (Delahunty, 291 Church Street): Richard Fishman has been described by a critic as a former sculptor of ''carefully composed'' metal pieces who now makes ''hideous objects because he is interested in beauty.'' Averaging seven to eight feet tall, these wobbly-looking plaster spires aren't hideous by current standards. But then again they aren't comely either, with their roughly modeled surfaces daubed in tar, through which the metal grid armature is often visible. The variations on the same shape expressed in several large pastels look either threatening or humorous. But except for one very handsome brown-and-white woodcut of a design that spirals like some tribal fetish, Mr. Fishman seems less interested in the image itself than in its use as a means of conveying his extremely turbulent emotions. He may be an Abstract Expressionist born too late. (Through Jan. 8.)

666-> SCOUTING; Clemson's Loss
Clemson's football team has a knack for making news. Last year, it was ranked No.1 in the nation. Two days ago, it was penalized for violations in its recruiting methods. Saturday, it will play Wake Forest in Tokyo in the annual invitation game between American colleges. So what did Clemson lose when it was punished by the National Collegiate Athletic Association? David Berst, director of enforcement for the N.C.A.A., points out that Clemson was placed on two years' probation. It can make no television or postseason appearances and can award only two-thirds of the maximum number of scholarships allowed. ''It's a severe penalty,'' he said, ''but not the most severe.'' But Clemson, like other thriving football schools, may not lose as heavily as the numbers indicate. Under the rules, a university may award 30 football scholarships a year, with a maximum of 95 players on scholarship at any time. Under the penalty imposed this week, that means Clemson may award only 20 scholarships in each of the next two years. But in recent years, it has awarded fewer scholarships, anyway. And, with some players red-shirted, or sitting out their eligibility until needed, the school will not suffer any sudden drain in talent. In fact, if it gives 20 scholarships next year, that would be only three or so fewer than usual. Pitt, another football power, lost only four of its 22 starting players from last year's team and gave only 18 scholarships to freshmen this year. Like Clemson, the Panthers are loaded. H.C. (Bill) McClellan, the athletic director at Clemson, considered the situation before leaving for Tokyo, and said: ''We have given out 23 to 26 scholarships a year since Danny Ford became the head coach. And this is his fifth season.''

668-> NIXON, ON TV, SAYS PRESIDENT WILL STICK TO SAME POLICY LINE
President Reagan will neither ''dig his feet in'' nor dramatically change his course as a result of the Democratic gains made in Congress, Richard M. Nixon predicted today. Mr. Nixon, offering a postelection analysis, noted Mr. Reagan had indicated he would be more conciliatory toward Congress but added, ''There's no question the directions of his policy will continue.'' Mr. Reagan ''is a man of great principle, but also one who likes to be effective,'' the former President said on the NBC News ''Today'' show. He added, ''He's not stupid. He'll look at the election results and see he does not have as much support in the House as he had in the last two years. He Won't Be 'the Veto President' ''He will then recognize those realities and continue on his course but do so in a way that is effective,'' Mr. Nixon said. ''He isn't going to just dig his feet in and be remembered as the veto President.'' Mr. Nixon, who saw 48 House Republican seats disappear in the 1974 elections after he left office in the Watergate scandals, said unemployment was a major reason for Democrats' picking up more than two dozen seats Tuesday. Mr. Nixon said, ''Let's remember President Reagan wasn't on the ballot this time, and exit polls indicate had he been on the ballot he would have defeated'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy, or former Vice President Walter F. Mondale. On the problems of Social Security, Mr. Nixon said it was ''better to have some preventive medicine now than face radical surgery later.'' ''The bullet must be bitten on Social Security,'' he said, adding that benefits should not be altered for current recipients. ''Those who refuse to step up to this issue are going to be on the wrong side of it politically,'' Mr. Nixon said.

669-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; U.S. Industries Picks Financial Executive
Sigurd D. Medhus, the chief financial officer at the American Express Company, has been appointed executive vice president and chief financial officer of U.S. Industries, a diversified maker of energy-related equipment, building materials and furniture. Mr. Medhus, 53, fills a position held by A.M. Singer, who is retiring next year. ''This just looked like it offered a lot of room for growth and opportunity, and I wanted to get in on it,'' Mr. Medhus said yesterday. ''It's a product-oriented rather than a financial-oriented company. I just get excited when you have hands-on, see-and-feel type of products.'' Last year, U.S. Industries, one of the model conglomerates during the conglomerate rage in the late 1960's, disposed of 14 of its divisions in a trimming action that resulted in a write-off of $106 million. Mr. Medhus said that he feels the balance sheet is now in pretty good shape. ''The leverage is much lower than many other types of companies in similar types of diversified industries,'' he said. Mr. Medhus was executive vice president and chief financial officer of American Express since 1980. Before that, he was vice president of finance at Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. from 1976 to 1980. Earlier, he spent 26 years at the General Electric Company. Among other posts, he served as general manager of consumer financing for G.E. Credit and chief financial officer of Canadian G.E. in Toronto. Born in North Dakota, he graduated from Oregon State University with a bachelor of science degree. American Express announced that Mr. Medhus's duties would be permanently assumed by a committee of three senior American Express executives. Mr. Medhus said that his main preoccupation when he is not keeping track of dollars is keeping track of his children. He has eight of them.

670-> Reform the Rape Law Reform
Progress in writing fair, effective rape laws is an uneven thing. Consider the recent change in New York's law that has caused such furor in a pending rape case in Brooklyn. The new law was designed to make prosecutions easier for district attorneys to conduct and victims to endure. Here it has jeopardized a case that would have been fairly simple to prosecute before ''reform.'' The old law defined forcible compulsion as ''physical force which is capable of overcoming earnest resistance'' or a threat of immediate death or serious physical injury. The Legislature, responding to pleas from prosecutors and women's organizations, dropped the ''earnest resistance'' language but kept the requirement that the victim be placed in fear. Experts agreed that fear is an ingredient in the overwhelming number of rape cases. But then, sure enough, along comes an exception. The victim, a 19-year-old college student, fiercely resisted two sexual assaults in her own home. But she could not say she had feared her assailant. The accused man had lived with her family for five years. Progress that sacrifices such cases is no progress at all. Surely the Legislature must try again. And it should not stop at curing the newly discovered defect. Among other issues Albany has ducked is sexual violence between husband and wife. Pressing rape charges will never be easy for victims; they must bear some burdens of proof to guard against frivolous, mistaken or malicious accusations. But the general trend has been healthy. Not long ago complainants could be cross-examined interminably about their sex lives. Their testimony required corroboration of all key elements of the crime, a rule of evidence that treated victims like accomplices. Since rape, by definition, is sexual intercourse against one's will, consent is an inescapable issue in many rape trials. The hazard that the victim will be put on trial is ever-present. But especially at a time when police are counseling minimal resistance in the interest of safety, rape victims should not have to suffer the law's unnecessary confusion.

Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany arrived tonight for dinner and talks with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. British officials said the two leaders immediately began discussions at the Prime Minister's official residence, 10 Downing Street. In her talks with Mr. Kohl, Mrs. Thatcher was expected to emphasize the need for quick action to avoid a looming dispute with the United States over European steel exports. The West German Cabinet will study Wednesday whether to join a European agreement to limit steel shipments voluntarily to avoid imposition by the United States of heavy import duties.

674-> Proposition Explanation
Regarding the article (''Nassau, Beware of Weighted Vote, '' Oct. 24), written by a longtime foe of Nassau County's economical and constitutional ''weighted'' vote legislative system: As members of the Nassau Board of Supervisors, which serves as the legislative branch of the county government, we believe it is important for Nassau voters to understand the meaning of the single Proposition that will appear at the top of their ballot on Election Day. A ''Yes'' vote on the propositon will not cost taxpayers a cent for any new program or project! Every 10 years, upon the completion of the national census, state, Federal and county legislative bodies are required to reapportion, based upon shifts in the population within the geographic unit. As you know, Congress on the Federal level, and the State Legislature, have already passed reapportionment plans. The County Legislative body must follow the same administrative process. Accordingly, following the receipt of detailed computerized data with egard to the 1980 population census, the Nassau County Board of Supervisors passed a reapportionment plan that now appears on the balot as Proposition I. The Proposition reads: ''Shall a Local Law entitled A LOCAL LAW to amend the County Government Law of Nassau County in relation to the voting power of the Board of Supervisors be approved?'' The Propositon makes no other changes, either in the makeup, election, term of office or compensation of the Board of Supervisors. Therefore, a ''Yes'' vote is a vote to continue Nassau's economical Board of Supervisors government, which is still the most efficient form of county legislative government around. Best of all, it works! One has only to compare the annual operating costs of Nassau's six-member Board of Supervisors with Suffolk's 18-member County Legislature to realize that, from a taxpayer's standpoint, the Board is a legislative bargain. Consider this: The entire staff of the Nassau Board of Supervisors numbers only 32 persons, including the Supervisors, who serve a county population of 1,321,582. There are 99 persons on the Suffolk Legislature's payroll, serving a population smaller than Nassau's at more than twice the annual cost. Unfortunately, many voters tend to believe that any proposition at the top of the ballot will cost them more in tax money, if they vote to approve that proposition on Election Day. In this case, the reverse is true! If Nassau's taxpaying voters want to continue good county government and services, we urge them to vote ''Yes'' on the Proposition at the top of the ballot on Election Day, and tell their friends to vote ''Yes,'' too.!

675-> ALLEN PACES RAIDERS
Marcus Allen bounced back from an unproductive performance in Cincinnati last week to rush for 156 yards on 24 carries today as the Los Angeles Raiders held off the Seattle Seahawks, 28-23. Allen, held to no yards on eight carries during a loss to the Bengals, scored on runs of 2 and 3 yards against the Seahawks as the Raiders raised their record to 4-1. Seattle fell to 2-3. The Raiders rolled to a 28-0 lead after less than 23 minutes of play, scoring four touchdowns in 11 minutes 14 seconds. But the Seahawks made a game of it by scoring 16 points in the fourth quarter, only to fall short. Allen's 2-yard scoring run with 3:32 left in the first quarter opened the scoring. Los Angeles got its second score in the opening minute of the second quarter on a 1-yard run by Kenny King. It came two plays after a 44-yard pass-interference penalty against Don Dufek of the Seahawks moved the ball to the Seattle 1-yard line. Less than a minute later, Rod Martin intercepted a Jim Zorn pass and returned it 39 yards for the Raiders' third touchdown. Allen's second touchdown, which came with 7:18 remaining before halftime, came one play after Allen raced 53 yards. The rookie from Southern California gained 121 yards on 12 carries in the first half. The Seahawks, who had won both of their games since the season resumed last month following the 57-day players' strike, got their first touchdown with 1:11 remaining in the first half on a 10-yard pass from Zorn to Steve Largent. Theotis Brown scored on a 3-yard run for Seattle with 12:08 remaining one play after a 31-yard pass-interference penalty against Ted Watts. Zorn threw a 23-yard scoring pass to Roger Carr with 9:15 left and Norm Johnson kicked a 30-yard field goal with 4:51 to go. The Seahawks threatened to go ahead in the final two minutes. A 50-yard pass from Zorn to Carr put the ball at the Los Angeles 30. However, Burgess Owens of the Raiders intercepted a pass at the 3-yard line and Los Angeles ran out the clock. A crowd of only 42,170 attended the game at the Los Angeles Coliseum, where capacity for Raider games is about 73,000. There were 52,036 tickets sold and 9,866 no-shows.

677-> Noisy Struggle Over Silence
True, New Jersey's new law requiring public schools to start the day with a minute of silence says nothing about religion. Each student is free to use that 60-second span ''for quiet and private contemplation or introspection.'' Who can object to that? Governor Kean did, but his veto was overridden. Now his Attorney General, Irwin Kimmelman, says the law so clearly violates religious liberty that he won't defend it in court. The Governor's lawyer is surely right about the law's purpose, as betrayed by legislators in floor debate. It is a disguised attempt ''to bring prayer back through the front door,'' as one senator put it. Mr. Kimmelman insists that the law runs afoul of Supreme Court decisions against organized prayer and scripture reading in public schools. He may be wrong to claim a clear right and duty not to defend a law he considers unconstitutional, but it's odd to find the law's sponsors disputing that claim. Why do the legislators want their law defended by an Attorney General who advised that it be vetoed? Why not hire their own lawyer? That's what Congress is doing in a Supreme Court test of the legislative veto. The U.S. Attorney General, to his credit, insists Congress has no right to nullify executive actions without a proper law. Congress recognizes that he could not credibly defend its view. Doesn't New Jersey's Legislature want a more credible advocate than Mr. Kimmelman? Better still, why not get out of the business of legislating public morality and repeal this deceptive little law? If it were found constitutional, that would be only because the Legislature has trivialized religion by disguising it.

681-> CONGRESS; ALTERING THE WAY THE HOUSE OPERATES
The rules of the House of Representatives always represent a balancing act: the rights of the minority versus the rights of the majority; free discussion versus efficiency; individual independence versus party discipline. Now the Democrats in the House are proposing a series of rules changes that could significantly alter these equations in favor of the majority, efficiency and discipline. In their view, the whole way that Congress does business has to be streamlined, and their changes would make it more difficult for members to delay the House, or force it to vote on embarrassing or extraneous issues. ''The fact is, the House is not working very well,'' said Representative Gillis W. Long of Louisiana, chairman of the Democratic caucus, which adopted the rules changes last week. ''We do some of the same things over and over again. And that limits our ability to get to matters of pressing importance.'' G.O.P. Vows to Fight Changes But the Republicans have vowed to fight the proposed rules when they are considered by the House when the new Congress assembles next month. An unusual statement by the Republican party leadership in the House calls the changes ''an exercise in political expediency that will concentrate more power in the hands of the Speaker and further erode the democratic process in the House.'' Representative Long concedes that the Speaker's power will expand. He explains: ''No question, when you try to make the institution operate more efficiently you give someone more discretion or power.'' The drive to strengthen the House leadership was set off primarily by the success of right-wing single-issue groups that have forced Congress in recent years to vote repeatedly on such issues as abortion, school busing and school prayer. To many legislators, these are no-win issues they would rather avoid, and the Democrats' victories in last month's election emboldened them to seek solutions. One solution would change the way that Congress allocates money. Under current procedures, the first step is passage of an authorization bill, legislation that defines where money can be spent by various Government agencies. The second step is an appropriations bill, which decides how much can be spent. They Use Them as Vehicles In recent years, a growing number of legislators have used these appropriations bills as legislative vehicles. To take one example, the House adopted an amendment Thursday that would forbid the Justice Department to use any of its appropriated funds to pursue desegregation cases that might result in school busing. The Reagan Administration has no intention of pursuing such cases anyway, but similar riders in the Carter years significantly inhibited the Justice Department. Probably the best known of these riders has been the Hyde Amendment, which blocks the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortions for poor women. In the Vietnam War, critics of the war used riders on appropriations bills to slow down, and eventually terminate, the war effort. Under the rules suggested by the Democrats, riders on appropriations bill would no longer be permitted. The only exception would be if a majority of the House voted to open the bill for such amendments. Of course, any sort of amendment would still be in order on the original authorizing bill. And any change in the House rules would not affect the Senate, which has a tradition of unlimited debate and amendment on any legislation. Lott Sees 'Effort to Strangle' Still, the change would be significant. Supporters say it is essential for ''a more orderly process,'' in the words of Representative Martin Frost, the Texas Democrat who headed a committee that drafted the proposed rules. But critics like Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip, call it an attempt to ''strangle the opportunity for dissent.'' Mr. Lott recalled the use of riders in the Vietnam era and said: ''Liberals resent it when it is used for a conservative issue, but favor it for a liberal issue. It all depends on whose ox is being gored.'' Mr. Frost concedes that this is a ''valid argument'' and emphasizes: ''This provision cuts both ways, left and right. Everyone should understand that.'' The second major rules shift involves constitutional amendments. Now, if a proposed amendment is buried at the committee level by a hostile chairman, a majority of the House can force a floor vote on the proposal by signing what is called a discharge petition. Actual passage of the amendment, however, requires two-thirds of the House. Fright at Close Call This situation unfolded last summer when the House leadership tried to block an amendment requiring a balanced Federal budget. Supporters persuaded a majority of the House to sign a discharge petition and the amendment reached the floor. Eventually it failed to get a twothirds vote and did not pass, but Democratic leaders were ''scared to death'' by their close call, according to one lawmaker. As a result, the new rule would require the discharge petition to cover two-thirds of the House, or 290 signatures, an increase of 72. The net result would be to make it much easier for House leaders to thwart amendments, and Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who chairs the Judiciary Committee, makes no apologies. ''We're only insuring that the Constitution is not tampered with,'' he said. Some of the strongest opposition to this particular change, however, comes from Democrats such as Representative Don Edwards of California, perhaps the leading champion of civil liberties in the House. Mr. Edwards acknowledges that he has tried to bottle up proposed constitutional amendments he did not like, including the balanced budget concept. But he also feels that the discharge petition is a ''safety valve, a very democratic procedure'' that should remain unchanged. Knife Cuts Both Ways The discharge petition, like the appropriations rider, has been a liberal tool in other eras. And Representative Edwards points out that before this fall, the last amendment to reach the floor by the discharge route was the proposed equal rights amendment. Some of the other proposed changes are procedural. The Speaker of the House, for instance, would be allowed to waive certain votes that are regularly demanded by the minority as a way of delaying the session and informing their members of the daily schedule. Other changes are openly political. One would make it easier for either party to strip a member of his or her committee assignments, should that member switch parties in midsession. Another would bar Democrats from aiding Republicans in election campaigns for Federal office. The Republicans concede that they have little hope of blocking the rules changes, but they warn that some day, they might be in the majority. And should that day come, asserted Mr. Lott, the Democrats should expect ''no quarter.''

683-> News Summary; THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1982
International The Soviet-Chinese talks could lead to a mutual pullback of troops from the Soviet-Chinese border, according to Viktor G. Afanasyev, the editor of Pravda, who is a key member of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. His comment was reported by Japanese and Soviet journalists now conferring in Moscow. (Page A1, Column 6.) Reagan Administration strategists have privately expressed concern about the improving Soviet-Chinese relations. They believe that both nations are serious about easing tension along their long frontier and that this could lead to a mutual reduction of border forces. (A7:1-3.) Argentina rebuffed President Reagan in rejecting an offer to meet with its President during his coming visit to South America, according to sources in Brasilia and Washington. Brazilian officials acted as intermediaries in Mr. Reagan's initiative. (A1:3-4.) Washington urged Central America to bar the import of ''major offensive weapons'' and to reduce the number of foreign troops in the region. Secretary of State George P. Shultz also told the Organization of American States that it would be ''devastating'' if Latin American countries adopted protectionist policies because of their faltering economies. (A17:1-3.) National Edwin P. Wilson was found guilty of smuggling four pistols and an M-16 automatic rifle to Libyan agents overseas in 1979. Mr. Wilson, a former American intelligence agent who made millions of dollars selling arms, explosives and expertise to Libya, is being held on bail totaling $60 million and faces additional trials on Federal charges of aiding Libya. (A1:5.) Advancing the 1983 income tax cut is under increasing consideration in the Reagan Administration. President Reagan said he was weighing a request to Congress to move up the 10 percent personal income tax reduction to January from July in an effort to spur economic recovery. (A1:2.) A higher Federal gasoline tax is sought by Representative James J. Howard of New Jersey, who is chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee. He said he would urged Congress in its post-election session to approve a four-year highway and mass transit bill financed in part by increasing the Federal gasoline tax by 5 cents a gallon to 9 cents. (A19:1-3.) The 1982 Lasker Award for basic biomedical research was won by five scientists who have made key contributions to the understanding of how viruses are related to cancer. Two other scientists, whose pioneering studies have clarified the understanding and diagnosis of important groups of inherited diseases, shared the Lasker prize for clinical research. (A21:1.) The cause of Lyme disease has been identified, according to researchers. They say they believe it is a bacterium they isolated in the skin of patients. Lyme disease, which often causes debilitating arthritis and sometimes meningitis, became a disturbing medical mystery when it was first identified in 1975. (A1:3-5.) The right of Roman Catholic bishops to speak out on the issue of nuclear weapons was defended by 24 former Government officials, prominent scientists and scholars. In a letter, the group said, ''there is increasing evidence that we cannot rely on governments to act on this matter in a timely fashion.'' (A18:1.) Women's votes cost Republicans a few key elections this month, according to indications from polls conducted by the television networks among people who had just voted. While the number was small, party strategists are worried about the tendency of women to vote for Democrats more than men do. As Republican governors met in Kansas City, some defeated by women's votes, the issue stirred frustration, argument and concern about 1984. (B19:1-2.) Metropolitan City-state budget differences came to light as Mayor Koch released details of his plan for closing New York City's deficits over two fiscal years. In an immediate response, Comer S. Coppie, executive director of the state's Financial Control Board, said he opposed the plan and would recommend ''major changes.'' (A1:1.) A fire in a condemned tenement in Jersey City took the lives of six persons, including four children and their pregnant mother. Eight months ago, a judge ordered the family to leave the building because of many violations of fire and safety codes. (B1:5-6.) Nearly identical-size tokens have created a furor in New York City's Transit Authority. The new tokens issued for the Connecticut Turnpike, which can be purchased for 17 1/2 cents apiece, fit the turnstile slots in New York City's subways, where the fare is 75 cents. Connecticut paid $218,000 for the minting of 10 million tokens, has sold 40,000 of them and has no plans to halt the sales. (A1:1-2.) A black instructor denied tenure at the City University of New York has won the right to determine how two tenure committee members voted in an effort to find out whether he was a victim of racial discrmination. The instructor was upheld by a Federal Court of Appeals, which reversed a ruling by the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York that upheld the confidentiality of the tenure decision.

685-> Market Place; New Pressure On Utilities
WEAK industrial demand. Unseasonably warm weather. Consumers who cannot afford to pay their utility bills. Rising gas prices. All these factors are taking their toll on utilities. And some analysts say the outlook for most utility stocks - both gas and electric - looks rather dim. For the electric utilities, the decline shows up clearly in the industry's total sales. Sales of kilowatt-hours are expected to fall by about 1 1/2 percent this year - the first decline since before World War II. And since early August, notes John B. Kellenyi, a utilities analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert, electric utility stocks have risen only 15 percent, while Standard & Poor's index of 400 stocks is up 29 percent. ''The market was becoming overenthusiastic about the economy, and moving to stocks, like growth stocks and high-technology stocks, which give a big bang for the dollar,'' Mr. Kellenyi said. ''The utilities are fairly stable, and are not going to have a big earnings explosion.'' Ernest Liu, a senior utilities analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, is one of the analysts who have soured on utilities in recent months. ''Up until October, we'd been very positive on electric utility stocks; we'd been recommending them for 21 or 22 months straight,'' he said. ''But since October, we've been more guarded, and we're recommending that investors underweight them for the next six to 12 months or so. At this juncture, we believe things are slowing down.'' To some analysts, the prospects for gas utilities look even less bright than for the electrics. One of the biggest problems for the gas companies is the threat of losing sales as industrial users switch from gas to residual oil. Oil prices have declined several dollars a barrel in recent months, and many analysts predict a further drop. In contrast, gas prices - which are largely regulated - are expected to increase about 9 percent. ''We are now confronted with a battle for market share, as gas competes with alternative energy sources, and as the pipeline companies compete with each other,'' commented Ron Cassinari, a vice president and natural gas analyst at E.F. Hutton. ''That is not conducive to expansion of price-earnings multiples, so I'd be very selective about where I put new money.'' He noted that in the Middle West some industrial users of natural gas are being charged $4.85 or $4.90 per thousand cubic feet of gas, while they can buy a thousand cubic feet of residual oil for $4.25. ''There has already been a moderate amount of loss of industrial load,'' he said, ''but it is extremely difficult to determine how much of it is from users switching to oil, and how much is from the decline in economic activity.'' The economic slowdown appears to be taking the greatest toll on utilities in the industrial Middle West. Uncollected bills and service shut-offs have risen at many utilities. Loss of industrial business is hurting more than the problems with individual consumers. To some extent, however, rate increases have made up for sales losses. At Consumers Power Company in Jackson, Mich., for example, shutoffs of electric service through November of this year were 12 percent higher than in the comparable period in 1981. Industrial sales - measured in the number of kilowatt-hours sold - were down 9.2 percent this year. In Consumers' gas division, sales to industrial customers are down 12 percent, but revenues are off only 3 percent because of higher rates. As for residential customers, sales are up 2.5 percent, while revenues are up 20 percent, because of the rate increases. In New York, on the other hand, where the economy has suffered less than in other parts of the country, Consolidated Edison has so far experienced ''no significant increases in outstanding bills or in turnoffs,'' according to Daniel Walden, a company spokesman. And at Brooklyn Union Gas, Robert Loftus, a company spokesman, said that while unpaid bills are up slightly from last year, they have fallen as a proportion of total sales. If there is one bright spot for the utilities, it is that their yields are looking increasingly attractive, particularly as interest rates fall. Mr. Liu noted that yields on electric utility stocks were now about 10.7 percent, ''and I think those kinds of yields will continue to hold,'' he said. Mr. Cassinari holds a similar view for the natural gas utilities. ''Natural gas utility dividends are absolutely secure,'' he said, ''and we will continue to see increases, although not on the order of magnitude seen over the last five years.''

686-> AROUND THE WORLD; Let Mrs. Bhutto Go, Pakistani Doctors Urge
A medical board has recommended to Pakistan's military Government that Nusrat Bhutto, the ailing widow of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, be allowed to go abroad for treatment for suspected lung cancer, her doctor said today. Mr. Bhutto was hanged in April 1979. Dr. Abdul Hye Saeed said the state medical board recommended that Mrs. Bhutto, 53 years old, should be sent abroad for treatment ''as soon as possible.'' But the board's chairman, Maj. Gen. Iqbal Mohammad Chaudhry, refused to disclose the findings, which he said would be sent to the Government. Two board members visited Mrs. Bhutto in the hospital today where she is under intensive care after collapsing at her home on Wednesday. She applied for travel permission in August and the Government set up a medical board last month to examine her request.

687-> TV VIEW; 'THE LAST WORD' OFTEN DOESN'T SAY MUCH
The first word about ''The Last Word,'' ABC's new hour-long midnight entry, is, it's a magazine show. But what sort of magazine? Partisan Review? Vogue? Country Life? A hint is provided by the Art Deco frame of the title, which calls to mind some minor magazines that were published between the declining years of Art Deco and the surging years of television. One of the more popular of them was Coronet, a pocket-sized effort to attract readers who found the Reader's Digest too demanding. In basic ways, the late-night television show is the incarnation for our time of the late magazine. The star of ''The Last Word'' is Phil Donahue, coming to us from Chicago. In a sort of preliminary bout, he engages that evening's experts, who represent opposing sides of an issue; then, in his inimitable manner, he bounds like an animal trainer among the ordinary Chicagoans in the studio, lashing about with his microphone, prodding, provoking, shocking the creatures through his hoop. The more impassioned their reactions, the more successful his act. Such is the role that has earned him celebrity. After a quarter-hour of his sort of commotion, things quiet down a bit as Greg Jackson takes over. Having demonstrated as the invisible interlocutor on the lamented CBS Cable's ''Signature'' that he is capable of conducting sustained exchanges, Jackson is now reduced to serving as a bridge between viewers and experts. His guests are with him in the studio or televised in from around the country, from exotic places like San Quentin penitentiary when possible. And then there are the other guests: the call-ins. Jackson serves as translator of their questions to the experts, his task being to juice up the give-and-take. No sooner does he manage to stimulate an interesting answer, however, then he must accept another telephone call or pause for a couple of commercials; instead of follow-up, there is break-away. This jerky pace gives an impression of energy and strains no attention span. A dash of leavening, like a discussion of Vietnam veterans, may be dropped into the show, but most of the hour is taken up with sizzlers like Tylenol, spies, burglars, artificial insemination (with a reallife artificially conceived baby on screen), religion in the schools - much the sort of story that was featured month after month on the cover of Coronet, which depended for its circulation on newsstand sales. Now and then, the producers score a coup, combining, for example, sex and crime in stories about conjugal visits for prisoners and homosexual rape behind the bars. One can understand why the National Enquirer is buying commercial time on this show. Coronet was always a cut or two below the giant popular magazines of its time - a touch more titillating, a bit more simplistic, better at blurbs than at content. On ''The Last Word,'' Jackson supplies the blurbs as lead-ins to the show. One night, for example, he tantalized with the promise of a former spy who had been ''nose to nose against the Russians''; the actual interview contained no hint of intimate acquaintance with the K.G.B., much less any nose rubbing. In his announcement of the conjugal visitation segment, Jackson played up the subject of homosexual rape, although it was not to receive their full attention until the following night. Just as Coronet was wont to feature instantly recognizable names, particularly from Hollywood, so now we have Donahue discussing the nuclear freeze with Paul Newman and Charlton Heston. Oh, for those innocent times when magazines invaded merely the sex lives of film stars and left their minds alone. A favored ploy of Coronet was the use of scare phrases to lend an aura of portent to its prodigiously ordinary stories. So, now, Donahue, in discussing a ''genius sperm bank'' with the reasonableseeming doctor who runs it, tossed in the name of Adolf Hitler and his master-race theories to heat up the studio audience. When the conversation with the doctor became too sensible, Donahue opened the cage of his Chicagoans. It's a letters-to-the-editor column come to jabbering life. The call-ins from viewers are less frenetic, probably because they are removed from the Donahue presence. Finally, what makes this new television series and the old magazine cousins under their different kinds of skin is the attitude toward their audiences. Coronet's buyers could read - if without much joy in the task. It was therefore important that every article captured the attention fast but never imposed upon it. Those four- and five-minute segments on ''The Last Word'' are modeled on the old editing strategy of keeping pieces short and punchy. The nightly subjects of the television show -crime, money, religion, sex (in a mild form), children, health - were the staples of Coronet as well, and usually the promise exceeds what is delivered. So now, on ''The Last Word,'' the discussion of spying was familiar; a panel on political-action groups was nearly incoherent; the interviews with inmates and their wives were predictable; the burglars on burglary were silly - a case of con men pulling a new con, with Jackson's solicitous cooperation; the actors on a nuclear freeze were show biz. In its striving for flash and speed, the program, like the magazine, has no time for complexity or nuance. The great trick of mass communications, like the shadier kinds of mass merchandising, is to pull the customer in, make the sale and get him onto something else before he has a chance to be disappointed with what he's just bought. Did such a magazine, does such a television magazine mislead more than it informs? At their best, both can deliver bits of information and opinion in palatable form, like orange-flavored vitamins for the kids. Only often, there's no vitamin beneath the flavoring. The audience that sustained Coronet moved swiftly to television. Why not? Here was a medium that could offer everything the magazine offered - and far more vividly. ''The Last Word'' is able to pander to its much larger audience to a degree that no magazine editor could match. Using the wonders of television and telephone, the show turns the viewers themselves into stars of the occasion. This enables Donahue and Jackson to become tribunes of the people. Whereas Coronet presented its experts respectfully, if sometimes simple-mindedly, they often beard the experts, bringing them down a peg with skeptical questions and attitudes. There is something appealingly democratic about this sort of pop populism, but also something demagogic. At the same time that citizens in the studio and at home are invited to express real concerns, they are also prodded to vent or invent irritations, suspicions, prejudices. The effect, particularly of the Donahue sections, is to sanction the ordinary Joe's mistrust of knowledge and credentials, to flatter his ignorance, to confuse common sense with common foolishness. It comes as a relief when Donahue tries to provoke a member of the audience into some high-pitched response only to be told that the issue doesn't really matter all that much. You can't agitate all of the people all of the time.

688-> AROUND THE WORLD; Frankfurt Police Seize 2 Guerrilla Suspects
The West German police today arrested two of the most wanted guerrillas from the Baader-Meinhof gang, both suspects in the attempted assassination of Gen. Frederick J. Kroesen last year, the authorities said. A spokesman for the Federal Criminal Bureau said the police arrested Brigitte Mohnhaupt, 33 years old, and Adelheid Schulz, 27, in Frankfurt. He said he could not comment on the nature of their arrest for ''tactical reasons.'' The police said after the arrests that they had stepped up their search for Christian Klar, the only Baader-Meinhof gang leader still at large. Miss Mohnhaupt and Miss Schulz are suspected of kidnapping and murdering Hanns Martin Schleyer in 1977. Miss Schulz is also suspected of involvement in the murder of Jurgen Ponto in August 1977.

689-> BUSINESS PEOPLE; New G.E. Officer Strong On Strategic Planning
Michael A. Carpenter thinks that strategic planning at a lot of companies adds up to little more than paper shuffling. He describes it as ''something they do every September, and then the rest of the time they run the company.'' As a vice president and director at the Boston Consulting Group, the 35-year-old Mr. Carpenter has striven to make strategic planning more a part of actual management. Now Mr. Carpenter has been named vice president in charge of corporate business development and planning at the General Electric Company, considered one of the premier strategic planning companies in the country. He succeeds Daniel J. Fink, who retired several months ago. Soon after his graduation from Harvard Business School in 1973, Mr. Carpenter joined Boston Consulting, where he has worked with a mixed bag of companies. ''My orientation has been how do you get things done in an organizational structure,'' he said, ''ranging from helping companies dispose of parts of their organizations to helping the chairman understand how the communications process impacts the strategies to be implemented. Mr. Carpenter never did consulting for G.E., though he has, over the years, met several times with John F. Welch, G.E.'s chairman, who offered Mr. Carpenter the job. What will Mr. Carpenter be doing? ''The primary emphasis,'' he said, ''is the creative use of strategic approaches to identify new opportunities for the company - either internally or through acquisitions. I think there's a second responsibility - to be a sounding board to the chief executive on whatever he feels like sounding on. A third responsibility is the ongoing development of the strategic process at G.E.'' Mr. Carpenter, who away from planning characterizes himself as a ''bad sailor and a bad skier,'' reports to G.E. on Feb. 1. He expects the environment to be inviting. ''It's a very analytical culture, rather than a shoot-from-the hip culture,'' he said. ''That's very in tune with my experience.'' N.R. Kleinfield

693-> Wider Budget Deficits Seen
Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that her forecast of budget deficits of $155 billion in each of the next three years ''already looks a little optimistic.'' The latest forecast by the budget office, she said, ''which already looks a little optimistic, projects a steady annual deficit of about $155 billion for 1983, '84 and '85 - not counting approximately $20 billion a year in spending that doesn't show up in the budget.'' The director said in an interview in U.S. News & World Report that the large deficits would persist even if the economy enjoyed sustained growth because Federal taxes had been cut more than probable expenditures. She said further budget-cutting would be difficult because programs for the poor had undergone extensive trimming. ''To make substantial reductions, you have to go after the big growth items that so far have not been touched - defense and Social Security, plus related pensions and Medicare,'' she added.

694-> GOING OUT GUIDE
TOUCH OF GOTHAM Amid the jewels of the diamond-trade block on 47th Street, the Gotham Book Mart & Gallery is a gem of a bookshop, a store at No. 41 West (719-4448) that is strong on works of belles-lettres and theater, a shop that radiates a fine literary, cultured air. The gallery is one flight up from the store, and its windows look out on the specialized commerce of the street, but on the inside the large room has a particularly warm and festive feeling that reflects the season. This is imparted by the annual show of rare Christmas tree ornaments, hundreds of bright and clever baubles created to hang from the limbs of the living-room fir. There is a ceiling-high tree in the center of the room, and it is adorned with myriad objects, the larger ones toward the bottom, the smaller toward the top; among them is a sled, a Santa ascending in a balloon, all manner of cunningly wrought miniature pieces. In showcases along the walls are fish, old airplanes, boats, a locomotive, angels, many, many dolls and objects in metal, paper and ceramics, including Dresden pieces. Open, free, through Jan. 8, from 10 A.M. to 6:30 P.M., Mondays through Saturdays and, next Sunday only, from noon to 5 P.M. CUBAN FLOURISH The Repertorio Espanol is one of New York's major and older Spanish-language theatrical companies. performing in the neat, intimate Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street (889-2850). Over the years, it has given New Yorkers productions of Spanish classics, and it has done newer plays in Spanish and even some translated from English. Tonight it is starting something altogether new for itself. The Reportorio is opening ''Havana Sings,'' its first musical anthology, a program of more than 40 songs by Cuban composers and lyricists done by nine singers with piano accompaniment by Pablo Zinger. The show, conceived and directed by Rene Buch, the company's artistic director, is divided into three parts. First are pop tunes; second are classical treatments of folk music, including Cuba's first known song. In the third section, the air will ring with arias and duets from Cuban zarzuela. It is a staged production, with costumes, lighting and slides of paintings by Cuban artists who live in New York. At 8 tonight, next Friday and Saturday, and at 3 P.M. on Dec. 26 and 29. Further performances are also scheduled in the repertory program. Admission: $8. BENEFIT Eartha Kitt, who is no stranger to holding an audience all by her own talents, is the entire cast of a benefit tonight at 9 at Greenwich Village's Top of the Gate, 160 Bleecker Street, at Thompson Street, in behalf of a beleaguered institution on the other side of town. Miss Kitt will entertain folk in her high-voltage way, singing and chatting, to help the Henry Street Settlement's Louis Abrons Arts for Living Center in the Lower East Side on Grand Street, which had been closed for lack of money. The actress will be the highlight of the evening, but there will be another high note sharing the bill: an announcement that ways have been found to reopen the west wing of the center, which houses the music school, and that the arts, still in need of saving, have been salvaged, at least for the moment. Admission: $30, $50, $100. Information: 766-9200, ext. 214. MORE TRADITION The New Amsterdam Theater Company is a nonprofit group that is out to collect, preserve and perform vintage American musicals, and it is starting its second season with a one-shot concert version, boasting a notable cast, of Victor Herbert's Irish operetta, ''Eileen'' tonight at 8 at Town Hall, 123 West 43d Street (840-2824). This is the first professional New York presentation of the show since it opened at the Shubert Theater in 1917, according to its producers. E.G. Marshall and Maureen O'Sullivan will narrate the story, while the music is being made by such voices as those of Frances Sternhagen, Cris Groenendaal, Judy Kaye, Roderick Cook, Jeanne Lehman, Mark Jacoby, Lisby Larson, Vernon Hartman and Jack Dabdoub. Behind them is a 30-piece orchestra and a 30-voice chorus, directed by Evans Haile. The Glee Club of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, which Herbert started in 1914, will join in the finale. Admission: $12.50 and $16.50. The company plans to continue the season with concert versions of Rudolf Friml's ''The Firefly'' and the Romberg-Gershwin musical, ''Rosalie.''

695-> McDonald's 'First' to Close
McDonald's plans to abandon the place where it all started - a small hamburger stand with a pair of golden arches that has become a landmark in the northwest Chicago suburbs. The 27-year-old stand will be closed next year because ''we don't have enough physical space to offer modern conveniences for customers,'' Win Christiansen, the corporation's Chicago-area vice president, said. A new facility, to be opened in June, will be built across the street. The franchise's owners said they had not decided whether the old building would be demolished. ''I imagine some people will be upset, but I'm sure some of its immedidate neighbors will be happy to see it go,'' said Mayor John Seitz, explaining that the new restaurant will not back up against homes as the old one did.

696-> MET PLANS BIG SHOW BY MOORE
Henry Moore, long regarded as one of the most distinguished of living sculptors, will be the subject of a major retrospective exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum next spring. Scheduled to open next May 14 and to run through late September, ''The World of Henry Moore'' is being organized by William S. Lieberman, chairman of the department of 20th-century art at the museum and a lifelong friend of the artist. It will include direct carvings in stone and wood, cast bronzes, both large and small, and a substantial group of drawings. The work will range in date over a period of almost 60 years, from the mid-1920's until the present. The exhibition has been made possible by a grant from the Gould Inc. Foundation of Chicago. William T. Ylvisaker, chairman and chief executive officer of Gould Inc., said: ''As a company that has placed the highest priority on creativity and originality in our corporate life, we are proud to be associated with Henry Moore and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in their presentation of the first major Moore retrospective in the United States in over 35 years.'' 1946 Retrospective Recalled It was in 1946 in the immediate aftermath of World War II that Henry Moore's reputation in this country was consolidated by a retrospective exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. This was followed over the next three decades and more by a long series of comparable exhibitions that may be said to have culminated in a comprehensive survey in Florence in the summer of 1972. Honors of every kind - official, institutional, academic - have come his way from many parts of the world, and not least in his native England, where he holds both the Order of Merit and the barely less prestigious Companionship of Honor. Now in his 85th year, Henry Moore remains remarkably active. Though no longer quite so vigorous in the domain of direct sculpture, he has a considerable activity both as draftsman and as printmaker. Since the establishment some years ago of the Henry Moore Foundation, he has also given a considerable amount of time and thought to the ordering and eventual distribution of what is known to be one of the largest bodies of work in all media ever produced by a sculptor of the first rank. This month he was present at the inauguration by the Queen of England of the Henry Moore Sculpture Center at the art gallery in his native city of Leeds, England. The museum has invited him to attend the opening of his show.

697-> Bridge: Hyper-Modern Bid Seems Reminiscent of Early Days
A hyper-modern style of bidding in competitive auctions, popular in the expert ranks, is known as ''negative free bids.'' Suppose that your partner opens one club, the next player bids one spade and you hold: S 4 3 H A Q 10 7 4 2 D J 8 6 C 5 2 A traditional bidder has trouble with this hand, for he does not have the high-card strength to justify a forcing bid of two hearts. The modern bidder is better off. He makes a negative double, implying some hearts, and hopes to be able to bid two hearts on the next round. Unfortunately for him, the opponents raise spades and make it inconvenient to show the heart suit. The hyper-modern style is to bid two hearts, nonforcing. It suggests a moderate hand with heart length. If the hand is strong enough to insist on a game, the choice lies between a jump to three hearts and a negative double. A double followed by a heart bid shows a strong hand and is forcing. This is, up to a point, a throwback to the earliest days of contract bridge. In 1930 a simple response of two hearts to one spade, with or without an overcall, was not forcing. The wheel has turned full circle. This is illustrated by the diagramed deal, from the recent final of the Harter Cup, a New York knockout team event limited to players below life master rank. The winners, by a margin of 13 international match points, were Larry Gutman, Philip Silverstein, Rod Salazar, Jim Chin, Paul Burleson and Sandy Friedman. They are all members of the Academy of Bridge, 210 East 57th Street, and are trained by the club's proprietor, Saul Bronstein. When Salazar and Chin held the North-South cards, they arrived as shown in four spades. This might well have ended the bidding, but East took an aggressive position by doubling, giving his partner a chance. West should now have bid five hearts, expecting his partner to have a strong hand short in spades, but he passed. After some defenses, South would have been able to score an overtrick. But West led the club queen, and now an attempt to collect an overtrick would have led to defeat: A heart play, aiming at a ruff, would have permitted West to score two club ruffs. But South knew his business and simply drew trumps to make his contract and a score of 790. In the replay, however, Gutman and Silverstein as East-West were playing negative free bids and West felt able to bid his hearts at the three-level. East naturally bid five hearts over four spades, and when this ended the bidding, the Gutman team had scored a game in each room, winning 16 points. NORTH (D) S A J 5 H 7 D J 10 7 6 2 C A J 4 3 WEST EAST S 10 6 2 S 7 H K 10 8 6 5 4 H A Q J 3 D Q 8 3 D A K 9 4 C Q C 9 8 6 2 SOUTH S K Q 9 8 4 3 H 9 2 D 5 C K 10 7 5 Both sides were vulnerable. The bidding: North East South West Pass 1 D 2 S Pass 4 S Dbl. Pass Pass Pass West led the club queen.

698-> BATTLE FOR A FRENCH CONTRACT
Three sophisticated aircraft, two American and one the product of an Anglo-French collaboration, are competing for a multimillion-dollar French contract that may be the United States aviation industry's last big military sales opportunity in Europe for some time. The contract is to supply France with airborne radar, which would give advance warning of attacking planes, missiles, ships and tanks. The need for such so-called Eye-in-the-Sky planes, military experts say, has been underscored by the recent wars in Lebanon and the Falkland Islands. In Lebanon, the Israelis used airborne radar to guide their fighters, which shot down more than 100 Syrian MIG's, and to locate antiaircraft missile bases, which were then destroyed. In the Falklands, Britain's lack of such a system cost it the destroyer Sheffield and the cargo ship Atlantic Conveyor, both of which were struck by French-built Exocet missiles fired from Argentine jets beyond the range of the British fleet's radar. System Called 'Indispensable' ''Every army needs airborne radar these days, and if you're committed to an independent defense policy it's indispensable,'' said Pierre Lelouche, a defense analyst at the Institute Fran,cais des Relations Internationales, a French foreign policy research group. The American competitors for the contract are the Boeing Company and the Grumman Corporation. Boeing's contender is its Awacs, or airborne warning and control system, plane. It is a silver 707 jet with a huge mushroom-shaped radar antenna on top of the fuselage. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has already ordered 18, at a total cost of $1.8 billion, to follow military movements behind the Iron Curtain, and other orders have come from the United States armed forces and Saudi Arabia. Grumman's contender is the Hawkeye E-2C, a propeller-driven aircraft that also has a mushroom antenna. The plane, which the Israelis used in Lebanon, was originally developed for the United States Navy. The dark horse in the race is called the ''European alternative,'' and frequently appears when a European country is thinking of buying expensive high-technology equipment from the United States. In this case, the idea is to turn France's requirement to the profit of European industry by putting a radar developed by Britain's Marconi Avionics into a French-built Transall military transport aircraft. 'It Will Be Costly' ''The radar is the most modern there is and the Transall is an ideal carrier, but it will be costly to do,'' warned Jacques Hublot, director of the Transall program at Aerospatiale, the French stateowned aerospace company. Adding urgency to the efforts by Boeing and Grumman to land the contract is the belief that airborne radar is one of the few areas where American military aircraft makers still have a chance of making sales in Western Europe. In 1978, General Dynamics won what some consider the ''defense contract of the century,'' selling some $2 billion worth of F-16 fighters to the Belgian, Dutch, Danish and Norwegian air forces to replace their aging Lockheed Starfighters. But West Germany and Italy are replacing their Starfighters with the Tornado, jointly developed with Britain, and the three countries are now offering this fighter to Spain in competition with McDonnell Douglas's F-18, and to Greece as an alternative to the F-16. The battle for France's radar-plane contract is being waged on two fronts - performance and cost. Boeing believes that France could meet its requirements with three Awacs, although it is offering a five-and six-plane package as well. Each plane, executives say, costs about $80 million. Ground equipment, a flight simulator and maintainence facilities, however, more than double the figure. Boeing's Inducements But last month, the company told 60 French industrialists that it would place $105 million worth of subsidiary contracts in France if it won the order. It said it would also place contracts worth $250 million for other work. In addition, Boeing is sweetening its offer by proposing to fit the planes with the CFM-56 jet engine, jointly built by France's Snecma and General Electric, instead of the Pratt & Whitney TF-53. For its part, Grumman has chopped its initial price for four of the Hawkeyes plus all support and maintenance by $40 million, to a total of $354 million, and offered to provide an equivalent amount of business for French industry, either by placing orders in France or by helping French companies get new orders abroad.

699-> AROUND THE WORLD; 'All Lies,' Soviet Attache Says of Spying Charges
The Soviet naval attache expelled from Britain for spying flew home to Moscow today, insisting that the allegations against him were ''all lies.'' The attache, Capt. Anatoly Pavlovich Zotov, boarded an Aeroflot flight at Heathrow Airport clutching a bag of Christmas gifts. His departure came two days after the Foreign Office announced his expulsion for ''engaging in activities incompatible with his status'' - diplomatic language for spying. The naval attache, given until Wednesday to leave, said his wife was already in Moscow. Captain Zotov, who had previously refused to comment on the allegations, told reporters as he hurried to his flight that the charges were ''without foundation.'' ''It's all lies - a fiction,'' Captain Zotov said as he hurried to his flight. ''These allegations are a total invention.'' Captain Zotov remained silent, however, when asked if he knew Geoffrey Prime, a former employee at Britain's top-secret communications headquarters at Cheltenham. Newspapers speculated Captain Zotov had been identified by Mr. Prime, who was sentenced last month to 35 years in jail for spying for the Soviet Union.

700-> 20 Dead in Panic At Moscow Game
More than 20 persons were killed and dozens were injured in a panic at Lenin Stadium after a game between Dutch and Soviet soccer teams last Wednesday, Soviet sources said today. The accident reportedly occurred on an icy ramp at the stadium, the main site of the 1980 Olympics. The Soviet team, Moscow Spartak, won by 2-0, scoring the final goal in the last second. Many spectators who had already left their seats tried to return when they heard cheers marking the last goal, the sources said. They ran into other spectators coming down the ramp, a panic ensued, and many were crushed. Soviet authorities almost never comment on such accidents, and so the official silence on the number killed or injured is not unusual.

701-> Primitive Peoples
To the Editor: We object unequivocally to the treatment of primitive peoples as presented in the articles, ''Venturing Into the Primitive World'' (Travel, Oct. 10). As anthropologists with a combined field experience of over 50 years in varied parts of the world, we were offended by the imperial condescension of the touristic perspective pursued in the articles, namely, primitive areas approached as living museums for the curious observer - complete with tour-leading anthropologists and deluxe accommodations in the villages and/or on ships offshore. But not a word about the way in which such people have been, and continue to be, ravaged by Western genocidal and ethnocidal practices, and not a word about the determining political configurations of the areas involved. he pieces are therefore distorted on several different counts: First, with reference to the obvious misuse of anthropology and anthropologists; second, with reference to the omission of the actual political, cultural and existential conditions of the peoples involved; and, third, with reference to the reduction of human cultures to mere objects of a disengaged curiosity (one tour actually links anthropology and ornithology). Of course, such conceptions are fully in accord with the general debasement of culture, and attitudes toward culture, in contemporary industrial civilization at large. However, the concentrated reflection of these attitudes in the feature article in question deserves special condemnation. We are, it goes without saying, appalled by the role that anthropologists and ''distinguished'' anthropological institutions have played in these exploitative enterprises no matter what the economic compulsion. STANLEY DIAMOND Professor of Anthropology The New School for Social Research New York DELL HYMES President, American Anthropological Association and Dean, School of Education, University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia (The letter was also signed by five other professors of anthropology.)

702-> CANADIAN DOCTOR CAMPAIGNS FOR NATIONAL ABORTION CLINICS
A 59-year-old physician who has successfully challenged Canadian antiabortion laws in Roman Catholic Quebec is promoting the establishment of abortion clinics for the rest of Canada. The physician, Dr. Henry Morgentaler, once permitted a television crew to film him performing an illegal abortion, and he subsequently spent 10 months in prison before his sentence was overturned. He is now campaigning for clinics in all major Canadian centers to bypass what he views as a cumbersome, discriminatory and dangerous procedure for legal abortions. The physician has been advising a Toronto group on starting a clinic like the one he built in Montreal. Such free-standing clinics are technically illegal. ''After Toronto we would like to see walkin clinics in Winnipeg and wherever there is a need,'' he said. He has also declared himself willing to offer abortions on demand regardless of legal curbs, which has provoked outrage from abortion foes. Among the attacks was a large cartoon in The Toronto Sun showing him in a cemetery digging graves for small coffins. Law Allows Abortions in Hospitals In an interview at his home in Montreal, Dr. Morgentaler said that Canadian law permits abortions in hospitals if special committees in the institutions ''determine that there is a threat to the health or life of the woman.'' He said, however, that ''about half the hospitals, including the Catholic ones, have no committees and perform no abortions.'' ''Of the others,'' he said, ''some are extremely conservative and timid, turning down most applicants, while a few are quite liberal. The result is that wealthy women travel to the U.S. while poor women are forced to have unwanted children.'' Dr. Morgentaler says he takes strength from a recent Gallup poll showing that more than 75 percent of the sample believed that abortion was a private matter of choice. Long before such publicopinion polls, he said, he was confident there was great popular support for his position despite the opposition of church and state, and he based his basic strategy on this belief. By May 13, 1973, when Dr. Morgentaler was shown on nationwide television performing an abortion, he had already provoked the authorities with his often-repeated assertion of having completed 5,000 illegal operations. As he expected he was charged and tried, and as he expected he was acquitted by a jury. ''It was quite remarkable,'' he recalled. ''In Quebec, I, an atheistic Jew who would not swear on the Bible, was acquitted by a Catholic jury. I knew they would not convict a man who was simply practicing medicine to aid others without gain.'' Verdict Set Aside But under Canadian criminal law, the prosecution can appeal a jury acquittal. An appellate tribunal not only set aside the verdict, but, as was then possible, also substituted its own ruling of guilty and sent him to prison for 18 months. After 10 months, the Supreme Court of Canada overturned the appellate decision and ordered another jury trial. He was again acquitted, and he has since run his clinic unhindered in Quebec.

703-> RECESSION'S IMPERFECTIONS AS A 'THERAPY'
To the Editor: Mr. Safire is consistent. Earlier in the year (''In Praise of Recession,'' column Feb. 8), he explained that ''the recession strategy (don't call it that!) must be maintained'' and that ''we may vilify Paul Volcker's villainy to our hearts' content, but we must not quit while we are winning.'' Now the battle is apparently over; the ''disciplinary therapy'' (we can call it that) has done wonderful things (''The Recession Speaks,'' column Dec. 13). Inflation rates are lower and falling; a chastened and more tractable work force is going to put out an honest day's effort without making exorbitant wage demands; firms have become tougher and leaner, and the unfit have been purged; the virtues of thrift are once again celebrated, and people are encouraged to save; and the capital markets can now channel such savings to their most productive uses. As Robert Solow said of Milton Friedman, I wish I could be as sure of anything as Mr. Safire is of everything. His description of recessions as tonics ridding the economy of its excesses and bad ways is incomplete. That wonderful disciplinary therapy ensnares all within its net, the virtuous and efficient as well as the inept, unwise and lazy. The financial shocks it administers, its sapping of confidence in the future, the polarized society it creates, the cumulative impact of spreading economic weakness as falling output and income chase each other downward, and the incipient dangers from a faltering and vulnerable world economy - these too must be put in the balance. What gives Mr. Safire such confidence that rapid economic growth will be so easily resumed? Let him instead hope that institutional reforms and wiser economic policies have immunized us against further economic debacle and panic. And if somehow rapid and sustainable economic growth is resumed, what is to prevent all those troublesome old habits and behavioral excesses from re-emerging? Once the disciplinary therapy of persistent, large-scale unemployment is not present, are we not back at square one? Mr. Safire should confront these unpleasant realities rather than continue to live in his Panglossian economic dream world. MARVIN E. ROZEN, Professor of Economics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa., Dec. 14, 1982

704-> AT TWO PARTIES, ROYAL ACCENTS
There's a season for almost everything, from soft-shell crabs to skiing, and heaven forbid that New York revelers take a back seat to shellfish or a pair of slats. There is, therefore, a social season and right now is it. For the dedicated, whose lives revolve around what is known as the scene, there are two, three and four events to be seen at, if not necessarily to enjoy, each night. Some of the merry-go-round is also a matter of noblesse oblige - you go to my charity party and I'll go to yours, and never shall we spend a night at home. This week there were two events, among the scores that competed for attention, that couldn't miss. Both featured royalty, a magnet that even the jaded can't resist. The parties were also a study in contrasts. The first, held at the Pierre Hotel Tuesday night, was sponsored by the Swedish Council of America and the guest list included most of the area's Swedish establishment. It was, despite the presence of King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, a low-key evening. The jewelry was discreet and if the designers had relied on this party for their trade, they would have starved. These were women with other things on their minds, who happily admitted that their dresses had been made by a ''dressmaker'' or bought off the rack. An exception was Margaretha Javits, who wore a Pauline Trigere but recovered her status by noting that it was 15 years old. At the Waldorf-Astoria Wednesday night it was, one might say, another cup of aquavit. In fact it was Spanish wine, as it would be at a salute to Spanish-speaking nations, given by the Spanish Institute and underwritten by Loewe, a Spanish leather company. The honored guests in this case were the Count of Barcelona, father of the King of Spain, and the Infanta Dona Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz, sister of the King, and her husband, the Duke of Badajoz. The Spanish gala was anything but low key. There were jewels that probably could have floated De Lorean Motor Cars Ltd., dresses that depleted bank accounts by four figures, coiffures that defied gravity and vast expanses of highly visible bosoms, shoulders and backs, broken only by the rays being shot off by the gems. An All-Star Cast There was also, as these things go, an all-star cast made up of diplomats to Washington and the United Nations, French royalty and nobility in the persons of Princess Chantal and her husband, Baron Francois de Sambucy, other assorted European royalty and nobility, and most of the better-known names of the international set from Caracas to Palm Beach. Two of the most glittering guests were American-born Aline, the Countess of Romanones, whose black and white dress couldn't compete with her famous emeralds and diamonds, and Mimi Herrera of Caracas who wore her emeralds with a shocking pink dress that was attached to what might have been the biggest bow ever made. Not quite as glittering, but not to be ignored, was Naty, the Duchess of Feria, in a Valentino dress with a decolletage that was, to say the least, both reckless and mesmerizing. There were, too, Marcella Perez de Cuellar, wife of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in a dress with a hand-appliqued skirt and bird-of-paradise collar, Candace Van Alen in black and feathers, Princess Christina of Bavaria, the Countess de Odiel, in ruffled and rustling green silk by Francisco Delgado of Madrid, and Carroll Petrie in a pink ruffled-back Givenchy. Chantal de Nora's black dress by Dior was worn with a stole punctuated by black and red bows, and Paloma Picasso was the sleekest woman in the ballroom in black satin by Yves Saint Laurent.

705-> THE WORLD IN SUMMARY; Chemical War In Afghanistan
While State Department officials charged for the second time last week that the Soviet Union was using chemical weapons in Afghanistan, the United Nations General Assembly demanded for the fourth time that the Russians get out of that country altogether. Moscow denied the former and dismissed the latter. Secretary of State George P. Schultz cited a 12-page Government report as evidence of the Soviet Union's ''illegal use of chemical and toxin weapons'' in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia. The report, an expansion of charges made in March, was based on interviews with survivors of attacks, analyses of their blood and urine, autopsies of several victims and accounts by medical personnel in refugee camps. Dr. Sharon Watson, an expert on mycotoxins at the Armed Forces Medical Center, said the effects of an apparently new Soviet-made toxin were ''horrible.'' The poison killed at least 73 people, 13 of them children, near Kabul in September, the State Department said, and the victims' skin began to decompose as little as one hour after death. Officials said the report, which was submitted to Congress and the United Nations, was aimed at increasing pressure on the Russians. It seemed likely, however, that the toxin condemnation would be no more effective than United Nations' latest demand - in a 114 to 21 vote - for an immediate Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Still, officials in Moscow have voiced support for phased pullout along lines proposed in a U.N. plan that is taking shape in ongoing talks with Pakistan and Afghanistan.

707-> NUCLEAR FREEZE: THE CASE FOR AN AMERICAN 'YES'
To the Editor: As Americans deeply concerned about the threat the nuclear arms race poses to our nation's security and survival, we must express our profound disagreement with your Oct. 24 editorial ''Against the Freeze Referendums.'' From our collective professional experience in helping to formulate U.S. arms control, intelligence and foreign and defense policy, we are convinced that a nuclear weapons freeze followed by major reductions is negotiable and verifiable and is in the best security interests of our nation and the world. You argue that negotiation of a freeze ''would inevitably waste much of the work already done over many years'' and ''will not advance a difficult diplomacy.'' You overlook that both the strategic arms and comprehensive test ban negotiations have made clear that we could readily accomplish an effective and verifiable freeze on nuclear weapons deployments and testing. Even if a verifiable freeze on nuclear production - a standing U.S. proposal for 20 years - is more difficult to negotiate, freezing nuclear testing and deployments would in itself prevent the next and most dangerous round in the nuclear arms race. Moreover, we have seen no indication of any development that would adversely affect our verification capabilities, and there have been indications of improvements in these capabilities. With Soviet assent - and Moscow should be challenged to agree based on encouraging indications from past negotiating experience - we believe that key elements of a freeze could be promptly achieved. This is the necessary precondition for mutual reductions, and it would provide a much more stable basis than the present arms race for pursuing what are at best complex and difficult nuclear reduction proposals presented by the Reagan Administration at the Start and intermediate nuclear forces negotiations in Geneva. A freeze on nuclear testing furthermore would facilitate completion of a permanent comprehensive test ban treaty, a goal of six Presidents, Republican and Democratic, but abandoned last summer by this Administration. The wording of the freeze resolutions that will be voted on around the country on Nov. 2 makes clear that the freeze is envisioned not as the end of the journey but as a first and essential step. This step will enable us to achieve meaningful, mutual - not unilateral - reductions. For if there is one reason above all others why we support the freeze as a practical negotiating tool, it is the threat new weapons developments pose to the achievement of meaningful progress in limiting arms. For example, without a freeze, within a few short years there will be thousands of nuclear-armed cruise missiles on both sides, small enough to be launched, not from enormous, detectable complexes, but from the backs of large trucks or from surface ships and submarines. When these missiles are deployed in Soviet forests and on Soviet trawlers, verifiable limits on the number of nuclear weapons could be forever beyond the reach of humanity. Similarly, time is important with respect to the potential vulnerability of our land-based missiles. The freeze would enhance nuclear stability, preventing years of further Soviet testing to perfect the operational accuracy and reliability necessary before any Soviet leader could ever contemplate that a first strike against any part of our missile force might succeed. Prolonged negotiations without some interim measure to prevent each nation from perfecting its silo-busting capabilities are not a prudent path to the prevention of nuclear war. In arguing against a freeze, you state: ''And the more stable the nuclear balance, the greater will be the need for more expensive nonnuclear forces.'' We find this bewildering. As avowed friends of arms control, do you see its objective as the negotiation of a less stable nuclear balance? Do you believe that this would permit cost savings on nonnuclear forces? No number of additional nuclear weapons can substitute for the strong conventional forces needed to reduce the risk of any war. And the implied suggestion that we should discard strategic stability in the dangerous and futile pursuit of nuclear superiority is an argument not only against a freeze but against any effective measure of arms control. Finally, you imply that political pressure on our Government should be tempered because the Soviet Government will never be subject to a similar degree of protest. To accept this argument would be to turn the meaning of America upside down. It would forfeit our status as a participatory democracy because the Soviet Union is not one. Popular involvement in this critical area bespeaks the confidence in ourselves as a people and as a nation that we must maintain to meet the multitude of challenges before us in the coming decades. In supporting the nuclear freeze, the American people are not sending detailed instructions to our negotiators. And they would not support or permit an end result that would create a Soviet advantage. But they are calling for a serious, sustained and urgent effort to halt and reverse the arms race that threatens us all. This effort is long overdue. We strongly urge Americans to support the nuclear freeze initiatives on their ballots. W. AVERELL HARRIMAN, CLARK CLIFFORD, WILLIAM E. COLBY, PAUL C. WARNKE, Washington, Oct. 26, 1982

708-> Rooting for the Red Sox
I am a freshman college student, recently uprooted from home in Chicago, and the need for new sports loyalties has become apparent to me (''Odysseus at Fenway,'' by Emily Vermeule, Sept. 26). Here at Wesleyan, I am transplanted halfway between Boston and New York, and no team to root for. I considered putting my loyalties with the Mets or Yankees, but for various reasons, including a jealousy of Yankee successes, I couldn't cheer either team. I thought about cheering the Red Sox, but I needed a reason, something to grab onto. Emily Vermeule has given me just that. I can relate to the frustration of having no champion in over 65 years. I can relate to a small, green oasis where baseball is meant to be played. I can also relate to spring optimism and September collapses. I can feel the Red Sox in my blood now.

710-> Market Place; Does the Tail Wag the Dog?
THE November series of put and call options expires after tomorrow's trading and, if the past is any guide, a familiar misconception about options and how the tail wags the dog is likely to be widely debated again. According to this notion, action in the options market can point the way for stock prices, rather than vice versa, holds that on the Friday before expiration date, an inordinate number of stocks close at, or within, a tiny fraction of the nearest strike price for the options. For stocks trading between $20 and $100 a share, strike prices are set in multiples of 5. For example, a stock now selling at $63.50 a share might have options with strike prices at 50, 55, 60, 65 and 70. A call gives its buyer the right to purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at a set strike price at any time during the life of the option. A put permits its owner to sell 100 shares of the stock at a specified strike price, also until the option contract expires. Puts and calls are now available on nearly 400 issues - all but a half-dozen or so listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The options, which have grown enormously in popularity in recent years, trade elsewhere - the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, The Pacific Stock Exchange and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. Although various studies have purported to show that the theory about option expiration dates holds water - or, conversely, does not hold water - most market professionals tend to dismiss it. ''It's just a myth,'' said Edwin Burton, who heads the options department at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''I don't believe the theory. ''In any case, it's an eminently testable proposition.'' It turns out that the Options Clearing Corporation, the central clearing unit for all four options exchanges, has tested the proposition. ''In our examination, there is a normal distribution of closing prices around expiration date,'' said Alan J. Salem, executive vice president of the Chicago-based corporation. ''It's a matter of probabilities,'' he added. ''At the most, the typical stock will close, at expiration or any other time, 2 1/2 points away from its nearest option strike price, since these are arranged in multiples of 5. ''Therefore, in all probability, roughly 20 percent of the stocks would end up within a half-point of the strike price on the Friday before expiration. Approximately another 20 percent, furthermore, would be expected to end up a full point away from the closest strike price.'' The suggestion has been made that the most ardent proponents of the tail-wags-the-dog theory tend to be people who most often are on the short side of the options market and have seen the market turn against them. Paul G. Stevens, executive vice president for operations at the Amex, is another man who has pondered the theory. ''Actually, it's a proposition that has never been fully proved or disproved,'' he stated. ''But, to the extent that there is any effect, it remains completely unpredictable.'' Meanwhile, Mr. Stevens believes that the steady increase in the number of put options available (starting in 1973, call options dominated the trading in its early years) has a ''counterbalancing'' effect that renders the theory groundless. It is, of course, a beguiling theory. Anyone able to predict the exact point where underlying stocks would close on the Friday before options expire conceivably would be in a position to profit by his prescience. One Wall Street executive observed: ''I know of a professional trader who's been trying for eight or nine years to take advantage of this phenomenon and, so far, he's been utterly unsuccessful.'' ''Only 4 or 5 percent of all options that are purchased wind up being exercised,'' Mr. Salem said. ''The large majority of puts and calls end up being liquidated at a profit or a loss. A third batch expires worthless.'' Although an individual investor is entitled to exercise an option and, for example, buy the underlying stock if the market accommodates him, exercising options generally is an activity left to the professional contingent. Indeed, one way that stock and strike prices can end up matching is through a common hedging activity shortly before expiration. At times, when the option has only slight value, speculators are likely to sell to a market maker who, in turn, hedges his position in the actual stock market. That process can sometimes mean that a stock closes right on the nose at the nearest option exercise price. While the tail-wags-the-dog theory doubtless will persist in this and future option expiration months, one fact is incontrovertible: Options trading is on the upswing, as shown by the open interest, or the number of contracts outstanding. Two days ago, the open interest for all option months rose to a record 10,323,943 contracts. That compares with an open interest of about 4.5 million contracts in mid-1980. Since each contract carries the right to buy or sell 100 shares of stock, that works out to an underlying equivalent exceeding one billion shares. But the vast majority of contracts are liquidated - not exercised. 'At the most, the typical stock will close, at expiration or any other time, 2 1/2 points away from its nearest strike price.'

711-> Talks Resume On Carpenter
Rob Carpenter, the Giants' unsigned fullback, said today that he would like to play Sunday when the season resumes but that ''a lot of timing is involved.'' Because the National Football League Players Association had invoked its right to be the sole bargaining agent for the players, the Giants were unable to negotiate with Carpenter or his agent, Gary Wichard, during the 57-day strike that ended Tuesday night. Today, Wichard talked with Terry Bledsoe, the Giants' assistant general manager. But, they said later, they did not discuss salary. One provision in the new management-union contract requires an agent representing a veteran player to be certified by the union. Wichard requested certification today, and he was awaiting a response from Ed Garvey, the union's executive director.

713-> OPEC FAILS TO SET QUOTAS ON OUTPUT FOR EACH MEMBER
Oil ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a frustrating two-day conference today unable to agree on the crucial issue of production quotas for individual members. The group did agree to raise its official production ceiling to a total of 18.5 million barrels a day, from the largely ignored 17.5 million limit set last March. The adjustment was an attempt to bring the official level more closely in line with actual production, currently estimated at 19.5 million barrels. They also reaffirmed their commitment to the $34-a-barrel base price - a level set in October 1981 but undercut both on the spot market and by members offering discounts, as an oversupply of oil developed. But without allocating production among the countries, analysts believe it is virtually impossible for OPEC to enforce the overall production limit intended to defend that official price. Bargaining Force Questioned The failure to set individual ceilings thus raises serious questions about OPEC's ability to remain an effective bargaining force. Some oil industry observers at the conference said a decline of oil prices early in the year now seems likely. The conference marks the third time this year that the ministers have failed to agree on how to apply the production ceiling adopted last March in an attempt to adjust to recession-diminished demand and the increased flow of oil from nonmember countries. Output by such countries, among them Britain, Mexico and the Soviet Union, exceeded OPEC's for the first time this year. When the 13 member nations first adopted their ceiling, they agreed to a system of individual production quotas pegged to historic levels. But these have been increasingly disregarded in recent months, and at this weekend's meeting the members only offered guidelines for individual output - a range between the March quota and current production levels. The failure to agree on firm production limits reflects pressure within the group from members desperate for revenues because of growing external debts and the continuing efforts of Iran to reassert itself as a political and economic pacesetter in the Gulf region. Indeed, the results of the conference represent at least a partial victory for Iran, which has clashed in recent months with Saudi Arabia, the group's biggest and most influential producer, over individual quotas. Iran leads a growing OPEC faction seeking to increase production, at the expense of Saudi Arabia's market share. Iran particularly needs additional oil earnings to pay for its costly war with Iraq. At a news conference after the conference adjourned, Marc S.N. Nguema of Gabon, OPEC's Secretary General, insisted that approval of the total ceiling figure and benchmark price meant the meeting was at least in part a success. ''Conferences are failures or successes in the eyes of the beholders,'' Mr. Nguema told reporters, when asked whether he thought the meeting had failed. But the Secretary General acknowledged that the conference had stumbled over its inability to reconcile a low-production ceiling with demands by several countries for higher production quotas. In the communique issued at the news conference, the ministers said ''agreement on stabilizing national quotas for the distribution of that total amount would require further consultations among the respective governments.'' To review these consultations, the ministers voted to reconvene ''at a later stage,'' the statement said. The oil minister of the United Arab Emirates, Sheik Mani Said al-Otaiba, who is chairman of the group's market monitoring committee, said he hoped the ministers could present their governments' results sometime in January. Sheik Otaiba said the monitoring committee would now meet at least once a month to follow market developments and production levels in the individual countries. No Discussion on Discounting Because of the preoccupation with production ceilings, ministers said the conference failed to deal with the other key issue on the agenda here: price discounting and the differentials paid to equalize the price of less valuable crude oils with higher quality crude from some African countries. The issue was not even mentioned in the ministers' statement, but it is assumed that it will be taken up at a later date as well. Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, retreating from threats to drop the benchmark price and flood the world with low-priced oil if its OPEC partners failed to unite, reaffirmed his commitment to the $34 benchmark price level for Saudi Arabian Light crude oil. ''We will defend $34; this is our policy,'' Sheik Yamani said. He said Saudi Arabia would seek to maintain its current 7-millionbarrels-a-day ceiling. Sunday, Sheik Yamani contended that current Saudi production, dampened to maintain oil prices despite the oversupply of oil, was down to between 5 million and 5.1 million barrels a day. Iranians Satisfied at Outcome Iranian representatives expressed satisfaction with the results of the conference. Iran's minister of petroleum, Seyyed Mohamed Gharazi, said at a news conference this afternoon, without explicitly naming Saudi Arabia, that the days have ended when OPEC decisions were made ''unilaterally.'' Some members, he said, were ''now gradually, in a hard way, learning that decisions have to be made within the family.'' Mr. Gharazi said Iran was prepared to accept an export ceiling of 2.5 million barrels a day for 1983. But he said it insisted on producing an additional 700,000 barrels a day for domestic needs. ''We will continue operating at this level,'' he said. ''We will not put pressure on anyone.'' The Iranian minister said his country had received assurances at the time of the overthrow of Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi, when it decided to throttle oil production, that OPEC would restore its share if future need arose. He said Iran now seeks a share, ''according to historic right and promise.'' He discounted the possibility that continued high Iranian productivity could lead other producers to drop their prices to diminish Iran's share of the market. Alluding to producers in Saudi Arabia and North America, the minister said, ''Those who have higher reserves and levels of production have more to lose.'' To illustrate the point, he cited an Iranian proverb saying that ''those who have more roof, gather more snow.'' Leading the offensive for higher quotas, Iran sought a quota of 3.02 million barrels of oil per day. The Iranians argue that such criteria as population size, proved oil reserves, national need and historic production levels should determine individual national quotas.

714-> CENSUS REPORTS THAT GROWTH OF HISPANIC POPULATION IS LARGELY IN BIG CITIES
Hispanic people, one of the nation's fastest-growing minorities, have established communities in every region and most large cities, and yet their expansion has been so selective that almost half of them live in just 10 metropolitan areas. That fact, along with disclosures about blacks, older people and life in the New York City area, comes from a 611-page report released today by the Bureau of the Census. The document points out the lure of warm climate for retirement, noting that the eight metropolitan areas having the largest percentages of people who are 65 years old or older are all in Florida. Blacks Highly Urbanized It says that blacks, once a more dominantly rural people than whites at various stages of urbnization in America, have become so highly urbanized that less than one-fifth of them remain on farms and in small towns. But even though blacks form a majority in a number of central cities, they do not in any of the metropolitan areas in the survey. They come the closest in Albany, Ga., where they make up 41 percent of the population. Only in 10 metropolitan areas, all in the South, do they exceed 30 percent. New York, the nation's largest metropolitan area, and Yuba City, Calif., the 287th, have some common characteristics, the report says. Both rank in the top 10 in the percentage of people on welfare and in the amount per capita that their local governments spend for services and facilities. The document, the ''State and Metropolitan Area Data Book'' for 1982, draws the portrait of a nation where people increasingly tend to live in communities with their own kind. Largely a study of metropolitan centers that have been spreading over wider and wider areas in recent years, it contains some previously unpublished information from the 1980 census as well as new information from other government agencies. Fewer People Per Square Mile The report says that in both central cities and the suburbs, there are fewer people per square mile. In 1970 there were 247 metropolitan areas, as defined by the Federal Government, with 360 people per square mile. By 1981 the number of areas had grown by 76, to 323, and many of the old ones had been enlarged, so that the average number of people on each square mile had dropped by 61, to 299. The 305 metropolitan areas are usually central cities of 50,000 or more along with their suburbs and outlying fringe areas. About 170 million people, 75 percent of the population counted by the 1980 census, live on the 575,883 square miles that made up metropolitan areas in 1981. One major finding of the 1970 census was that more people lived in the suburbs than in the cities they surrounded, but the margin was small, 67 million in the central cities to 83 million outside. A decade later the difference was overwhelming. The Government found 67,941,825 people living in the central cities and 102,551,158 in surrounding areas. The city residents were outnumbered 3 to 2 by those in suburbs. The report issued today confirmed the uniqueness of the New York City area, which, in the report, encompasses the city, Rockland and Westchester counties in New York State and Bergen County in New Jersey. Aside from the size of the New York metropolis, which had more than 9 million people counted in 1980, it has a mixture of wealth and poverty not found in other major areas. In the top 10 areas with a high percentage of welfare cases, as based on Aid to Families with Dependent Children and Supplementary Security Income, New York was the only major area included. It ranked 10th behind Visalia and Stockton, Calif.; Jersey City; Atlantic City; Yuba City and Fresno, Calif.; Vineland, N.J., and Modesto and Redding, Calif. At the same time, New York had a comparatively high rating for overall income. Among 305 metropolitan areas, New York ranked 35th in per capita personal income, at $9,839 in 1979 as against a national average of $8,757. The New York area has far more blacks than any other, almost 2 million. It ranks second only to Los Angeles in the number of Hispanic people. The 1980 census counted 1,493,148, or 16.4 percent. of the area's population. New York ranked 304th in the percentage of people owning their homes and was first among major areas in the percentage of people living alone. One reason for the New York area's uniqueness is that, because of its size, some of its suburbs were broken off before 1970 as separate metropolitan areas. Long Island was made a separate metropolitan area, known as Nassau-Suffolk, with a 1980 population of 2.6 million. Even though many of the Nassau-Suffolk area's residents commute to New York, it was found to have its own economy and character. The Census Bureau, in publishing state reports, was able, for example, to use the same analysis for each: ''a faster growth rate for nonfamily vs. family households, an increase in families maintained by women with no husbands present, and smaller average family and household sizes.'' The figures made public today did emphasize certain dramatic differences between areas. All of the country has been growing older because of increased longevity and the aging of the ''baby boom'' generation born after World War II. But the distribution of the elderly is more uneven than in the past. In Sarasota, Fla., 30 percent of the population was 65 or older. In Bradenton, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers, Daytona Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa-St. Petersburg and Ocala, those older than 65 made up 17 to 27 percent of the population. In large part, these were the elderly who had moved to Florida. But not far behind were the northeast Pennsylvania metropolitan area, around Scranton, with 16 percent and Atlantic City with 15.9 percent. New York ranked 34th with 13.2 percent. In these areas, the elderly population is, in large part, made up of people who were left behind as those younger moved out. Places With Few Older People In Anchorage, only 2 percent of the population had reached 65. Ann Arbor, Mich., a college town, had only 6.4 percent 65 or over; Casper, Wyo., 6.3 percent; El Paso, 6.6. Even in Florida, Fort Walton Beach, on the Gulf Coast near Mobile, Ala., had only 5.8 percent 65 or older. As people of age groups tended to stay together, so did minorities. Blacks concentrated in central cities of all sizes and regions with some settling in the older, close-in suburbs, a movement that has been occurring for some time.

715-> THE GAME'S AFOOT: SHERLOCK HOLMES RETURNS TO THE SCREEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Michael Billington frequently reports on the cultural scene in England. DEVONSHIRE, ENGLAND Abright, clear, sharp morning on Dartmoor in the heart of Devon. A couple of young men in climbing-boots are preparing to scale the huge, craggy rock of Haytor. On the plain below is an old-fashioned gypsy encampment alive with florally-decorated, curlicued caravans and a sole fiddler. From the swirl of smoke coiling up from the gypsy fire emerges a sharp-featured figure with matted beard and broadbrimmed black hat. He approaches a handsome-looking young couple on chestnut-and-white mares and offers to read the lady's fortune. As he takes her jasmine-scented hand and suggests a fatal choice lies ahead of her, she quivers with apprehension and a figure in grey anorak cries, ''Cut and print.'' For this is a new version of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic 1902 tale ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' and the second in a projected series of 13 full-length Sherlock Holmes films starring Ian Richardson as the great detective. Everyone is aware of the challenge. The fact that over 150 Holmes films have already been made. The fact that Basil Rathbone established almost seigneurial rights to the character with a series of films in the 1940's. The fact that this particular tale - with its spectral hound haunting darkest Dartmoor - has attracted more attention than any other from Alwin Neuss as a silent Holmes in 1915 to Peter Cook doing a tonguein-chic version with Paul Morrissey in 1978. So why another set of Holmes films? The idea belongs to Sy Weintraub, a California movie producer, real estate dealer and racehorse owner who was hooked on Holmes from childhood. Six years ago, he decided the time was ripe for a set of 90-minute movies that could be sold to cinemas in some countries, television in others. He negotiated with Conan Doyle's surviving daughter for the rights (the works are now in the public domain everywhere except the United States and Germany). He enlisted the backing of the English producer Otto Plaschkes, who cast Ian Richardson. And now ''The Sign of Four'' is in the can; ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' is well under way; and two American film companies and a television network are expressing urgent interest in these movies which have cost $4 million apiece. Otto Plaschkes, speaking amid the banging of technicians in a rambling 19th-century Devon mansion, Knightshayes Court, which stands in for Baskerville Hall, is emphatic that the intention is not to do dirt on Conan Doyle. ''The stories are so good that we want to do them properly, not send them up. 'The Sign of Four,' which Desmond Davis has directed, is a potpourri of children's fantasies: stolen jewels, revenge, treasure, a strange dwarf, things that appeal to the child in all of us. '' 'The Hound of the Baskervilles,' which Douglas Hickox is now directing, is slightly more open to reinterpretation. The old Basil Rathbone version, with locations on the back lot of Universal, seems silly and bizarre and stupid when you see it now. We're trying to make it both an internal and external horror story. To what extent is the hound symbolic? To what extent do you actually show it? The ambiguity of the horror will, I hope, give the story a new frisson.'' Not everyone, of course, is as passionate about Conan Doyle as Mr. Weintraub and Mr. Plaschkes. ''God, what tripe,'' wrote Raymond Chandler in 1949 of ''Hound of the Baskervilles.'' ''It looks to me as if Lincoln was wrong. You can fool all of the people all of the time.'' But, despite Chandler, the myth of Sherlock Holmes seems as strong as ever. Audiences in New York and London flocked to the revival of the William Gillette stage play in the mid-1970's. Letters still pour in daily to the fictional detective at his address at 221b Baker Street. And while we all identify with the dogged Watson, we secretly yearn to be Holmes, once dubbed by W.H. Auden ''a genius in whom scientific curiosity is raised to the status of a heroic passion.'' Ian Richardson, a veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company and currently ubiquitous in British television, now dons the deerstalker. Can he hope to compete with the memory of Basil Rathbone? ''Rathbone,'' he says, ''was marvellous. Graham Greene called him 'that man with the knife-edge face and the snapping mouth' and he had the height, the nose and a jawline which I will never have. But the crucial thing he missed was that Holmes had a definite and quirky sense of humor. It's the sort of humor that you might feel slightly uncomfortable with if you encountered it at a dinner party. It's usually expressed in dry little quips. When, in 'Hound of the Baskervilles,' Holmes and Watson are following Sir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer down a street, Watson asks if he should run after them. 'Not for the world, Watson,' says Holmes. 'I am perfectly satisfied with your company if you will tolerate mine.' I missed that kind of cool irony in Rathbone's interpretation.'' What is striking about Mr. Richardson is that he is approaching the role as logically and deductively as the sleuth himself. ''Being an actor is like being a detective with a magpie sense of theft. And, rather like Holmes, I only really come alive when I've something to do. So when I committed myself to the role in February, I sat down to re-read the entire works and, with my wife, compile a dossier on Holmes. We made notes on each of the stories and on any clue to Holmes's character. We also got a copy of the Army and Navy stores catalogue for 1900, which has illustrations of the cigar cases, the travelling spirit flasks, the binoculars, the magnifying glasses, the pipes, the violins of the period. We made photostats of these and pasted them up alongside the notes in a volume that now runs to 150 pages. ''One of the things I discovered doing this was that Conan Doyle was a fascinating but sometimes careless author. One particular remark of Watson's leapt out at me, which was that 'he seldom laughed but when he did and in that particular way it meant trouble.' I checked through all the stories and found that in fact Holmes laughed rather a lot. For instance, 'He laughed that infectious, silent, wheezy laugh which I always find irresistible.' But the conclusion I came to, after listing all the references together under a single heading, was that Holmes's laughter was frequent but mirthless and a bit cold.'' Not all of Mr. Richardson's meticulous research will find its way onto the screen: The cocaine-snorting of Holmes will be excluded on the grounds that the films are family entertainment. But Mr. Richardson has found a way of registering the sleuth's quickening interest. ''The problem in re-creating Holmes is that at the beginning of every story, he's low, depressed, drugged out of his mind. Now you can't start a movie with the leading character so laid back that you think he's out of his mind with boredom. What I've done instead is to concentrate on the sort of intensity of excitement that you can see in the eyes. On the screen you can show that progressing just as on the stage you would show an upright walk changing to a coiled spring. I let the lids of my eyes come down so that they look hooded and when the germ of a case becomes a reality, the eyes open and we're off. The game's afoot.'' Despite the odd hiccups (David Healy who was Watson in the first film has had to be replaced by Donald Churchill because he was under contract to the National Theater), the game is also afoot on the new Sherlock Holmes films. After a set of cinematic spoofs, the old Baker Street wizard is once more being taken seriously, not least by the American Holmes buff, Charles Pogue, who has done the first two scripts. Mr. Weintraub, who has sunk his own personal fortune into the project, also proudly says that the Baker Street set will be furnished with authentic copies of the Strand Magazine, even though moviegoers will probably never notice them. And the casting is certainly the best of British: Denholm Elliott, Martin Shaw, Nicholas Clay are all in ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' and there is talk of Ian McKellen to play Moriarty. The key question, of course, is whether, in the age of ''E.T.'' and ''Tron,'' the public still hungers for Holmes's deductive logic and the cool clarity of a rational mind. As Holmes himself says in ''The Hound,'' ''The past and present are within my field of enquiry but what a man may do in the future is a hard question to answer.'' Time alone will tell whether Mr. Weintraub or Chandler is right.

717-> AROUND THE WORLD; K.G.B. Is Said to Search Dissident's Apartment
K.G.B. agents this week searched the apartment of Georgi N. Vladimov, leader of the Moscow branch of Amnesty International, Mr. Vladimov told Western reporters today. Mr. Vladimov also said he and his wife, Natasha, were told to report to Moscow's Lefortovo Prison on Jan. 4 for questioning. He said he was told during the seven-hour apartment search Tuesday that he was to be interrogated about possible links with a convicted terrorist called Borodin. But the 52-year-old dissident writer said he believed the search was part of a renewed effort to make him move to the West. He said the K.G.B. agents took away manuscripts, letters, books and his two typewriters. It was the second time this year his home has been searched and materials confiscated, he said. Among the documents taken were those related to the London-based human rights groups, the author said.

718-> WHEN TO ENJOY ART IS TO DESTROY ART
To the Editor: In his Dec. 13 Editorial Notebook article, Karl E. Meyer mourns the threat posed to ancient cave art by public exposure. The instances of vandalism and cheap commercial exploitation cited by Mr. Meyer are lamentable, but what ultimately useful purpose is served by excluding cave (or any other) art from public view? Granted, cave art is unusually fragile and merits as much protection and conservation as it can be given. On the other hand, unseen art might as well not exist. The life of any work of art is finite in circumstances of public accessibility. To deprive cave art of ''the human presence itself'' is in effect to kill it as dead as it eventually would become through the attrition of that same human presence. To keep its location a secret shared only by a few scientists is to maintain an elitist position that nullifies art's larger communicative purposes. That the Lascaux cave paintings are dying as a result of exposure to hundreds of thousands of viewers is regrettable only insofar as ultimate death is a precondition of life. Would it not have been far more regrettable had these paintings never been seen by significant numbers of people, had they never in effect outlived their Paleolithic creators? We can't eat and have our cultural cake. It's just a question of whether we eat it now or later. JAY JACOBS, New York, Dec. 14, 1982

719-> NEW YORK AND JERSEY LEGISLATURES ACT IN STRUGGLE ON BUDGET
The State Senate passed a regional sales tax increase Monday night that Republican legislative leaders said was a way to save the current bus, subway and commuter-rail fares. That tax had previously been rejected by the Democrats, however, and early today both sides met in an effort to find a compromise. Shortly after the measure was passed, by a vote of 33 to 18, Governor Carey called a meeting in his office with Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders. The Assembly on Thursday had passed a payroll tax designed to save the fares. In New York, the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority met briefly at 6 P.M. Monday to consider fare increases, but then recessed to await developments at the State Capitol. The board remained in recess at the authority's offices at 2:30 A.M. this morning. Richard Ravitch, chairman of the M.T.A., said the board would raise fares on commuter lines in the suburbs by 50 percent and fares on subways and buses in the city by 25 cents if the Legislature failed to provide money for mass transit. Fink Supports Compromise As he walked into the meeting in Albany, the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, pointed at Mr. Carey's office and said, ''We've got to listen to this guy.'' Mr. Anderson did not put forward any proposal. At 1:30 A.M., Senator Anderson left the meeting, and said only that the ''staffs are still working,'' and that the leaders would meet again later this morning. Manfred Ohrenstein, the Senate minority leader, said: ''We have not agreed on anything. We have agreed to work through the night.'' Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, said that he was prepared to support a compromise proposal to levy a payroll tax only in the city and a sales-tax increase only in the suburbs. He called that combination the ''worst of both worlds,'' but he said he was prepared to compromise. ''Everybody agrees there should be a compromise, but all the other guys don't want to compromise.'' The proposal to combine the taxes was first mentioned by State Senator Norman Levy, Republican of Merrick, L.I., who is chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, but aides to Senator Anderson said he did not support such a compromise. James L. Biggane, the Republicans' chief fiscal aide, called it ''the worst of all possible alterantives. Cuomo to Propose Alternative Mr. Ohrenstein, Democrat of Manhattan, said Democrats still wanted ''a business tax'' and wanted to hear from Senator Anderson ''what business taxes he is for.'' ''The ball is in his court,'' Mr. Ohrenstein said. Mr. Cuomo said he was also prepared to suggest compromise proposals as an alternative to the Senate's proposal to raise the sales tax half a percentage point in the 12 counties served by the M.T.A. The meeting did not get under way until after midnight, because Mr. Cuomo and other Democrats said they had doubts that enough Republican Senators could be found to pass the sales-tax measure. But, after a three-hour delay, called to give Senator Roy M. Goodman, Republican of Manhattan, time to reach Albany, 33 Republicans cast their votes in favor, two more than necessary to pass the measure. All Democrats present voted against the tax increase, as did two Republicans - Jay P. Rolison Jr. of Poughkeepsie and Richard E. Schermerhorn of Newburgh. ''Time is running out,'' said Senator Carol Berman, Democrat of Lawrence, L.I., as she explained her vote. ''People are calling my office today in actual tears that the fare will go up.'' Anderson Wants to Hold Fares In the debate, Mr. Anderson reaffirmed his commitment to provide enough money to maintain the fares through the next year. M.T.A. officials have said the future of the fares also depends on the Federal Government providing the increased operating aid that has been proposed in Congress. ''What we are discussing,'' Mr. Anderson said as debate got under way in the Senate, ''is not whether we will maintain the fare, but how we are going to do it.'' But Mr. Ohrenstein said that if the Republicans did not abandon the sales tax plan, the fares would go up. ''If you know your tax is dead,'' he said, ''you are not offering a solution, you are offering a fare increase.'' The Democratic plan passed by the Assembly calls for a tax on private employers of 44 cents for each $100 of payroll. Even if the legislative leaders had reached agreement, the Assembly would not have been to ratify it until later today at the earliest. With no compromise proposed Monday, Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink, Democrat of Brooklyn, decided not to call members back to Albany. The M.T.A. is required to present a balanced budget at a meeting of the State Financial Control Board at 11 A.M. today. An official familiar with the negotiations said the meeting of the Control Board would be postponed until later this afternoon. Mr. Ravitch said Monday night that if there was an agreement in principle among the leaders in Albany on a tax package, he would not recommend a fare increase. Coppie Disagrees But Comer S. Coppie, the Control Board's executive director, said an agreement in principle by legislative leaders would not be enough for the Control Board to approve a budget. In New York Monday night, about 50 demonstrators picketed against a fare increase in front of the M.T.A. headquarters on Madison Avenue. Inside, hecklers were removed by police as the M.T.A. met for about 10 minutes and recessed. ''My view is that we must wait until the last possible moment,'' Mr. Ravitch said.

721-> I.R.S. REPORTS IT IS GETTING RESULTS IN NEW ROLE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS
The Internal Revenue Service says it is already seeing results from tough new laws giving the tax-collecting agency a major role in the battle against narcotics traffickers. One new law permits the revenue agency to collect a 50 percent tax on large sums of cash carried by couriers or other underlings in narcotics trafficking who refuse to identify the owner of the money. The law, which took effect Sept. 4, says the messenger owns it until it is proved that he or she does not. ''We have already used it in three different areas of the country,'' said Richard C. Wassenaar, assistant commissioner of the I.R.S. in charge of criminal investigations. ''When a courier is picked up off the street carrying suitcases full of cash, we can grab it quickly with a good chance of keeping it.'' Even more important in the battle against drug trafficking are several changes in the law, also enacted this year, requiring the revenue agency to share information with other Federal agencies investigating nontax criminal matters. Law-enforcement officials had complained that a 1976 law written in response to abuses of tax return information in the Nixon Administration virtually removed the tax agency from any role in the antidrug campaign. Access to Tax Information The new law makes it easier for Federal investigators to gain access to information gleaned by the revenue agency from tax returns or other sources. For example, a routine tax audit might uncover evidence that the Justice Department could use to prosecute a taxpayer on drug charges. Where tax return information is involved, any sharing is subject to court approval. But information picked up about a taxpayer from an informer or other source could be shared with the Department of Justice on written request with court intervention. Although the streamlined procedures have been in effect only a short time, Mr. Wassenaar said United States Attorneys and other Federal officials were pleased with the results. In the last fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, the revenue agency opened investigations of more than 700 high-level drug traffickers, financiers and others involved in laundering or otherwise providing money for narcotics deals, the agency said. The I.R.S. recommended prosecution in 343 drug cases and issued assessments for more than $300 million in unpaid taxes. Of that number, 180 were indicted, 120 were convicted and 78 of the 103 who received sentences were sentenced to jail terms averaging four years. ''It is becoming more difficult to be involved in the narcotics business,'' Mr. Wassenaar said. ''We are working on cases now that are considerably larger than we've ever had.'' The revenue agency now devotes about 20 percent of its criminal investigations budget to narcotics trafficking, Mr. Wassenaar said, and as a result of President Reagan's recently announced initiative, it expects that to increase to as much as 30 percent. A major project for the revenue agency in the next few months will be investigation of foreign tax havens. Mr. Wassenaar characterized as ''mind-boggling'' the amount of money flowing through several countries from narcotics, tax shelters and other criminal enterprises in the United States.

722-> VERMONT AND ITS HUNTERS BATTLING OVER DEER
When the Vermont Legislature handed over control of the state's wild deer to the Fish and Game Department in 1977, a decades-long debate was thought to be over. But after the worst season for deer hunters in many years, some legislators, stung by angry constituents, now want to take back control or at least severely limit the department's authority over the deer. Critics of the department say its policy of thinning out the herd, primarily by allowing the hunting of does, has worked too well, and they want the policy overturned. ''Fish and Game buffaloed us when they said the deer herd needed to be thinned out,'' said Frank Miles, a Newport insurance agent and hunter who leading a group trying to ban the doe season in Vermont. ''They've been spoiled,'' retorted Benjamin Day, the Fish and Game Department's Director of Wildlife, who is the primary target of the hunters' ire. The herd had grown too large for the winter food supply, he said, and far more animals have starved than have been killed by hunters. Too Many or Too Few? Whether there are too many deer in the Vermont woods has been a matter of dispute for years. When the herd reached its population peak in the late 1960's, wintertime kill figures for the animals were also extremely high, according to Mr. Day. The winter food supply for deer, which must forage among evergreens and low brush in the snowy months, is always skimpy, and free-running dogs add to their misery. The weaker deer are the first to die. The fierce winter of 1977-78 killed tens of thousands of deer, and hunters had poor luck the next fall. The Legislature, which had retained control over deer since the Civil War, gave it to the Fish and Game Department, which promised to restore the herd to a stable level. To do so, the department instituted a policy under which some hunters were permitted to shoot antlerless does and young bucks. The goal was to keep the breeding herd at a level sustainable by the winter food supply. Two consecutive mild winters led to a larger herd, which depleted the food in the winter range, Mr. Day said. Then, the cruel winter of 1981-82 decimated the herd, he said, estimating that as many as 20,000 animals died last winter, causing this season's poor showing for hunters. ''There just weren't any groceries out there,'' Mr. Day said. Many Legislators Hunt But hunters do not see it that way. ''We don't want antlerless hunting in Vermont,'' Mr. Niles said. ''We lived without it for many years and had a hell of a good deer herd.'' He and several thousand other hunters have made clear their displeasure at what they call the virtually invisible 1982 deer herd. It is estimated that one-third of the members of the State Legislature are hunters, and they have been listening. Several said they planned to introduce legislation to limit sharply the Fish and Game Department's control over the deer. Stephan Morse, Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives, hoping to head off what he believes would be a time-consuming and unnecessary debate, asked the department, which he said should retain authority over the herd, to institute a one-year moratorium on permits for hunting antlerless deer. Although Mr. Day favors continuing the antlerless policy until the herd has stabilized, his superior, Fish and Game Commissioner Gary Moore, said the depatment had ''goofed'' by overestimating the size of the herd a year ago when it issued its 1981 antlerless permits. Mr. Moore indicated he would agree to at least a one-year moratorium.

723-> THREE QUICK GOALS HELP RANGERS WIN
The way Barry Beck told it, the Rangers took out all their frustration on the Toronto Maple Leafs. The result was a lopsided 6-1 victory last night at Madison Square Garden in which the Rangers outshot the Leafs, 49-20. Toronto, with a streak of 20 road games without a victory (0-17-3), proved to be an easy target for the Rangers. The Leafs have not won on the road since last Jan. 31. ''It got to the point where we were just fed up with ourselves,'' said Beck, speaking of the Rangers' 2-4-1 record and 32 goals allowed in their seven previous games. ''It's hard to live with yourself, to sit next to each other in the locker room every day and say, 'Gee, we're playing good, but things just aren't happening for us,' '' Beck said. ''We had to be honest with ourselves, be men about it and face up to the facts.'' Brooks Takes Steps Herb Brooks, the Rangers' coach, helped the players face facts by calling up Pat Conacher from the minors. Brooks benched Mikko Leinonen last Sunday and told Kent-Erik Andersson that he would be benched last night. Leinonen was back in the lineup last night, and Andersson also played, because Anders Hedberg was ill. Leinonen and Andersson helped produce the first two Ranger goals, before the game was 10 minutes old. Andersson and Mike Rogers controlled the puck along the boards until Leinonen could wheel out and fire a 30-foot slapshot past Michel Larocque in the Toronto goal. Then, as Rogers sprinted between the two defensemen, Leinonen lifted a gentle pass straight down the slot, making the puck land on Rogers's stick about five feet in front of Larocque. Rogers flipped in his seventh goal. Eddie Johnstone fed Don Maloney on a two-on-one rush for Maloney's 10th goal and a 3-0 first-period lead. Then, after Mike Allison and Robbie Ftorek scored in the third, Maloney scored again. It was his third two-goal game in the last four at home. '60 Minutes of Nonexistance' ''This was really a terrible game for us,'' said Mike Nykoluk, Toronto's coach. ''We had a bad first period in Chicago, but for 60 minutes, this was probably the worst we've played because it was 60 minutes of nonexistence.'' Larocque had the clearest sense of how much the Rangers dominated: he made 43 saves and still lost, 6-1. At the other end, Ed Mio had his first cakewalk of the year, facing only nine shots in the first period, three shots in the second, eight in the third. He lost his shutout bid when Bill Derlago scored a power-play goal with 4 minutes 40 seconds remaining. ''I wanted the 2 points, not the shutout,'' said Mio, who had allowed 17 goals in his last three games and was 1-6 before last night. ''It's nice if you get it, but more important is that we got 2 points, and I broke the losing streak.'' ''We haven't been treating him too well, but he's got a lot of guts, he wasn't about to give up,'' said Beck, referring to Mio. ''And I think tonight he gained some confidence back. He played like it, anyway.'' The Rangers killed 1 minute 5 seconds of a two-man Toronto advantage in the second period. Their own power play continued to flounder, going 0 for 3. But the Rangers skated so well that it often looked as if they were on the power play when they weren't. Toronto's offense ranks 20th in the 21-team league, and three of their four regular defensemen are 20 years old or younger. Clearly, the Leafs are not Stanley Cup contenders. But they have played reasonably well at home this season, unbeaten at Maple Leaf Gardens in their last six games (4-0-2). That's where the Rangers play next, on Saturday night. Hedberg is expected to be well enough to play that game. Andersson, who played so well for two periods, injured his left cheekbone and his right hand when he lost his footing and crashed into the end boards with 2:18 left in the second period. He will be X-rayed today.

724-> TURBOPROPS FOR SMALLER LINES
In this age of the jet airliner and the space shuttle, the aviation industry is turning new attention to an old idea - the airplane with a propeller. With commuter airlines in mind, a number of foreign and domestic aircraft manufacturers are taking aim at a market for turboprop planes that is expected to average more than $2 billion a year over the next two decades, according to the Regional Airline Association, a trade group. The propeller of a turboprop plane is driven by a jetactivated turbine shaft. The United States, in most respects the world leader in commercial aviation, has lagged in producing lightweight commercial aircraft. Later this month Fairchild Industries is introducing a new plane, which it will make in partnership with Saab-Scania of Sweden, and the Beech Aircraft Corporation is coming along with a plane of its own. But overseas manufacturers have a head start and seem better primed to capture the major share of new orders. Thriving Corporate Market American manufacturers have had other priorities. ''To a large degree they have chosen not to enter the growing marketplace for small aircraft used by regional and commuter airlines,'' said Duane H. Ekedahl, president of the regional association, ''in favor of the burgeoning market for turbine-powered corporate aircraft.'' The corporate planes are smaller, typically seating six to nine persons, while the commuter operators prefer planes that seat from 15 to 50 or more, with corresponding luggage space and substantial head room. If financial balance sheets are a proper measure of success, American manufacturers have done well focusing on the corporate turboprop market. Sales surged from 428 of these planes in 1977 to 918 in 1981, and annual revenues grew from $295 million to last year's $1.1 billion, according to the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. While working to improve their chances for a significant share of the expanding commuter airline market, Fairchild and other domestic companies are urging Washington to restrict aircraft imports on the ground that many are unfairly subsidized. Many Nations in the Race Leading the race against the Americans for mastery of the United States market are Brazil, Ireland, Britain, Canada, West Germany and a French-Italian consortium. Small airlines have specialized needs, and no single plane satisfies them all. Most commuter operators agree, however, that propeller planes fit their overall mission best. Propeller planes are more maneuverable than the bigger jets, operate efficiently at lower altitudes and shorter distances and can take off and land safely on the short runways that are common in small cities. A plane highly regarded by commuter operators is the de Havilland Dash 7. One of the larger commuter models, it seats 50 passengers. Only 30 of these Canadian-made planes were being used by the industry in 1981, but they ranked third in seats that were available to the commuting public. A somewhat smaller but faster model, the Dash 8, is a newcomer. Other popular planes now in use include the Brazilian Embraer Bandeirante, the Irish Shorts SD3-30 and two American-made planes - the Beech 99 and the Fairchild Metro. Various Models on the Way Among those expected to come out in 1983 and 1984 are the French-Italian Aerospatiale/Aeritalia ATR-42, a 46-seater that will sell for $5 million; the 30-seat Embraer 120, for $3.2 million; the 36-seat Shorts 360, priced at $3.25 million; the 19-seat British Jetstream 31, for $2.2 million, and the West German Dornier 228-100 and 228-200, seating 15 and 19, respectively, and selling for about $1.5 million each. ''The American companies have complained that we in the commuter industry have hampered their planes by failing to make up our minds about what we want,'' said Tulinda Deegan of the Regional Airline Association. ''That simply is not true. We desperately need planes in the 25- to 40-seat class.'' Steve Caine, a spokesman for Beech, said his company's 1900 model could help fill one of the gaps. This plane, which seats 19, is expected to be available late next year. Challenge of Maintenance The advantage of the overseas companies may be more apparent than real, Mr. Caine suggested in a telephone interview. ''Because we are here, we can offer better maintenance and other support to our customers, most of whom really need to keep those planes in the air,'' he said. ''The competitive problem,'' he said, ''is with Government subsidies given to some overseas planes for product development as well as for financing. We fully expect that the quality of our plane and the after-market support will make up for some of the differential.'' Richard A. Henson, president of Henson Aviation Inc. of Salisbury, Md., said there are sound reasons why foreign manufacturers are capturing much of the commuter airline business in the United States. ''They appreciate that we are growing and are well worth their time,'' he said, ''while the Americans seem to be saying, 'We're doing so well making money on corporate jets, why should we waste our time on commuters?' '' Seeking Customers' Ideas Mr. Henson, who has been in commercial aviation for more than 40 years, rejected the argument that foreign manufacturers would be unable to provide adequate maintenance. ''Even though they are based in Toronto, de Havilland has given fine service,'' he said. ''They come around frequently to ask us what we want in airplanes. Then they design them and come back again to get our comments. They just seem to care more.'' Meanwhile, the competition grows hotter. Aeromech Airlines of Clarksburg, W.Va., recently canceled a $5 million order for five Embraer 120's. ''We have decided we want to look around some more,'' said Charles Koukoulis, general manager of Aeromech. ''Personally, I think the French-Italian ATR-42 is the winner on the horizon now, but no corporate decision has been made yet.'' It's an industry where many decisions are still to come.

725-> ABOUT NEW YORK
The ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center is symbolic of a great many things about New York City. Like the thick, musty smell of heat rising from long-cold radiators, or the display of bathing suits and caftans known in department store windows as resort wear, the opening of the skating rink is a sure sign that winter has come to the city. The rink is also one of those places that is simply shorthand for a kind of glitter and glow that the city is thought to have, and so its small square of ice sunk amid skyscrapers is always turning up in movies and television programs as a quick and easy way of saying, ''This is New York.'' But in fact the skating rink is very much a certain kind of New York, in microcosm. It is beautiful and bright, with a devoted and sometimes critical contingent of regular patrons, a sure-fire crowd of tourists, and the requisite number of odd characters. It has a general manager transplanted from Chicago, a Bavarian-born skating instructor and five miles of refrigeration pipes beneath its concrete slab foundation. And from the moment that the rink officially opens this afternoon, it will have a cast of hundreds sketching figure eights on its surface, and an audience of thousands leaning over its metal railings, watching the skaters go round and round, with a soft slip-slip of skate blades on artificial ice. A season, and a tradition, will have begun again. ''This is the rink in the world,'' said Michael Traver, the manager, who arrived in New York only three weeks ago and still has that bedazzled look on his face that newcomers who will be happy here always have. The regulars have already taken to the ice, eyeing Mr. Traver suspiciously, for while the ceremonial opening is today, skaters have been using the rink since Saturday. ''How are you?'' they were saying yesterday, adjusting their skates, criticizing new music and the renovation of the dressing room, doing spins. The man in the gray flannel suit and the spit-and-polish black skates spun round with the woman in the Fair Isle cardigan and the knit gloves. The woman in the green knickers and the white sweater moved around quickly to the disco music - push, glide, push, glide, snap fingers, push. Above them the crowds gathered, their eyes going in circles, too, and growing glassy. ''This is New York,'' said one of a group of sailors in blue uniforms, hanging over the railing. Polly and Bertram Pollens stopped to scold Mr. Traver because of a recorded announcement that had said the rink would not open until next week, causing them to miss a day's skating. The Pollens skate at Rockefeller Center three or four times a week. Dr. Pollens is a psychoanalyst with an office nearby, and his wife says this gets him away from his work. ''This is our second home,'' said Mrs. Pollens. ''It's our way of life.'' Dr. Pollens hypothesized that the crowds lining the rink were going through a process of identification. ''They can imagine themselves doing all these spins and turns without doing them themselves,'' he said. Lots of famous people have skated at the rink since it opened in 1936, an afterthought in the grand plan for Rockefeller Center, a substitute for a rather pedestrian sunken plaza. Sonja Henie skated there, and John Curry, Steve Allen and Joan Crawford. Movies have been filmed there, and soap operas, and television pilots. Hans Altinger, the skating instructor who has been there for nearly 25 years and who first instituted the addition to the rink of motorized decoy ducks on rainy days, has steered any number of wobbly beauty queens around the ice. But perhaps the best-known person to skate at the rink is the Ice Princess, although Mr. Altinger dismisses her with a wave of the hand because she does not, in truth, skate very well. Mr. Traver admits that as soon as he came to town and said he was taking the Rockefeller Center job, people asked him, ''Do you know the Ice Princess?'' On Monday, the Princess herself came up to him and introduced herself. Even the regulars are not quite sure of the Princess's name. 'You may call me Princess,'' she told Mr. Traver, and that is what everyone else calls her. She wears serious skating outfits, sequined costumes with little flip skirts, occasionally a crown, and she goes to the center of the rink and performs movements with her hands, with her body, that at first could be mistaken for the movements of a professional skater but which are a kind of odd mime of such movements. Everyone knows the Princess, and everyone knows the rink at Rockefeller Center. It is one of the Thes of New York, like The Park, (Central), The Ferry (Staten Island), and The Tree (also at Rockefeller Center), the most emblematic parts of a city known, to many people, simply as The City. The rink itself is not so special, only a piece of ice 59 feet wide, 122 feet long, with the signatures of hundreds of skates in white on white upon it. But with the gray towers looming above it, almost dwarfing the sky, the edging of silver flagpoles with gilt balls on the top, the people going around and around and around and the people watching them do so - it is all like something built and produced in Hollywood, only better. Sometimes, the public-address system plays ''New York, New York,'' and the regulars move with a practiced sway and bob to the music. ''These little-town blues are melting away,'' Frank Sinatra sings, and it is all like a movie of what New York City is supposed to be like in the wintertime.

Thousands of utility customers are being asked to contribute an extra dollar with their bills this winter to help prevent the cutoff of heat to the poor. The voluntary programs generally supplement state laws or regulations prohibiting or limiting the elimination of service to people who fall behind in payments for gas or electricity in the heating season. A spot check Thursday showed that most plans were similar: Customers get a notice with their monthly bills, asking them to contribute $1 to a fund administered by a social service agency. The utility generally matches or adds to contributions. ''It means those in the community who are more fortunate can help those who are less fortunate pay their bills,'' said William T. Green of the Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company in Rock Island, Ill. Shareholders Donate $10,000 Company shareholders in the Iowa-Illinois program are donating $10,000 to get the plan started and are adding $1 for every $5 contributed by customers, up to $2,000 a month. A similar program started about six months ago by two Arizona utilities, the Arizona Public Service Company and the Salt River Project, raised $149,000 through September, according to Capt. Duane Decker, the Phoenix area administrator of the Salvation Army's Center for Social Services. Arizona Public Service and Salt River limit contributions to $1 per customer. A third Arizona utility, the Southwest Gas Corporation, announced its own program earlier this week and said it would accept donations of any size and would match them with up to $50,000. Utility officials said the recession and, in some cases, rate increases had increased the customer delinquency rate. Company spokesmen in most areas said they had turned off the power as a last resort. The Public Utility Commission in Ohio, like regulatory agencies in many states, has declared a moratorium on shutoffs from Dec. 1 to March 31 and has ordered restoration of services to some customers whose power has already been turned off for nonpayment. Gas and electric customers in Pennsylvania must be notified 10 days before the power is shut off.

727-> DANCE: LOUIS 'APERTIF' AND 'REPERTOIRE'
BECAUSE dance is an art of the present tense, it can sometimes be risky for choreographers to look back. Unless a choreographer is able to make something out of the past live again in the present, retrospection can be akin to spending an evening with some amiable, but garrulous, friend who insists on showing you every last photo he took on his summer vacation. Murray Louis looked backward in two different ways in the two new works that his Murray Louis Dance Company presented Wednesday at the Joyce. A whole era came to life in ''Aperitif,'' to piano music by Milhaud and Chabrier. Actually, it was an imaginary era that was reborn, for in ''Aperitif'' Mr. Louis drew on our fancies and visions of romantic Parisian cafes from the turn of the century to the day before yesterday. It was the twilight hour - ''l'heure bleu,'' as the French would say - in both Peter Koletzke's lighting scheme and Mr. Louis's choreography. Wearing bowlers on their heads and waggling their heads in a friendly greeting, Michael Ballard, Danial Shapiro, Rob McWilliams and William Gornel strolled into a cafe. They sustained acrobatic poses for a long time on the tables and chairs. But no one minded. Indeed, Joanie Smith, Betsy Fisher, Janis Brenner and Anne McLeod contemplated them with mild interest. Miss Smith and Miss Fisher danced a languid duet, and there was an equally languid solo for Miss Brenner. A solo for Miss McLeod began in a jiggly fashion, but it soon calmed down. In fact, everyone was calm in this cafe, and although the men and women could be said to be showing off for one another, they were never indiscreet. What made ''Aperitif'' a delight for dance watchers was its very calm. At times, Mr. Louis can be a manic choreographer, and his dancers can look like the best-trained jumping beans in the world. But here he was not afraid of long-held pauses and elegant poses, and all that stillness was as interesting as the motion. Mr. Louis put himself in perpetual motion in ''Repertoire (a Retrospective),'' his other premiere. This was not so much a new work as an anthology of solos choreographed by Mr. Louis since 1953. Film clips alternated with live sequences, and each solo was introduced with spoken commentary. Mr. Louis was looking back on his career, and because he possesses a strong stage presence and a prodigious technique, this autobiography in dance ought to have been exciting. Oddly enough, it wasn't. To be sure, it did reveal certain things about Mr. Louis's choreographic progress. For instance, even the earliest of the solos, ''Piper'' of 1953, displayed the concern for clearly articulated movement that remains an identifying characteristic of the Louis style. And dance after dance showed his love of multimedia effects. Thus, in his ''Antechamber'' of 1953, he danced with an ominous projected shadow, and, a decade later, in a film excerpt from ''Landscapes,'' the wizardry of camerawork wrapped misty shadows about him. Nevertheless, ''Repertoire'' disappointed. For one thing, the commentary was occasionally superficial, and it contained minor discrepancies, as when Mr. Louis at times gave both 1953 and 1955 as the year of his first full concert. More importantly, however, the solos tended to blur together. Yet the glory of a solo or a solo section in an ensemble piece is its very separateness. A solo enables a dancer to step forward and make a particular statement in space and time. By stringing several solos together, this sense of particularity was lost. Should Mr. Louis wish to revive old solos, he should go ahead and do so. But those solos should be treated as distinct entities, not as ingredients in a stew. Should he wish to give a lecture-demonstration on the creative process, using his own works as examples, that, too, might be a fine idea. However, it would require more illuminating commentary than that which accompanied ''Repertoire.'' The company also offered the season's first performance of ''Geometrics,'' a piece to electronic music by Alwin Nikolais in which Mr. Louis most definitely turns his dancers into jumping beans - into Cubist jumping beans, that is, for the choreography combines hoppety steps with sharp-angled gestures. It is all very antic, even slightly frantic, yet its demands never fazed the cast, and Mr. Ballard was fine in a solo that began with an awesomely deep kneebend and Mr. Shapiro was equally fine in another solo containing stretches and swings.

728-> ISRAELIS GETTING EINSTEIN'S PAPERS
The Hebrew University here has received the personal papers of Albert Einstein, a collection it said contains far more social and political commentary than scientific works. The university announced today that it would make the archives available to legitimate researchers and would publish a detailed catalogue of the 50,000 pages of material. The archives, which include letters to and from such figures as Sigmund Freud, Franklin D. Roosevelt and George Bernard Shaw, arrived here last week. Einstein, who lived from 1879 to 1955, willed the papers to the university's Jewish National University Library, but the executor of his literary estate kept them at Princeton University for 27 years. Einstein, who was born in Germany and became a naturalized American,had strong links to the early Zionist movement and later to the state of Israel. He turned down an offer to become Israel's first President, saying, ''I have neither the natural ability nor the experience necessary to deal with human beings and to carry out official functions.'' Einstein Helped Found University The university, which Einstein helped found in 1925, has been collecting Einstein memorabilia for years. Einstein himself gave the university the original draft of his general theory of relativity, written in 1916. The institution sponsored a symposium three years ago of Einstein's students and friends in which the professor's wit and humanity were frequently remembered. The Princeton University Press recently published an edition of the symposium papers.

729-> MUSIC NOTED IN BRIEF; Mira Zakai Appears In First Recital Here
Mira Zakai, a contralto from Israel with wide experience on the international orchestra circuit, made her first appearance as a recitalist in New York on Sunday night. Her program at Alice Tully Hall was short on vocal display for its own sake but long on musical difficulty and deep seriousness - with songs by Brahms, including the ''Vier ernste Gesange,'' and Schumann's Liederkreis (Op. 39). Miss Zakai's singing was an ambivalent combination of rich timbre, musical rectitude, wonderful dramatic projection and curiously flawed technique. Her diction, her eloquent portamento effects and her personal involvement made songs like Schumann's ''Fruhlingsnacht'' radiantly expressive experiences. Still, all Miss Zakai's music was compromised by a rapid, blurred vibrato. It was a problem that showed less in the shorter note values of Brahms's ''Der Gang zum Liebchen'' and ''Standchen,'' and one which she sometimes turned to advantage - especially in her straightened, quasi-choirboy delivery of Schumann's ''Auf einer Burg.'' The extended tones of Brahms's ''Dein blaues Auge,'' however, left this slightly unsteady and grating quality painfully exposed. Mikael Eliasen's accompaniments were clear - sometimes to the point of dryness - but his personality was an active and a positive force in all these songs. Bernard Holland

732-> SCOUTING; Marvelous Draw
Marvelous Marvin Hagler's sudden popularity in Massachusetts could make him unpopular with patrons of Fieldborough Travel and Leisure in England. The travel agency has been trying desperately to purchase at least 210 tickets for Hagler's defense of his middleweight boxing championship against Tony Sibson of England Feb. 11 in Worcester, Mass. However, the 13,500-seat Worcester Centrum was sold out within 24 hours after the fight was announced last Thursday. But the English fans are not alone. ''We have requests for 4,000 to 5,000 tickets from people who don't believe there are no tickets left,'' Bob Arum, the promoter, said yesterday. Arum attributes the heavy interest in the fight, in part, to the matchup of Hagler and Sibson. But more importantly perhaps, he sees Hagler as the new No.1 attraction in boxing, succeeding Sugar Ray Leonard, who announced his retirement last month. ''I really believe Ray has passed the mantle onto Hagler,'' Arum said. Arum, for one, is so convinced of Hagler's popularity that he is looking ahead to an even bigger New England show than the Sibson fight. If Hagler gets past Sibson and then Frank (The Animal) Fletcher in another title defense in May, Arum will schedule an outdoor fight for Hagler next summer in the 35,000-seat Marciano Stadium in Brockton, Mass., hometown of the late champion Rocky Marciano.

734-> A.T.& T. to Cut Construction Bill
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company said it planned to cut construction spending 2 percent next year, to $16.8 billion. Among other reasons, it cited a decision by the Federal Communications Commission that shifted responsibility for purchasing and providing new on-premise equipment from the Bell operating companies to American Bell, the new A.T.& T. subsidiary, as of Jan. 1. American Bell intends to sell rather than lease some of its on-premise equipment. Separately, A.T.& T. said it had agreed in principle that the Headquarters Companies, a privately held San Francisco telecommunications concern, would manage the public rooms for A.T.& T.'s Picturephone video conferencing service. There are 11 such public rooms now but the two companies have agreed to more than double that number.

735-> GEORGE A. SCHREIBER
George A. Schreiber, chairman of the Public Service Company of New Mexico, died Sunday at his home in Albuquerque, after a long illness. He was 63 years old. Mr. Schreiber joined the company in 1949 and was elected president in 1966. He was elected chairman of the board in 1974. Under his guidance, the company grew from a relatively unknown southwestern utility to become the only company from New Mexico listed on the New York Stock Exchange. He was appointed the first chairman of Albuquerque's Urban Renewal Commission in 1967 and was a member of the board of directors of the Albuquerque National Bank. He was a founder of Western Energy Supply and Transmission Associates and a board member of the Edison Electric Institute. He leaves his wife, the former Mary Cook; two sons, Peter F., of Phoenix, and George A. Jr. of Manhattan; a daughter, Mary T. Smith of Sheridan, Wyo.; and two grandchildren.

736-> HORSE RACING: AN INDUSTRY CONFRONTING TRANSITION
For the last 30 years, more Americans have attended thoroughbred races each year than baseball, basketball or football games at the college and professional levels. Attendance at the country's 92 sanctioned thoroughbred tracks last year was 56.1 million, and those who went wagered $7.6 billion on the races they watched. But those attendance and betting figures are not significantly higher than they were 10 years ago, and the tracks' operating costs since have increased at inflationary rates. As a result, some tracks have shut their gates permanently, others are perilously near that decision, and the survivors are frantically looking for new ways to promote and present the sport. Industry leaders are virtually unanimous in insisting that the sport itself is in no danger of seriously declining or disappearing. They point out that new First of two articles on shifting trends in thoroughbred racing. investors are paying exorbitantly high prices for race horses, that major races offer richer purses than ever, and that racing is on the verge of various advances in offtrack betting and telecasting that could lead to greater prosperity for the top tracks and horses. They also say that racing is just beginning to explore new markets, and that the possible expansion of the sport into several large Southern and Southwestern states by the end of this century could compensate for declines elsewhere in the country. This combination of change - severe trouble in some parts of the industry and suddenly promising developments in others - has put racing in America in the midst of a transformation greater than at any other time in its history. The trends that are altering the face and the future of the sport include: - Continued hardship among all but the largest tracks in the East and Midwest, with perhaps only half of those currently in operation likely to survive through the end of the century. - A continuing pattern of declining on-track attendance throughout the sport; fans are able to watch races on television and wager in offtrack betting parlors, gambling casinos and with legalized telephone betting accounts. - A further shift from New York to California as the power base of American racing, where the top horses will win and lose championships. - The legalization of racing in some states in the South and the Sun Belt and the development of significant racing and breeding centers there. - A severe financial realignment of the currently inflated breeding industry, which is producing more horses than will be required for racing and is dictating the premature retirement of race horses. ''Racing is beyond the Chicken Little syndrome where people keep predicting its impending doom,'' says R. Richards Rolapp, president of the American Horse Council, a Washington-based lobbying group and clearinghouse for the racing industry. ''The industry is focusing on real growth and development, and that means change, much of which is right around the corner.'' Most of that change stems from a radical conclusion that has been reached by many race-track operators in the last decade: racing has gone about as far as it can go in existing markets in terms of wooing patrons to spend a day at the races. The emphasis in the coming years will be on establishing new markets, and on developing new ways for people to watch and bet on horses without attending the races. Three Centuries of Racing Thoroughbred racing in America did not get off to a promising start. The first seven horses imported from England arrived at Jamestown plantation in Virginia in 1610, but contemporary accounts record that the stallion and six mares ended up on the settlers' dinner tables that winter. Forty-five years later, the first American race track was built, near what is now Nassau County on Long Island, and not far from the modern Belmont Race Track. Since those first races in 1655, thoroughbred racing has been a familiar part of the American sporting and cultural scene through races like the Kentucky Derby and horses such as Man o' War and Secretariat. Racing reached its zenith in the decade following World War II, when horses such as Citation, Native Dancer and Nashua captured the imagination of a free-spending public in a prosperous economy. The quality of racing improved dramatically in the 1940's and 1950's, as American money purchased the best stallions in Europe and imported the horses whose bloodlines have made the American throughbred the fastest in the world. Facing Increased Competition When racing began booming in the late 1940's, there was little competition for the gambling or sports dollar. But in the last 30 years, casinos in Las Vegas and then Atlantic City, as well as parimutuel-wagering sports such as greyhound racing and jai-alai, and state lotteries, opened a wide range of options to gamblers. And the rise of professional football, basketball and ice hockey gave fans who gambled on sports a new world of options. The newer gambling and sports attractions not only detracted from racing's fan base in general but seemed to draw away younger fans in particular. No major track has undertaken comparative surveys of its fans' median ages, but officials of the New York Racing Association, for example, say that the average age of their patrons has gone from about 40 years old to about 50 in the last 20 years. ''What's surprising is that racing wasn't hit even harder,'' says Gerard S. McKeon, president of the New York Racing Association, a non-profit trusteeship, chartered by the state, that operates Aqueduct Race Track, Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Track. ''We're feeling what happened then now. People used to be introduced to racing by a father or an uncle who played the horses. Now those fathers and uncles are football fans.'' Extended Seasons As attendance and betting began to level off in the early 1970's, most tracks attempted to compensate by extending their seasons, a move that was welcomed and encouraged by state legislatures, which had become dependent on the revenue generated by the sport. At most tracks, between 1 percent and 3 percent of the money wagered goes directly to state coffers. Last year in New York, for example, the state's commission on bets made at throughbred tracks amounted to more than $70 million. These extensions of the racing season at the slumping Northeastern tracks began an era of year-round racing, which has spread the horses and patrons thin. Last summer, the dangers of such extensions became clear, as four nearby tracks had overlapping schedules for the first time. Keystone Race Track, in northeastern Philadelphia; Monmouth Park, in Oceanport, N.J.; Atlantic City Race Course and Delaware Park, in Stanton, Del., ended up staging a four-way contest for fans and for horses, and all suffered severe drops in attendance, handle and racing quality. The competition was fatal for Delaware Park, an idyllic country track that had long been a resort-like spot where top stables from the Maryland shore had campaigned their horses in August. It was the home of major races in turf history such as the Delaware Handicap and Delaware Oaks. But last August, the track's board of directors announced that the track was no longer drawing enough patrons and wagers to meet its operating costs. The closing of Delaware Park shocked many racing fans and industry officials and served to underline the dangerous positions of other familiar tracks in the Northeast: - Last month, three tracks -Waterford Park in Chester, W.Va., Penn National Race Course in Grantsville, Pa., and Detroit Race Course - abruptly closed down, canceled a total of more than 150 racing dates for this winter, and announced they would not reopen until February at the earliest. The tracks cited unexpected drops in the betting handle, which they attributed to high unemployment in the local steel or automotive industries. - At Atlantic City Race Course, business has dropped off 20 percent in the last 10 years and has declined steadily since gambling casinos came to the area in 1978. Track officials have said that the track's future is in serious jeopardy. - In Maryland, where four tracks within 30 miles of one another - Bowie, Laurel, Pimlico and Timonium - have traditionally rotated racing dates, various legislative initiatives are pending that would permanently shutter one or two of the plants. - Hialeah Race Track near Miami, long considered the most palatial and picturesque of American tracks, has been in a steady decline for a decade. Average daily attendance has fallen from 15,488 in 1975 to 8,234 in 1981. Several racing groups in the state have begun a call for a state takeover of the track and its preservation as a historical park as the only way to sustain it. A Boom in California These gloomy trends in the East have served to stunt nationwide growth in attendance. The national figures have not declined only because of the spectacular ascendance of California. When a horse named Swaps came out of California to win the 1955 Kentucky Derby, it was the first time that the racing establishment took West Coast racing at all seriously. In the years since, however, California racing has risen so quickly that it now rivals New York as the power base of the sport. For the last three years, Hollywood Park, in Inglewood, Calif., and Santa Anita Race Track, in Arcadia, Calif., have surpassed New York tracks in showing the largest daily average attendance and on-track betting handle in the country. Easterners had long argued that the California racing times were the result of fast tracks and that the horses were a cut below those racing in the East. That position became almost untenable this year, when California-based horses won most of the richest and most prestigious races on the Eastern racing calendar, including the Kentucky Derby, Arlington Million, Woodward Stakes, Marlboro Cup, Jockey Club Gold Cup and Meadowlands Cup. Spectacular rises in attendance and betting have enabled the California tracks to offer the largest purses in the country and consequently attract top horses and jockeys there on a regular basis. This year, the five top money-winning trainers in the country all operated out of California, and four of the six richest races were presented at California tracks. New York and California racing officials say that flat comparisons in attendance and on-track handle between the two states are almost meaningless because of the presence in New York of offtrack betting, which is not legal in California. OTB an Influence Since 1971 Offtrack betting shops were first opened in New York in 1971 under the direction of five regional non-profit corporations, with the announced intention of driving illegal bookmakers out of business and raising more funds for the state and generating more fans for the sport. There are now 360 branches in the state. In 1981, $1.001 billion was bet at OTB on races at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga; patrons attending those races bet $891 million. OTB officials estimate that almost 100,000 New Yorkers bet each day. In one sense, the combined on-track and offtrack attendance and handle figures suggest that New York racing is richer and more popular than ever, but in fact the nature and distribution of OTB betting makes the offtrack bettor of little value to the race tracks. For each dollar wagered at the track, the N.Y.R.A. retains 10 cents, but it gets only 1.75 cents from each dollar wagered at OTB. Furthermore, the on-track bettor is likely to reinvest his betting stake several times in the course of the day; the offtrack bettor typically makes only one or two bets on his lunch hour. The result is that one on-track bettor is more valuable to the tracks than are 10 OTB players. But although the N.Y.R.A. spends $9 million a year advertising the pleasures of attending the races, its long-range forecasts indicate that offtrack betting is the only area for real growth. ''We don't think that we can sustain our caliber of racing with on-track attendance,'' says Mr. McKeon. ''We can either let the quality of New York racing slide, which we're not about to do, or we have to look elsewhere to stay where we are and grow.'' 'Simulcasting' Explored ''Elsewhere'' is ''simulcasting,'' the simultaneous telecasting of races into betting facilities away from the track. Because of the small fraction of OTB money that the N.Y.R.A. receives, it is exploring and implementing other forms of offtrack betting on which it would receive a larger piece of the action by eliminating the middleman. All of them involve the satellite transmission of races at Aqueduct, Belmont or Saratoga into facilities where betting is conducted - either existing race tracks and gambling casinos, or new racing theaters that would be the equivalent of race tracks without horses. Some of these new avenues have already been opened, with tentative but encouraging results. Last summer, as many as 28 race tracks across the country accepted betting on the featured Saturday or Sunday race in New York and then showed the race on television monitors throughout the track. The New York race was presented as an additional race on the track's program, and profits were split between the host track and the N.Y.R.A. Two tracks. Waterford Park and Caliente in Mexico, presented and took bets on full nine-race cards from New York. Since 1979, New York races have been piped into Teletrack, in New Haven, where fans wager through the Connecticut OTB pools and watch the races live on a 32-by-40 foot screen. Last year, the N.Y.R.A. realized about $5.5. million from the operation. There may also be enormous simulcasting possibilities involving the N.Y.R.A. and the Nevada casino industry. Compared to betting in the casinos and on professional sports, horse-race betting in Nevada is now a smaller scale operation, according to Charles F. DiRocco, whose Sports Form Inc. in Las Vegas is one of only two licensed disseminators of racing results in that state. Mr. DiRocco says that only about $125 million is wagered on horse races each year in Nevada casinos and sports-betting parlors. He says that 80 percent of that betting is on California races by California tourists, with only 15 percent going down on New York races. But he thinks that simulcasting those races into Nevada could increase the statewide betting tenfold, and the annual handle on New York races could jump from its current $20 million a year to as much as $250 million a year. He points out that the N.Y.R.A. now receives no revenue from that betting, and could receive at least $1 million a year to start. Deal for Nevada Sought Mr. DiRocco, who calls simulcasting ''the only salvation for the racing business,'' has spent three years and $500,000 of his own money trying to arrange for his firm to broadcast New York races into Nevada casinos and legal bookmaking shops. He says, and former N.Y.R.A. officials confirm, that he was close to an arrangement two years ago that would have given the N.Y.R.A. a $2,000-a-day fee for the use of the broadcast signal of the races, but that the N.Y.R.A. drew back because of fears that the signal would be pirated and sent into every bookmaking parlor in the state. The N.Y.R.A. is now negotiating with individual casinos because it wants to send the races into only the larger and classier casinos in the state. Mr. McKeon sees this type of simulcasting arrangement - the transmission of nine races a day from New York into other states -as the most profitable one for the N.Y.R.A. He also thinks that it could, in the next decade, begin to replace live racing at some of the financially tenuous tracks in the East. ''There are tracks that are not going to make it through the next decade,'' Mr. McKeon says. ''I'm sorry that they'll go, but I'd be foolish not to say that they would be logical places for simulcasting theaters. Breeding groups and trainers and owners will be opposed, because they won't have anywhere to race their horses. But those tracks are probably going to close anyway. It's better for the state to receive some revenue.'' --------------------------------------------------------------------- Tomorrow: Expanding markets.

738-> RECITAL: DIMITRI SGOUROS, 13, MAKES A DEBUT AS PIANIST
VERY few 13-year-old pianists are ready for a New York debut, let alone one at Avery Fisher Hall. But, in what must be a record of sorts, Dimitri Sgouros's Sunday evening recital, with the violinist Erick Friedman, lasted three hours and contained, among other works, two crushingly difficult warhorses - Brahms's Variations on a Theme by Paganini and Schumann's Symphonic Etudes. Dimitri Sgouros is an amazing 13-year-old - a genuine prodigy. His playing has a youthful spring to it - a dextrous contrapuntal command and elasticity, and more than a touch of poetry. At all times there is an ingratiating and exciting dynamism to his phrasing. Yet he is still an immature artist. He often overestimated his virtuosity and played certain passages at such a speed as to render them blurred and meaningless. He also suffers from an occasional lack of structural focus, and treats his showpieces as if they are hurdles on an obstacle course. But there was no reason for such a lengthy and tortuous concert in the first place, except to present this likable, sweet-faced child as the pianistic equivalent of a decathalon runner. Such circus tricks are demeaning to a pianist of Dimitri Sgouros's ability. He has incalculable gifts and should be allowed to nurture them. It would be a tragedy if this brilliant but still developing talent were pushed too firmly into the spotlight before allowing him to reach the peak of his abilities. Mr. Friedman, a sensitive and accurate violinist, offered music by Paganini and Bach on the solo violin, and joined with the pianist for a tender and dramatic rendition of the Franck Sonata in A.

740-> TV: MOLLY PICON STARS IN VIGNETTE ABOUT SENILITY
THERE is one big reason for watching the little film that is on WNBC-TV tonight at 7:30. ''Grandma Didn't Wave Back'' is about an 11-year-old girl and her reactions to the fact that her treasured grandmother is sliding into senility. The girl, Debbie, is nicely played by Lara Berk, who currently is appearing as Tessie in the film version of ''Annie.'' But the extra and special ingredient is Molly Picon in the role of the grandmother. Miss Picon, of course, is the veteran actress whose credits encompass vaudeville and the Yiddish and Broadway theaters. She knows all the tricks of the acting trade and she puts them to good use in the half-hour portrait. Produced and directed by Tom Robertson for Multimedia Program Productions, ''Grandma Didn't Wave Back'' is slight, little more than a hazy vignette filmed through an exceptionally fuzzy filter. But Miss Picon wonderfully knows how to, as they say, tug at the heartstrings. With a background of sea and gulls, the girl remembers how she used to walk along the beach with her grandmother, an always-vibrant woman. But when her grandfather died, Grandma became curiously distant. Eventually, she and her few belongings, her ''chochkas,'' were moved into Debbie's home. But old age continued its distressing advance. Grandma began to confuse the past and the present. She became forgetful and careless. Her children talked of putting her ''away.'' Debbie is puzzled and hurt but intensely protective of the older woman. She likes the chochkas, the beautifully crocheted shawls that nobody seems to care about nowadays. But Grandma is clever enough to advise her that she mustn't be trapped in the past. Things are always changing ''when you grow up, and the change is forever.'' The fact is, Grandma notes, ''we dance to the music of our own time.'' There is nothing overwhelming here, but Miss Picon makes this short film something special.

742-> What's New in Consumer Research; WHEN PIZAZZ PAYS OFF
There is growing consternation on Madison Avenue because some advertisers are beginning to think they are spending huge sums of money unnecessarily on commercials. Why the second thoughts? One answer: David Vadehra. Mr. Vadehra's new consumer research service, Campaign Monitor, suggests that the more creative - unusual, striking, imaginative - the commercial, the less it costs an advertiser to get people to remember it. Mr. Vadehra, president of Video Storyboards/Campaign Monitor of New York, believes that companies airing dull or abrasive advertising are being penalized financially because they have to compensate for their lack of imagination by spending more to reach consumers. ''It pays to be creative,'' says Mr. Vadehra. ''Memorable commercials get the public's attention more easily. You don't have to run them as often to make your point.'' That may seem an obvious point, but Mr. Vadehra's effort to quantify creativity has drawn considerable interest on Madison Avenue. Over a three-month period last spring, the Vadehra study asked 1,000 television viewers to list the commercials they had seen in the course of a week that had made an impression. These ''retained consumer impressions'' were then arranged by brand and category. Dividing the advertiser's weekly television budget by retained impressions, Mr. Vadehra arrived at the cost per 1,000 retained consumer impressions. This figure serves as a common denominator and allows him to compare each brand in a category using the same standard. The commercials remembered by respondents were not necessarily the most creative. Often, consumer recall of a commercial is not due to the ad's cleverness but to a multimillion-dollar media blitz. The key question, Mr. Vadehra says, is how much money had to be spent to tattoo the sales pitch on America's subconscious. In the auto market, for example, Mr. Vadehra found, on average, that in the second quarter of 1982, Chevrolet, Ford and Chrysler ads had to be seen 25 percent more than Toyota's to gain the same number of retained consumer impressions. Ford's commercials alone had to be seen 50 percent more than Toyota's to reach the same level of public attention. ''Detroit's advertising, despite its heavy expenditures, fails to make an impact on consumers,'' says Mr. Vadehra. ''All U.S. auto makers' commercials look alike. With the huge amounts of money the Big Three spend on television, they could change the world. But, as the numbers show, there's a great deal of waste in their ad budgets.'' To be sure, some marketing people question whether even the most creative advertising backed by the largest media budget could alter the American public's negative perception of American cars. A similar picture of inefficiency emerges in the fast-food arena, Mr. Vadehra's research shows. McDonald's ''You Deserve a Break Today'' ads in the second quarter had to be seen almost twice as often as Burger King's to generate the same level of retained impressions. Mr. Vadehra believes that people were tuning out McDonald's ads and responding favorably to Burger King's ''Aren't you hungry?'' campaign. The Burger King ads used sophisticated photography to sell the burger as a product rather than as a somewhat nebulous eating experience. Burger King's taste appeal strategy was so successful that McDonald's and other competitors adopted the same approach this fall. The Vadehra study also showed Seven-Up's success in exploiting its lack of caffeine. Its new ads provided health information, stressing a long-dormant sales point. On the other hand, the Vadehra study found ''Pepsi Challenge'' ads less productive because they used an old-fashioned hard-sell approach. According to the report, the ''Pepsi Challenge'' ads had to be seen 55 percent more than Seven-Up's spots to attain comparable memorability.

743-> COUPLE ADOPT 67-YEAR-OLD
A 67-year-old woman who was born in a home for the retarded has been adopted, and now goes to church on Sunday and swims at the Y.W.C.A. with a childless couple she calls Mom and Dad. Frank Pollin, 54 years old, and his wife, Diana, 38, who have been married five years, tried to adopt a child, but ''because of his age, they wouldn't let us,'' Mrs. Pollin said. Mrs. Pollin started baby-sitting but, she said, ''I wanted more - I wanted someone to take care of at night.'' They decided to adopt Margaret Rice, a retarded woman with diabetes whom they met at Lakeland Village, a home for the retarded and handicapped. Miss Rice's mother and brother lived and died at the home. Weighs 95 Pounds Miss Rice, who is called ''Peto,'' has the mind of a 4-year-old. She is 3 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 95 pounds. ''Peto was born at Lakeland,'' Mrs. Pollin said. ''As far as we know, so were her two sisters and brother.'' The Pollins became Miss Rice's sponsor, responsible for making sure she had birthday and Christmas gifts. In July, when Lakeland decided to transfer Miss Rice and her mother to a rest home, the Pollins filed for guardianship and later adoption. After weeks of waiting, they became Miss Rice's legal guardians and she arrived at their home Sept. 1. In October, Miss Rice's 98-year-old mother died at Lakeland and the Pollins arranged the funeral. Has Toys and a Phone Now, Miss Rice thrives on life at home, where she has her own room, a new wardrobe, toys and a phone. ''When I go to bed, I call her and tell her good night,'' Mrs. Pollin said. ''She says, 'Good night Momma-day, tell Daddy good night.' '' She also enjoys the three youngsters Mrs. Pollin cares for each weekday. ''They spend hours talking 4-year-old talk,'' Mrs. Pollin said. Mr. Pollin is retired from the military. The Pollins receive $200 a month in assistance for Miss Rice, who is covered for major medical expenses by Medicare. A newborn could not have provided as much, Mrs. Pollin said. ''After they made Peto, they threw away the mold.''

744-> AROUND THE NATION; College Found at Fault In Discrimination Suit
Albany State College, a predominantly black school, practiced racial discrimination in passing over a white man to name a black woman as chairman of its history department, a judge has ruled. The decision was reached by County Judge Eugene Black Jr. of Dougherty National news is on pages A16-28 and B8-12. County, serving as a special master in an equal employment complaint. Dr. John Moore was one of two whites passed over for the chairmanship when the school selected Dr. Veula Rhodes. However, Judge Black focused on the elimination of the other white candidate, Dr. Jesse Silverglade of Miami, who was not a party to the complaint. He said the job should have gone to Dr. Silverglade rather than Dr. Rhodes or Dr. Moore, who filed the complaint. But Judge Black said he could not order relief because Dr. Silverglade was not a party to the complaint, which was filed under requirements of the Georgia Board of Regents.

745-> EVERYTHING CHANGES ON THE CAVALIERS BUT THE FACE OF FAILURE
RICHFIELD, Ohio EUGENE and Frank, a pair of program vendors, were leaning against a wall in the mezzanine of the Coliseum here. It was in the first quarter of last Wednesday night's quiet game against the Knicks. From their vantage point, the vendors could gaze upon the canyon of empty yellow and brown seats, nearly 18,000 of them. Scattered about was an announced crowd of 2,114, though the figure seemed as inflated as the basketball. ''We used to have 60 vendors working a game, with about 20 on beer,'' said Eugene. ''I'm talking about just a few years ago. People were hollering and jumping.'' A man, looking suspiciously like a cash customer, came in from an entranceway, carrying a cup of beer. As he passed the program vendors, he noticed the red-lighted score on the scoreboard, 23-11, in favor of the Knicks. ''Oh,'' he said, ''the Cavs are catching up.'' ''How 'bout a program?'' asked Frank. ''What for?'' said the patron. ''Half the players will probably be gone before I get to my seat.'' The Cavaliers never caught the Knicks, and they lost their 14th game in 16 attempts this season, the worst record in the National Basketball Association. But at least none of the players were traded away during the game. To followers of this team, it seems even the outrageously unlikely is probable. Their lowest point came in the Portland game. Only a minute and a half into the game, the Cavaliers were down, 6-2, but Tom Nissalke, the coach, called a timeout. ''I knew this game was going to last two weeks,'' he said. ''I never had a feeling like this in 25 years of coaching.'' The Cavaliers lost by 50 points. In the last two seasons, or since Ted Stepien bought the club and became majority stockholder of the public corporation, 39 players have worn the uniform of the Cavaliers - 23 last season, for the highest turnover of any team in the league. The Cavaliers have also changed coaches six times in the last three years. They had gone from winning 37 games three seasons ago, to 28 two seasons ago to 15 last season. They've become perhaps the worst club and most poorly run franchise in professional basketball, only because they have seemed to have worked so hard and resourcefully to achieve these lows. ''This team,'' said Harry Weltman, in his first year as executive vice president of operations, ''made some terrible deals. No, not just terrible -I'd say the worst in history.'' Stepien obtained players who had never really made an important mark in pro ball and paid them huge salaries on long-term contracts - for four and five years. The Cavaliers traded away No.1 draft picks for players who didn't produce or didn't stick around very long. One, Jerome Whitehead, was gone within eight days. Things became so embarrassing in 1980 that the league office felt it necessary to call Stepien in and put a moratorium on trades by the Cavaliers. Several years before, the Cavaliers had become respectable. In fact, good. The Cavaliers had been an expansion team in 1970 and had been a league joke, but in the 1975-76 season, under Coach Bill Fitch, they had a 49-33 record and lost to Boston in the Eastern Conference final, four games to two. Attendance at the Coliseum hit a peak the following season when the team made the playoffs again - losing in the first round - and drawing an average of 12,738 fans, second best in the league. This season, attendance is down to about 4,700 a game, and only the Indiana Pacers, who have put a curtain over a large part of their stands, are drawing poorer. The Cavaliers seem to have dug themselves a particularly large cavity. Dallas and Detroit, for example, were bad teams for several years but improved dramatically with top college draft choices; they now are competitive. However, the Cavaliers do not have a first-round draft pick until 1987. In the three years of the reign of Stepien, the president of the Cavaliers, the team has compiled a record of 45 victories and 136 defeats. What happened? What went wrong? ''I picked people to handle things who I trusted and thought were sincere,'' said Stepien. ''But we made mistakes. And I take the responsibility.'' Ted Stepien sits along the baseline to the side of one basket. Nearby is the Cavaliers' bench. Stepien is 57 years old, wears glasses and has a roundish, jowly face. Sometimes his view of the game is obstructed by the wine-and-yellow pompons shaken by his Teddie Bears, the team's cheerleaders who are encamaped under the basket. Stepien likes the seat, particularly since it is close to the Cavaliers' bench. ''I like,'' he said, ''to be involved.'' He bought the club because of his long-time interest in sports - he was an all-city basketball player in Pittsburgh - and because he admits it gave him some recognition. ''When I walked down the street, I used to be an unrecognized millionaire,'' he said some time ago. ''Now I'm a recognized millionaire.'' Being the owner of the Cavaliers also has helped his other business, the one that turned him from a poor boy, the son of Polish immigrants, into a rich man. He founded National Advertising Services, which places recruitment advertising in newspapers across the country. Once, he said, Christmas was just an orange and a nickel. Now, he has a 36-foot powerboat, a 17-acre estate, a limousine, a bodyguard, gold watches and large diamond rings. But he wanted more. He wanted the fame that came with owning a sports team. He delighted in giving parties for his clients in the 16 N.B.A. cities where he has offices, inviting his players and coaches. So what if, before the game, he banged open the locker-room door and, while the coach was diagramming a play, reminded the players about the party after the game? And he was the No.1 man, making decisions without sometimes telling his coach or player personnel director - sometimes even taking advice on player matters from salesmen in his advertising company. He could be a virtual spendthrift with player contracts, and then be niggling about other matters. ''I like Ted Stepien very much, but I told him to his face that sometimes he has no idea how to run a basketball team,'' said Bill Musselman, who was dismissed six weeks ago as his coach and player personnel director. ''I mean, I'd tell him we had to have someone scout a team. He'd say, 'You have to?' And then he'd decide who. I remember once he had one of his salesmen scout Phoenix for us. It began, 'The forwards line up on opposite sides of the floor. ...' I couldn't believe it. I threw it right in the trash basket.'' And if Stepien didn't know much about the N.B.A. - and he admits it -then he wasn't so terrific on public relations either. Shortly after he bought the club, an interview with him ran in ''Rave,'' the publication of the Richfield Coliseum. When asked about changes he wanted to make, he commented: ''This is not to sound prejudiced, but half the squad would be white. I think people are afraid to speak out on the subject. White people have to have white heroes. I myself can't equate to black heroes. I'll be truthful. I respect them, but I need white people. It's in me - and I think the Cavaliers have too many blacks, 10 of 11. You need a blend of white and blacks. That draws, and I think that's a better team.'' The team is still predominately black, but it happens that perhaps the best player now is white - Scott Wedman, a good but not great 6-foot-7-inch forward whom Stepien signed as a free agent in 1981 for $4 million for five years. Stepien was heavily criticized for those remarks. ''I'm no racist,'' he said. And he seems to act toward blacks with humanity and a ready checkbook. When players are in trouble, they find him an easy man to talk to - and to borrow from. Even those players making half a million dollars a year. ''Ted's biggest asset and biggest problem,'' said Musselman, ''is that he's a soft touch. When I tried to discipline the players, he'd say in the morning, 'Fine, suspend the guy.' Then in the afternoon the guy would talk to him and tell him his personal problems and Ted would rescind the suspension.'' Stepien, whose wife died of cancer three years ago, has six daughters with whom he has a close relationship. And recently, he has been suffering the slings and arrows of a disapproving local press. ''I've been getting picked on a lot,'' he said, ''and I'll be frank, it hurts. I don't like to hear and read things about me that can hurt my family. Owning a ball team is not worth it if my children are going to be taunted in school, like they have been. Like one radio announcer, he said, 'Ted Stepien is a pimple on my body,' and 'The people who work for Ted Stepien are prostitutes.' How can people get away with stuff like that? ''The fact is, I took over a club from Nick Miletti that was going down. He couldn't pay his bills. When he left, so did the coach, Stan Albeck. He ran the draft for us in 1980 and the next day announced he was going to coach San Antonio.'' Stepien needed a coach, and hurriedly hired Musselman, who had won a Big 10 championship with Minnesota. Musselman coached into the beginning of last season, when he was moved into the front office. After Chuck Daly, Don Delaney and Bob Kloppenburg had brief runs at the job, Musselman returned as coach but would soon be dropped again. Some people blame the Cavaliers' failures on Musselman, who some critics believe gave Stepien bad advice. ''Ted wanted a playoff team right away, that's what he kept talking about,'' said Musselman, ''and I tried to get the best available as quickly as I could.'' Stepien says: ''Bill Musselman and I worked well together. I consider him a good friend, and I believe he did the best job he could. I have nothing bad to say about Bill.'' Now, according to some, Stepien has made the best decision of his three-year career as majority stockholder of this public corporation: He is trying to sell the club. He says he has lost $7 million to $8 million over the last three years, and he projects a loss of $4 million more this year. He says he wants to sell the club for $12 million. ''A logical buyer,'' he says, ''are the Gund Brothers.'' George and Gordon Gund own the arena. Stepien says all other prospective buyers have shied away from purchasing the team because of where the arena is situated, 22 miles from downtown Cleveland. A Cleveland resident for the last 35 years, Stepien, says he would like to keep the club in Cleveland, but if he must sell it to people of another city, he would. Meanwhile, he is thinking of moving the club into Cleveland to play at the 8,500-seat Public Hall. ''It's a tragedy that the arena was built so far away from town,'' Stepien says of the Coliseum. The arena was constructed in 1974. But others observe that when there is an attraction worth attending, the Coliseum fills up. Next week, a concert with The Who is sold out. And the Ice Capades have played to record-breaking crowds. Joseph Graham, the president of the arena, asked: ''Were we in a poor location when they had seven straight sellouts during the 1975-76 playoffs? Give us the product and we will bring in the people.'' In the stands for the Knick game were a group of men who see most of the home games, and have for years. ''We're here whenever we don't have bowling night,'' said Fran Klco. ''Why do we come?'' said Lou Oress. ''Because we want to support the team so it won't leave Cleveland.'' ''Look at that,'' said Mr. Klco. ''They lost the ball again. That's 16 times in the first quarter that they've come down the floor and turned the ball over without getting off a shot.'' A few minutes later, a Cavalier forward, Cliff Robinson, had his shot blocked. ''Do we count that a shot if he got the ball stuck back in his face?'' asked Mr. Oress. ''Well,'' said Mr. Klco, ''he did get it off.'' Such small nuggets of optimism in an otherwise gloomy setting are what fans such as Mr. Klco and Mr. Oress seek. They are not much different from the people on the club. ''What we are trying to do now,'' said Coach Nissalke, ''is not panic. We've got to bite the bullet and try to keep the team stabilized.'' Nissalke, a veteran of 16 seasons as a coach in the N.B.A. and the American Basketball Association, took over the club one week before the season started. ''When I came here,'' he said, ''there was a tremendously oppressive atmosphere on the team.'' In training camp, there had been a near-revolt among the players, complaining of the disciplinary tactics of Musselman. Bobby Wilkerson, the 6-7 guard who signed a $700,000 contract, was suspended when he and Musselman had a confrontation over wind sprints. James Silas left camp complaining of sundry ailments; Robinson was openly disappointed that he had to stay in Cleveland when the Cavaliers matched Houston's offer sheet for him. And Geoff Huston was grumbling because he was the fifth guard. When Nissalke took over, some peace returned. Among his moves was restoring Huston to a starting role. ''I think Geoff can be one of the best guards in the league,'' said Nissalke. ''And I believe he can provide the leadership we need on the court.'' He also cited the return of James Edwards, the 7-foot center who had been injured, as important, along with a body-strengthening program. ''James weighs about 240 pounds,'' said Nissalke. ''I'd like him at about 250 - a strong 250.'' ''Too often,'' said Nissalke, ''we play one-on-one basketball. We don't have the talent for that. We've got to play team ball or we won't win at all.'' Huston echoes this, and adds: ''You can't get depressed. I've got to think that I'm being paid a certain amount of money and the fans are paying 13 bucks a ticket to see me play. I've got to give them and my boss their money's worth. And if we all think that way, I think the team can win some games.'' One hope for the future, said Harry Weltman is the free-agent market. ''We've got about six or seven players whose contracts are up,'' he said. ''And so there will be room on the roster for new players. And Ted has always been willing to spend some money to get talent.'' To a club executive, Stepien said recently, ''Don't worry, I can run the Cavs.'' ''Anyone can run the Cavs,'' the executive said. ''The trick is running it well.''

746-> BRIEFING
The Meese Connection T he Moss Institute, a new organization to research the future in behalf of what it calls the ''meat-and-potatoes man,'' has been quietly guided in its first year by its interim executive director, Ursula Meese. Her resume, which lists many previous administrative posts, including deputy probation officer in Oakland, Calif., makes no mention, however, of the fact that she is the wife of Edwin Meese 3d, counselor to President Reagan. Women these days tend not to trade much on such connections and some people in Washington haven't yet made the association, an aide says. But when someone does ask whether Ursula Meese is related to Edwin Meese, her favorite response is: ''Only by marriage. His daughter is my niece's cousin.'' Search for Information I t has been almost 16 years since Bernard B. Fall, a journalist and historian whose extensive writings about Vietnam brought criticism from doves as well as hawks, was killed by a Vietcong mine while patrolling with American marines. But Mr. Fall, who was a professor of international relations at Howard University, remains the subject of hot debate. Since 1979 his wife, Dorothy, has been trying with little success to obtain files on him from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. One of the main reasons Mrs. Fall, a graphic designer, wants the material is so she can finish the book about her husband that she began in 1970. The Government, which at one time sought to prove that Mr. Fall, who retained French citizenship, was a foreign agent, has provided some of the documents. Among them were 652 largely blacked-out pages from the F.B.I. But the agencies have generally resisted Mrs. Fall's request on the ground that national security would be compromised; they have asked a court to rule that they have met their obligations under the Freedom of Information Act. Mrs. Fall has now asked that the court privately review the files to see whether, in fact, their release could be damaging. ''I can tell it's biographical information about him that's common knowledge,'' Mrs. Fall said of some of the heavily censored material she has been given. ''People always hear that the public is forever harassing the Government'' over the Freedom of Information Act, she added. But of the problems of those making requests, she said, ''They have no idea.'' A Question of Energy T here was a certain novelty about the meeting yesterday of the board of Americans for Energy Independence. In the past, the energy situation has dominated discussion at most meetings. But yesterday a more pressing problem was at the top of the agenda. Should the sevenyear-old coalition of nuclear-oriented companies and labor organizations disband? ''The energy problem hasn't gone away but the oil glut and the Government have created a perception that it has,'' said the group's executive director, Elihu Bergman. ''Therefore, it's much more difficult for an outfit like ours to raise money.'' Two of the coalition's biggest supporters, General Electric and Westinghouse, have decided they will no longer make more than token contributions to its budget, which was about $375,000 this year. ''I don't have a safety net,'' said Mr. Bergman, who presides over a staff of six, including four part-timers. ''I'll be out on the street if this thing folds.'' In the end, the board fell back on the classic Washington solution to its problem. It deferred a final decision until March. World War I Premiums T he Veterans Administration didn't appear to be doing anything overly generous when it announced that, as of New Year's Day, veterans of World War I would no longer have to pay premiums on their life insurance policies. Since the war ended 65 years ago, this suggested that it was talking about a small group of people mostly well into their 80's. Actually, the World War I program remained open to servicemen, war veterans or not, until 1940. Thus, explained a V.A. official, Paul A. Koons, there are some 27,000 of the policies still in force, some of which pay dividends higher than their annual premiums. The regulations are being changed in favor of policyholders to save on the high administrative costs of the 1980's. Robert D. Hershey Jr. Lynn Rosellini

The G. Heileman Brewing Company said it had reduced the number of Pabst Brewing Company shares it was seeking under a current tender offer to 4.25 million.

748-> Yugoslav Devaluation
Yugoslavia has devalued the dinar by 16 percent in a move intended to increase exports. It was the latest in a series of Government measures to prop up the faltering economy. Yugoslavia owes more than $19 billion to the West and has been suffering from falling production, rising unemployment and surging inflation. The central bank said the dinar sank on Friday to 1.59 cents from Thursday's level of 1.9 cents and was thus adjusted against other currencies.

749-> THE WORLD IN SUMMARY; Foes of Army Win in Uruguay
Uruguay used to be so stable and prosperous that it was called the Switzerland of South America. It even copied the Swiss-style collective executive. But that made for such ineffective government that when the country became engulfed in guerrilla warfare and economic trouble in the early 70's, the army stepped in and another dictatorship was born. Last week, Uruguay made a first move to restore democracy by voting in primary elections for the 500 leaders of three approved parties who will choose presidential candidates for an election in November 1984. In most cases, opposition candidates won over those backing the Government. In addition to a rightist group called the Civic Union Party, the accepted parties are the traditional ones in Uruguayan politics, the Blancos and the Colorados. Christian Democrats, Socialists and Communists were banned.

750-> SCOUTING; Ring Ratings Win
Even in New York, such football stars as Wesley Walker, Harry Carson, John Riggins and Mark Haynes were outdrawn in the television ratings game by such boxers as Tyrone Crawley, James Broad, Livingstone Bramble and James (Bubba) Busceme. The striking National Football League Players Association all-star game in Washington drew an overnight 3.0 rating and 9 percent audience share on Channel 9 locally. Its main sports opposition - fights on both CBS and NBC - did much better. The CBS fights, which featured Broad defeating an even-lesser-known heavyweight, Donny Long, and Crawley outpointing Gene Hatcher, drew a 5.7 rating and 17 percent share. Bramble's decision over Busceme on NBC received a 5.0 rating and 15 percent share. Michael Katz Roy S. Johnson

JUDY VAN DER VEER RAMONA, Calif., Nov. 24 (AP) - Judy Van der Veer, a novelist and poet who wrote about ranch life and the San Diego foothills she called home for 63 years, died Monday at her farm here. She was 75 years old. Miss Van der Veer's first work was ''The River Pasture,'' in 1936, followed two years later by ''Brown Hills,'' which was praised in The New York Times as ''something rare and lovely.'' Here other works included ''Hold the Rein Free'' and ''Higher Than the Arrow.'' She also wrote children's books, including ''The Wandering Pig'' and ''To the Rescue.''

752-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Giving Thanks W anda Levine, who lives near Third Avenue and 23d Street, finally got off yesterday for a family Thanksgiving in Virginia - a day late but already giving thanks. Unable to make her plane at Newark Airport on Tuesday evening, because of a Holland Tunnel mishap, Miss Levine was phoning her mother from a booth in the Port Authority Bus Terminal when she found her wallet missing. First she burst into sobs. Then somebody helped her find the police and they told her to stay put. ''A young man in a wheelchair stuck around to see if I was O.K.,'' she said, ''and lent me a dime for a local call.'' Sooner than seemed possible, the Port Authority police took her to confront a ''screaming and struggling'' young woman. A search turned up the wallet. The police, Miss Levine said, helped her call her mother back ''and got me a ginger ale and some aspirin.'' They told her, she said, that a suspect was seized so quickly because while she was on the phone, a man watching from a terminal restaurant went to the police with a detailed description.''They were following the girl before I even went for help,'' Miss Levine said. The wallet was held for evidence. Miss Levine could not thank the strangers, only the police team, Michelle Grabley and Mike Kormash. ''They both told me,'' she said, ''what a rarity it is for a bystander to get involved, even a little bit.'' Robin Herman Laurie Johnston

754-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Staying Close to Home, Gastronomically T he heaps of turkeys in butchers' windows and supermarket freezers dwindled fast yesterday and the trimmings went home with them to holiday tables. But such vegetables as radicchio, endive, mache, white asparagus and other New York exotica - including lettuce or tomatoes from the Sun Belt or Mexico - were better left in the stores, according to Dr. Joan Gussow, a professor of nutrition at Teachers College. The Pilgrims feasted on local food of the season, and the season is just the time, Dr. Gussow said, for Northeasterners to get back to their roots: yams, potatoes, carrots, parsnips, rutabagas and other turnips. The logic also embraces pumpkins, squash, nuts, kale, leeks and - if they are local - cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. ''The Pilgrims may have been pretty dependent on the Indians for that first dinner,'' Dr. Gussow said, ''but never on stale, overpriced produce from distant places.'' An uncooked cranberry apple relish could play ''the refreshing role'' of a salad, she suggested. And it ''makes sense'' that pumpkin, apple and mince are the holiday pies. What was Dr. Gussow cooking for her family? ''To tell you the truth,'' she said, ''I'm eating at my sister-in-law's.''

755-> NETS SQUANDER LEAD AND FALL TO CLIPPERS
The Nets' two-game winning streak ended tonight when they were defeated by the San Diego Clippers, 114-109, at the Sports Arena. The defeat dropped the Nets to 7-8. The Clippers, meanwhile, gained only their third victory against 10 losses. The Nets led by as many as 11 points in the second half and by 90-85 going into the final period. The Clippers did not take the lead until Terry Cummings hit a turnaround jumper from the right side with 4 minutes 30 seconds left. That put the Clippers ahead, 100-98. San Diego extended the lead to 106-100 on baskets by Cummings and Lionel Hollins and two free throws by Michael Brooks. They maintained control after Larry Brown, the Nets' coach, was called for a technical foul with less than two minutes left as the Nets were about to retrieve a bad pass by the Clippers. Randy Smith, who finished with 21 points, hit the free throw and sealed the victory with a 22-footer with 33 seconds left. Cummings led the Clippers with 25 points; Hollins added 20. For the Nets, Otis Birdsong had 29 points. Buck Williams had 20. Cummings at Small Forward Paul Silas, the Clippers' coach, started Cummings, the team's first selection in the most recent collegiate draft, at small forward instead of his normal power-forward postion. Silas switched Tom Chambers back to the power position that he had played impressively last season, his first in the league. ''Tom wasn't comfortable out there,'' Silas said before the game. ''And Terry, well, soon he's going to be the ultimate power forward. He hasn't yet gotten into the flow of our system, but with his natural talent, he hasn't had any problems adjusting to the league.'' Coming into the game, Cummings, who left De Paul University last spring after his junior year, was ranked seventh in the league in scoring with an average of 23.4 points a game and ninth in rebounding at 10.5. ''He thinks there's nothing he can't do.'' Silas said. ''And even I was surprised. He's a much better shooter than I anticipated. He's a good ball handler and passer.'' Nets Counter With King With the lineup change by the Clippers, Cummings, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and 220 pounds, was matched against the Nets' Albert King. Williams guarded Chambers. King scored the Nets' first points, but it was Birdsong who led the opening spurt. Birdsong, who had 17 points in the first quarter Tuesday night against the Warriors, scored 13 points from the field tonight as the Nets took a 32-29 lead. The opening period was a frustrating one for Cummings, who was held scoreless by King. Even though the Clippers are a young team, leadership is provided by the two veteran guards, Hollins and Smith. The pair led San Diego with 9 and 8 points. Smith Extends Streak Smith, who was playing in his 854th consecutive game, extending his league mark, scored the Clippers' last 6 points of the first period, then led a spurt that brought his team from a 42-33 deficit to a 51-50 lead with 3 minutes 9 secounds left in the half. Smith scored the first two baskets in the 15-5 surge that took only 3:08 to complete. Jerome Whitehead led the Clippers with 8 points in the second period. He is the Clippers' part-time starting center, assuming that role when Bill Walton is attending law school at Stanford University.

756-> REAGAN IS FACTOR IN CONNECTICUT RACE
Representative Stewart B. McKinney likes to call Connecticut's Fourth Congressional District ''the land of steady habits.'' One of its steadiest has been the election of Mr. McKinney, a Republican. Six times he has won, usually in walkovers. Now his last victim, John Aristotle Phillips - dispatched by a 50,000-vote margin in President Reagan's 1980 landslide - is back for a second go at the incumbent on Nov. 2. But this time both candidates agree that Mr. Reagan has become a political liability. The district covers 250,000 voters along the Fairfield County coast from Greenwich to Bridgeport. ''This race is a referendum on Reaganomics,'' said Mr. Phillips. The 27-year-old president of a microcomputer concern, Mr. Phillips became famous for designing an atomic bomb from declassified information while a student at Princeton University. Past Difficulties Recalled Mr. McKinney, who is 51 years old, points to the electoral difficulties he has overcome in the past. He won re-election by 12,000 votes, albeit his narrowest margin ever, in the post-Watergate elections of 1974. And he kept his job despite Gov. Ella T. Grasso's Democratic victory in 1978, winning his fifth term by 24,000 votes. But Mr. McKinney has acknowledged concern about the economy and about the state's Republican ticket. It is headed by Lewis B. Rome, the gubernatorial candidate, who, according to recent polls, is trailing William A. O'Neill, the incumbent. Included on the G.O.P. slate is Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the bane of Republican conservatives. Since Congress recessed earlier this month, Mr. McKinney has been campaigning seven days a week, showing no apparent effects from the heart attacks he suffered in 1977 and 1978. He underwent triple bypass surgery in 1978. With less money and name recognition than Mr. McKinney, Mr. Phillips has depended upon an aggressive attack on the incumbent's record. He assails Mr. McKinney's votes for the three-year tax cut and other parts of President Reagan's economic program - and then assails him for ''waffling'' in voting to override Mr. Reagan's veto of a supplemental spending bill in September. Appeal to Voting Blocs Mr. Phillips has captured some of the incumbent's traditional labor support and has tried to do the same in the Jewish community by leaking a letter from the Congressman to a constituent criticizing Israel for bombing the Iraqi nuclear reactor. All this has led Mr. McKinney, first, to accuse his opponent of ''negativism'' and then to lace into him with vigor of his own. Mr. McKinney generally refuses even to utter his opponent's name. But speaking at a center for the elderly in Bridgeport, he labeled him ''essentially rotten.'' To which Mr. Phillips has said: ''Is the pot calling the kettle black? Mr. McKinney is shedding crocodile tears because everyone isn't feeling sorry for the millionaire Congressman. Life is tough. He ought to see how tough it is for the people in the unemployment lines.'' Unemployment an Issue Indeed, Mr. Phillips has made unemployment his major issue. He announced his candidacy outside an unemployment benefits office in Bridgeport, appeared there again the day the national jobless rate exceeded 10 percent and has devoted much time to Bridgeport, the city with the most residents (130,000) and highest unemployment (about 12 percent) in the district. Mr. Phillips stresses creating jobs by giving tax breaks to small businesses that make high-technology products. He believes Fairfield County can become a rival to Route 128 around Boston and California's ''Silicon Valley.'' These stands, and organized labor's reluctance to support any Republicans this year, have helped Mr. Phillips win the endorsement of the Connecticut A.F.L.-C.I.O., which in 1980 backed Mr. McKinney. But Mr. McKinney has reminded campaign audiences that unemployment in the entire Congressional district averages 5 percent. The rate in the Stamford area is 3.5 percent and in the Norwalk area 3.8 percent, both among the lowest in the nation. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 95,000 to 83,000 in the district. Mr. McKinney has won thousands of crossover votes in the past, and he may need them more than ever now. He has kept two important labor endorsements: from the United Automobile Workers Union in the state and the Connecticut Education Association, a teachers' group. Differences With Reagan And appearing recently before the Westport Teachers Association, he emphasized his differences with the President. He listed issues such as defense (he voted against the defense budget this year), a bilateral nuclear weapons freeze (he favors it, as does Mr. Phillips) and tuition tax credits for private schools (he opposes them). Mr. Phillips has tried to attack the Congressman among younger constituents for his votes to cut student loans. ''Education for the Fourth District,'' the Democrat often says, ''is like oil in Texas: a natural resource.'' Mr. McKinney has defended his votes by maintaining that all Congress did with student loans was require a financial need test for families earning more than $30,000.

758-> SCOUTING; In the Words Of Billy Taylor
Billy Taylor, a striking National Football League player, was looking for a temporary job as a football announcer. The former Giant halfback, now with the Oakland Raiders, did not get what he was hoping for - doing color on Canadian Football League games. But he did offer some commentaries via the telephone on the strike, the Raiders, the Giants and Marcus Allen. ''There's so much money out there, you'd think there'd be enough for players and owners,'' said Taylor, who still has a home in Hillside, N.J. ''I always thought I was underpaid, and then I found out how much the owners were making. I really think they're trying to break the union.'' He said he was eager for the season to resume because the Raiders, who had won their first two games, ''are phenomenal.'' ''I can't believe the talent we have,'' said Taylor. ''Whenever Jim Plunkett is on, we're darn near unbeatable.'' Taylor was most effusive when talking about Allen, the rookie halfback who is keeping the former Giant on the sidelines. ''It's a pleasure watching him,'' said Taylor, who performed so well in the exhibition games at fullback that the Raiders dropped Mark van Eeghen. ''Allen really reminds me of O.J. Simpson. He has such instincts. And he sees the whole field. He's got vision backwards.'' Taylor said he was happy with the Raiders, and not only because he was making ''more than double what I got with the Giants.'' He said the main difference between the two teams was the ''relaxed'' atmosphere and easier working conditions with the Raiders. ''They really have fun out there,'' said Taylor. ''I think it's because with so many veterans they don't have to teach as much and so there are not as many long meetings.''

759-> SCIENCE WATCH; CAT Scans in 3-D
A new and fairly simple mechanical device may be able to produce three-dimensional versions of the images taken by CAT scanners, nuclear magnetic resonance machines and ultrasound devices. All three machines, using different principles, create cross-section views of the body to aid doctors in diagnosing illnesses and finding trouble spots. The new device in question, called SAM (for stroboscopic analyzing monitor) simultaneously displays up to 90 images from any of the modern scanning devices, ''stacking'' them, apparently in thin air, as a kind of three-dimensional display of successive scanning pictures piled one on top of the other with space between. Each picture in the stack is transparent enough to see through and thereby gain a sense of the interior structure of the object examined by the scanning machines. The device uses a projection screen that in effect is a translucent plastic cylinder mounted to rotate on an eccentric axis. Like a wheel with its axle off center, the edge or rim of the cylinder moves in and out as it passes any given stationary point. The scanner pictures, registered on 35 millimeter film, are mechanically synchronized so that they are projected, much like a movie, on the spinning plastic cylinder's surface as it moves in and out. The projection and the rotation of the cylinder are both too fast for the eye to follow; as a result, persistence of vision takes over, and the viewer sees all the pictures at once in what the machine's designer, Edward Woloshuk of the Zyntrax Corporation, calls a ''transparent solid.'' The SAM machine has yet to undergo testing in the medical environment to see if its apparent advantages are real. Dr. Harvey J. Berger, director of cardiovascular imaging at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, said in a telephone interview that a test was planned to compare the machine with other methods in diagnosingcoronary artery disease.

760-> POLL FINDS DANFORTH AND HIS OPPONENT IN MISSOURI RUNNING NECK AND NECK
A dramatic shift in voter sentiment since September has put State Senator Harriett Woods, a Democrat, even with John C. Danforth in their race for the United States Senate, according to a statewide poll taken earlier this month. Mrs. Woods is the first woman to run for the Senate from Missouri since the 1950's and is the only Democratic woman running for Senator this year. Mr. Danforth, the Republican incumbent, was considered unbeatable a year ago and held a lead of 56 percent to 39 percent in September. But Mrs. Woods, a moderate from nearby University City, has chipped away at his standing by criticizing his support of President Reagan's economic policies. The St. Louis area, which relied heavily on the automobile industry and other manufacturing, has been hit hard by the recession. Unemployment is running at about 11 percent, and small businesses are failing at a record pace. A Tie in October Poll The two candidates tied with 47 percent each, with 6 percent undecided, in the poll taken Oct. 9 by Market Shares Corporation of Chicago. In the same poll, support for the President slipped from a 57 percent to 31 percent favorable rating in September to a 48 percent to 40 percent favorable rating this month. A year ago, Mr. Reagan had a 63 percent favorable rating in Missouri polls. Among those who favored Mrs. Woods, 54 percent said they did so because of Mr. Danforth's strong support of the President's economic policies. Conversely, 46 percent of the Senator's backers said they favored him because of his support of Mr. Reagan. The Senator now appears to be trying to put some distance between the President and himself. He has criticized the Reagan Administration for ''not presenting a clear picture on what its nuclear policy is and how to prevent nuclear war.'' And when asked if a Presidential appearance would help or hurt his candidacy, he responded, ''I suppose a little bit of both.'' In addition to the expected strong support she received in heavily Democratic St. Louis, Mrs. Woods also gained significant backing from women and siphoned off much of her opponent's ''soft support,'' voters who were not committed but leaned toward Mr. Danforth. Higher Support From Women Women voters in the poll, who had favored Mr. Danforth by 51 percent to 41 percent in September, gave Mrs. Woods a 52 percent to 39 percent lead this month. She has been active in the drive for an equal rights amendment to the Constitution. As a result of their new standings in the polls, with nine days remaining before the Nov. 2 election, the candidates' campaigning has become fierce. In debates this week the two made personal attacks on each other, contrary to their previous practice. Mrs. Woods attacks Mr. Danforth for voting for deregulation of natural gas prices, for voting to decrease Social Security benefits and for voting for ''the biggest tax increase'' in the nation's history and against extending unemployment benefits. She also blamed him for the Federal budget deficit because he supports the President's policies. Mrs. Woods Called 'Demagogue' In turn, Mr. Danforth has called his opponent a ''demagogue'' who ''wants to turn back the clock two years and revert to the reckless, misguided policies that got the nation into this mess in the first place.'' In a debate in Kansas City Thursday, the candidates exchanged accusations of misrepresenting each other's record. Mr. Danforth repeated this assertion in a debate here Friday, but Mrs. Woods brushed it aside and detailed, with dates, his voting on economic issues. The two candidates appear to agree on nothing, other than that the economy is seriously ill. On unemployment, Mrs. Woods has proposed a government-backed program to put the jobless to work repairing bridges and roadways and doing other public works projects. Government Funds for Research Her plan would also include government financing for research and training programs for the unemployed, a restructuring of tax breaks to benefit moderate-@ and lower-income taxpayers and a reduction in deficit spending by the Government. Mr. Danforth takes the position that lower interest rates and a better business climate would reduce rising unemployment. He said Mrs. Woods's proposed remedy would lead to ''economic havoc for this country.'' Mrs. Woods has said that the current problems in the Social Security system are short-term and that the system could correct itself by 1990. Mr. Danforth said such a view was ''totally irresponsible.'' On the military, Mrs. Woods advocates a verifiable freeze in the production of nuclear weapons and restrictions on the sale of nuclear materials to other nations. Mr. Danforth favors ratification of treaties governing strategic arms limitation and nuclear tests. Mrs. Woods said she thought the Defense Department's budget could be cut by about $30 billion, but Mr. Danforth said that would leave the United States ''behind the Soviet Union.''

761-> SALAZAR WINS CITY MARATHAN IN A CLOSE DUEL
Alberto Salazar and Rodolfo Gomez staged a straining, side-by-side duel over the last six miles of the New York City Marathon yesterday before Salazar, in the event's closest finish, won his third consecutive title by only four seconds. Cheered on by throngs of spectators, a record total of 13,746 runners finished the 26-mile-385-yard race. The sight of two marathoners running virtually together up First Avenue, through the Bronx, back down Fifth Avenue and on to the finish line in Central Park was another first in the 13-year-old race. Salazar's winning time, 2 hours 9 minutes 29 seconds, was slower than his world-best 2:08:13 here last year, but yesterday's performance was ''mentally tougher,'' he said afterward, because of the competitive circumstances. Stiff northerly headwinds nullified the otherwise favorable running conditions - clear weather and 50-degree temperatures - and the hopes of many of the 14,308 starters for personal records. But Grete Waitz of Norway won her fourth women's title. And Salazar's sweep of the Boston and New York marathons was capped by a stimulating, and at times painful, duel with his Mexican rival that was not resolved until the runner from Eugene, Ore., surged in the final 600 yards en route to a 4:35 finishing mile. ''We got spoiled,'' his wife, Molly, said while feeding their 8-week-old son, Antonio Roberto, after the race. ''Alberto's first two marathons here were so easy. This is what marathoning's all about.'' The city's love affair with the race remained intact, with the crowd estimated to have been as large as last year's turnout of more than two million. ''You're All No.1,'' read a sign easily visible to the runners from the second-floor window of an apartment on Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn. The enthusiasm among spectators along First Avenue's crowded corridor was greater than ever, affecting not only the 4,000 foreign runners from 68 nations and 3,500 first-time starters, but also the established stars. ''If you run too close to the crowd on First Avenue, it's like having a headache,'' said Mrs. Waitz, the former world-record holder, who ran what she described as a ''safe'' race in 2:27:14, which placed her 117th over all and more than a minute ahead of Julie Brown. In Assorted Costumes ''All the time, there was something to listen to and watch,'' said Kjell Sodergren, a 33-year-old male nurse, who was running here for the first time as part of a 30-member group from Sweden. ''It was quite an experience. I had heard about it, but it was more than I thought it would be. You had no time to think of tiredness.'' As usual, competitors ran in assorted costumes, ranging from symbolic T-shirts to green plastic garbage bags, which were more abundant this year because of the unexpected wind and chill. Dave Horning, a 34-year-old Californian, swam three miles from the 69th Street Pier in Brooklyn to the Fort Wadsworth starting area on Staten Island between 8 A.M. and 8:45, then completed the race in 2:54:04. Forty-seven runners broke 2:20, and an additional 110 were under 2:30. Last year 186 finished under 2:30, another indication of the slower times caused by yesterday's wind gusts that reached 23 miles. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, finished in 3:06.28. Noel Johnson, at 83 the oldest competitor, was timed in 6:07.37. The last finisher crossed the line at Tavern-on-the-Green in Central Park in 7:33.19. Surprises and Disappointments There were surprises and disappointments throughout the long day. Dan Schlesinger, an unheralded 27-year-old Yale graduate and Harvard Law School student, finished third in 2:11:54, a personal best by several minutes. Schlesinger said that long, uninterrupted training periods in South Korea, where he had served as a translator until recently, had helped build his strength. ''I was carried to the finish on the wave of sound when my legs failed me,'' said the elated 5-foot-10-inch, 130-pounder, who ran with the lead pack for the first 18 miles, then held on as others faded. ''New York crowds are unsurpassable.'' But New York continued to haunt Dick Beardsley, a 26-year-old from Rush City, Minn., and one of America's more consistent marathoners in recent years. Only six months after he had dramatically dueled Salazar into the last rtraightaway at Boston, losing by only two seconds (2:08:51 to 2:08:53), he cramped in his calves between eight and 10 miles; considered dropping out after crossing the Queensboro Bridge, and struggled home 30th in 2:18:12. ''I never felt loose the whole race, I don't know why,'' said Beardsley, who had expressed pre-race confidence but strayed all over the road and unsuccessfuly tried surging, dropping back and regrouping in an effort to develop some rhythm. Last year he never even got to run here, after having been bitten and bruised by three dogs during a training run near his home. In the 1980 race he tripped on a Queens pothole in a fall that sent Bill Rodgers, then the defending champion, tumbling over him. Wind Is Intimidating All the runners, including the 24-year-old Salazar, seemed intimidated by the gusty winds that can be more of a curse than rain or snow. ''In some instances, it seemed to straighten you right up,'' said Paul Farinacci, a 32-year-old Dallas resident, who was running here for the third time and finished in 3:11:26. ''I really tightened up.'' When the leaders passed the five-mile mark in 24:53 (27 seconds slower than last year), with Salazar in front of the group of 20, the caution flag was evident. ''I was worried about being up front and having the wind take its toll,'' said Salazar, who normally likes to control races as a frontrunner. The lead pack was large through the first 10 miles (49:29) and past the halfway mark (1:04:55). Then it dwindled, and Salazar was surprised to see the 31-year-old Gomez staying back. ''I thought he was playing the sly fox,'' he said. Two years ago, Gomez ran with Salazar until the 20-mile mark before giving ground and finishing second by 33 seconds, then the closest finish since the race began in 1970. This year, however, Gomez had won three marathons, all in 2:11, and had vowed, ''I'll run with Alberto all the way.'' A side stitch, or stomach cramp, unsettled Salazar as early as halfway into the race, for the first time in his four marathons. ''I got a little nervous,'' he said. Easing slightly, he hoped that no one would surge ahead and that the stitch would disappear. Mexican Makes His Move Without realizing that Salazar was laboring slightly, Gomez began asserting himself over the Willis Avenue Bridge, after successive 4:44 miles by Salazar between the 16th and 18th miles had created a two-man race. At one point, Salazar said, he thought Gomez was leading by as many as 20 yards in the Bronx. But the margin was actually seven to 10. More importantly, Salazar never lost contact. At 21 miles, around Fifth Avenue and 133d Street in Manhattan, as the theme song from the movie ''Chariots of Fire'' blared over several loudspeakers on the street, Salazar drew even with Gomez. ''My plan was not to leave Alberto behind, but to open distance between Alberto and others,'' Gomez said through an interpreter. Duels are the soul of marathons, which require not only tactical skills but also survival instincts. This year, while setting American records in track at 5,000 and 10,000 meters, extending his perfect string of marathon titles to four, and winning the prestigious Falmouth 7.1-mile road race, Salazar has shown his diverse talents. In Boston, although he and Beardsley had run together in the closing stages, only one decisive kick was involved. Yesterday's struggle produced a series of extended surges by both runners, with Salazar opening brief leads and Gomez retaliating. The two entered Central Park together at 22.9 miles, the first time any leaders had been so close so late. Three miles from the finish, they were on opposite sides of the blue line, the guide for the course, and cutting corners as deftly as possible to shorten yardage. Realizing that Gomez possessed a faster sprint kick, and with his cramps gone, Salazar intensified his surges, often up to 150 yards. ''The surges were designed to soften him up,'' he said. ''And I wouldn't slow down to a normal speed again. The whole tempo was picking up.'' He Appears to Sway ''Alberto tried on three occasions to leave me behind, but I thought each time to stay up,'' said Gomez, a two-time Olympian. ''My plan was to beat him at the end with a sprint. I planned to sprint with 200 meters left.'' At 23.5 miles, suffering from stomach cramps, Gomez appeared to sway, as if he might succumb. But he bounced back in front one mile later, and they ran evenly on re-entering the park for the last mile. With the two still side by side, often separated only by inches, Salazar said, he noticed that Gomez's fists were clenching, a sign of strain and fatigue. Salazar made a decisive sprint with 600 yards left. It was an accelerated surge, more associated with 400-meter training than marathons, but an integral part of Salazar's overall program as a track and road racer. ''He surprised me and increased the tempo too drastically,'' said Gomez. ''I wasn't expecting such a change.'' A swirl of dust from a vehicle entering the park ahead of the runners distracted Gomez slightly, but it was not a factor. ''The surprise was the spurt of that moment,'' he said. Opening his lead to 10 yards, Salazar first wondered whether he had kicked prematurely. ''In the last 300, I wondered whether he'd surge back,'' he said. Gomez did not, and as Salazar crossed the finish line, he held up three fingers. ''It was mentally tough on me,'' he said. ''I had that side stitch and I was trying to fight panic, not letting him get too far ahead.'' Gomez was not dismayed. ''I will try again,'' he said. ''Today was closer.

762-> Pricing Crime
At the end of ''M,'' the German film classic, a woman says to the mob celebrating its capture of a child killer, ''But will this bring back our children?'' The mob falls silent. Nothing and no one can return what is lost to crime. Sometimes, as in ''M,'' the loss is of a loved one. Sometimes, it is of property. But always, whatever the crime, one is also robbed of self-confidence or courage, trust or innocence. The contents of a ransacked apartment, for instance, may be found, but the careless unconcern with which its owner used to unlock the door is gone forever. That sense of loss is intangible, but it must be addressed, however much its measurement may confound reason. ''A loss has been brought upon the community,'' Isak Dinesen wrote in ''Out of Africa'' about the accidental shooting of a child, ''and must be made up for, somewhere, by somebody.'' Paul and Joan Garland lost their daughter, Bonnie, five years ago when she was beaten to death by her boyfriend, Richard Herrin. Mr. and Mrs. Garland sought damages from Mr. Herrin for their ''emotional distress and expenses.'' This week a jury awarded them $40,000. Mr. Garland, himself a lawyer, said they didn't sue for the money. ''This has been a sincere effort on our part,'' he said, ''to seek justice.'' In putting Richard Herrin in prison, Justice, that mythic figure, satisfied the state. But Mr. and Mrs. Garland are not abstractions, and they needed something more. For them, $40,000 was the something more; for the parents of the child in ''Out of Africa,'' it was a cow and heifer. The Garland decision has been called ''trend-setting,'' and perhaps it is. But for the moment the most that can be said about the Garlands' $40,000 is that it is like Dinesen's cow and heifer. Both are symbols - not only of the human need to make a criminal pay for his crime, but of the impossibility of ever calculating the correct sum.

763-> Average U.S. Pay Put At $15,691 Last Year
The average American worker earned $15,691 in 1981, an increase of 9.2 percent over the previous year, the Labor Department reported Saturday. The department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said Alaska had the highest average pay, at $25,350, more than $4,600 higher than the District of Columbia, which ranked second with $20,718. The bureau said Michigan ranked third with $18,143, followed by Wyoming with $17,238 and New York with $17,132. The report said that at the other end of the pay scale, Vermont, Arkansas, Mississippi, Maine and South Dakota had averages of $12,000 to $13,000. The department said the pay information was compiled from reports submitted by employers participating in state and Federal unemployment insurance programs. The data covered the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. The average government worker earned $15,879 a year, as against $15,652 in the private sector, according to the study. It said workers in the mining industry, which includes extraction of oil and gas, had the highest pay levels, averaging $25,723, followed by transportation and public utility workers, who averaged $21,365 last year. The report said retail trade workers earned the lowest average pay, $9,131. ''In addition to having the highest annual pay in 1981, the mining industry also led all other industries in pay growth between 1980 and 1981 with an 11.7 percent increase,'' the report said. ''The service industry, which includes such establishments as hospitals and accounting firms, had the next highest growth in pay at 10.2 percent. Retail trade showed the slowest growth in pay with a 6.8 percent increase.'' The study said North Dakota led the nation in average raises, with a pay increase of 12.4 percent from 1980 to 1981, partly because of raises for energy-related workers. Louisiana and Oklahoma followed with 11.4 percent increases, and Texas had 11.2 percent.

GULF PEACE EFFORT TO CONTINUE JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Oct. 24 (Reuters) - An Islamic peace mission said today that it would continue efforts to end the 25-month-old war between Iran and Iraq in spite of reports that the mediation effort had reached a deadlock, the official Saudi press agency reported. The Islamic Conference's peace committee, headed by President Ahmed Sekou Toure of Guinea, said in a statement that some progress had been made and that the group would remain in contact with the combatants. On Sunday, the committee delivered a new peace plan to President Ali Khamenei of Iran and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Today's statement was issued after Mr. Sekou Toure was briefed on the results of the trip. The Guinean President was quoted earlier by the Saudi newspaper Okaz as saying, ''We have come to a deadlock.'' The mediation committee, formed last year at a meeting of leaders of Islamic nations, held talks here today to make a final assessment of Sunday's efforts to interest Iran and Iraq in a revised peace plan. The committee is made up of representatives of Guinea, Gambia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey, Senegal, the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Islamic Conference. The United Nations and the movement that professes nonalignment failed in previous attempts to end the war, and diplomats said the latest mission stood little chance of success. ---- Iran Reportedly Shells Iraqi Port BEIRUT, Lebanon, Oct. 24 (Reuters) - Iranian artillery shelled Basra in southern Iraq today, killing seven civilians, the Iraqi press agency reported.

The statement also said that Iraqi forces killed 26 Iranians during the previous 24 hours of fighting.

765-> RANGERS DEFEAT STARS BY 4-2
The Rangers checked and forechecked more effectively than usual at Madison Square Garden last night, took advantage of their chances and defeated the Minnesota North Stars, 4-2. Mark Pavelich scored a short-handed goal in the first period, and Anders Hedberg tallied his fourth goal of the season in the second. Goals by Eddie Johnstone and Robbie Ftorek in the last period sealed the Rangers' fourth victory of the National Hockey League season. They have lost six times. Bobby Smith in the second period and Brad Maxwell in the third were the goal scorers for the North Stars, now 6-2-1. The visitors outshot the Rangers, 33 to 23, but they were usually thwarted by Ed Mio, who played his best game of the season in five starts. ''This was the first time Eddie was challenging,'' Ranger Coach Herb Brooks said. ''He played well, but I'm not about to overlook Steve Weeks and J.D., though.'' Weeks and John Davidson are also Ranger goaltenders although Davidson is in traction with a back injury at lenox Hill Hospital. Mio Credits Defense ''We will know Wednesday about J.D.,'' Brooks said of Davidson's back problems. ''We'll know by then whether the drugs he's taking are working.'' Davidson entered the hospital last Tuesday, and at this point is considered to be out indefinitely. ''I heard some good reports about J.D.,'' Mio said when asked whether he thought his own performance had solidified his position. ''Don't count him out; he'll be back.'' Mio was voted the game's top star. ''My defense did well,'' he said. ''We limited their shots to outside.'' Mio's fifth start was by far his best, according to several teammates. The 28-year-old goaltender lost his first three outings, to Washington, the Islanders and Montreal, before his first victory, against Vancouver, last Wednesday night. The North Stars had seven power plays and took advantage on the fourth and last ones. Smith's goal at 16:10 of the second period came when Bill Baker was penalized for interfernce, and Maxwell's goal, with 1:12 left in the game, was scored when Mike Allison was penalized for delaying the game. Short-Handed Goal The Rangers have had difficulty with a man advantage in their previous games, having scored only six times in 38 power plays, which placed them 18th in the National Hockey League. That they scored their first goal while a man short was an indication of their determination to be effective against the North Stars. ''Minnesota is similar to us; they have a lot of good skaters,'' said Barry Beck, the captain of the Rangers, ''and you have to check them. We've been working on bodychecking in practice, and we put it to work tonight.'' Beck said also that Ftorek's performance was a pleasant surprise to the Rangers. Ftorek missed the first seven games of the season because of a groin injury. His goal was the first of the season after he led the Rangers in scoring in last year's playoffs. ''Robbie plays well with Don Maloney and Eddie Johnstone,'' Beck said. ''He gives us a lot of depth now that Ulf Nilsson is out.'' It was the third game in a row missed by Nilsson, who has a goal and three assists. Ftorek Scores, Assists Ftorek's goal came at 17:49 of the last period when Dave Maloney led him with a crisp pass through the middle. Ftorek also assisted on Johnstone's goal 7 minutes 5 seconds earlier. Johnstone broke away after Ftorek's pass, faked to his left when he got close to the goal and went to his right, beating Don Beaupre in the North Star net for his fifth goal of the season. The second Rangers' goal was finally attributed to Hedberg after it was given to Dave Maloney first and Kent-Erik Andersson. Dave Maloney blasted the puck from the left circle and it hit Hedberg's skate. ''It hit my skate and went in,'' Hedberg said without any hesitation. ''We beat a good hockey club tonight,'' Brooks said. ''We haven't played well in October, and we're happy to get the win.''

766-> IDEAS & TRENDS; Scientists Find Key to Growth
The substance crucial to human growth lies deep within the brain, eluding efforts to extract it. Two scientific teams have now tracked this substance to another location -in a rare pancreatic tumor - and determined its chemistry. The achievement, by groups led by Dr. Roger Guillemin and Dr. Wylie Vale, both of Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif., is being reported separately: Dr. Guillemin's in this week's issue of Science and Dr. Vale's in the journal Nature later this month. The substance is growth hormone releasing factor, or GRF. It is secreted in the brain, but in such minute amounts that it has escaped extraction. Indeed, of the four hormone-releasing factors predicted by scientists 25 years ago, GRF is the last to be found. The hypothalamus, a deep-seated part of the brain, produces the factors, which stimulate the pituitary gland (located at the base of the brain) to produce hormones. The hormones in turn regulate various body functions, such as temperature and appetite. GRF prompts the pituitary to produce growth hormone. Since scientists could not easily find GRF in the brain or circulatory system, they explored a rare pancreatic cancer that also stimulates the pituitary to release growth hormone. Experiments indicated that what the Salk teams found, in two different cancer victims, is the same substance found in the brain. After more tests and only with Food and Drug Administration approval GRF will be tested in humans, such as children suffering from pituitary dwarfism. These children are currently treated with growth hormone itself, which is difficult to obtain. Endocrinologists believe that when used in normal animals growth hormone may cause the pituitary gland to reduce its natural release of growth hormone to compensate for the artificially introduced supply. GRF would stimulate hormone production rather than substitute for it, making it potentially more effective in regulating the growth of farm animals. Its simple structure, experts noted, should also make it easy and economical to produce artificially in large quantities.

769-> WHAT'S NEW IN NEWSPAPER PUBLISHING; IS IT TIME TO UNITE THE UNIONS?
Changes in production and newsroom technologies, along with some well-publicized failures of big-city dailies, have created a pressure on newspaper unions to reconsider what their role will be in coming decades. The computer-driven systems have, in effect, moved many of the functions of the composing room into the hands of editors. The deployment of pagination equipment and plate-making machines using lasers will complete that shift, leaving the printers union and many other production craft workers with nothing to do. One response has been to negotiate early retirements, accompanied by handsome bonuses from publishers eager to reduce operating costs quickly. Another has been to seek a realignment of the unions. The International Typographers Union, which represents 50,000 active printers, will vote in March on a plan to merge with the Newspaper Guild, a 30,000-member union of reporters, photographers, editors and commercial employees. The pressmen and the graphic arts unions are weighing a similar step. In the long run, that could lead to creation of a single plantwide union. Charles A. Perlik Jr., president of the Guild, said ''the onrush of technology is so swift and so merciless that the forces are in place for a merger of all the print unions'' within five years. Newspaper owners are not sitting by idly while the unions create a new bargaining force. They have increasingly turned to outside labor relations professionals for their bargaining sessions and their dayto-day operations. Richard D. Ostrow of Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson - the largest of such firms -thinks the adoption of some of the new technologies will not happen until the inevitable labor-management conflicts get resolved. He suggested the retraining of craft employees for other jobs, such a circulation work, because ''a lot of these people know what a newspaper is about.'' The deaths of newspapers in Washington, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Buffalo are making the unions take stock of their bargaining position for the future. Earlier this month they acceded to substantial reductions to keep The Boston Herald American operating. Even without the threat of immediate closure, unions at The Daily News in New York negotiated cuts that management said would save $50 million a year. Organized labor is coming to understand that ''having some job is better than having no job,'' Mr. Perlik of the Guild said.

770-> IDEAS & TRENDS; Is Big Brother Prone to Error?
''Garbage in, garbage out'' is a jocular old dictum in the computer field. The saying takes on ominous tones, however, if the program contains the criminal records of 36 million Americans. Researchers at Congress's Office of Technology Assessment have found that almost half of a sample of such records kept by the Federal Bureau of Investigation were incomplete or inaccurate. In a report last week, they warned that before Congress authorizes a national computer network for sending arrest information to police, banks, employers and other civil institutions, the consequences of misuse should be evaluated. The report said that nearly 30 percent of the work force ''were potentially exposed to employment disqualification because of an arrest record.'' But of this total, 35 percent had no arrest for a serious crime (such as murder, rape and robbery) and only one arrest for a minor crime (such as drunkenness and lesser assaults). In one F.B.I. system, almost 30 percent of the sampled records held no final disposition of cases. The report warned that a national data bank could be used for monitoring lawful activities. ''To understand this concern, one must remember that the debate over the national computerized criminal history system began in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when the F.B.I. was engaged in domestic political intelligence and surveillance,'' the report said.

771-> WHEN BEAUJOLAIS IS KING IN PARIS
PATRICIA WELLS is restaurant critic for The International Herald Tribune in Paris. In Paris, the 15th of November - the first day of sale of Beaujolais primeur, the new Beaujolais - signals the beginning of a season-long fete that won't cease until after the holiday revelry has cleared sometime in January. From now until the New Year, the French are in a festive mood, and the spirit is wildly evident in wine bars all over town as Parisians down by the glass and the bottle the young, fruity red wine that's been in fashion here for the last three decades. There's no better place than a true Parisian bistro a vin to sample the wines, fresh from the keg and bottled by conscientious bistrotiers who do their best to search out above-average wines at below-average prices. No matter that this year's abundant crop of new Beaujolais lacks that special fruitiness and is short on acidity. No matter that everyone here agrees that the publicity surrounding the light, young red wine has reached almost unbearable heights. Paris wine bars are cramped, hectic, popular spots all year round, but they take on special flair from mid-November to the first day of spring, when Parisians stand elbow to elbow, quaffing wines of every color and origin, snacking on thickly buttered tartines, or open-face sandwiches, layered with slices of peppery country sausages or garlic- and thyme-flecked rillettes of pork. The wine bars in question bear no resemblance to the chic wine bars so popular in England and the United States. More often, the Parisian wine bar is indistinguishable from an ordinary French cafe. What sets it apart is the quality of food offered and the care taken in selecting and bottling small-production wines. One of the liveliest and most unusual wine bars is Jacques Melac, found in the workingman's 11th arrondissement, west of Place de la Bastille. Jacques Melac, the 38-year-old bistrotier, seems to come right from central casting, with his handlebar mustache, nonstop chatter and genuine pride in the food and wine offered in this tiny, five-table bistro. He's obviously having such a great time that no one could leave the corner bar feeling sad. If there's any question about what you're to do at Jacques Melac's, signs all around will tell you: ''If you want water, you must place your order the day before'' says one hand-scratched poster. Another reminds clients that ''Water is reserved for cooking potatoes.'' Coffee is sold, reluctantly, and lemonade is reserved for children under 11 years of age. At lunch time, the place takes on the frenzy of the Bourse at the height of trading, as workers, businessmen and secretaries stand five-deep at the bar, or vie for a rickety stool to sit down at one of the red oilcloth-covered tables to take in the day's hearty plat du jour. One day the dish might be a rustic platter of boiled beef tongue, accompanied by tiny potatoes in a creamy mustard sauce. The omelets are creamy and delicious, and the selection of wines includes not just Beaujolais, but Gigondas and Cahors, Sancerre and country wines from the Jura in southeastern France. The bistro serves as a wine shop as well. Diners can pick a bottle right off the shelf for sampling and, if it suits their taste, they can buy a bottle or a case as they leave. This year Mr. Melac won the coveted Meilleur Pot, an annual award given to French bistros offering quality wines. Ask to see the Art Deco-style traveling trophy, which he'll pass on to the 1983 winner when the award is made next spring. Across town, in the more bourgeois 8th arrondissement, Geraud Rongier offers some of the best of a dozen or so bottles of Beaujolais primeur sampled in a week's worth of tasting. Mr. Rongier, who moved to Le Val D'Or about a year ago, won the Meilleur Pot several years ago, and maintains quality in wines and food. He can be found shopping at the Rungis wholesale market each morning, and if he suggests you try a special plat du jour at lunch, you can accept his word that the dish will be fresh and probably worth sampling. T he main floor cafe is crowded with well-dressed businessmen and well-coiffed secretaries rushing through a quick cold lunch. Ask for a glass of Beaujolais, and the waiter brings a whole bottle, charging diners for only what's been consumed. Best bets are the warm cheese and ham quiche and the assiette de charcuterie, including sausages and the excellent jambon a l'os, silky ham that's been cured with the bone intact. The downstairs dining room is reserved for hot lunches, accompanied by the popular Cote de Brouilly or Pouilly Fume. If it's on the menu, sample the sturdy boeuf Bourgogne, or perhaps a platter of saucisson cooked in the full-bodied Cote de Brouilly. The tarte tatin isn't always available, but go for it when it's on the menu. The upsidedown apple tart is prepared on the premises with Golden Delicious apples, and is always served with a huge pot of thick, irresistible creme fraiche. If this was anywhere but Paris, you'd call La Tartine a luncheonette. But this is Paris and La Tartine is a wine bar in the oldest sense of the world. It's a workingman's hangout - meaning men and women - and at lunch time the crowds gather to share modest platters of wafer-thin slices of jambon de Paris, the light, palecolored ham that's cured in a salt brine, then cooked. It's the ham most commonly found in Paris cafes and usually goes into the sandwich mixte, or ham and cheese sandwich served on a French baguette. Everyone at La Tartine seems to know the red-haired waitress who single-handedly coordinates the orders from the 20 or so tables bunched together in this dim, antique bar. Above the din can be heard shouts of ''Suzette, Suzette'' as workers call out for a double express before rushing back to the streets and the office. Worth sampling here: firm and fragrant crottin de Sancerre, the young goat cheese from the Loire Valley, which is best enjoyed with the light, white Sancerre. Au Sauvignon is one of the city's tiniest and most chic wine bars, just steps from the popular Bon Marche department store. Like many other bars, it's high on Beaujolais hype, with windows and walls plastered with posters reading ''Vive le Beaujolais'' and maps of wine routes throughout France. Walking into Au Sauvignon is like walking up against a stage set: The place is so narrow and small you walk four steps inside the door and you hit the back wall. Au Sauvignon is a good place to stop in for a late afternoon snack, to sample Beaujolais or wines from Alsace and St. Emilion with pate de porc or jambon d'Auvergne. Visitor's guide to sampling the harvest Beaujolais Bars Following is a list of Paris cafes and wine bars selling Beaujolais primeur by the glass from now till January, and Beaujolais nouveau year-round. Although the terms ''primeur'' and ''nouveau'' are used interchangeably, technically primeur is served only from Nov. 15 to Dec. 15, though the first, fresh crop is served in most bars until well into the new year. The term ''nouveau'' is technically reserved for the wines released for sale Dec. 15, to be drunk through next November. Many of the wine bars listed close early in the evening, so a visit during the lunch hours, when hot plates are usually offered, is recommended. Price Tags Wines by the glass are generally priced at 60 cents to $1. A bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau costs 20 francs, or $2.85, if purchased to consume outside the cafe, and 30 francs, or $4.25, if consumed in the cafe. Wine by the case is also available at most of the establishments. Prices for a cold lunch run $2 or $3 and for a hot meal, $5 to $10, with wine and tips generally included..

772-> Q&A
Q. When dining at a seafood restaurant in Houston, I had a delectable fish listed on the menu as ''mahimahi.'' Are you familiar with this fish? A. Yes, but I have dined on it only in Hawaii. I have been told that it can rarely be found on mainland menus. When available here, it has probably arrived in a frozen form. Mahimahi - it is sometimes spelled as two words or hyphenated - is a type of dolphin, though no relation to the mammal usually referred to as a dolphin. In the Encyclopedia of Fish Cookery (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1977), A.J. McClane states that while mahimahi is ''one of the most delicious seafoods,'' the annual yield is small. In Hawaii, he writes, ''mahimahi has become synonymous with island cuisine,'' although ''traditionally there was never much demand for dolphin among island people'' and ''it was only with the influx of tourism since the 1950's that any market developed.'' Q. Most commercially made soy sauce seems to contain a lot of salt. For those of us cooking without salt is there such a thing as a saltfree soy sauce? A. As you know, it is the sodium in salt that is the culprit. Some soy sauces are lower in sodium than others, but the amount is still substantial. So-called low-sodium soy sauces, low only in a relative sense, are available in health-food stores, but I am not inclined to use them. Q. I read recently about a salad containing trevisse. Can you tell me what this is? A. An educated guess is that ''trevisse'' may be another word for an expensive salad ingredient, @radicchio, which is becoming increasingly available and, therefore, increasingly popular. A form of wild chicory, it is most commonly associated with Italy's Veneto region, where one version is referred to as red treviso, Treviso being the name of a town north of Venice. I find radicchio to be one of the finest of salad ingredients. Shaped somewhat like a small cabbage but with tender red leaves and white stalks and veins, it adds a delicately bitter taste to a salad. Its texture is a bit firmer than that of Boston lettuce. Q. I am curious to know something about foie gras. What is the difference between foie gras and pate de foie gras? Can pure foie gras be made from the livers of anything other than goose? A. Pure foie gras is made from the unadulterated liver of either goose or duck and from no other animal. The foie gras of goose is preferable, by far, to that of duck. As Larousse Gastronomique points out, the finest foies gras come from the geese of Alsace and southwestern France. The most amusing quotation about the product appears in C. Gerard's book ''L'Ancienne Alsace a la Table,'' in which he says, ''The goose is nothing, but man has made of it an instrument for the output of a marvelous product, a kind of living hothouse in which grows the supreme fruit of gastronomy.'' Pure foie gras may, of course, be studded with truffles and served in aspic. A pate de foie gras may contain only a small quantity of pure foie gras plus any of many ''fillers'' including ground pork, the liver of other animals, cereals and ground fat. Readers are invited to send questions about food and cooking techniques to Craig Claiborne, Food Editor, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036. Unfortunately, unpublished questions cannot be answered individually.

773-> CURRENCY MARKETS; DOLLAR MIXED; GOLD UP OVERSEAS AND IN U.S.
The dollar was mixed against other major currencies yesterday and gold prices rose. West German political developments helped the dollar in early European trading, as did continued rumors of an realignment in the European Monetary System, the Common Market's joint arrangement aimed at maintaining stability among their currencies. Some traders believe a devaluation of the Belgian and French francs and the Italian lira may be imminent. The West German mark was weakened as a result of the election victory over the weekend for the opposition Social Democrats in Hamburg city elections. For traders, the victory raised the possibility of a defeat for the governing Christian Democrats and their coalition allies in West Germany's national elections in March. The dollar rose to 2.4170 West German marks from 2.4110 marks Friday in Frankfurt trading. Gold for spot delivery climbed $2.70 to close at $442.30 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. In later trading, Republic National Bank quoted gold at $442 an ounce, up $3 from Friday's late bid. In London, the British pound slipped to $1.6127 from Friday's $1.6140. In late United States trading, the pound was $1.6088, down slightly from $1.6095 on Friday. Other dollar rates in late European trading compared with Friday were: 2.0415 Swiss francs, unchanged; 6.8250 French francs, down from 6.8325, and 2.6675 Dutch guilders, up from 2.6600. In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 245.30 Japanese yen, up from 243.45 Friday. Other dollar rates in late United States trading compared with Friday were: 2.4190 West German marks, unchanged; 6.8295 French francs, down from 6.8625; 2.0335 Swiss francs, down from 2.0465; 244.85 Japanese yen, up from 243.80, and 1.2358 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2362. Gold opened the day by rising to $438.93 an ounce in Hong Kong, from $437.38 on Friday. In Europe, bullion rose to $440.50 an ounce in Zurich, up from $435.75 Friday, and to $441.50 in London, from $437.

Executive Polish F lubbing the wine order at lunch -Chateau d'Yquem, say, with the lamb chops - may not be a rising businessman's biggest nightmare, but Pace University is suggesting its new ''executive wine seminar'' as a perfect accompaniment to an M.B.A. A dozen graduate-school business students have signed up for the six-week, noncredit course at $185, which includes a cellar sampling of several $20 to $25 wines per session. The idea is to ''put a little polish on an executive,'' according to Arthur Centonze, the associate dean. ''Knowing how to handle the wine situation might impress a client as much as knowing how to analyze a financial statement.'' Looking eventually, of course, at wine as an investment, the course promises first to teach the business students how to read a wine label.

776-> INVESTING; MAKING A BET ON TECHNOLOGY STOCKS
AFTER taking a drubbing in the final months of the bear market, t echnology stocks have roared back with a vengeance. The gain in the i ndex of 117 high-technology stocks compiled by Hambrecht & Quist, t he San Francisco securities firm, has been so great, in fact, that f rom early August to last week it had shot up 60 percent, o utdistancing broader market averages by 25 percent. Some technology stocks, such as Apple Computer, have nearly doubled in recent months. But in light of the moribund economy and the somber business forecasts made recently by the chief executives of some of the larger technology companies, many analysts are wondering whether technology investors have jumped the gun. John Westergaard, who heads Equity Research Associates, a division of Ladenburg, Thalmann, is one of them. ''Generally, I find that the technology issues are richly priced.'' Many investors apparently feel the same. Last week, on the days the market took some big setbacks, the technology issues were among the stocks hardest hit. But while Mr. Westergaard is ''not inclined to chase'' technology stocks, he also would not be a seller. ''It's the place to be as an investor. And it's better to have bought sooner rather than later.'' Indeed, the focus of investors is clearly on the rest of the 1980's and beyond, rather than the next three to six months. As Otis Bradley, a veteran technology analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons, put it, ''No matter how volatile the short-term economy is, the major constant secular trend is that technology will be a greater and greater component of the gross national product. I'm a believer in the Alvin Toffler 'Third Wave' theory that electronic technology will replace industrialization as the force revolutionizing society.'' Richard Hoffman, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., is equally bullish on the technology sector. So much so, in fact, that it is ''the core of our model portfolio,'' he said, representing 23 percent of its total weight. That is about twice the weight given technology stocks in the S.& P. 500 stock index. ''If you're going to be bullish you have to be in technology stocks. These companies are the only way the economy can increase its productivity fast enough to deal with the problems of the world,'' Mr. Hoffman stated. Among Merrill's recommended stocks are E-Systems and Tracor (electronic warfare), Harris (communications equipment), Intel (computer memory), Tandem Computer, I.B.M. and Hewlett-Packard. Eventually, predicted Mr. Hoffman, ''Twenty-five of the 'nifty 50' growth stock names that investors favor will be in technology. People that are buying the same old names now are buying yesterday's story.'' While the debate remains about the wisdom of committing heavily to technology stocks now, everyone agrees that it is going to be increasingly hard in the future to pick the potential winners. There are literally hundreds of new companies in the embryonic stage now that may make technology breakthroughs. That is in large part due to the recent surge of pension fund money into the venture capital industry. How to Pick High-Tech Stocks So what criteria can an investor use when these high-tech companies make their debuts in the public securities markets? Michael Kassen, portfolio manager in charge of the Select Technology Fund run by the Fidelity Management and Research Company, Boston, said that when investing in new issues, he considers the quality of the venture capitalists in the deal. ''If it's a firm like Kleiner Perkins of San Francisco or Graylock Management or TA Associates, both from Boston, then I feel a little more confident,'' he said. Mr. Kassen also considers the rationale for the company's existence and whether or not it is in a growing market. One new issue now in registration that Mr. Kassen likes is Altos Computer, a microcomputer company that has as one of its original investors Sequoia Funds, a venture capital group associated with the Capital Research and Management Company. If a new-issue company has no track record, though, Mr. Hoffman of Merrill Lynch advises investors to stay away from it. They should only invest in those companies that have survived their first business crisis and have established themselves as dominant players in their fields, he said. High-technology companies are so enticing to investors because of their fast growth. For example, both Mr. Westergaard, of Equity Research, and Mr. Bradley, of Alex. Brown, just heard of a word processing company called Syntrex, which they said had grown from $100,000 in sales in the fiscal year 1980 to $31 million in the year just ended, and whose management is looking for a 50 percent gain this year. Both men plan to look into Syntrex further. ''That's what makes technology so exciting,'' said Mr. Bradley. But like a hot air balloon, rapid growth in a technology company can collapse overnight. That is why Mr. Kassen and others place heavy emphasis on new product research and development. This is especially important for large, established companies, he said. Investors, added Mr. Kassen, should be especially wary of companies that ''rest on their laurels; in technology, more than other fields, the targets are rapidly moving.'' Selectivity among technology issues is crucial. ''There is a kaleidescope of different patterns in technology. A group can have one or two good years, then tread water,'' Mr. Bradley said. Investors in the emerging field of computer graphics, for instance, found that, contrary to expectations, their companies were much more cyclical and tied to the overall health of the economy than originally expected. Many fund managers, in fact, are keeping a lid on their technology exposure. Alfred Kugel, president of the Capital Appreciation Fund, run by Stein Roe & Farnham, Chicago, has toned down his positions in semiconductor and instrumentation companies, primarily because he does not expect an upturn in capital spending in 1983. But he does favor companies in the mini and personal computer business such as Apple and Tandy. In view of the recent surge in the stock market, have investors missed the technology boat? Perhaps not. Even if a company's shares have done phenomenally lately, it may still be a good investment. Jack Granahan of the $20 million Nova mutual fund of Boston did not sell any of his Evans & Sutherland holding, even though it went from $19 a share in early August to $36 last week, because he is impressed by the growth potential of the company's military flight simulator and computer-aided design and manufacture (CAD/CAM) businesses. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fred R.

777-> A Recall on 'Happy Mates'
A New Jersey company is voluntarily recalling squeeze toys, called Happy Mates, because they are small enough to lodge in a child's throat, the Consumer Product Safety Commisson said Wednesday. The toys have not been cited in any choking or suffocation incidents, the commission said, but toys with similar shapes have been involved in deaths by choking. About 8,000 Happy Mates have been distributed in the past two years, primarily in the Northeast.

778-> WHAT'S DOING IN VIENNA
PAUL HOFMANN, formerly a Times correspondent, lives in Europe. Unusual excitement is being felt in the sedate, gemutlich capital of Austria these days as a brilliant 1982/83 season of the Vienna State Opera (Staatsoper) unfolds. The season marks the debut of Lorin Maazel, formerly director of the Cleveland Orchestra, as general manager of one of the world's most renowned shrines of the lyrical drama. New productions include Wagner's ''Tannhauser,'' Tchaikovsky's ''Pique Dame,'' Schonberg's ''Moses und Aaron,'' Verdi's ''Falstaff,'' ''Rigoletto'' and ''Luisa Miller,'' and Puccini's ''Turandot'' as well as of Ravel's ballet ''Daphnis et Chloe.'' Singers include Leonie Rysanek, Pilar Lorengar, Walter Berry, Jose Carreras, Mirella Freni, Edita Gruberova, Gundula Janowitz, Giuseppe Taddei and Patricia Wise. Among guest conductors are Christoph von Dohnanyi, Sixten Ehrling, Erich Leinsdorf and Riccardo Muti. The State Opera's programs also include plenty of Mozart, Beethoven, Rossini, Richard Strauss and other standbys of a traditionally rather conservative repertoire. The curtain will go up every night until the end of June, except on Feb. 10 when Maestro Maazel will, for the first time, do the honors at the Opera Ball, the peak of Vienna's giddy Fasching (Carnival), and on April 1, Good Friday. Mr. Maazel has pledged himself to what he calls the ''Vienna tradition of total opera,'' presumably meaning that nothing in the old city is as important as the institution that he now heads. A season schedule of Vienna State Opera performances can be obtained from the Austrian National Tourist Office (545 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10017; 212-697-0651). Tickets cost from $1.40 for a gallery seat at the umpteenth performance of a repertoire production to $67 for an orchestra seat or a chair in the best box at a premiere. Tickets can be obtained by mail if the order reaches the State Opera's box office at least 12 days before the performance. Write to Bundestheater-Verwaltung Goethegasse 1, 1010 Vienna, Austria. Music and More Those preferring lighter musical fare will enjoy the lavish productions of operettas by Johann Strauss, Lehar, Kalman and the other greats of the Austro-Hungarian school at the Volksoper, which is government-subsidized like its august sister house, the State Opera, and occasionally in one or two of the private theaters. There is virtually no day in Vienna without symphonic or chamber music or some lieder recital of a high order in one of the city's big concert halls or minor auditoriums. Sacred music can be heard on Sunday in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna's central landmark, and in the churches of St. Augustine and St. Michael, adjoining the Hofburg. Admission to performances of the Vienna Boys Choir in the Hofkapelle, in the Hofburg every Sunday morning, is $2.25 to $4.50. The Burgtheater, housed in a sumptuous building opposite the neo-Gothic city hall, is considered one of the leading locales for legitimate drama in the German-speaking countries; stage buffs with at least a smattering of the language should not pass it up. Noteworthy productions, at times adapted from Broadway hits, are often presented in the Volkstheater and the Theater in the Josefstadt. The illustrious Theater an der Wien, where ''The Magic Flute'' was first performed in 1791 and ''Fidelio'' in 1805, now specializes in musicals. Other Diversions In addition to the Opera Ball there will be hundreds of big and small Carnival dances in January and February. The merrymaking starts with the annual Emperor Ball in the Hofburg, the former imperial castle in the city core, on New Year's Eve. Men sticking to tradition wear white tie and tails to the major Carnival affairs, but black tie and dinner jacket is now generally acceptable. The white stallions of the Spanish Riding School, which have been seen pirouetting in New York recently, will again perform in their manege in the Hofburg. The horses can also be watched at their morning workout almost every weekday. Inquire at Reitschulgasse 1. Coffeehouses Often pronounced dying or outright defunct, the Viennese coffeehouse seems today vigorously thriving. Old establishments have recently been renovated with an accent on Art Nouveau decor. A revival of Art Nouveau, locally known as Jugendstil (youth style) with its flowery lines and suggestions of turn-of-the-century yearnings for a liberated way of life, is the rage of Vienna right now; it is the art-and-design aspect of the city's all-pervasive nostalgia for the days of Emperor Franz Josef. Strong coffee still comes preferably ''mit schlag,'' with a generous cap of whipped cream, schlagobers in Austrian German. Waiters are solicitous, newspapers and magazines in various languages are kept available in wooden holders, and nobody who has at least had an espresso is hustled into ordering something else or leaving. Patrons leisurely read newspapers, discuss business deals or affairs of the heart, play chess, or just dream. Try Cafe Landtmann, on the Ring adjacent to the Burgtheater, Cafe Schwarzenberg on the square of the same name near the Belvedere Gardens, the coffeehouses in the Imperial or Sacher hotels, or the arty-intellectual Cafe Hawelka at Dorotheergasse 6 near St. Stephen's Cathedral. Cappuccino with cake at many coffeehouses will cost around $2.50. Dining Out Perennials on local menus - schnitzel, boiled beef with horseradish sauce, goulash, dumplings, sausages, venison, risottos, strudels and other rich desserts - reflect the old city's eating culture as a blend of Teutonic-Alpine, Bohemian and other Slavic, Hungarian and Italian elements. Lately the influence of the French nouvelle cuisine has also come to be felt on the banks of the Danube. Ambitious cooks have started experimenting with low-fat ingredients and new combinations, and spurning rich sauces and deep-frying. One interesting practitioner of the revisionist culinary current is Altwienerhof, Herklotzgasse 6, in a nondescript neighborhood near Schonbrunn Castle. It is now rated among Vienna's top-ranking restaurants. The check after a recent lunch for two featuring delicately prepared pheasant, dry red Austrian wine and fresh fruit for dessert ran to $35. A ''Gastronomy'' folder issued by the Vienna Tourist Board lists some 20 deluxe restaurants where dinner for two may cost $50 or more, but the quality and service in some of them were recently found to be uneven. Although commonplace wisdom counsels to stay away from restaurants in hotels, the Rotisserie Prinz Eugen in the Vienna Hilton is widely praised. The Rotisserie features schnitzel and roast poultry, venison in season and excellent apple strudel. For substantial, traditional food in an appealing setting, the Gosser Bierklinik, Steindlgasse 4, near the central Graben, has repeatedly proved reliable. A three-course meal for two with beer from a brewery in Styria costs $20 to $25. Gosser Bierklinik's vast menu runs the entire gamut of traditional Viennese cuisine. A specialty is salzburger nockerl, a fluffy dessert mainly of eggs and sugar; it is made to order for at least two persons. The official ''Gastronomy'' leaflet ignores the innumerable beisel (also spelled beisl) scattered all over the city and its environs - simple taverns with a short bill of fare chalked on a blackboard, cigarette smoke, kitchen odors - no nouvelle cuisine - and loads of local color. The beisels stick to fundamentals - soup, schnitzel, goulash, boiled beef, roast and deep-fried chicken, and almost always some strudel. Don't expect fancy hors d'oeuvres or salads in such places. The food and the wine are often surprisingly good at moderate prices, maybe $7 for a solid meal for two with some draft beer. Caution: When an eating place uses the word eisel in its signs and advertising, it probably belongs to a new class of mock-folksy restaurants with pretentious decor and prices. Young Wines The 1982 grape harvest was abundant, and the Viennese are making pilgrimages to hillside suburbs for more than a sneak preview of what promises to be an excellent vintage. The ''People's Emperor'' Josef II decreed in 1784 - when Mozart was 28 years old and Schubert was not yet born - that every vintner could serve his own product on his own premises directly to paying guests. Hundreds of wine growers still do in their cozy villages that skirt Vienna from the north to the southwest. A pine branch on a pole jutting out of a vintner's house signals that locally pressed and fermented fresh grape juice may be drunk there; the place is called a heuriger, the vernacular for ''this year's (wine).'' Usually the walls are whitewashed, decor minimal and the tables bare. There will be a crackling fire in a ceramic stove. Maybe a local bard, accompanied by an accordion player, will entertain the guests with schmaltzy Viennese songs. Sausage and cheese will be available at a counter, but it is quite all right for patrons to bring their own snacks. (Delicatessens in downtown Vienna obligingly put together packages containing chicken, cold cuts and pickles.) The heady young wine and the sentimental music are conducive to that genial, bittersweet mood that foreigners seek in Vienna, and Viennese at a heuriger. The wine-growing suburbs can be reached by public transport in about 30 minutes from the center. Grinzing, at the end of the No. 38 trolley line, is the most touristy of the vintners' villages that administratively now belong to the municipality of Vienna. Neustift am Wald (No. 41 trolley line), Sievering (No. 38 trolley and 39-A bus) and Heiligenstadt of Beethovenian memories (subway line U-4) are quieter and more genuine. (Connoisseurs shun places with neon signs and parked tourist coaches.) An evening at a heuriger with a liter of white wine and snacks shouldn't cost more than $12, a tip for the music included. Where To Stay It is easier to find accommodations earlier (until about April) than later in the year. Visitors without reservations may turn to special counters at Vienna's Schwechat Airport and at the city's two main railroad terminals, West and South/East for information on available space in hotels and pensions. Among Vienna's 10 deluxe hotels, the Imperial and the Sacher are the most prestigious; double rooms with breakfast up to $90. The two American-style establishments looking at each other across the central Stadtpark, the Vienna Hilton and the InterContinental, are among the better units of their respective chains; doubles $37 to $55. Good first-class hotels are the Hotel de France, Schottenring 3, near the University; Erzherzog Rainer, Wiedner Hauptstrasse 27, near the State Opera; Royal, near St. Stephen's Cathedral; and Prinz Eugen, opposite the South/East Railroad Terminal. Doubles with breakfast from $33 to $45 in each of these hotels. Good second-class hotels near the city center: Goldene Spinne, Linke Bahngasse 1-A, near the Hilton, and Urania, Obere Weissgerberstrasse 7, both with doubles with bath and breakfast for less than $20.

779-> OBSERVER; ADDALS OF MEDICID
There seemed to be several fish hooks lodged in my throat. All teeth in the upper jaw throbbed with pain, and unaccustomed pressure behind the eyeballs threatened to pop them right out of the skull at any moment. I went to the doctor. ''I could take out that old heart and put in a plastic one,'' he said, ''but it wouldn't help your head cold one bit. I suggest you take two aspirins and go to bed.'' The bed was a furnace made of sheets; the pillow, an iron vise clamped against my head. From the bedside telephone I reached a second doctor. ''I see, I see,'' he said. ''You're burning up and your head is being crushed. Now, one thing we can do for you is to create a new baby in a laboratory pan, but that's not going to relieve cold miseries, is it?'' ''I don't want a baby manufactured in a lab, and I don't want a plastic heart either. I want help.'' ''Stay well covered up and try not to catch a chill,'' the doctor said. Until that instant the idea of catching a chill had not crossed my mind, but immediately after hanging up I felt my body temperature drop 40 degrees. On the phone, the third doctor offered a wide range of possibilities. ''If your brain stops working, we can keep the rest of your body functioning on life support systems for another 20 or 30 years,'' he said. ''We can also give you a liver transplant if your liver gives out. Alternatively, if you become suicidally depressed, we can brighten you up with some quite miraculous drugs.'' ''What can you do for a bad cold?'' He hung up. The night that ensued was a thousand hours long. Phantasms appeared at the foot of the bed and jeered. One was my grandfather, dead these 75 years past. ''Didn't I always tell you, boy, that man would find it a lot easier to travel to the moon than to cure the common cold?'' ''How could you possibly have told me that? You died 20 years before I was born.'' ''And didn't I tell you there'd come a day when doctors would start prescribing plastic hearts instead of mustard plasters, and second-hand livers instead of camomile tea, and that when that day came and you went to them with a bad cold they'd offer to make you a baby in the laboratory?'' Released from nightmare by dawn, I stood beside the bed and discovered that Gestapo agents had spent the night beating the backs of my legs with iron bars. What was more disturbing, my entire head was becoming liquefied. ''Whole head seems to be undergoing watery meltdown, eh?'' remarked the doctor I'd picked at random out of the Yellow Pages. ''By George, you might be a candidate for the first head transplant. Could make us both famous if it worked. Even if it didn't I'd get a lot of ink for pioneering a process that's bound to come sooner or later.'' At this stage I was perfectly willing to try a head transplant. ''Tell me something more about your symptoms,'' the doctor said. I told him the Gestapo had beaten the backs of my legs through a thousand-hour night. ''Sounds to me like it's just a cold,'' he said. Just a cold? I was willing to undergo a head transplant, and he called it just a cold? ''I'm offering to put my head in your hands,'' I said. ''If it works you will go down in the annals of medicine as the man who discovered the cure for the common cold.'' Sorry, he said. Nobody in medicine had been interested in the common cold in the last 30 years. If his colleagues ever caught him working on it, he'd be laughed out of the profession for pursuing unglamorous research. ''Just suffer agony for a few days and you'll soon be good as new,'' he said. In midafternoon my head abruptly stopped gushing away through eye slits and nostrils, and an immense but invisible chain was suddenly cinched tight around my chest. Death seemed imminent. I was gasping for a final breath of air when a research professor of medicine, an old friend of mine, dropped in for a chat. ''Of course you feel like you're dying,'' he smiled, ''but statistically speaking, death in these cases is very rare.'' While I went purple with coughing, he chatted about the latest developments in genetics. Did I know, for example, that by putting a rat gene into a mouse, science could now produce a mouse twice as big as mice normally are? I offered him a chance to help mankind. ''Take a gene from a mouse with a head cold and put it in me,'' I urged, ''and maybe you can produce a man with a cold 10 times smaller than he used to get.'' ''In medicine,'' he explained, ''nobody gets the big ink for work on the common cold. Just take a couple of aspirins and get into bed.''

780-> Reagan, in Statement, Acclaims Polish Union
President Reagan issued a statement today marking the second anniversary of the Polish Government's formal recognition of Solidarity union, saying the struggle goes on despite attempts to destroy the movement. ''Today marks the second anniverary of an important milestone in mankind's age-long struggle for freedom,'' Mr. Reagan said. ''In November 1980, for the first time since 1917, a Communist government was compelled to grant formal recognition to a free trade union, Solidarity. ''This unprecedented step was brought about by a nonviolent revolution of millions of Polish workers who could no longer tolerate coercion and mismanagement.'' Referring to the crackdown on Solidarity the Polish Government began a month later with the declaration of martial law, Mr. Reagan said: ''It is said that by declaring war on its people, the Polish Government has destroyed Solidarity. This is not so. One can imprison protesters, club and disperse demonstrators with tear gas or water cannons, but the specter remains: Never again will the self-appointed representatives of the workers be able to pretend that they represent anyone but themselves.''

781-> Hillary Demby Is the Bride of Donald Malafronte
Hillary Demby, a hospital specialist in the municipal bond division of Standard & Poor's in New York, was married yesterday to Donald Malafronte, son of Mr. and Mrs. P.A. Malafronte of West Hempstead, L.I. New Jersey Superior Court Judge Frances Cocchia performed the ceremony at the bridegroom's home in Mountain Lakes, N.J. The bride, who will keep her name professionally, is a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Alexander Demby of Jersey City. She was graduated from New York University, as was her husband, and received her master's degree in public health from Yale University. Her previous marriage ended in divorce. The bridegroom is director of the Urban Health Institute in Roseland, N.J., a nonprofit corporation that provides planning counsel to health care management. He previously had served as chief of urban operations for the New Jersey Regional Medical Program. His first wife died. The bride's father is a retired electrical contractor and Mr. Malafronte's father is a retired electrical engineer.

782-> SCOUTING; The Jersey Hills
When the national cross-country championships were scheduled for the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey, everything seemed in place: A field of 1,000 runners headed by Alberto Salazar, the marathon man, and a 6.2-mile course laid out around the perimeter of the race track and the training track. One thing was missing: Hills. ''In Europe,'' said Fred Lebow, president of the New York Road Runners Club, ''all the cross-country courses have natural hills. We had to solve some problems in the Meadowlands because the regular race track is a one-mile oval and the training track is a half-mile around. But we laid out the course around both tracks. But we still had no hills. So we decided to create some.'' The hill-making project will start in a few days. Hills will be built in the quarter-mile area between the two tracks, giving the area a new profile for a while. ''Six hills in all,'' Lebow said. ''We won't have to import any materials. They're constantly changing the surfaces of the tracks, so there are tons of dirt available. And they'll build six hills up ramps, anywhere from six feet high to 15 feet. Then they'll have hills, the way you're supposed to, when they run the cross-country.''

784-> PHILHARMONIC: LOPEZ-COBOS
Jesus Lopez-Cobos's second New York Philharmonic program of the season Thursday night in Avery Fisher Hall lacked anything overtly glamorous - no big-name soloist, no blockbuster, no premiere, no certified exotica. Yet in its own modest way the program and performances added up to a most pleasant evening. Least effective was the opener, Schubert's Symphony No. 4 in C minor (''Tragic''). This was a perfectly honorable reading, but it remained just that - a reading. The orchestra played decently, but neither the hall's acoustics nor the apparent slighting of rehearsal time nor Mr. Lopez-Cobos's intepretive insights brought much special to the music. Carl Nielsen's Clarinet Concerto (Op. 57), which followed, is curiously akin to Shostakovich in its nervous patterings from the snare drum, its brooding anticipations and its vigorous neo-Classicisms. It is an engaging piece, and the Philharmonic's own Stanley Drucker brought the solo part virtuosically to life. After the intermission came two scores that used to crop up on subscription programs more frequently than they do today. Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, first championed by Arturo Toscanini, remains a wonderful piece - gorgeous sonorities rising to an impassioned climax - and the Philharmonic strings did it justice. The concert ended with Richard Strauss's ''Death and Transfiguration.'' Mr. Lopez-Cobos paced this bit of brooding Germanic mysticism aptly and by and large the orchestra responded well. The quieter parts sounded lovely, and while the louder passages sometimes grew raucous, the unusual clarity of the acoustics served to reaffirm Strauss's remarkable skills as an orchestrator.

785-> Heller Sees Recovery Lag
Walter Heller, an economist who served in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, said today that there was no visible economic recovery for voters to consider before going to the polls next month. He compared President Reagan's plea to ''stay the course'' with the voyage of the Titanic. Mr. Heller, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, said recovery could begin next year, but that unemployment ''will hover around double-digits for months to come.'' He also said a substantial victory of Democrats in November could make a difference in ending the recession. Mr. Heller, a professor of economics at the University of Minnesota, compared President Reagan's economic program to the voyage of the ill-fated ocean liner during an interview on the CBS News television program ''Face the Nation.'' The Titanic sank on its maiden voyage. The economic course that Mr. Heller outlined was for the Federal Reserve Board to continue its easing of monetary restraints and a consistent effort to hold down Federal deficits. If that happened, he said, ''then I could see the skies brightening sometime in 1983. After all, recessions do come to an end.'' On unemployment, Mr. Heller said he expected the rate to rise to 10.5 percent or ''a little beyond that,'' and to exceed 9 percent a year from now.

786-> STAGE: CARYL CHURCHILL'S 'TOP GIRLS,' AT THE PUBLIC
IN the long-running ''Cloud 9,'' her first play to be seen in New York, the English playwright Caryl Churchill turned our usually wellordered theatrical universe topsy-turvy. She sent her cast leaping in and out of two centuries and continents, three genders and even one another's roles. Whatever the effort's flaws, it was always the product of a strikingly original and supple imagination. You could feel the author's bracing determination to liberate both the theater and the audience from every esthetic and sexual shackle in sight. Miss Churchill's newest play, which journeyed intact from London to the Public's Newman Theater last night, is no match for its predecessor, but, happily, it is every bit as intent on breaking rules. The work's title is ''Top Girls,'' and its protagonist, Marlene (Gwen Taylor), is the newly named managing director of the Top Girls Employment Agency in contemporary London. In an opening scene that is almost beyond daring, Marlene throws a dinner party to celebrate her promotion. The setting is a trendy Anglo-Italian restaurant called La Prima Donna. The guests, it could be said, are all dead. The women joining Marlene for white wine and pasta are none other than real and fictional prima donnas of the past: Isabella Bird, a Victorian explorer; Lady Nijo, a medieval Oriental concubine turned pioneering Buddhist nun; Dull Gret, the armor-plated woman who led a female charge through hell in Bruegel's painting ''Dulle Griet''; Pope Joan, who may have presided briefly over the Vatican in the ninth century, and Chaucer's Patient Griselda. Dressed in their appropriate historical outfits (amusingly designed by Pam Tait), these women chattily compare notes and laud their hostess on her new success. Such is Miss Churchill's great gift for making the illogical both human and plausible that we quickly forget that we're in a timewarped cloud-cuckoo land. The wild tricks of ''Top Girls'' don't end there. Though we never see Marlene's party guests again, other surprises follow as Miss Churchill gets to the main business of her play, which is primarily a realistic probing of Marlene's rise to the top at Top Girls. The actresses in the company keep popping up in new roles; the setting switches abruptly and at first inexplicably between London and a dreary working-class home in provincial Suffolk; the evening ends with a scene that predates the rest of the action by a year. Miss Churchill also makes abundant use of overlapping, intentionally indecipherable dialogue, Robert Altman-style, as well as of lengthy pauses and stage waits that would make any Pinter play seem as frantic as a Marx Brothers sketch by comparison. One cannot be too thankful for all these brave gambles, the strangely compelling and somehow moving silences included. Miss Churchill sees the theater as an open frontier where lives can be burst apart and explored, rather than as a cage that flattens out experience and diminishes it. Because of the startling technique and several passages of dazzling writing, ''Top Girls'' is almost always fascinating, even when it is considerably less than involving. Some of the play's slippage does occur, it's true, when Miss Churchill's experiments run on self-indulgently. It seems unduly perverse that almost every scene must trail off before ending. The fantasy prologue, fun as it may be, is seriously overlong; later on, the author has trouble resisting the urge to lecture. Yet the major difficulty in ''Top Girls'' is a matter of content, not form. To these male American ears, Miss Churchill's new statement about women and men seems far more simplistic and obvious than the fervent pansexuality of ''Cloud 9.'' The message announces itself in that first scene, which proves an almost anthropological search for the ties that bind history's strongest sisters. Like Marlene, the famous icons at her table are ''top girls'' - courageous women who have ''come a long way'' by accomplishing ''extraordinary achievements.'' But they've all paid a price for success: They've sacrificed their personal lives and children, been abused by men and lost contact with women who did not become ''top girls.'' And we soon learn that Marlene, the present-day inheritor of their hard struggles for independent womanhood, is worse off yet. In order to fight her way up from her backwater proletarian roots to the executive suite, she has become, figuratively speaking, a male oppressor. When we watch Marlene's chillingly antiseptic agency in action, we quickly see that it is designed to coach its female clients into adopting the most odious male traits and values: the steely selfishness and aggression that ostensibly propel one forward in the Darwinist business world. Marlene's own emotional and sexual life is as barren as Lady Macbeth's - she pointedly recoils at the mere mention of the word ''gynecology.'' She's even abandoned her illegitimate and dull-witted daughter (Carole Hayman), leaving her sister to raise the girl as her own child instead. Marlene treats women of lower social status - from the waitress at La Prima Donna to her clients and family - as callously as any man might; she chastises the working class she's left behind as ''lazy and stupid.'' Finally, she even consigns her tubby, misfit daughter to the social junk heap by coldly remarking, ''She's a bit thick -a bit funny. She's not going to make it.'' To Marlene, the ability to make it by male success standards is the only criterion of female worth. No one can deny that women like Marlene exist. As Miss Churchill ultimately makes too clear, her heroine is partly a caricature of the ultimate British ''top girl,'' Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. But the playwright seems to beg her complicated issues by showing us only her monstrous heroine at one extreme, and, at the other, the victimized women that the Marlenes of this world exploit and betray. The absence of the middle range - of women who achieve without imitating power-crazed men and denying their own humanity - is an artificial polemical contrivance that cuts the play off at the heart. We're never quite convinced that women's choices are as limited and, in the play's final word, ''frightening'' as the stacked case of ''Top Girls'' suggests. Even in England, one assumes, not every woman must be either an iron maiden or a downtrodden serf. Still, we're often carried along by the author's unpredictable stagecraft, her observant flashes of angry wit and pathos. Among the best moments are the brief and scabrously sketched interview sessions with the pathetic clients at Top Girls and the affecting final confrontation between Marlene and her nonachieving sister (Deborah Findlay). Under the sensitive direction of Max Stafford-Clark, the entire play is perfectly acted by the tightknit ensemble, led by Miss Taylor's vibrant and not wholly unsympathetic Marlene. Lindsay Duncan is particularly delightful as a blonde Lady Nijo. Selina Cadell is wry and sad as both Pope Joan and a present-day corporate middle-manager - both women who passed as men to advance their careers, then met with tragic ends. The production at the Public has been transported from the adventurous Royal Court Theater, under a laudable new exchange program. The run is limited to a month with this cast. However trying ''Top Girls'' can be, that doesn't alter the fact that New Yorkers have a rare but brief opportunity to see a brand-new work by an important English playwright in its original staging. Everything considered, it might well be wise to catch what Miss Churchill is up to while you can and quarrel with her later.

789-> HOW ABOUT DIM SUM AT DINNER?
SAN FRANCISCO IT is this city's newest look in Chinese restaurants, a sleek, white-walled, brass-railed, ivy-hung former furniture showroom. Called Yank Sing, it serves, of all things, those traditional Chinese breakfast dumplings called dim sum for dinner. ''If you accept it for breakfast and lunch, why not for dinner?'' said Henry Chan, co-owner of the restaurant, which is at 427 Battery Street in the financial district. And so at brunch, among the Marcel Breuer caned oak chairs, the butcher-block tables, the etched-glass partitions and the whitedraped tables are wheeled serving carts dispensing shrimp dumplings, steamed pork buns, coriander-laced water dumplings, tiny vegetablefilled spring rolls and sweet egg custard tarts. These are not the customary steel carts of the plain dim sum parlor, pushed by middleaged women crooning, ''Har gau. Siu mai Char siu bau.'' Instead, cloth-covered trolleys with assortments of imaginatively arranged dim sum are pushed by bow-tied college-age men and women, each personally chosen and hired by the Chans. It is the same in the evenings. Traditionally, the serving of dim sum usually ends in early afternoon, but at Yank Sing dim sum constitute the dinner menu as well. Judging by the numbers of diners, San Franciscans seem to like the novelty of the menu as much as they seem to like the decor of this restaurant, which is so unlike the usual run of plain, undecorated Chinatown-style establishments. As if its uncharacteristic look and menu were not arresting enough, the restaurant is run by Judy Chan, a physician, and her husband, Henry, who says he would like nothing better than to finish medical school and become administrator of a free clinic. Mr. Chan, 38 years old, is president of Yank Sing; Dr. Chan, 36, is secretary-treasurer. Dr. Chan, who has a pharmacy degree from the University of California at San Francisco and graduated from the university's medical center here last year, said somewhat ruefully, ''We're in the restaurant business now, but I'd like to get back to medicine if I could.'' Her husband, who has a degree in finance from California State University in Los Angeles, studied hotel and restaurant management at the University of Nevada and was but one semester away from graduation from the University of the East medical school in Manila, hopes that the operation of the restaurant will reach a point that he can finish school. Yank Sing, in the heart of the Embarcadero, is a restaurant of changing character that during the week is a lunch and dinner spot for the business community but on weekends becomes a most traditional dim sum breakfast-brunch parlor for a sizable segment of the Chinese community. This Yank Sing is one of three operated by the Chan family. The first, opened in 1958 by Mr. Chan's father, George, who left China for Hong Kong just ahead of the Communist takeover of China in 1949, was a 35-seat dim sum parlor at the edge of Chinatown here; it eventually closed. The second, with 120 seats, was opened in 1966 by the elder Mr. Chan a short distance away from the first, on Broadway between Stockton and Grant Streets. The third was opened in 1974 in the financial district at Stevenson and Second Streets. When the third place opened, it was the only downtown San Francisco restaurant offering only dim sum and noodle dishes. During this time Henry Chan was helping with his family's restaurant expansion and going to school - until 1979, when his mother became seriously ill. ''I had to come into the business full time,'' he said. ''Judy came with me.'' It was their idea ''to uplift the vision of dim sum as well as Chinese food in general,'' Mr. Chan said, adding: ''Customers are demanding good service, good quality, cleanliness and an atmosphere without abrasiveness. Most Chinese restaurants emphasize food alone. We wanted to provide the best possible atmosphere we could. We wanted to create our own market.'' It is an idea that seems to have succeeded. At midday the 350-seat restaurant serves as many as 500 dim sum lunches, virtually all to executives, brokers, salesmen, clerks and secretaries, many in their 20's and 30's, from nearby financial institutions. Because of the time difference with New York financial centers, many brokerage offices here start at 6 A.M. or earlier, so that by 11 A.M., when Yank Sing opens, the business day is almost over and dim sum brunch can be a leisurely meal of desultory snacks. The Chans employ 24 dim sum makers and a dining-room staff of 60. More than 60 varieties of dim sum come from its kitchens. For dinner 25 of the more popular and elaborate dim sum are put on a special menu, and there is, in addition, a small selection of simple stir-fried dishes. These evening dim sum, artfully arranged, cost about $3 an order. During the day simpler and smaller servings cost about half that. On weekends, when Yank Sing becomes a true extension of Chinatown, when families of 10 or more crowd around the big round tables, when Chinese outnumber Westerners by as many as three to one, prices for average dim sum dishes drop to about $1.20. Mr. Chan, asked why, replied with a grin, ''Saturdays and Sundays are Cantonese days.''

790-> SURVEY SAYS RECESSION FORCES CUTS AND LAYOFFS IN 25 STATES
A survey of 25 states indicates that the recession has forced them to cut services, lay off employees and undertake other cost-saving measures in the last six months, the National Governors Association reports. The survey said the ''substantially reduced expenditures'' had been undertaken because of lagging collections, despite tax increases enacted by the states in the last two years. State revenue collections are failing to live up to earlier projections, said the report, which was issued last weekend. It was based on preliminary data collected by the governors' association and the National Association of State Budget Officers. The states on which the preliminary results were based are Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Virginia. ''Expenditures in these 25 states were reduced even more as states instituted a variety of cost-saving measures, including layoffs of employees, restrictions on state travel and purchases and across-theboard cuts,'' the report said. The situation for the current fiscal year shows continued deterioration in the states' financial condition, the study said. Estimated revenue was said to be off $1.8 billion, or 2.2 percent. States not included in the study also face severe financial constraints. In Wisconsin, Governor-elect Anthony S. Earl, facing a $265 million deficit, announced plans that include repeal of a new $75 million property tax credit.In Indiana, Gov. Robert D. Orr has called a special session of the Legislature to deal with a projected $452 million deficit. And in Minnesota, the Legislature has completed action on a $350 million package of tax increases, spending cuts and payment shifts.

793-> Chrysler's Talks in Canada Stalled
The union representing Chrysler's 10,000 Canadian workers said today that a strike would begin Friday if last-minute negotiations failed to win a pay increase that Chrysler says it can not afford. Chrysler and the union pledged to negotiate until the 10 A.M. deadline, but neither side held out much hope of a settlement after a meeting Wednesday between Lee A. Iacocca, Chrysler's chairman, and Robert White, director of the United Automobile Workers in Canada, failed to get the stalled talks moving. ''I think it's almost impossible to avoid a strike now,'' Mr. White told reporters today, ''but if the company were to surprise us and make an economic offer, we could work to make it a short one.'' A strike by Chrysler workers in Canada would cause major problems in at the company's United States operations. Chrysler has four plants in Windsor and one each in two other Ontario cities, Ajax and Etobicoke. The Chrysler New Yorker and several other models are produced only in Canada, as is interior trim used in United States production. Letter From Iacocca Mr. Iacocca said in a letter to Chrysler workers that a work stoppage ''will cripple the company and, perhaps, ruin it.'' ''We will take a strike if we must, even though we are aware it could put us out of business,'' he told the Canadian workers. ''We wish we could pay you on a parity basis with Ford and G.M. Eventually we may be able to do so, but not now.'' A strike in Canada would force the layoff of at least 6,000 workers in the United States who make parts for the Canadian plants, and if it continued, the entire active Chrysler work force of 43,000 would be threatened, Chrysler officials said. The union has rejected Chrysler's offer, which, like the proposal turned down in the United States, provides no raises beyond a costof-living adjustment in December. The American workers voted last month to postpone further negotiations until January rather than go out on strike. Chrysler workers have had no raises since 1979, when they made concessions to help the company stave off bankruptcy. Mr. White said his members were insisting on a substantial increase to put them ''on the road to parity'' with their colleagues at the Ford Motor Company and at the General Motors Corporation, who now make about $3 an hour more.

794-> GOING OUT GUIDE
LOBBYISTS Big new buildings in Manhattan sport lobbies that are designed as public places, indoor parks where one may sit and read, perhaps buy a snack, or use as a rendezvous for meeting friends. A new high, wide and handsome - if a bit bare - lobby has recently made its debut. It is the glass-enclosed 11,000-square-foot ground floor of the new 43-story I.B.M. Building at Madison Avenue and 57th Street. There is no waterfall here, in what is called the Garden Plaza, but there are tall bamboo trees, the tallest of them 45 feet high, reaching toward the 68-foot-high ceiling of this unusual greenhouse in Midtown Manhattan. This most roomy spread is dotted with small tables and chairs enough to seat 60 people. Open, free, from 8 A.M. to 10 P.M. every day. The New York Botanical Garden has opened a Shop-in-the-Garden in the plaza, its first facility anywhere out of its Bronx base, and one may buy plates and glassware and bone china, jewelry and the like, all with flower motifs; also gardening supplies and bulbs. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., (220-8700). PIANIST Cecile Licad is a 22-year-old pianist from the Philippines. Ever since she was 19 and a student of Rudolf Serkin, she has performed with the Boston Symphony at Tanglewood, the New York Philharmonic, the Chicago Symphony, the New Japan Philharmonic, the London Symphony and others of similar caliber. Last year she won the Leventritt Gold Medal, the first one awarded in 10 years. Tonight at 8 o'clock, however, Miss Licad makes her orchestral debut in Carnegie Hall. She will be the soloist for a Mozart piano concerto in the house, at 57th Street and Seventh Avenue, appearing with the New York String Orchestra. The group, conducted for the last 14 years around Christmastime by Alexander Schneider, consists of 65 similar-aged talented musicians. Also on the program is music by Haydn, Beethoven and Strauss. Miss Licad will make her Carnegie Hall recital (tonight's is orchestral) debut next year. Admission: $4, $5.50, $6.50, $7.50. Tickets: 247-7459. WAR AND PEACE ''Battles and Leaders of the Civil War'' brings to life, through 53 wash and pen-and-pencil drawings on view through Jan. 4 at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street (369-488), the terrible conflict that divided the nation in the 1860's. Combat artists, similar to correspondents, and artists serving in the military, with their work, enhanced by illustrators who worked from sketches, photographs and imagination, caught the flavor of the front. Century magazine commissioned 70 artists to do this; a fourvolume history, with the same title as this exhibition's, was published in 1888, and is the source of the present show. Walking past these scenes, which might have illustrated Stephen Crane's novel of the war, ''The Red Badge of Courage,'' the confusion of battle, the grandeur of war at sea, the broken battle lines and the holding lines all come to life. This is a noisy war waged on the quiet walls of the academy. But in another gallery here, 100 paintings and drawings in a retrospective of Abbott Handerson Thayer's artistry, reflect a turnof-century chaste gentility in keeping with the pretensions of the ''Gilded Era'' and later, when the artist gained notice for his portraits and landscapes. He idealized women, birds and countryside in his work, all of which is very evident in what you see here, through Jan. 23. Open noon to 8 P.M. Tuesdays, noon to 5 Wednesdays through Sundays (but not New Year's Day). Admission: $1.50; free after 5 Tuesdays. OPERA Last summer a new opera project of Greenwich House, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, near Bleecker Street, gave its first performance, a concert version of ''Cosi Fan Tutte.'' It was well received, and now, tonight and tomorrow at 8 P.M., the second opera will be done, Mozart's ''The Magic Flute.'' The work, done in full in concert rather than as a staged presentation, will be sung in German by the cast of young professionals, all graduates of major music schools and chosen from recommendations by musicians and established music teachers. They are the ones with whom the project is concerned, singers for whom the performance is not a debut but an important step at the beginning of a career. Edward Houser conducts the 25-piece orchestra. Admission: $8; over-65's, $6. Entertainment Events is on page C20. Wednesday Sports is on page B6. Richard F. Shepard

797-> REQUIRED READING
'I Feel Strongly' Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, in debate on the gasoline tax bill, Dec. 20, 1982: I am not one who feels so strongly that that is right or wrong. But I know there is one subject about which I feel very strongly, and that is the fact that throughout this nation the administrators of the transit authorities - I do not care whether it is in San Francisco, Chicago, Washington or wherever - are becoming the highest paid public executives in the nation. They are getting more money than the mayors of their communities. They are getting more money than the governors of their states. They are taking trips all over the nation into the most luxurious areas, because they know that the Federal Government is picking up a very substantial portion of that tab. I think it is high time that the Congress provide some limits that officials working for regional transit authorities, mass transit authorities, not be permitted to receive a salary in excess of the highest paid official in the community in which they are operating. I think maybe we ought to send the message as well that it is time for them to cut back on their fancy vacations to all the luxurious areas of this nation. The Senate's Troubles Representative Barber B. Conable Jr., Republican of upstate New York, in his newsletter to constituents issued Dec. 26, 1982: I do not believe with Henry Adams that a Senator is ''like a begonia, showy but useless.'' Some of the people I admire most in the world are, or have been senators. The Congress always seems to add up to much less than the sum of its parts, and right now, after the lame-duck session, the Senate appears to be an institution badly in need of overhauling. The institutional indignities it inflicted upon its members during the past two weeks amounted to cruel and unusual punishment. Central to the Senate's troubles are two rules - or the lack of rules - extended debate and germaneness. Extended debate is Senate talk for that mortal enemy of patience, the filibuster. As to germaneness, or relevancy, Senate rules recognize none of the discipline which the House has imposed on itself. The result is that every bill becomes a hodgepodge, and the same amendment will be added to each of five or six bills, creating five or six hostages to nongermaneness. Enough is enough. Nobody expects democracy to be efficient - individual freedom was the primary purpose of our founders - but it should function at least a little. Advice to Freshmen Representative Morris K. Udall, Democrat of Arizona, offering advice to incoming freshmen members of Congress, in an interview with Common Cause Magazine, January 1983: You've taken your solemn oath, and if you're like me, you felt the rush of emotion and pride that goes with being a member of Congress. However, don't let it go to your head. You might well think of the words of a retired member's farewell to his colleagues: ''May the future bring all the best to you and your family and friends, and may your mother never find out where you work.''

799-> CHICAGO SEES 2 DECADES OF ABAKANOWIZ WORKS
CHICAGO ''EMBRYOLOGY,'' by the Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz, is an arrangement of 800 rounded forms, some bigger than a body, some smaller than a fist. At a distance, they appear as solid as stones, but up close they reveal an unexpected, vulnerable softness, a tangle of string beneath a thin membrane of mesh or burlap. ''Embryology'' fills an entire gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, where the first major retrospective of Miss Abakanowicz's works has gone on view. Part of the exhibition is displayed at the Public Library's cultural center because the museum lacked sufficient space for the artist's large installations. The retrospective spans two decades of her work, beginning with the monumental woven ''Abakans,'' whose convention-breaking dimensions and refusal to be merely decorative propelled their maker to international recognition in the mid-1960's. (The name was coined by a critic and later adopted by the artist.) The works in this series, woven in large pieces and stitched together by Miss Abakanowicz and two assistants in her Warsaw studio, are massive, monochromatic, organic shapes. Discovering What You Want The hairy, rootlike protuberances, orifices and undulating surfaces of the ''Abakans'' are suggestive of genitalia, of ancient trees and garments, of large aquatic and winged creatures. ''Everybody can discover in them what he wants to,'' Miss Abakanowicz said in considered, accented English. ''Very seldom is the interpretation against my feelings. Most of the time it is something I can accept.'' It hasn't always been that way, however. ''When I created the 'Abakans,' there was nothing like this kind of form in weaving,'' Miss Abakanowicz explained during her visit to Chicago for her retrospective. ''People wanted to push my work into the category of weaving, of decoration for architecture. Categories are important for art historians, not for the artist. I don't care if it is sculpture or object. I created the 'Abakans' as a protest against convention, as a need to escape everything established.'' Communicating With Message At the 1965 Sao Paulo Biennale, Miss Abakanowicz recalled, ''I was completely unknown. My work got recognized as a message; there was an integrated energy that people felt. This was a way of communicating, the way of showing people the unexpected richness of our world. ''Why had I chosen weaving? Because when I began to study art I understood that my imagination doesn't fit in any existing philosophy or trend or tendency in art,'' Miss Abakanowicz continued. ''As a child I always constructed forms, and they were a kind of bridge between me and reality. This necessity of bringing my imagination into objects didn't change. I am absolutely sure it comes from the oldest part of my brain. There comes a need to make something. I live with this need; it becomes more and more a vision. As it becomes clear, I begin to put it into material.'' Miss Abakanowicz's materials have changed as she has solved one set of artistic problems and moved on to another. From weaving she proceeded to rope installations in the early 1970's, and to construction made with existing fabric. She abandoned color along the way, in her art and her clothing; Miss Abakanowicz dresses almost exclusively in dark tunics and pants now. Fighting 'Established Feeling' ''I had a struggle with color, because I wanted to work against the established feeling we have toward color,'' she recalled. ''I think we are rather tired with too much color in publicity around us. I turned to black, which was still too rich. I feel very comfortable now with the colors made by nature. To make the message clear, the absence of color is very important. Absence is more important sometimes than presence, like silence says more sometimes than speech.'' Describing ''Backs,'' a cycle of 80 objects formed of gluepermeated burlap and string pressed into a plaster mold of a man's seated back and thighs, Miss Abakanowicz said: ''They belong so much to all the gray in the world. They are like stones, like shells coming from the seas with all the plants that are growing on them. The 'Backs' are to me a very contemplative piece. One should be alone with them.'' At some exhibitions, she said: ''People have begun to multiply 'The Backs.' They are there a while, they look around, and finally they sit next to them on the floor. It must be the visualization of a common mythology that brings us together.'' At the Museum of Contemporary Art, the ''Backs'' are arranged in widely spaced rows facing a wall. From behind, they appear solid, but from the front they are hollow, haunting. Elsewhere, Miss Abakanowicz has placed them in a broad arc, or in close rows. She insists on arranging her work no matter where it is exhibited. ''Backs'' was created over the last six years, a part of Miss Abakanowicz's ''Alterations'' series, which spans a decade and includes ''Embryology'' and other cycles made of burlap, hemp, mesh, string, thread and glue. But such materials of every sort have become increasingly hard to come by in Poland since the imposition of martial law nearly a year ago, she said. Although Miss Abakanowicz travels and exhibits freely, she acknowledged that martial law ''has affected the life of everybody; we all suffer from moral pressure. It is like a great illness.'' ''Magdalena Abkanowicz: a Retrospective'' will remain in Chicago through Jan. 2. It will then travel to Montreal, Portland, Dallas, Los Angeles, Japan, and possibly New York.

801-> Bridge: 3 Teams End a Year's Play For the Von Zedtwitz Title
Very few recreational events take a year to complete. One of them is the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship, which will conclude in New York next Wednesday and Friday in a three-team final at the Cavendish Club to decide the 1982 title, just as the 1983 event is getting under way. The three teams in the final are led by Peter Leventritt, Tim Nelsen and John Lowenthal. Each team has lost one match to one of the others. Lowenthal, who had lost earlier to Nelsen by just one international match point, came from behind in a semifinal match this week to beat Leventritt by 19 points. In the diagramed deal, from the last session, North-South found themselves in no man's land, hanging between game and slam. South opened a thin hand, and West crowded the auction with a weak jump to three diamonds. North could have settled safely for three notrump, but not unnaturally he had visions of slam. His negative double caused South to show his club suit, and the partnership was groping for a non-existent fit. The final contract of five hearts was distinctly shaky, but could have been made. The opening lead of the diamond king was won with the ace, and South guessed right in clubs by leading the ten for a winning finesse. He then cashed the A-Q of hearts and ruffed a diamond. The king of hearts was played, leaving East with the jack, and, after taking the ace and king of clubs, South had the lead in his hand in this position: NORTH S Q 8 4 H - D 10 9 C - WEST EAST S K 7 S J 10 6 3 H - H J D Q J 7 D - C - C - SOUTH S A 9 5 H 9 D - C 6 South led his last club, and if East had ruffed, the defense would have had no chance. But Dorothy Truscott, as East, thoughtfully discarded a spade, leaving South with a choice. Obviously, he could have led spades to make his contract, but it seemed likely to him that the spade king was on his right. He led his trump, hoping to end-play East, but West scored the spade king and a diamond winner for down one. In the replay the contract was three no-trump, making with an overtrick, and the Lowenthal team gained 13 points. NORTH S Q 8 4 2 H A Q D A 10 9 6 C A 10 5 WEST EAST S K 7 S J 10 6 3 H 4 3 H J 10 7 2 D K Q J 7 5 2 D 8 4 C 9 8 3 C Q 7 2 SOUTH (D) S A 9 5 H K 9 8 6 5 D 3 C K J 6 4 North and South were vulnerable.

802-> PERSONAL FINANCE; LAST MINUTE TAX MOVES FOR 1982
PEOPLE who operate their own businesses, have large amounts of d ividend and interest income or hold incentive stock options may be a ble to cut their 1982 tax bill substantially if they act now. B ecause of changes in the tax law that will go into effect in J anuary, there are only a few weeks left to make the most of certain l oopholes that are about to be closed. If, for example, you run your own business, be it a consulting practice or a manufacturing operation, consider buying equipment such as a new computer, copier or car before Dec. 31, to make full use of the quicker depreciation schedules. You may have been delaying such purchases in the expectation of even faster depreciation deductions slated to take effect in 1985 and 1986. But tax legislation earlier this year repealed those provisions, so taxpayers who have deferred capital investments in anticipation of these faster write-offs need wait no longer. Besides, acting now assures you of being able to take maximum advantage of the new accelerated cost recovery system for business property. Even if you acquire new or used business property on the last day of the year, you will be able to claim depreciation on it as if it had been acquired on July 1. Furthermore, a little-publicized provision of the new tax law provides an additional incentive to buy business property by Dec. 31. After that date, the total of the depreciation deductions you will be permitted to take over the life of an asset will be reduced by half the amount of the investment tax credit you get in the year of purchase. Take the case of someone who buys a $5,000 computer, which is considered five-year property and qualifies for the full 10 percent investment credit. If he purchases it this year, he gets the full credit of $500 and can also depreciate the entire $5,000 cost. If he buys it in January and claims the credit, the cost basis for depreciation will be cut by half of the credit, or $250, and come to only $4,750. If you are moonlighting at a second job and use part of your home as your base of operations, don't shrink from making improvements to your home office for fear you won't be able to claim the deductions. While the Internal Revenue Service has historically opposed deductions for depreciation or a portion of the rent related to a home office except under certain situations, a law enacted last year made clear that these expenses are deductible. And if you've bought a home computer you may be able to claim write-offs associated with its use ''to the extent it is used for business purposes,'' says Ernst & Whinney, the accounting firm. You may also be able to secure an 11-month tax deferral on your dividend and interest income by forming a ''Subchapter S'' corporation before year-end. These closely held concerns have many attributes of corporations but their income (and losses) are passed through to shareholders as if they were partnerships. The reason to form one by Dec. 31 is that a new law has greatly liberalized the amount of ''passive'' income, from such sources as rents, interest and dividends, that these business entities can earn. But it also provides that starting in 1983, new Subchapter S corporations that cannot prove a business purpose must use a calendar rather than a fiscal year for tax purposes. Having a fiscal year for a Subchapter S corporation is a big advantage for most individuals because they generally are on a calendar year for tax purposes. Putting the corporation on a fiscal year postpones, in effect, the individual's tax on the corporation's income for 11 months after the fiscal year ends. Accountants are advising many clients with large amounts of dividend and interest income to shift investments to a Subchapter S corporation with a Jan. 31, 1983, year-end; that way, tax won't be due until a year from now. ''It's perfect for corporate executives or independent business persons who have some - but not necessarily inordinate amounts - of dividend and interest income,'' says Leon M. Nad, senior partner with the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse. ''The beauty of this thing is that if you get started this year - and only this year - you can have 100 percent of your income as passive income.'' It's not necessary to have tens of thousands of dollars in passive income to capitalize on the ploy. ''We're doing it for clients with $6,000 to $8,000 in dividend and interest income on up,'' says Mr. Nad. But Congress may close this loophole. Late last month the Treasury said it would ask Congress to do so for Subchapter S corporations formed on or before Oct. 19. But accountants continue to inform clients of the gambit. ''It's a gamble,'' said Mr. Nad, ''and we tell clients to approach it with caution.'' FINALLY, if you are an executive who has been granted incentive s tock options that you can exercise this year or next, you may be b etter off exercising them in 1982. (Incentive stock options, c reated by the 1981 tax act, are special incentives to buy company s tock that receive better tax treatment than nonqualified options.) T he reason to exercise incentive options this year is the new a lternative minimum tax, which goes into effect in 1983. The revised A .M.T., as it is called in the accounting world, will apply only if i t is greater than your regular tax. It is intended to insure that h igh-income individuals pay at least some tax. ''You don't need to worry about it if you earn $50,000 or $60,000 and have, say $10,000 worth of long-term capital gains,'' says Theodore Romak, a tax partner with Arthur Young & Company. ''But if your income is substantially higher, and you have significant longterm capital gains and other tax preference items you may well get caught.'' That's because starting Jan. 1, the bargain element of incentive options (the spread between the purchase price of the stock and the exercise price of the option) will be a tax preference item subject to the A.M.T. But if the options are exercised this year, the spread will not be taxed. Normally, the difference between the original price of incentive options and their market price on the day you exercise them and buy the stock is not taxable; the tax is deferred until you sell. But if you have enough tax preference items from other sources to fall under the net of the A.M.T. next year, you may be taxed on that spread as soon as you exercise. If you are subject to the A.M.T. in 1983, be aware that you will get no tax benefit at all for certain deductions, such as state and local income taxes and real estate taxes, because of the mechanics of the computation, warns Mr. Romak. His advice: Prepay tax installments in December. He also suggests trying to push income into 1983 because it will be taxed at the marginal A.M.T. rate of 20 percent rather than at the top marginal rate of 50 percent that would otherwise apply.

803-> AROUND THE WORLD; Portugal's Ruling Parties Suffer Some Local Losses
Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao said early today that his conservative coalition government would stay in office despite some losses in balloting Sunday in local Portuguese elections. The Prime Minister said his Social Democrat Party still held an advantage nationwide over the leading opposition party, the Socialists. Returns from more than 60 percent of the balloting for 70,000 local officials gave his coalition of Social Democrats, Christian Democrats and Monarchists 44.7 percent of the vote, down from its final tally of 47.2 percent in the last local elections three years ago. The Socialists of former Prime Minister Mario Soares were reported taking 30.9 percent, a 3 percent rise over the 1979 poll, while the country's pro-Soviet Communists were holding steady at close to 20 percent of the vote. In the previous election the Communists polled 20.5 percent.

804-> COMIC SONGS: NEAL ARLUCK
creation of a turn-of-the-century English music hall at the Village Gate a few seasons back. He is now doing a whole music-hall program, ''Pardon My English,'' more or less on his own, at Van Buren's, 349 West 46th Street, at the unlikely hour of 6 P.M. on Wednesdays. Mr. Arluck's musical hall is atmospherically British, centered primarily on the songs of Flanders and Swann. But he also draws on such American songwriters as Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, Harold Rome and the international team of Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin, delivering their songs with the clear precision and ripe fullness of a British variety performer. It is a rich collection of comic songs that Mr. Arluck crams into his 50-minute performance. As an obvious admirer of Michael Flanders, he is completely at home in such Flanders and Swann songs as ''The Gas Man Cometh'' and the outrageously seductive lines of ''Madeira.'' But he also ventures into Groucho Marx territory with Kalmar and Ruby's ''My Love Is Waiting,'' and he tries to follow Danny Kaye's prodigiously dextrous delivery of a long list of Russian composers that make up the lyric of ''Tchaikovsky,'' although he does not stay the complicated course quite as triumphantly as Mr. Kaye did. Mr. Arluck is assisted by Lillian Byrd, who moves chairs and microphones and hats with a wondrously expectant air, part of a running gag that quickly runs out of gas, although she herself is a consistently wide-eyed delight.

806-> EMOTIONAL APPEALS ARE MADE QUIETLY
Much of New York's 1982 race for governor has been fought over the air, with millions of dollars of television and radio ammunition. But supporters of Mario M. Cuomo and Lewis E. Lehrman are waging a second, virtually invisible campaign for the allegiance of the state's voters. The weapons are the telephone and the postage stamp, and they are being wielded with uncommon, and perhaps recordbreaking, vigor. While the candidates conduct what they like to call a ''campaign of ideas,'' their staffs are using phone banks and mass mailings to deliver carefully crafted appeals to carefully selected groups of voters. Sometimes, what is said through these more private channels would never be said on television or radio - or, at least, would be said differently. And although Mr. Cuomo, the Democratic-Liberal candidate, seemed by week's end to be ahead, both he and some of his aides said that if the balloting on Tuesday turns out to be close, his reliance on telephone canvassing and his opponent's use of the mails could well make the difference. Just as he has outspent Mr. Cuomo on television, so too has Mr. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative candidate, overwhelmed Mr. Cuomo through the mails. More than eight million pieces of literature have been sent to voters on Mr. Lehrman's behalf at a cost of about $1 million, according to campaign spokesman John Buckley. By comparison, the Cuomo campaign is getting out between two million and three million pieces of mail. Mr. Lehrman is surely setting a record for the use of mail in a New York State campaign, and he probably rivals any other statewide campaign in the country. But what is important is not so much the volume of mail but how it is distributed to groups of voters that Mr. Lehrman views as potential supporters. ''It's targeted,'' said Karl Ottosen, the Lehrman campaign manager. ''That is the beauty of direct mail. You don't change your message. You can't say anything you wouldn't say to the general public. Yet you can highlight points you want to make.'' Mr. Cuomo's supporters say they find something sinister about an effort in which different literature is sent to different voters, with Jews getting one letter and Catholics another. ''Pandering'' is the word the candidate himself used in a speech at the Buffalo International Airport on Friday. ''(The Lehrman) campaign has figured out what everybody's weakness is, what everybody's vulnerability is, what everybody's bias is,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''and they've printed a piece of literature with a different message for everyone.'' In his Buffalo speech, Mr. Cuomo said he feared that the impact of Mr. Lehrman's mailings was not showing up in polls that gave him a lead of more than 10 percentage points. A Catholic and the father of five, he was particularly incensed by a Lehrman mailing to Catholics which said: ''A vote for Lew Lehrman is a vote for traditional family values.'' Another letter, sent on Mr. Lehrman's behalf to Irish voters, says of Mr. Cuomo: ''If he were governor he would continue to take New York down the road to moral decay and financial ruin.'' The Lehrman mailings, according to Andrew Cuomo, the candidate's son and a top campaign operative, prompted the Cuomo campaign to send out its own letter to Catholic voters. Across the bottom was written: ''Mario Cuomo: he doesn't just talk about traditional values, he lives them.'' While it is not directly controlled by his campaign, Mr. Cuomo has benefited from an effort that is in some ways similiar to Mr. Lehrman's mass mailings. It is widely known that most of New York's labor organizations back Mr. Cuomo; less well known, except to union members, are the things being said about the candidates in the various publications written for, and mailed to, union members. Naturally enough, union newspapers have run strong editorial endorsements of Mr. Cuomo, but they have also run fierce attacks on Mr. Lehrman. For example, one of the largest of the union papers, The Public Employee Press, with a ciruclation of over 100,000, ran a two-page profile of Mr. Lehrman under the headline: ''If Lehrman Had His Way There Would Be No Unions.'' The article contained references to what it called the ''slave labor'' and ''concentration camp'' working conditions in the Rite Aid drugstore chain. The article did not contain any response from Rite Aid or Mr. Lehrman, who was once an executive of the company, and many of the incidents reported in the article, the candidate later pointed out, occurred after he left. Mr. Lehrman may be outdoing Mr. Cuomo at the post office, but the Cuomo team is clearly running up a larger phone bill. For several weeks his campaign, both directly and through unions and local politicians, has been operating telephone banks all over the state. Workers call prospective voters, find out where they stand and urge them to support Mr. Cuomo. The New York State United Teachers, for example, expects to have called every one of its 240,000 members by Election Day. All this has not been lost on the Lehrman camp, which has hired a company to make phone calls to voters on behalf of their candidate. Besides convincing people to vote for a particular candidate, the phone operations produce lists of potential supporters that will be the basis of a massive get-out-the-vote effort on Mr. Cuomo's behalf. According to Norman Adler, Mr. Cuomo's field coordinator, 20,000 workers will make 200,000 telephone calls to remind the Democrat's backers to vote and even help get them to the polls. Mr. Adler says it will be the largest such operation in the state since John F. Kennedy's race for President in 1960, and he estimates it could be worth between 4 percent and 6 percent of the total vote, easily enough to decide a close election. The importance of getting out the vote was on the candidate's mind last week, too. ''You've got to get out every vote you can,'' Mr. Cuomo exhorted campaign workers in Buffalo. ''You have to drag people to the polls.''

807-> DE LOREAN MOTOR NAMES CREDITORS
John Z. De Lorean's automobile company owed money to dinner and athletic clubs in New York, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Beverly Hills, a popular bar in London, a delicatessen in Manhattan and the National Football League, according to court papers on file here. Creditors of the De Lorean Motor Company, a heavily indebted sports car maker that was recently forced to close in Britain, were listed recently in United States Bankruptcy Court in Detroit. Mr. De Lorean was recently indicted in a multimillion-dollar California drug case. The list did not tell how much De Lorean Motor owes the organizations or what services they provided. It included these creditors: - The Boardroom, a private dining club in the same office building in Manhattan as the headquarters of De Lorean Motor. The club's manager, John Penn, confirmed Mr. De Lorean was a member but he refused to say how much he owed the club or for what. But Mr. Penn did say the debt was not for club dues. - Les Ambassadeurs Club in London, a ''conservative English club,'' according to its secretary, Robert Mills. ''I'm not aware of any account due to us,'' he said. ''We are a private members club and our membership is confidential.'' - Star's Delicatessen in Manhattan. Employees said De Lorean Motor had recently paid its debts, which covered frequent orders for takeout sandwiches when officials were working through the lunch hour. - Taxi on Credit Inc. of New York. The limousine service transported De Lorean executives around the New York area, according to the manager, Norman Wagner. De Lorean Motor had a ''rather small account with us,'' he said. ''They didn't abuse it.'' Other creditors were the New York Athletic Club; Harry's Bar in London; Beverly Hills Ltd., a Mercedes-Benz dealership; the Bloomfield Hills Country Club in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., an affluent suburb of Detroit, a club where many top auto executives are members, and Two of the Best, a small Garden Grove, Calif., concern that provided cleaning services for company apartments in Newport Beach used by De Lorean Motor's sales personnel. None of these creditors could be reached for comment. Regarding the debt to the National Football League, a spokesman for the league said he could not explain it. ''I really don't have any idea what it is for,'' the spokesman said, adding that the league was checking into it.

809-> FOLLOW-UP ON THE NEWS; Bugging Trains
When a Long Island Rail Road crew discovered two hidden voiceactivated tape recorders aboard its train in December 1981, the railroad defended the bugging as legal, the United Transportation Union called it ''Gestapo tactics'' and illegal, and the Nassau County District Attorney's office said it was investigating what might be a felony. The railroad said it had resorted to bugging because some train workers were broadcasting ''religious, racial and ethnic slurs'' over train radios. The prosecutor has dropped the case as not ''prosecutable.'' The railroad has promised not to bug trains anymore. The union is skeptical. ''It'll happen again,'' says Edward Yule Jr., the union chairman. He reports the railroad still hires private detectives to check on workers on sick leave. ''Yes, we still do that,'' acknowledges a railroad spokesman, Donald Malone, ''to make sure that people are not malingering.''

810-> FOR A CHANGE, A CLASH OF IDEAS AND INTELLECTS
Whatever else turns out to be true of New York's 1982 campaign for governor, it will have been a contest between two powerful, stubborn and searching intellects with sharply contrasting ideas about how the world does, and should, work. ''This is a campaign of ideas,'' Lewis E. Lehrman has said, over and over, and it has proven true not only of his race but also of that of his adversary, Mario M. Cuomo. Voters will be faced on Tuesday with a stark ideological choice between Mr. Cuomo, the Democratic-Liberal, and Mr. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative - and, for once, the labels will mean what they say. But the contestants do not just represent different philosophies; each promises to be something of a philospher, a shaper of ideas rather than a passive recipient of them. Of course, it is generally not a good thing in politics to be thought of as too intellectual, and each candidate has resolutely fought the notion that he might be impractical, which is how intellectuals are often regarded. Mr. Lehrman reminds people that he is an ''independent businessman'' of no small success; Mr. Cuomo says he is a long-standing practitioner of the science of governing who has ''experience money can't buy.'' Still, one can't help but feel that these are candidates who would be happier arguing about Marx, Adam Smith and St. Augustine than about the budget for the Division of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse. Yet if both are academic, they are rooted in different disciplines. Mr. Lehrman is part economic theorist, part business school teacher; Mr. Cuomo is a lawyer, a sociologist, a theologian. For Mr. Lehrman, people are best thought of as rational, competitive creatures who respond to incentives and should be left free to do so. Mr. Lehrman uses ''supply-and-demand'' analogies not only when he talks about the economy, but also when he discusses crime. ''It doesn't cost anything to commit a crime,'' he said last week. ''We know in business, for example, that when it costs nothing to produce a product, and the reward for the product is rising, the supply of the product and the supply of the producers of the product will also rise.'' Thus high crime rates. On economics, Mr. Lehrman is almost a libertarian: If he could, he would take the government out of nearly everything. That can make conversations with the candidate very interesting. For instance, he responds with sympathy when presented with such ideas as opening the nation's borders to all immigrants or eliminating punishment for ''victimless crimes'' such as prostitution. He is enough of a politician not to take these positions - in the case of prostitution, he thinks the community has an interest in keeping the streets free of those who solicit. But he is too much a philosopher not to know that the logical implication of his attitude toward government is ''deregulation,'' even in areas where it might be unpopular. The one place Mr. Lehrman does not sound like a libertarian is when he talks about the rights of the accused and the death penalty. To him, there is no inconsistency. It takes a ''limited state that is strong'' to protect ''free people,'' he says. In his world, government would impose few rules, but woe unto those who would disobey them. Mario Cuomo is quite another case. For him, the guiding principle is the New Testament injunction to love. ''The purpose of government,'' he once said, ''is to make love real in a sinful world.'' Another word for love is charity, and that's how Mr. Cuomo sees the role of the state - it helps people decide to do good things that they might not get around to doing as individuals. Mr. Cuomo's intellectual system is not as tidy as the one that gives rise to Mr. Lehrman's spare vision of the state. Both Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Lehrman believe in incentives, and both believe that tax cuts can create jobs. But while Mr. Lehrman sees taxes as largely pernicious, Mr. Cuomo sees them as part and parcel of his ''charitable'' state. And while Mr. Lehrman sees almost all limits on business as a threat to prosperity and freedom, Mr. Cuomo believes businesses, like people, sometimes have to be forced to do what is right. If what is important to Mr. Lehrman is getting to a clearly defined place as quickly as possible, Mr. Cuomo believes it is more ''pragmatic,'' as he says, to chart a general direction. In his world, the ultimate goals are elusive. ''We can't make it perfect,'' he says. ''We can make it better.'' Mr. Cuomo gets irate when it is suggested that believing in the welfare state means he believes in welfare cheats - ''they should go to jail,'' he says. Nor does he find an unbalanced budget appealing. And he says there is nothing about his view of charity that precludes being tough on crime. But the lawyer in Mr. Cuomo makes him deeply skeptical of attempts to curb defendants' constitutional rights. It can also make him remarkably legalistic. He gets angry when Mr. Lehrman says the Democrat is for ''unrestricted abortion'' and Mr. Cuomo bases his case on the fact that when the United States Supreme Court ruled on abortion, it distinguished between the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The complicated views of these candidates make normal political sloganeering somewhat beside the point. It is Mr. Lehrman, the conservative, who describes himself as the candidate of ''change,'' and Mr. Cuomo, the liberal, who accuses Mr. Lehrman of being a ''radical.'' Mr. Lehrman says he doesn't like Mr. Cuomo's use of that word but, when asked why the Republican establishment in New York was cool to him, he has said, ''Lenin wasn't welcomed into Petrograd.'' Through their relentless emphasis on fear - of crime and of joblessness - the candidates have sometimes obscured the richness of their positions. And the ''campaign of ideas'' has not precluded personal attacks or ethnic appeals. Still, many voters seem to be relishing the chance to choose between the two candidates. The latest New York Times Poll gave both Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Cuomo very high approval ratings, suggesting that even in politics, there are worse things to be than intellectual.

813-> REPORT ANALYZES DEATH RATE AT STATE'S MENTAL INSTITUTIONS
Mentally disabled people in state developmental centers had a death rate in the last decade that was roughly double that of New York's general population, according to a state report. However, the report, from the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, said the death rate at the state centers was similar to the rates reported at public and private institutions for the mentally retarded nationwide. In fact, Dr. Ann MacEachron, the report's lead author, contended that the figures were somewhat of a positive sign. The current rate is not significantly different from the rate 10 years ago, she noted, even though the people committed nowadays were generally more severely impaired. The change in patient character, she said, was due mostly to the state's push to transfer mental patients from large institutions into community-based treatment programs. The transfer program, which was intensified in the 1970's, has resulted in a drop in the institutional population from about 24,500 to about 13,000 in the last decade, she said. Lowest Rate Was in 1977 The report, issued Thursday, said the death rate for residents at New York's 20 developmental centers was 17.9 per 1,000 for the last 10 years. It said 1977 had the lowest rate at 15 deaths per 1,000 residents, while 1981 was the highest year at 20.4 deaths per 1,000. In the same period, the report said, the mortality rate for the general population of the state was 8 to 10 deaths per 1,000. The study highlighted the years 1972, 1977 and 1979 because, it said, those represented high, low and average mortality rates. However, it could not explain why there were different rates in the different years. ''While the descriptive profiles of residents who died during each of the three study years differed, no general pattern emerged to highlight yearly differences,'' the report said. Respiratory Failure Kills Many The report added that of those who had died in the three study years, 60 percent were profoundly retarded, 16 percent were severely retarded and 24 percent were ''at higher levels of intellectual functioning.'' The study said the deaths were equally spread across age groups; 33 percent were 23 years old or younger, 33 percent were between the ages of 24 and 55 and 34 percent were between 56 and 94. The leading cause of death was respiratory failure, the report said; 42 percent of all institutional deaths were related to that problem. A total of 31 percent were related to circulatory problems; 9 percent were linked to injury or accidents, 5 percent to tumorous conditions and 13 percent to other difficulties. ''Many people who currently live in developmental centers usually have a very poor health status,'' Dr. MacEachron said, noting that many of the respiratory problems developed as a result of patients not being able to move around as well as normal individuals.

815-> DR. CHARLES HENDEL, 91, DEAD; EX-YALE PHILOSOPHY PROFESSOR
Dr. Charles W. Hendel, retired chairman of Yale University's department of philosophy and a former president of the American Society of Political and Legal Philosophy, died last Friday at a nursing home in Salt Lake City. He was 91 years old. Dr. Hendel was credited by associates with blending philosophy with the social sciences and liberal arts to create what was considered one of the outstanding programs of its time. Dr. Hendel introduced at Yale the preceptorial system of bringing small groups of students together with faculty members that was established at Princeton in 1905 under its president, Woodrow Wilson. Dr. Hendel also set up a seminar program that attracted ranking scholars and philosophers. Under his leadership, the department became one of the most popular at the university. Among Dr. Hendel's books were ''The Philosophy of David Hume,'' ''Studies in the Philosophy of David Hume,'' ''Jean Jacques Rousseau: Moralist,'' and ''Citizen of Geneva: Selections of Letters from Jean Jacques Rousseau.'' Studied in Europe He also wrote ''Civilization and Religion: An Argument About Values in Human Life,'' and was co-author of ''Philosophy in American Education.'' Dr. Hendel was president of the American Society of Political and Legal Philosophy from 1959 to 1961, and delivered the Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow in 1962-63. Charles William Hendel Jr. was born in Reading, Pa., and graduated from Princeton at the head of his class in 1913. After study at the University of Marburg in Germany and the University of France in Paris, he was awarded a Ph.D. from Princeton in 1917. He taught philosophy at Williams College in 1919 and 1920, and then at Princeton until 1929. From 1929 until 1940, Dr. Hendel was professor of moral philosophy and later was dean of the faculty of arts and science at McGill University in Montreal. In 1940 he joined Yale as Clark Professor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics and chairman of the philosophy department. That same year, he was elected president of the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association. Dr. Hendel's wife, the former Elizabeth Jones, died in 1977. He is survived by a son, Charles W. Hendel 3d of Mission Viejo, Calif., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

816-> TURKEY'S CAPITAL GOES TO WAR AGAINST SMOG
The Government's radical new antipollution program for Ankara went into effect this month on a day when the air was brown and the sun a bloody splotch in the haze. There was no wind to relieve the city, which is shaped like a bowl in the Anatolian plateau. The main cause of the capital's pollution, according to Refet Erim, the Under Secretary for Environmental Affairs, is the heating of buildings. Industrial pollution accounts for only about 10 percent, he said, and pollution from traffic even less. Thus the antipollution program involves mainly a reduction in heating, a serious problem in Ankara, where winter temperatures tend to linger below freezing. The pollution crisis dates from three years ago, when the Turkish Government, in financial straits, banned fuel oil heating systems in new buildings in Ankara and urged people to convert to cheaper, locally produced coal. At the time Turkey was spending all its export earnings to import oil. But Turkish lignite is high in sulfur content and poor quality, leading to a noticeable increase in pollution levels. ''It was a big mistake,'' Mr. Erim said in an interview here as he explained that the aim of the program for Ankara was to reduce pollution discharges by over 50 percent in a year. Last month the authorities reversed the previous policy and banned the conversion of heating systems to coal. It was also announced that new buildings would not receive permits if they were heated by coal. In addition, the importing of low-grade, high-sulfur fuel oil was barred. Last year most of the fuel oil came from Libya, and it was said to have a high percentage of sulfur and paraffin. At the same time it was announced that Ankara's General Hygiene Council had drafted a ''warning plan'' prescribing measures to be taken at various pollution levels. Besides restrictions on heating, it calls for traffic controls and eventually the shutdown of factories and the establishment of emergency sections in hospitals for smog victims. When the plan went into effect, the sulfur dioxide in the air was said to have surpassed 700 micrograms per cubic meter. It was announced that heating systems could be turned on only once a day, and for a maximum of six hours. This restriction, however, did not apply to hospitals, dormitories for students, the aged and the disabled, bus, airline and train stations, and police and military buildings. ''People feel things have become much worse this year because the weather has been bad, with little wind,'' Mr. Erim said. He pointed out that Istanbul had a higher level of pollution because of its industy and traffic but that the wind blew the pollution away. Pollution peaked in Ankara last winter on Jan. 11 and 12, when 1,850.80 micrograms of sulfur dioxide and 1,207.48 micrograms of dust were registered in a cubic meter. ''It's very high but can't be compared with London of the 50's, when the sulfur dioxide reached 4,500 micrograms per cubic meter,'' Mr. Erim said. He said the goal was to bring the total discharge for the 1982-83 season down to 20,900 tons of sulfur dioxide and 45,000 tons of dust. The total for the previous year was 48,052 tons of sulfur dioxide and 76,927 tons of dust. He said the results of the recent measures were not yet noticeable, essentially because people were still using old fuel oil. But stocks should be finished by the end of this month, he said, and a visible improvement is expected in January and February. One problem, however, is that 1,500 buildings were converted to coal over the last year without permits. This means a 15 percent rise in lignite consumption, Mr. Erim said. Another difficulty, Ankara residents say, is that many people have spent much money converting furnaces to coal, and are somewhat reluctant to go back to oil.

817-> Q.'SPEAK TO YURI?' REAGAN: 'UM, DA.'
Remember the ''missile gap'' crisis of the early 60's and the fears it produced here at home about America being No. 2? Well, Yuri V. Andropov's emergence as general secretary of the Communist Party now confronts us with a crisis of a different sort, unique in Soviet-American relations. Mr. Andropov, we're told, speaks English; Ronald Reagan, we know, cannot speak Russian. In short, a linguistic gap - sudden, unexpected, ominous. In a world of realpolitik, the dangers are obvious. Above and beyond the impact of linguistic inferiority on America's post-Vietnam psyche, the Kremlin will exploit the Andropov advantage on a global scale. No country will be safe from Soviet linguistic bullying. The Western allies, already anxious about being targeted by Soviet SS-20's, will be prodded toward neutralism, leaving NATO's future much in doubt. The developing nations will be driven to reassess their alliances. A world destabilized. Obviously this gap is intolerable and calls for immediate counteraction by Mr. Reagan himself. But can he master the Russian language and the Cyrillic alphabet on a crash basis in, say, two weeks? Democrats may smile. Republicans may be unavailable for comment. But such a linguistic breakthrough is certainly possible - provided, of course, Mr. Reagan does not squander his time on such irrelevancies as the Federal budget, unemployment, defense. Nor is this the only option available to the Administration in creating a strategy to overcome the gap. The President must: 1. Immediately enter subscriptions to Pravda and Izvestia, and prominently display these newspapers on the Oval Office coffee table - in full view of visiting foreign V.I.P.'s. The word will filter back to the Kremlin. 2. Open his next news conference with ''Dobriy vecher'' - ''Good evening'' - and casually pepper his remarks with da's and nyet's. The K.G.B. always tunes in. 3. Observe, in informal discussions with visiting heads of state, that he has lately taken to reading Dostoevsky, Gogol and Turgenev in the original, and perhaps recite a memorized passage or two of Tolstoy's ''Voyna i Mir'' - ''War and Peace.'' For that, the K.G.B. would wake up Mr. Andropov in the middle of the night. Further, Mr. Andropov's reputed command of English and his fondness for things Western must be turned against him. But how? By the White House's discreetly leaking the disinformation that at last the C.I.A. has planted a mole in the Kremlin. This ploy alone would plunge the K.G.B. into a witch hunt on an unprecedented scale, thereby neutralizing at least 42 Soviet armored divisions. The only glint of comfort in the crisis is that not all Kremlinologists agree that Yuri and English are on speaking terms. But one very disconcerting fact has surfaced: When Vice President Bush and Secretary Shultz held their first meeting with Mr. Andropov immediately after Leonid I. Brezhnev's funeral, at one point the new leader nodded before receiving a Russian translation of a comment by Mr. Shultz. Nodded! Mr. Andropov nodded! Some United States intelligence circles still are not sure whether the nod meant yes, no, or was simply a case of a twitching nerve. But our worst-case wargamers already have concluded that the nod was the real thing, not just linguistic oneupsmanship. There is no reason to panic, though. The Andropov nod can be offset -quickly. The President, whenever he hears as much as a syllable of Russian, must nod, too. Indeed, he should immediately start stockpiling nods. This retaliatory posture, operational at once (in contrast to the MX ''dense pack'' missiles), would create mass confusion in the Central Committee and Politburo and might even force a reassessment about launching a linguistic offensive. This is no time for the usual diplomatic pussyfooting. Mr. Reagan must urgently make it clear that the United States will not allow the Soviet Union to violate the SLT (Strategic Language Treaty), which specifically stipulates: ''One Leader, One Language.'' True, no negotiations have yet begun on the SLT - in fact, there is no such thing as an SLT - but this should not prevent the Administration from accusing Moscow of cheating in advance. Whether such an overall strategy would serve as a deterrent and cancel the Andropov advantage is not at all certain. But one thing is: Our nation cannot tolerate inferiority of any kind. America is a superpower. In our dealings with the other superpower, we can settle for nothing less than linguistic parity. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bernard Kalb is State Department correspondent for NBC News.

819-> EUROMISSILE MYTHS
Is America trying to ram Pershing 2 and cruise missiles down Europeans' throats? That myth, cultivated by Western European foes of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's plans to install medium-range missiles, has begun to spread on this side of the Atlantic. Western European indictment of supposed American arrogance is coupled with a prescription by some American sympathizers: Let's not force something on the Europeans they do not want. It dovetails with the speech by Yuri V. Andropov, who proposed to reduce - actually, to relocate - portions of his medium-range-missile arsenal behind the Urals in order to forestall Western counterdeployment. Finally, it is linked to another myth: From the beginning, the critics claim, there never has been a sound strategic rationale for the Pershing 2's and cruises. The first myth is rooted in a misreading of history. No other alliance policy has been debated more democratically and exhaustively than the Brussels decision of December 1979, to install 572 Pershing and cruise missiles starting in December 1983 if armscontrol negotiations with Moscow failed. In those days, it was the Carter Administration that was rather reluctant to place new missiles on the Continent. It was rattled Europeans who insisted that something be done about SS-20's, being deployed in the Soviet Union at the menacing rate of one per week. It is not true that the West wants to threaten the Soviet Union with missiles that lack a plausible rationale. There are two very good reasons for deploying the missiles in Europe. One pertains to arms control. In the late 70's, the West correctly understood that appeals to sweet reason would not persuade the Kremlin to dismantle a powerful nuclear arsenal that it was expanding with breathtaking speed. There are no free gifts in international affairs. Emptyhanded, the West would appear as a supplicant at the bargaining table. And negotiations would degenerate into a meaningless ritual unless the West stood ready to counter the buildup. The second reason relates to the complicated business of deterrence. While 300,000 American troops in Europe constitute a very powerful warning, sheer numbers are not enough in an age of atomic abundance. Nuclear weapons can be deterred only by nuclear weapons, and NATO's arms are no longer sufficient for the task. There are, to be sure, thousands of short-range tactical weapons in Western Europe. Unfortunately, these can hardly impress the Russians because they are bound to devastate alliance territory first and foremost. There are also hundreds of nuclear strike aircraft. Yet most of these obsolete planes, destined for the scrap heap, are no match for the Warsaw Pact's large-scale air defenses. In short, NATO has plenty of nuclear weapons, but the wrong kind. Hence, the long-overdue decision to deploy missiles that can strike deep and swiftly. Compared to some 1,300 long-range warheads the Kremlin can hurl into Western Europe, that is a modest number -barely enough for deterrence; not enough for launching a war. Apart from the numbers game, there is a more profound reason why land-based American missiles contribute to deterrence in Europe. The Soviet Union has never drawn a distinction between ''theater'' and ''strategic'' nuclear systems. To the Kremlin, any weapon that can strike the Soviet Union is strategic - whence it follows that the Soviet Union would have to attack part of America's strategic arsenal in the process of attacking Western Europe. Would the Russians confine opening salvos to America's Europebased system only - aiming, as it were, at their adversary's switchblade while leaving his sword untouched? By their own logic, the Russians would have to attack America's entire nuclear panoply. As a recent Soviet propaganda tract put it: ''Any pre-emptive strike (against Europe) is senseless unless it destroys or at least substantially weakens the strategic nuclear potential of the other side's retaliatory capability.'' Such a decision, raising the specter of all-out war, is not lightly taken, and therein lies the very essence of extended deterrence on behalf of nonnuclear allies. Those who believe in extended deterrence might still argue that it makes little sense to do what its logic requires if determined Western European minorities are prepared to prevent deployment at any cost. If we accept such counsel, the lesson will not be lost on Moscow, which will learn that it can have military dominance costfree. And it will learn that Western societies do not cherish their democratic processes enough to defend them against the onslaught of the strident few. A devout wish for peace alone does not produce peace, and the mere desire for arms control has never achieved an equitable agreement. Because NATO has held fast to its Brussels decision, Moscow, as the Andropov speech indicated, finally has begun to talk disarmament. If the West loses its nerve now, it will have neither missiles nor arms control. And the Soviet Union will have gotten something for nothing. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Josef Joffe, on leave as a senior editor of the West German weekly Die Zeit, is at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

820-> ISRAEL KEEPS AREA FROM LEBANESE
An advance squad of Lebanese troops arrived here today, but Israeli forces that moved in on Friday to keep peace between feuding Lebanese Christian militiamen and Moslem Druse refused to leave. An Israeli captain said his forces would remain until they were ''absolutely certain that the Lebanese Army could control the fighting.'' The officer said the area, 10 to 15 miles southeast of Beirut, had been quiet for the last three days because of the Israeli presence. The decision to send Lebanese troops to this area, which has been controlled by Israeli troops, was made Sunday at a meeting of local politicians and President Amin Gemayel, who left shortly thereafter for New York. Plans for full deployment of the Lebanese troops were apparently held up by the continued Israelil presence. Israelis Entered 4 Villages Israel moved tanks and troop carriers onto the sandbagged front line between the Christian and Druse Moslem quarters of Kafr Matta and into three other mountain villages on Friday to end days of artillery and machine-gun exchanges. Despite a 150-year history of Druse-Christian strife, the mountain area here was said to have been largely calm for about eight years until Israel allowed in the Lebanese Christian militiamen and upset the power balance. The fighting has put Israel in a delicate position. Israel is allied with the Lebanese Christians in its invasion of Lebanon but has a significant Druse population at home. A Lebanese lieutenant in Kafr Matta said the army could not enter the town until Israel pulled out. He said the advance unit would stay overnight and see if the Israelis ''are still here tomorrow.'' Lebanese policemen said that in four days of fighting last week before the Israelis moved in, about 15 people were killed.

821-> FRENCH SET TAX BENEFITS TO ENCOURAGE EXPORTS
France's Socialist Government today announced new tax benefits to encourage French companies to increase exports and development, including bigger deductions for expense account meals and other business entertainment. The incentives come in the wake of a record trade deficit for September and growing fears about the franc. Budget Minister Laurent Fabius said the new 30 percent tax that the Socialists had imposed on business entertainment costs this year will be rolled back in proportion to their success in increasing exports. No details were given, but generally the more a French company exports the more entertainment costs it will be allowed to charge against its tax liability. Effective in January In addition, the Socialists are seeking to encourage French companies to invest more in research and new product development by allowing them to write off 25 percent of the cost of any increase in their research and development budget. Both measures will take effect in January and will not affect Government tax receipts this year, the Budget Ministry said. The new tax incentives are the latest indication of official alarm at the rapid deterioration in France's trade preformance since the Socialists came to power. In September, the deficit soared to $1.72 billion, the second-worst figure for a single month since June's alltime record deficit of $1.86 billion. While imports rose 6 percent, to $9.2 billion, exports stagnated at $7.4 billion. Last June's forced devaluation of the franc, after the French central bank almost ran out of foreign-currency reserves, has raised the cost of French imports at a time when stagnant world trade makes it hard to secure an offsetting rise in exports. The continued strength of the dollar has also increased France's bill for imported oil, despite the glutted market. The weakness of France's export preformance is particularly worrisome to Finance Ministry officials, who note that, after rising more or less without interruption since World War II, the inflationadjusted value of French exports fell 10.4 percent at annual rates in the first half of 1982 and by a stunning 18.4 percent in the second quarter of the year. Automobile Exports Down So far, it appears that automobile exports, once one of the strong points in French trade, are falling by nearly 10 percent a year, measured after inflation, while consumer goods are down 6 percent at annual rates so far this year and capital goods by 8 percent. Meanwhile, imports have been increasing as foreign manufacturers gained most of the benefits resulting from the reflation of the economy by the Socialists last year. Much of the blame is placed on the rise in industrial costs, particularly since the Socialists increased pay and benefits and reduced the workweek from 40 to 39 hours without adjusting wages.

822-> HOW TO STABLIZE THE PRICE OF SHIRTS, ETC.
To the Editor: The chairman of the corporation which makes Arrow shirts predicts that it will be difficult ''to get the consumer out of thinking that everything is on sale all the time,'' and the chairman of J. C. Penney adds that since neither manufacturer nor retailer can now set prices, ''the consumer sets the price'' (Oct. 11 Business Day). Unused industrial capacity, unsold inventories, rising unemployment and less purchasing power, and ''softening'' prices are the telltale signs of very deep depression. Up to a point, the shirt and retail magnates are correct in hoping for a way to stabilize prices. When will they and policy makers in both parties admit that the corporate world, here and abroad, suffers from excessive competition, borrowing, spending, building and production, and to such an extent that two policy changes are needed? As in the early days of the New Deal, the first requirement is to regulate (limit) output to what can be sold at reasonable prices. The second is massive public works requiring an increase in government spending and a decrease in corporate borrowing and spending. The price of shirts (and everything else) will not stabilize until this regulation of supply is in place. On these matters, neither Keynesians nor supply-siders are of any help. FREDERICK C. THAYER Associate Professor of Public and International Affairs University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, Oct. 11, 1982

823-> LEUKEMIA SOCIETY OFFERS PATIENTS A VARIETY OF AID
In 1944 the family and friends of Robert Roesler de Villiers, devastated by the death of the 16-year-old New York City youth from leukemia, committed themselves to a memorial that would aid other victims of the then mysterious form of cancer. Five years later, a foundation in his name was formed in New York to provide money for the study of the disease. Since 1967, it has been known as the Leukemia Society of America Inc., which now spends $165 million a year on 165 grants to 75 institutions throughout the world. The group is entirely dependent on public support. The New York City chapter raised $477,813 last year through a variety of events, including a bikeathon, radiothon and parties. And in one of its major fund-rasing events this year, on Dec. 6, the chapter will present a concert at Carnegie Hall by the Athens-born pianist, Rita Bouboulidi. The funds go toward such projects as basic cellular research and bone marrow transplants, along with professional and public information programs. ''Of course the research projects the society funds are the key to the goal of finding a cure for the disease,'' said Bernard H. Garil, the president of the New York City chapter. ''But our various support projects for the leukemia patients and their families are significant as well. Much of that work is done through the work of each of our 54 chapters.'' Emotional Support Offered The treatment of leukemia, Mr. Garil noted, is a long and involved process, often financially as well as emotionally draining. ''Our approach involves more than just assisting with the treatment of the disease,'' said Mr. Garil, an executive with the investment concern of Oppenheimer & Company, whose son contracted leukemia eight years ago at the age of 7. ''We offer a variety of support projects aimed at easing some of that burden, both financial and emotional.'' Mr. Garil said that in its 1981 fiscal year, only about 23 percent of the chapter's expenditures went for organization management and fund-raising activities. Within its patient-aid program the New York chapter contributes up to $750 a year to each patient for drug treatment, blood screening and transfusions, X-rays and transportation costs. The local chapter also offers family consultations to help those stricken with leukemia get financial aid that is not available through the society. Through a network of volunteers, who frequently have had personal experience in coping with the disease, the organization tries to help the patients and their families prepare for the emotional problems they will likely encounter. Society Is Expanding Program ''We are constantly expanding our patient-aid program,'' said Marie F. Sisko, assistant executive director of the chapter. ''But as far as we are concerned, there is more work to be done since statistics based on data available through the National Cancer Institute show that currently we are involved with only 14 percent of the leukemia patients in New York City.'' To reach more patients who may need the society's help, the local chapter formed a speaker's bureau, Mrs. Sisko said. ''The point is to make the public aware of the disease, its symptoms and the forms of treatment, and also make the society's financial and counseling programs known to the patients and their families,'' Mr. Garil said.

824-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Continues Slide; Gold Declines $2 in U.S.
The dollar continued to lose ground against most major currencies yesterday, while gold turned in a mixed performance on world bullion exchanges. Bullion rose in Hong Kong and Switzerland, but failed to reach levels set in late trading Monday in the United States. Gold ended the day at $455.50 an ounce in New York, off $2 from Monday's late bid. The dollar began the day by falling for the sixth consecutive session in Tokyo, dropping 3 Japanese yen to close at 235.50 yen, its lowest level since May. By day's end, the dollar fell to 234.13 yen in the United States from Monday's late rate of 237.10 yen. The dollar traded at 278 yen as recently as Nov.1. It has been sliding against currencies of all major trading partners since Nov. 8, when it reached its highest level in at least 15 years, according to records kept by the Federal Reserve System. Falling interest rates and a widening trade deficit in the United States have contributed to the dollar's decline, according to analysts. Although lower United States interest rates have made dollardenominated investments less attractive, currency dealers in Europe and the United States said a cut in the prime lending rate Tuesday had little impact on the dollar. Chase Manhattan Bank reduced its prime rate a half percentage point, to 11 percent, but no other major bank followed suit. London currency and bullion markets were closed for a holiday, but elsewhere the dollar fell against the British pound. The pound rose to $1.6175 in Europe, from $1.6030 Monday. In the United States, sterling climbed to $1.6290, from $1.6070. Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday, included: 2.3740 West German marks, down from 2.3850; 1.9955 Swiss francs, down from 1.9970; 6.7125 French francs, down from 6.7430; 2.63125 Dutch guilders, down from 2.63475; 1,367.00 Italian lire, up from 1,376.00, and 1.2395 Canadian dollars, down from 1.24415. Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday, included: 2.3703 West German marks, down from 2.3770; 6.7050 French francs, down from 6.7375; 1.9975 Swiss francs, up from 1.9968, and 1.2410 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2435. In Hong Kong, gold rose sharply after a three-day Christmas break to close at $456.06 an ounce, up $9.93 from last Friday. Bullion later closed in Zurich at $454.50 an ounce, up $2 from Monday. Bullion for January delivery slipped $2.40 on the New York Commodity Exchange, to close at $456.30 an ounce. In later New York trading, bullion was bid at $455.50 an ounce at Republic National Bank, down from Monday's late bid of $457.50. Silver for January delivery fell 10 cents on New York's Comex, to $11.05 an ounce.

825-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Steinbrenner Annoyed
George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, yesterday urged baseball's executive council to accelerate efforts to replace Bowie Kuhn as commissioner. Steinbrenner blasted as '' ridiculous garble'' comments made last week by Ballard Smith, the president of the San Diego Padres, indicating he was leaning toward Kuhn to replace himself after Kuhn failed to win re-election Nov.1 in Chicago. ''The vote is over. We'd better get about the business at the Nov.12th meeting of the executive council of selecting a new commissioner because we've got to get baseball moving forward.''

826-> ABOUT REAL ESTATE; GETTING READY FOR WINTER AT APARTMENT COMPLEXES
For some people this week's spell of Indian summer may have conjured up pleasant thoughts of spring, but it did nothing to deter Robert M. Freedman from concentrating on the winter that is ahead. Mr. Freedman is a vice president of Sulzberger-Rolfe Inc., a realty concern. He oversees the management of 10,000 governmentassisted apartments in the metropolitan area. These days the 28-yearold executive is busily telephoning and visiting various housing developments to assure that each is prepared ''to operate at optimum efficiency and economy'' during the winter. He is not scurrying about at the last minute to get building boilers repaired or to secure supplies of fuel and other wintertime necessities. These things, in fact, were done last summer or even earlier. Rather, like the captain of a ship before it sails, Mr. Freedman is putting the buildings under his aegis through something like a shakedown period before winter itself provides the final test of his preparations. In recent winters city housing officials have been forced to devote more and more of their resources to coping with a heating crisis as thousands of buildings - and their tenants - are left without heat for various periods of time. Daniel W. Joy, a deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said most of the buildings that cause complaints are not managed by real estate giants such as Sulzberger-Rolfe but rather are marginal buildings where the owners seem to be unable or unwilling to keep up with the costs of maintaining the property. In preparing for winter, a company like Sulzberger-Rolfe has obvious advantages - experience, size, expertise and money - that many property owners do not. But Mr. Freedman and Edward Sulzberger, president of the company, said in recent interviews that the key principles they pursue should be the same for an owner or manager of just one building: preventive maintenance and energy conservation. ''You can't operate in the old way,'' Mr. Freedman remarked. ''Just doing general cleaning and maintenance nowadays will not get you a good building.'' ''Preparing a building for the winter is basically a year-round job,'' said Mr. Sulzberger, who has spent 50 years in the real estate industry. ''You can't wait until the last moment to start.'' Late in the spring, Mr. Sulzberger said, is when his concern begins its preparations for the following winter by checking the boilers in each building it manages. ''If you have breakdowns during the heating season, not only do you have unattractive tenant relations,'' he said, ''but you pay for fuel through the nose.'' The company insists that fuel, bought by the tankful, be delivered in the daytime when the building's superintendent is present and can check the truck's tank. Mr. Sulzberger said the company pays for fuel oil at 60 degrees, so it wants to be sure that a full tank of 60-degree oil is delivered. If the fuel is at a higher temperature, the expansion caused by the extra heat means that less actual fuel will be delivered. Sulzberger-Rolfe keeps charts of fuel consumption in each of its buildings and, when necessary, suggests to owners that they consider replacing the boilers. For example, Mr. Freedman said, the concern replaced rotary boilers in a Long Island development with airatomizing boilers and cut the complex's $500,000 fuel bill by 30 percent. Sulzberger-Rolfe has its own purchasing department, which obtains -through competitive buying and bulk purchases - all items, from light bulbs to rock salt, for the buildings it manages. The two men say owners and managers should realize that ''little things'' can add up to substantial savings. ''Up to 70 percent of a building's expenses are untouchable,'' Mr. Sulzberger said. ''So you have to work on the 30 percent that you can affect. The intelligent manager can find ways to take up the slack.'' He cited as an example Southbridge Towers, the Mitchell-Lama development with 1,654 apartments in lower Manhattan, which Sulzberger-Rolfe manages. The 12-year-old cooperative complex - just south of the Brooklyn Bridge and bound by Fulton, Pearl, Gold and Frankfort Streets - contains four 27-story towers and five six-story buildings grouped around several inner courtyards. Several years ago the realty concern replaced all incandescent light bulbs in hallways, the two garages and laundry rooms with fluorescent fixtures, which are more efficient and are said to last 18 times longer. The savings: $50,000 annually. Andrew Rokicsak, the development's superintendent, explained during a recent tour that periodic checks are made of the condition of the building's radiators, the temperature of the chimney stacks and the amount of carbon dioxide in the stacks to determine if the heating system is working properly. The realty company distributes circulars to tenants advising them how to cut their electricity expense and how to keep their apartments heated comfortably but not excessively. With the assent of the cooperative board, two years ago the concern placed solar panels on two of the high-rise buildings as an additional energy-saving measure. ''We try to do everything in-house, and only on highly technical work will we call on nonstaff personnel,'' Mr. Freedman said, alluding to the project's 38-person maintenance staff. ''Having your own trained crew is a cost-saving measure over the long run.''

827-> JOSEPH MICHAEL LYDEN
The man credited with converting an ancient Chinese game of chance into keno died here Sunday at the age of 83. Joseph Michael Lyden is credited with bringing the ancient game to Nevada from a casino he owned in Montana. He once told of setting up the game with his late brother, Francis, in their casino in Butte, Mont., in 1928 after two Chinese ''came in and asked if they could run a lottery.'' Mr. Lyden was born in Ireland on April 27, 1899, and had lived in the Las Vegas area for 27 years.

828-> 3 RIDERS BREAK JUMP RECORD
Three international riders set a National Horse Show jump record of 7 feet 6 inches last night and shared the William Coburn Cox Memorial Challenge Trophy for the Puissance Class. Rodney Jenkins of the United States on Arbitrage, Michel Robert of France on Janus de Ver, and Walther Gabathuler of Switzerland on Beethoven II attained the highest jumps ever achieved in the 99-year history of the Madison Square Garden show. The United States entered the third night of the six-night show with such a commanding point lead that the puissance results made little difference in the team standings. The United States leads with 58 points. France is next with 39, followed by Switzerland, 25, and Canada, 12. Five horses went into the fourth jumpoff of the event. Barney Ward, who set a North American record of 7-6 3/4 last week at Washington, was eliminated at 7-3 in the third jumpoff. Harry de Leyer, the 55-year-old grandfather who has always been a sentimental favorite here, also reached the third jumpoff before knocking a chip off of the wall. Miss Monahan Eliminated Katie Monahan, who entered yesterday's program with a 4-point lead among individual riders, was eliminated in the first round of the puissance and dropped to third place in the standing. Robert took over the lead with 22 points, followed by Gabathuler with 16. Jenkins moved up to fourth with 13 points. Miss Monahan was eliminated with Hendrick, a mount better known for speed than Grand Prix qualities. Still, with her fine showing this week after her dominance of the Washington show, Miss Monahan is not discouraged. ''In the past two years I've had nothing,'' she said. ''After I rode Silver Exchange in the mock Olympics, he was sold, and I had nothing whatsoever. I hit bottom. I was depressed. I just wondered if I'd ever have jumpers again. That was probably the best thing that ever happened to me.'' She explained the seeming contradiction: ''I sat down with John Madden, who runs my stable on the family farm in Upperville, Va., and we decided that if I ever was to do well, I'd have to develop my own string of jumpers. I'd always ridden for other people. I traveled around and had nothing to do with the care or shipping or stabling of the horses. ''I would just get on and ride. In this business, you can't cut any corners if you want to be on top. Everything has to be done just right. The system never really worked for me. I always was in the ribbons but had never won a Grand Prix until this year.'' String of Grand Prix Triumphs She came to the Garden with a string of Grand Prix triumphs for 1982, the best performance by any woman rider and high on the list for Rider of the Year. Miss Monahan cited the stirring comeback of one of her horses, The Jones Boy, who won the Puissance here for her in 1978. The Jones Boy came back from a near-fatal skin infection to triumph again with the slim blond rider. Miss Monahan won the Grandprix of Florida with him. But then, displaying the versatility of her stable, she went on to win the Grand Prixs of Mexico and Charlotte with Jethro. In August, she won the Prescott (Ohio) grandprix and won four of the top six places with her new French-bred horse, Noren, at Southampton, L.I. Her success has already changed her career goals. ''I had many,'' she said, ''but I'm in the process of setting new ones. One was to develop a good barn and a string of victories and to get to the top. My new goal is to stay there. I don't want to be a flash in the pan.'' The coach of the United States team, Bert De Nemethy, was so elated with the its winning performance in the Nation's Cup on Wednesday night that he has decided to give some of the younger riders a chance to compete. ''I always consider the Nation's Cup the most important class ,'' he said, ''and I am so delighted with the results that I am goinging to give a new and younger team a chance. We plan to send Tony D'Ambrosio, Norman Dello Joio, Ann Kursinski and Mark Leone to represent us in the Toronto Winter Fair.'' Dello Joio, with Johnny's Pocket, was beaten out by Michael Matz, with Honest Tom, yesterday afternoon in an open jumper stake.

829-> MONEY MAGAZINE PROFITABLE FOR TIME INC.
Rumor had it that time nearly ran out on Money magazine. Time Inc., that is. Five years ago, cynics at Time Inc. were betting that the giant communications company would fold Money, the personal finance monthly it introduced in 1972. Money was a money-loser. ''There were some questions about whether Money would survive,'' said Marshall Loeb, the magazine's managing editor. Money marks its 10th anniversary this month. And despite its difficult debut, Money's outlook today is upbeat. After eight years of losses and a major shift in editorial strategy, Money has survived and prospered. Moreover, it has taught Time Inc. executives some hard lessons about how to create new magazines and develop an audience. ''Money got off to a much slower start than Time wanted,'' said John A. McConville, a publishing analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, the investment banking firm. ''Now,'' he said, ''I think it's doing better than the company could have anticipated.'' Profits Outlook Time Inc. expects that profits from Money this year will be double what they were in 1981, when the magazine reportedly earned between $2 million and $3 million. (Last year Time Inc., which publishes six other magazines, including Fortune, People and Time, had a net income of $149 million.) Ad revenues at Money climbed 48 percent in 1981. Circulation has jumped to 1.1 million from 228,000 in 1972. Back in 1972, Money was considered a gamble by some financial analysts, who thought that Time Inc. was rusty at the business of starting publications. Money was, after all, the company's first new magazine since the 1954 premiere of Sports Illustrated. A few observers worried about timing. Money appeared on newsstands only two months before one of Time Inc.'s greatest embarrassments: the death of Life, the weekly photo magazine. Life was resurrected as a monthly in 1978. Millions on Preparation The company spent millions of dollars on start-up costs and sophisticated marketing research. Days were spent haggling over details. A special effort was made to choose a snappy name for the magazine; Advantage and Strategy were contenders. Otto Fuerbringer, the former managing editor of Time magazine who directed a management team that spent a year birthing Money, said Money looked like a sure winner. It was to deal exclusively with personal finance. Money readers, Time Inc. hoped, would be the educated, affluent people whom advertisers adore. For advertising, ''I thought it was the ideal editorial environment,'' Mr. Fuerbringer said. Early issues had as features articles on topics ranging from home improvement and insurance to direct-mail companies that hawk commemorative medals (headline: ''Perils of a Mail-Order Midas''). There was an emphasis on stories about budget shopping. The initial enthusiasm advertisers had for Money led many Time Inc. executives to believe the magazine would turn a profit by 1975. They were badly disappointed. During most of the 1970's, Money flopped. Time Inc. predicted that when Money's circulation reached 500,000, the magazine would become profitable. Instead, Money was still losing money in 1979, when circulation hit 800,000. While circulation grew, many of Money's wealthier readers, the most important readers to advertisers, did not bother to renew their subscriptions. Advertising became sluggish. ''There were certainly people who thought that perhaps we ought to drop the magazine,'' Mr. Fuerbringer said. Indeed, Time Inc. faced a tough choice in the late 1970's. The company could fold Money or risk continued losses. After some bickering among Time Inc. brass, Money remained, proving to Wall Street analysts that the company had remembered one of magazine publishing's most important rules - be patient. The Value of Holding On John S. Reidy, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the brokerage firm, said Sports Illustrated ''supposedly took longer to make a profit. In starting a magazine, you may have to wait five or six years, or longer'' for success. Time Inc. may have seriously miscalculated with its early profit projections. ''But the company knew enough to hold on,'' he added. Money was, however, made over. Its editors thought the magazine's image as a penny-pinching guide had alienated readers. ''In the eyes of some people, it was a cents-off magazine,'' said Mr. Loeb, a former Time magazine economics editor who became managing editor of Money in 1980. Many affluent subscribers thought Money's reporting on investments was dated and often simplified and shallow. To woo the well-to-do, Mr. Loeb and his predecessor, William S. Rukeyser, the current managing editor of Fortune, reversed strategy. Penny pinching was out, replaced by more sophisticated financial advice. Articles on investments and taxes were made more detailed. The editors added new columns on mutual funds and savings. The period between final editing of the magazine and distribution was cut by three days, allowing timelier articles. Money's graphic design, once drab by Time Inc. standards, was brightened. Glossy photos of celebrities such as Milton Friedman, the economist, were put on the cover. In reaching an upscale audience, ''the editorial side has really gotten on target in the last two and a half years,'' said William M. Kelly Jr., Money's publisher. Like the major business magazines, Money also has benefited from the growing interest in financial news. Money's change in strategy worked. The magazine has been making a profit since 1980, and it seems to have found the richer, bettereducated audience that Time sought all along. According to Money, 46 percent of its readers have an annual household income of $35,000 or more, compared with just 28.2 percent three years ago. Advertisers are again enthusiastic. The October issue of Money is 248 pages, the largest issue ever. Time Inc. planners, Mr. Loeb said, are talking about making Money a fortnightly within five years. Competition Expected to Grow Money's major fear now is competition. There is little today. Changing Times magazine, Money's chief rival among personal finance publications, has a larger circulation, 1.5 million, but attracts far fewer ads and less affluent readers. Analysts say, however, that competition will grow quickly. Time has shown other publishers that a personal finance magazine can succeed, and it is expected that many will enter the field. Just two weeks ago, Sylvia Porter, the financial columnist, disclosed that she plans to edit a new magazine, Personal Finance, scheduled to make its debut next October. Kazi Hasan, chairman of Hale Associates, a financial research company, said he believes that Money will face stiff competition by 1984, probably from new magazines started up by publishers that attempt to cater to the same upscale readers. ''Just wait,'' he said. ''Money won't be alone much longer.''

831-> THE WORLD IN SUMMARY; Zia Hangs Tough On Afghanistan
Even if Pakistan is something less than the ''bastion of stability'' touted last week by President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, it has been steadfast in refusing to legitimize the puppet Government in Afghanistan. ''Pakistan will not talk to this man who came to be head of the Afghan regime by riding on Soviet tanks,'' Mr. Zia vowed. He said his 45-minute chat last month with Yuri V. Andropov, the new Soviet leader, produced ''no proof, no indications, no promises'' of plans for withdrawing 100,000 Russian troops from Afghanistan. Mr. Zia was in the United States to bolster support in Congress for the Administration request for $3.2 billion in economic and military aid over six years for his country. He insisted anew that Pakistan ''has neither the means nor, indeed, any desire to manufacture a nuclear device.'' But United States intelligence aides have said that Pakistan's nuclear weapons program had continued unabated and would be able to produce bomb-quality material within the next few years. President Reagan did not challenge Mr. Zia's denial. ''We accept that the President of Pakistan is telling the truth,'' an Administration official said after their meeting in the Oval Office. Mr. Reagan also left it to others to ask about Mr. Zia's oftenpostponed plans for elections and his human rights record, notably in undermining the independence of the judiciary. Asked about public flogging, Mr. Zia said that was authorized under Islamic law and ''civil law inherited from the British.'' To prevent permanent physical, if not psychic, harm, he said there were regulations governing ''how long the whip should be, where the person should be struck and where the body should be placed.''

832-> Bonn Says 2,392 Fled East Germany in 1982
West Germany said today that 2,392 East Germans fled to the West this year, using methods that ranged from scaling the Berlin wall to crossing the Baltic Sea in rowboats. The West German Interior Ministry said 269 of the East Germans were ''barrier breakers,'' people who had surmounted barriers on the guarded border at the risk of their lives. Some climbed over the Berlin wall or crossed minefields and booby-trapped barriers on the 855-mile border between East Germany and West Germany. There was no breakdown on other methods used, but the Interior Ministry said people had been smuggled out of East German Baltic ports on ships bound for the West, while others were hidden in Western automobiles that passed through East German highway checkpoints. Some used forged passports and documents to get past East German border guards and others traveled to other Eastern-bloc countries and made their way to the West from there. In 1981 the number who fled was 2,900, including 298 ''barrier breakers.'' In 1982, an additional 8,415 East Germans were allowed to leave East Germany to settle in West Germany, while freedom for a total of 1,377 people in East German prisons was bought by the Bonn Government, the ministry figures showed. West Germany is believed to pay about $20,000 for each prisoner. The newest refugee was a 19-year-old East German automobile mechanic who fled to the West German state of Lower Saxony Monday night unseen by Eastern border guards. The police said he had not been injured crossing the border barriers.

833-> HAROLD KENDRICK
Harold Kendrick, former manager of the New Haven Symphony Orchestra, died last Thursday at St. Mary's Hospital in Milwaukee, where he was undergoing a heart operation. He lived in Stamford, Conn., and was 68 years old. Mr. Kendrick studied the organ in the United States and Paris and then performed. He was manager of the New Haven Symphony from 1952 to 1959, managed the Erie Philharmonic Orchestra and was a musical representative for Columbia Artists Management. Mr. Kendrick served with the Army in World War II and was on the board of the American Symphony Orchestra. There are no immediate survivors.

834-> SPORT PEOPLE; MacLeish Is Released
Rick MacLeish, a 32-year-old center-forward, who once was one of the highest scorers in the National Hockey League, was given his unconditional release yesterday by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He played with the Philadelphia Flyers from 1970 through the 1980-81 season, scoring 50 goals in the 1972-73 season and 49 in 1976-77. Last season he scored 13 goals for the Hartford Whalers and the Penguins.

835-> LEHRMAN CLASHES WITH CUOMO ON TV
Lewis E. Lehrman and Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo repeatedly accused each other of a ''lack of candor'' and ''misstatments'' yesterday in their campaigns for Governor. In two joint television appearances, they also clashed on the death penalty, the economy and many other subjects. Mr. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative candidate, accused Mr. Cuomo, the Democrat-Liberal, of a ''lack of candor'' in telling a woman in Brooklyn that though he opposed the death penalty, the Legislature could enact a death penalty at any time by a two-thirds vote. A two-thirds vote is needed to override a veto. ''Again there is a lack of candor in Mario's position on this particular issue,'' Mr. Lehrman said. ''The reason we don't have the death penalty in New York for the murder of innocent people is because Mario Cuomo and Hugh Carey have supported the veto of the death penalty.'' Mr. Cuomo said his position on the issue had always been clear, and he went on to list issues in which his position ''had been lied about'' in the campaign. 'Last, Desperate Hours ''My position on tax increases has been lied about, my position on abortion has been lied about,'' he said. ''I don't mind that, but I'm not going to allow my position on life and death to be lied about. I know these are the last, desperate hours, but, Lew, let's maintain our dignitity in this campaign.'' The exchange came during a joint appearance on WNBC-TV's ''News Forum'' program and the disagreements over ''misstatements'' continued afterward. Mr. Lehrman accused Mr. Cuomo of misstating Mr. Lehrman's position on abortion, and Mr. Cuomo invited Mr. Lehrman to a ''three-hour debate on distortions.'' At the start of the last full week of campaigning before Election Day, the major party candidates for Senate, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democratic and Assemblywoman Florence M. Sullivan of Brooklyn, differed on the economy and other issues in separate television appearances on the WCBS-TV ''Newsmakers'' program. Mr. Moynihan, seeking re-election on the Democratic and Liberal lines, denounced the economic policies of the Reagan Administration and once again criticized his opponent for saying that the Soviet Union might have encouraged the nuclear freeze movement. Optimistic on Economy Mrs. Sullivan, candidate of the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life Parties, said she believed the economy was recovering from the recession. She also acknowledged that she was not familiar with proposed legislation that would make abortion and, many believe, the use of some forms of birth control a crime. In their joint appearance on ''News Forum,'' Mr. Lehrman said his tax-reduction plan would help create 200,000 jobs. Mr. Cuomo said that his own advice to the unemployed would be, ''Don't listen to people who give you magic solutions.'' Summing up their views, Mr. Lehrman said that government should be limited to public safety, education and providing ''a working evironment.'' ''People of New York can take care of their own problems,'' he said. He said Mr. Cuomo favored ''big government and big government spending.'' Mr. Cuomo said that Mr. Lehrman was running against ''a phantom, a straw man.'' He said that he too, favored a limited role for government. On the death penalty, Mr. Lehrman said it was ''simple justice,'' supported by the Bible. Asked if he was concerned that an innocent person might be put to death, he said there was ''no chance'' that this could happen. ''Under the guidelines of the Supreme Court,'' he said ''and given the commutation powers of the Governor to release anybody sentenced to death, there is no chance that an innocent person will be put to death,'' 'Following the Polls' Mr. Cuomo said there was ''no logical way of eliminating the possibility of mistake.'' He said that Mr. Lehrman was ''following the polls'' and that the Legislature had blocked efforts to provide more police, prosecutors and a better criminal justice system. On campaign financing, Mr. Cuomo said he favored sharp limits on campaign contributions and government funds for campaigns. Mr. Lehrman, a businessman, has spent $7.3 million of his own money on the campaign, and Mr. Cuomo said he expected to be outspent by 3 or 4 to 1 before the election is over. Mr. Lehrman said he opposed limits on contributions by individuals, and favored tax credits for contributors. In another joint appearance later in the day on ABC-TV's ''This Week With David Brinkley'' the rivals disagreed on the national economy. They are scheduled to meet in a formal debate today. Before yesterday they had made only one joint appearance.

836-> HEADLINERS; Twinkle, Twinkle Salazar
Winning the New York City Marathon may not be easy for Alberto Salazar, but it's certainly becoming a habit. The 24-year-old runner won his third consecutive marathon last week in a race he called ''mentally tougher'' than any of his previous victories. While his time - 2 hours 9 minutes 29 seconds - was slower than last year's record, the competition was closer, with Mr. Salazar, who suffered stomach cramps for the first time in four marathons, pulling away from Rodolfo Gomez in the final 600 yards of the race. Two days later at a White House awards ceremony, Mr. Salazar accepted Presidential congratulations and then gave President Reagan a pair of running shoes.

The NCNB Corporation, holding company for the North Carolina National Bank, said its previously proposed acquisition of Bancshares of North Carolina had been approved by the Comptroller of the Currency. Under terms of the transaction, NCNB will exchange up to 2.15 million shares of its common stock, which closed unchanged yesterday at $18.375, for the assets of Bancshares. The merger is scheduled to be completed on Dec. 23. Following the merger, NCNB's North Carolina National Bank will have 256 branches and assets of almost $9 billion, it said. NCNB also has mergers pending with the Exchange Bancorporation Inc. of Tampa, Fla., and the Peoples Downtown National Bank of Miami.

838-> Castilla Is Winner On Disqualification
Castilla was awarded first place in the $300,000 Yellow Ribbon Stakes today at Santa Anita after Avigaition impeded her a sixteenth of a mile from the finish and was disqualified. Avigaition led by a length from start to finish of the 10-furlong grass race, clocking 1:58 3/5 under Nestor Capetaine, an apprentice jockey. But the horse ducked in sharply in the stretch and Castilla, who was closing strongly on the rail under Ray Sibille, took up sharply. Sangue finished two lengths behind the winner and in third place. Honey Fox, the 5-2 favorite, was sixth. Castilla, a 3-year-old daughter of Bold Reason, returned $37 for $2 to win. She is owned by Mary Jones Bradley and trained by Charlie Whittingham. No Showdown A possible showdown between the undefeated 2-year-old fillies Landaluce and Princess Rooney will not take place either this year or in the Kentucky Derby next May, according to Frank Gomez, Princess Rooney's trainer. On Saturday night, Princess Rooney won the Gardenia Stakes at the Meadowlands by 11 lengths in stakes-record time of 1:43, but she injured her left foreleg coming out of the starting gate and will not race again this year. ''It's not serious and all she needs is time to heal up,'' Gomez said by telephone from New Jersey a few minutes after the Gardenia.

840-> BRIGHT NEW TALENTS LIGHT UP THE SKY OFF BROADWAY
A PLENITUDE of fresh new performing talent is brightening Off Broadway, but in most cases the talent is new only to New York. Many of these actors and actresses, young and old, are seasoned professionals who have appeared on a variety of stages, especially in America's regional theaters. Not only has regional theater become a primary source of new plays, but it is also serving the valuable function of grooming actors and sending them - along with those new plays - to the New York theater. This weekend theatergoers may see new talent from Chicago, Providence and Louisville in the invigorating revival of Sam Shepard's ''True West'' at the Cherry Lane Theater; in David Hare's ''Plenty,'' a provocative study of personal and political disillusionment at the Public Theater, and in Jane Martin's ''Talking With,'' an incisive evening of monologues at the Manhattan Theater Club. In addition, there are talented newcomers in Lanford Wilson's ''Angels Fall'' at the Circle Repertory Company, in the sciencefiction musical ''Little Shop of Horrors'' at the Orpheum Theater and on other of New York's smaller stages. John Malkovich is giving one of the outstanding debut performances of the season as an uproarious renegade in ''True West.'' Although this is Mr. Malkovich's first appearance on a New York stage, he is a star in Chicago as an actor and director with the venturesome Steppenwolf Theater. Mr. Malkovitch and Gary Sinise, who is his co-star as well as the director of ''True West,'' could be said to represent a Chicago style of acting - low key and laid-back. In its New York premiere last season at the Public Theater, ''True West'' seemed labored. As played by the two Chicago actors, the mismatched brothers - one a scrounger, the other a screenwriter -become freewheeling Shepard archetypes. They are a classic comedy team, working together so playfully on stage that it seems they really are brothers or have been friends for life. The fact is they share a creative compatability as actors and directors with the Steppenwolf company. Last week Mr. Malkovitch won a Joseph Jefferson award, the Chicago equivalent of a Tony, for his performance in ''True West.'' Last season he won a Jeff as director for the acclaimed Steppenwolf production of Lanford Wilson's ''Balm in Gilead,'' and his wife, Glenne Headly, who has not yet appeared on the New York stage, won one for her acting in the same play. Performances at the Cherry Lane, 38 Commerce Street (989-2020), are at 8 tonight, 7 and 10 P.M. tomorrow and 3 and 7:30 P.M. on Sunday. Tickets are $14 and $16. George Martin in 'Plenty' In ''Plenty,'' written and directed by Mr. Hare, George Martin gives an exemplary performance as an English diplomat overcome by a case of conscience. Mr. Martin, although a native New Yorker, has been a member of Providence's Trinity Square Repertory Company for the last 12 years, playing major roles in 46 productions. Last season New Yorkers saw another authoritarian side of this malleable actor. He was the beleaguered head of a comic madhouse in Harold Pinter's ''Hothouse,'' a role he first played at Trinity Square. Starring in ''Plenty'' is Kate Nelligan, making her American stage debut. Before ''Plenty,'' this passionate Canadian actress was familiar to American audiences largely through the television production of ''Therese Raquin'' and the movie ''The Eye of the Needle,'' but with her charismatic presence she has been commanding the stage at London's National Theater for several seasons. Performances this weekend at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater, 427 Lafayette Street (598-7150), are at 8 tonight and 3 and 8 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday. Half-price tickets, at $6 and $7, are available on the day of the performance, from 1 P.M. for matinees, 6 P.M. for evenings. ''Plenty'' will move uptown to the Plymouth Theater on Dec. 28. 'Talking With' From Louisville In ''Talking With,'' at the Manhattan Theater Club, 321 East 74th Street (472-0600), there is a group of exceptional actresses from the Actors Theater of Louisville, some of whom have worked in the New York theater, but almost all of whom have made their reputations in Kentucky. This is one of those instances when New York acts as a showcase, allowing talent to be seen by a wider public. Frequently, when the show closes, the performers return to their home company. Theatergoers are advised to catch them while they can. Actually, this is the final weekend to see ''Talking With,'' 11 monologues delivered by eccentric women who are marked by their obsessions. The play was originally presented at last season's new play festival in Louisville, and Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater, has brought it to New York almost intact - with the substitution of one new monologue and two New York actresses. ''Talking With'' serves as an opportune introduction to a talented, pseudonymous playwright and to a covey of gifted actresses who can use their monologues as audition pieces for seasons to come. (Performances tonight at 8 and tomorrow and Sunday at 2:30 and 8 P.M. Tickets are $16.) Laura Hicks opens the evening as an actress who wonders about the odd, nonreciprocal relationship she has with the audience, which remains in the dark while she is in the spotlight. A graduate of Juilliard, Miss Hicks toured the country with the Acting Company before joining the Louisville theater. Playing a rodeo bronc-buster, Margo Martindale lassoes the audience with folksiness and lusty humor. Like so many of the women in ''Talking With,'' she is inseparable from her character; one could easily imagine her taming wild horses. Lisa Goodman is arresting as she delivers ''Twirler,'' the first monologue written by Miss Martin. In this fervid confession, she describes the mystical spirituality of the art of baton twirling. Expert at portraying aberrant young women, she previously played a hyperkinetic adolescent in Olwen Wymark's ''Find Me!'', also at the Louisville festival. Susan Cash is making her New York debut as a snake-handler. In performance, she has the innocence and the conviction of a born-again believer, disarming the audience as she unfolds her rapturous tale of reptilian worship. In the most poignant of the monologues, Sally Faye Reit discusses the death of her mother, who clung to life as if it were a collection of ''clear glass marbles.'' The actress has a gentle limpid quality that is perfectly suited to the material. The oldest of Miss Martin's women is a lady in love with lamps; she is warmed by their proximity as if they are sunbeams. The role is played by Anne Pitoniak, a favorite Louisville personifier of mature women. Several seasons ago, with calm self-assurance, she placed her own imprint on the role of the Mother Superior in the professional premiere of John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God,'' the character played on Broadway by Geraldine Page. Though each of these actresses is distinctive, they are versatile enough to act as standbys for one another's roles. In performance, most of them share a down-home congeniality and spontaneity, attributes that make them well-suited to the flavorful plays of Miss Martin, Beth Henley, James McLure and other writers who have emerged from the regions. One could call this a Louisville approach to acting. The primary practitioner of the style, Susan Kingsley, recently made her Broadway debut in Miss Henley's short-lived ''The Wake of Jamey Foster.'' There is another example of Chicago theater on stage this weekend in New York. Gregory Mosher has brought his Goodman Theater production of David Mamet's ''Edmond'' to the Provincetown Playhouse, 133 MacDougal Street (777-2571), a matter-of-fact rendition of potentially melodramatic material, featuring Colin Stinton as a suburbanite who becomes a crazed urban vigilante. Paul Butler is striking in a small role as Mr. Stinton's cellmate. (Performances tonight and tomorrow at 7 and 10 P.M., Sunday at 7 P.M. Tickets, $14.50 and $15.50.) Brian Tarantina in 'Angels Fall' One reason so many of these excellent American actors work in regional theater is that it offers them a chance to act within a company. In New York, the Circle Repertory Company, 99 Seventh Avenue South, at West Fourth Street and Sheridan Square (924-7100), is one of the few theaters that has its own acting ensemble, which in previous seasons has introduced such actors as Nancy Snyder and Danton Stone, both of whom appear to advantage in ''Angels Fall.'' The new face in the cast is the talented Brian Tarantina as a fast-rising tennis professional. The character is anxious; the actor is appealing. (Performances tonight at 8, tomorrow at 7 and 10 P.M., Sunday at 3 and 7 P.M. Tickets, $15 and $17.50.) The Circle specializes in new plays. In contrast, The C.S.C. Repertory, 136 East 13th Street (677-4210), uses its acting company in a challenging array of classics, currently, ''Faust,'' Part I, and ''Faust,'' Part II.'' Playing the role of Gretchen, Faust's ideal woman, is Ginger Grace, who can project innocence without slipping into coyness. Part I can be seen tonight at 8, tomorrow at 3 and Sunday at 2; Part II, tomorrow at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 7 P.M. Tickets for both parts, $18; $12 for one ($8.50 for students and the elderly), or $6, 15 minutes before a performance. The W.P.A., which recently opened a new play, ''Back to Back,'' in its home theater, 138 Fifth Avenue (691-2274), is represented Off Broadway by the musical ''Little Shop of Horrors'' at the Orpheum Theater, 126 Second Avenue (477-2477). Although he is upstaged by a ravenous plant, Lee Wilkof has the leading role as a Walter Mittyish florist; he has an ingenuous affability that lets him get away with murder. As a back-up group to this house-of-horrors musical, there is a melodic trio of ''dream girls'' -Leilani Jones, Jennifer Leigh Warren and Sheila Kay Davis. (Performances tonight at 8, tomorrow at 7 and 10 P.M. and Sunday at 3 and 7:30 P.M. Tickets are $18 to $25.) While checking up on Off Broadway's early-season new faces, theatergoers will also have an opportunity to revisit more familiar but equally promising talent, including Daniel Gerroll and Ellen Parker in ''Plenty'' and Lynn Milgrim and Theresa Merritt in ''Talking With.''

841-> BLIZZARD HITS MIDDLE WEST, ISOLATING CITIES UNDER FOOT OF SNOW
A ferocious storm churning its way eastward from the Rockies buried many cities in the Middle West under more than a foot of snow today, sending stranded motorists scurrying for shelter from winds of up to 70 miles an hour. At least 10 deaths in the Plains states were attributed to the storm system. The storm was also blamed for nine deaths in Louisiana, Mississippi and Kentucky, where severe flooding occurred when the southern edge of the storm passed through. In Minneapolis and St. Paul, the authorities banned all travel except that considered essential after 15 inches of snow blanketed the area, drifting as high as 8 feet. All major highways as well as side streets were clogged with stalled vehicles. Stranded motorists sought refuge in churches, National Guard armories and libraries. The Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport was closed, along with the University of Minnesota. It was the first time the university has been shut down because of the weather since 1966. Ice storms and winds of 40 miles an hour hit Nebraska Monday, tearing limbs from ice-glazed trees and knocking out power for half of Lincoln's 170,000 residents. Five inches of snow fell in the evening, and the authorities pleaded with residents to stay home. Travelers Stranded in Nebraska About 500 people were stranded at the Interstate Holiday Inn in Grand Island, Neb., and thousands more were stranded along heavily traveled Interstate 80, a major east-west highway through the Plains. The National Weather Service in South Dakota reported that 17 inches of snow fell throughout much of the state, adding to the misery of a heavy accumulation that fell over the weekend. The weather service advised residents in a 28-county area of South Dakota not to travel unless they had snowmobiles or vehicles with four-wheel drive. Rod Fiedler, a trucker hauling potatoes to Kansas from East Grand Forks, Minn., said motorists who piled into two truck stops on Interstate 29 near Colman, S.D., spent much of Monday night exchanging storm stories. He said he had helped several people pull their cars out of ditches, but that when the semi-trailers started sliding into the ditches he decided it was time to pull off the road. Richard Dovovan, an elevator repairman who was stranded at one of the truck stops, said being stranded was not all bad. ''We had all kinds of fun here,'' he said. ''We drank coffee, drank beer and played cards. It's not boring when you have fun and good people.'' New Storm Spares Denver A new blizzard swept across the plains of eastern Colorado today, stranding more than 1,000 travelers in churches, schools and motels. Today's storm spared Denver, which is still digging out from under 30 inches of snow that fell on Christmas Eve. At Denver's Stapleton International Airport, workers struggled to clear a third runway today. Ten inches of snow fell on the northwestern part of Iowa, closing highways near Sioux City, including Interstate 80. Winds gusted to 54 miles an hour. The rest part of the state fared much better; Des Moines got only a couple of inches of snow. In Kansas, the situation was similar. The western and northwestern parts of the state received the heaviest snowfall, up to 14 inches. Many Homes Without Power Among those stranded in Kansas was Gov. John Carlin, who was taking his family on a ski vacation to Colorado. About 700 people stranded in Colby, Kan., were housed in a community building, a church and a tavern as wind-whipped snow closed a 250-mile stretch of Interstate 70 from Salina to the Kansas-Colorado state line. About 250 people in Goodland and Russell, Kan., were stranded in motels, private homes and public buildings. In western and north-central Kansas, 20,000 homes and businesses were without electricity today. Officials said it would probably take several days before power could be restored. A spokesman for the National Weather Service in Chicago said the storms that have battered the Plains states were to be expected at this time of the year. ''We usually get four of five of them each winter,'' the meteorologist said, ''and they normally leave the Rockies and enter the plains like this.'' While their western neighbors shivered and tried to cope with the snow, residents in Illinois, Wisconsin and southern Michigan basked in unusually warm weather. The temperature in Chicago reached a record for the day 64 degrees early today.

842-> GOING OUT GUIDE
ROUSE AND DROWSE Two separate sessions today cover New York as it is in celebration and as it is in slumber. The first, at 12:30 P.M. in Fraunces Tavern Museum, 54 Pearl Street, at Broad (424-1776), goes to the very roots of going out in New York. Kym S. Rice will address herself to ''Visual Images of Tavern Life,'' showing in a slide lecture in these appropriate precincts what went on in New York's taverns during the 1700's as depicted in prints and paintings. They show not only the taverns of the time but also let you see the dining, drinking, smoking, gambling and dancing that even then were forging New York's national reputation. This series of tavern talks is leading up to the opening of a new exhibition, ''Taverns: For the Entertainment of Friends and Strangers,'' that opens in Fraunces's venerable quarters on Dec. 1, with Mrs. Rice as guest curator. Admission to her talk is free. A more soothing side of life is approached in the other session, at 7 P.M. today in Room 220 of New York University's Main Building, 200 Washington Square East. The subject is ''New York City Lullabies,'' and you can fight dropping off as it proceeds with samples, live and recorded. Julia Lebentritt, director of a project dedicated to collecting lullabies of our various ethnic constituents, will preside over the gathering. Four singers will sing lullabies of many origins, including Hispanic, black and Ukrainian. The audience is invited to join in talk about it and even to sing the lullabies they remember. It is sponsored by N.Y.U.'s Program in Urban Ethnomusicology, the New York Folklore Society's city chapter and the Department of Performance Studies. Suggested contribution: $3. Information: 598-3431. Limited seating available. RICHARD RETURNS Richard III is a king guaranteed to stir the emotions. There are some who think he was not a bad fellow, but to most who think about it, he comes across as a ruthless villain. These negative vibes stem largely from ''Richard III,'' by William Shakespeare, a play that in itself has lent itself to infinite interpretations and presentations to match them. Tonight at 8, ''Richard III'' opens the sixth season for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, which,since 1977, has been playing only the Bard, some 20 productions, including a park tour last summer presented by Joseph Papp. The company promises a ''Richard III,'' directed by John Clingerman and starring J. Kenneth Campbell, that sticks close to what Shakespeare had in mind, something that scholars will have to judge for themselves. It includes original music with choral voices and instruments. The troupe performs at its house, recently refurbished, at 165 West 86th Street (877-6810). Through Dec. 12, with 2 P.M. shows on Saturday, Dec. 4 and 11. Admission: $8; matinee, $6. GUITAR For eight years, devotees of the art have flocked to the 92d Street Y, at Lexington Avenue, to hear experts perform in the series ''Classic Guitar.'' Tonight at 8, the series, presented by the Center for Inter-American Relations and the Y, returns for yet another season. Tonight's performer is Eduardo Fernandez of Uruguay, whose New York debut in 1977 prompted Donal Henahan, music critic of The New York Times, to say, ''Rarely has this reviewer heard a more impressive debut recital on any instrument. He ranks with the world's top guitarists.'' The series with four continues on Dec. 2 with Mario Escudero, a Flamenco guitarist who will be accompanied by a singer and dancers. On Feb. 8, the Assad Duo, from Brazil, performs and on April 23, Eliot (ok) Fisk, an American, concludes the series. Admission $6.50, $7.50, $8.50; for the entire series, $22, $26, $30. Box office: 427-4410. ON THE BIAS The story of discrimination against blacks in the entertainment industry is the theme of ''Rhinestone,'' the new musical by Bill Gunn that has just begun performances at the Richard Allen Center for Culture and Art at 36 West 62d Street (489-7456). The show, with music by Sam Wyman and choreography by George Faison, tells of a conflict between a black writer-director and a Hollywood producer. Its cast is headed by Novella Nelson, Michael Wager and Joe Morton. This is the company's 14th season since its founding by Hazel Bryant, who started out with shows in a hotel theater on lower Broadway and who has brought the troupe to its permanent home. Tuesday through Sunday at 8 P.M. Admission: $8. Entertainment Events is on page C26. Thursday Sports is on page D24. Richard F. Shepard $6.50, $7.50, $8.50; for the entire series, $22, $26, $30.

843-> SUSPENSION IS FAIR, BLINKA OF JETS SAYS
Stan Blinka, who will sit out today's Jets' game against Tampa Bay as only the second player in National Football League history suspended for a foul, said yesterday that Commissioner Pete Rozelle's decision was ''fair.'' ''I hate to think it happened to me,'' the middle linebacker said after practice. ''But shots like that don't belong in the N.F.L.'' Blinka has decided not to appeal the suspension. On Friday, he met informally with Rozelle and Art McNally, supervisor of officials, to view films of the Nov. 28 incident involving the Green Bay Packers' John Jefferson. ''I got caught at it, I was the one that did it,'' Blinka acknowledged at the team camp in Hempstead, L.I. ''We looked at my film from different angles. In fact, McNally explained that the reason I wasn't thrown out of the game right then was because my back was turned to some of the officials.'' Because Rozelle and McNally felt so strongly about the foul, Blinka said, he decided an appeal would do no good. And if the suspension were delayed, he noted, ''it could wind up coming for a playoff game.'' The illegal blow occurred in the fourth quarter as Jefferson, the wide receiver, ran into Blinka's territory. Defensive players may ''chuck'' an offensive player within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage. But Blinka, who was in that zone, left both feet and swatted Jefferson across the helmet with his right forearm, sending Jefferson to the ground in pain. Jefferson was removed from the game, although he was able to play the following Sunday and catch three passes. The Jets won the game, 15-13. Blinka wore a black, pin-striped suit with a vest for the meeting at the commissioner's office. He brought another film that showed him legally hitting Jefferson earlier in the game. ''The film I brought was of the first play of the second quarter, when I hit Jefferson legally,'' he said. ''I showed I had the same intent to hit him in the fourth quarter. The legal blow was delivered with the same force. But in the fourth quarter, he was further away than he had been, and to get him I had to leave my feet. ''The main reason I went in to see the commissioner informally was to show him I'm not a hoodlum and to explain what led up to it - to let them know I'm not that kind of a ballplayer.'' The 25-year-old Blinka is in his fourth season. He committed two penalties earlier this season - one for unnecessary roughness and the other for pulling a face mask - and committed only two last season. His teammates call him Mole because of his off-the-field demeanor. He wears horn-rimmed glasses and favors conservative suits, which give him a studious appearance. Films Are Shown But the Packers' coach, Bart Starr, labeled Blinka a ''hoodlum'' the day after the game. And during last Monday night's Jets' game in Detroit, the Jefferson incident was repeated several times on television. Meanwhile, isolated camera shots were put on Blinka during the Lions' game by ABC. One showed Blinka, apparently off balance, hitting the Lions' Billy Sims with a forearm blow. One of the announcers commented, ''Blinka again,'' even though no penalty was assessed. ''The commissioner told me he had already made his decision before the Lions' game, but didn't think it would be fair to the Jets to suspend me just before a game,'' Blinka said. Rozelle's judgment on Blinka was made at the same time he levied a $1,000 fine against the Lions' Leonard Thompson for his hit on the Giants' Leon Bright as Bright attemped to field a punt in the Thanksgiving Day game. ''I think I was in the unfortunate situation that there were two plays -mine and Thompson's - that warranted scrutiny at the same time,'' said Blinka, who will lose his game salary of about $4,500. He added, however, ''I'll continue bumping people over the middle.'' He described the forearm blow as ''the first one I ever remember throwing.'' '' The receiver gets the ball and he gets hit in the head,'' he continued. ''It happens every day in the league.'' Jefferson, however, did not have the ball. That apparently was a major factor in Rozelle's decision. ''I'm just going to let it go,'' said Blinka. ''The impression I got from the commissioner is that something has to be done about the kind of shot that I took. He repeated what he told me in his letter, that it was one of the worst shots he had seen.'' Blinka, though, had looked forward to today. He has never missed a game. He pointed out that this would have been his 54th straight game - ''my uniform number, 54.'' Woodring Will Start Instead, John Woodring will make his first pro start against the Buccaneers. He is a second-year player from Brown. The worse the weather, the more the Buccaneers are likely to run the ball and the more prominent Woodring will be. Under the Jets' defensive plan, the middle linebacker performs on running plays and is lifted in passing situations. But the weather is supposed to be subfreezing, which could affect both teams' ability to pass. This will be the second time in Tampa Bay history it has played in freezing conditions; the first was 1976. Their offense is geared to minimize turnovers, with runners who have lost only one fumble over the last two seasons, and a quarterback, Doug Williams, who has been the hardest to sack and intercept over his five campaigns. The Jet coaches believe Tampa Bay will attempt to throw, wind permitting. The Buccaneer coach, John McKay, refused interviews with New York reporters all week. Swirling Winds at Shea Some teams are unable to pass in Shea, where swirling winds often exceed 30 miles an hour and where winds at ground level are different from winds 20 feet up. Longtime observers note that the red ribbons atop the same goal post often flap in opposite directions. But the Jets will face the same wind as Tampa Bay. It is likely, then, that the absence of Johnny (Lam) Jones, a long receiver, will not be as damaging as might be expected. Jones, who snared four passes under the dome last Monday night in Detroit, has a sprained ankle. The sure-handed Derrick Gaffney, who is more effective over the middle and on sideline passes, will replace Lam and shuttle in plays, alternating with Bobby Jones. Barring further injuries, the absent regulars will be ready for the next game. ''I'll get ready for Miami next Saturday,'' said Blinka.

845-> HARVESTER CONTINUES WAGE CUTBACK
The International Harvester Company disclosed today that it had sent letters to its 9,700 domestic salaried employees informing them that the company would not restore a 5 percent cut in their pay until at least January. The company had said it might restore the deleted wages in November. Harvester, which has been facing serious financial difficulties all year, cut the pay of the 5,500 managers and 4,200 secretaries and clerks in March as part of an extensive cost-reduction program. It had said it would review its financial condition in November to determine whether to restore the salaries to their former levels. The decision to delay restoring the wages is another indication of the debt-ridden company's deteriorating financial condition, which has steadily worsened since it made the pay cuts. Then Harvester estimated it would lose about $500 million during its 1982 fiscal year, which ends Oct. 31. Now, the company predicts it will lose more than $1.5 billion. Earlier Cutbacks Continued In the letter, Harvester, which recently completed some major readjustments in its $4.2 billion debt restructuring plan, said it had based its decision on the depressed economy and ''continued pressure'' on its financial condition. Although the company said it intended to restore the deleted wages on Jan. 1, it said the final decision would be ''subject to continued appraisal.'' Harvester also informed the employees that it had no current plans to restore merit increases, which were also suspended earlier, until at least the first half of its next fiscal year. The company also reiterated earlier announcements that it plans to continue the suspension of company contributions to the employee savings and investment plan and to reduce vacation time by one week through 1984. While the company said it would continue to suspend vision and hearing benefits in its medical plan, Harvester announced that it would discontinue a 20 percent co-payment requirement for certain health and welfare benefits as of Nov. 1. Salaried employees would still be required to contribute $15 a month for certain other medical coverage. Harvester, which called the actions ''prudent'' and necessary to restore the company to financial health, froze the wages of its salaried employees on Jan. 1, 1981. This year, the company cut the pay of salaried workers by 5 percent and that of corporate officers by 20 percent and canceled incentive compensation programs.

847-> 15-Year-Old Elected To County Weed Unit
Fifteen-year-old Eric Salem won in his first try for elected office, but he was a bit tired after it was all over. Eric, a Lincoln High School sophomore, said Tuesday that ''I don't want to hear anything more about politics'' for a few days after winning one of two spots on the Lancaster County Weed Control Authority. He drew more than 15,000 votes to win a four-year term paying $20 a month. In his campaign, he appeared on several television shows. ''It was a lot of fun until about four weeks ago,'' he said. ''Then it got kind of boring.'' Eric and Don Keller, who finished first, were chosen from among four candidates. Eric took an interest after reading that weeds might have contributed to a traffic death.

848-> THE NATION IN SUMMARY; Feldstein Gives The News, Such As It Is, in Person
Those waiting for recovery from recession got little cheer from Martin S. Feldstein, confirmed last week as chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers in exchange for a trip to Capitol Hill and testimony on the economy's sorry state. (Partly to register their differences with the Administration and partly out of interbranch irritation, Senate Democrats had balked at voting confirmation until Mr. Feldstein came on over, which he'd been refusing to do because, he said, he was too busy and anyway, hadn't been confirmed.) ''Unfortunately,'' Mr. Feldstein told the Joint Economic Committee, ''we're still in the ambiguous bottoming-out range.'' Friday, the Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. weighed in with an appraisal that reflected the recent downward trend in mainstream forecasts for 1983. Even modest recovery by midyear - the bank forecast a 3.6 growth rate in the spring - was unlikely to ease unemployment before 1984; Milton Hudson, a Morgan economist, put the jobless rate for all of 1983 above 11 percent. The figures of the week did little to resolve the issue. The Commerce Department reported that American businesses spent 4.8 percent less on plant and equipment this year than they did last, and that the decline will continue through the first half of 1983 as well. But consumer spending, the mainspring of the economy, surged 2.3 percent last month, the biggest gain since May. Meanwhile, the inflation report, which the Adminstration months ago took to celebrating as a sign of its economic policies' success, sounded an ominous note, as sharply higher costs for natural gas and home heating oil pushed wholesale prices up 0.6 percent in November. Most economists attribute the slowing of inflation to plentiful crops and a world energy surplus, as well as the recession. Wholesale prices have climbed this year at a rate of 3.7 percent, compared with 7 percent last year. Inflation fears or no, United Auto Workers president Douglas A. Fraser last week predicted easy ratification of a new contract with the Chrysler Corporation, and in Canada he got it. Company and union negotiators last week reached agreement on an immediate pay raise and quarterly cost-of-living adjustments for auto workers in the United States and across the northern border, where 10,000 workers walked out Nov. 5, after a first tentative agreement, rejected by the members, tied wage increases to company profits. The 85,000 American workers, half of whom are on indefinite layoff, also rejected that earlier version of the pact, but voted not to strike. The company says the Canadian strike makes a profit unlikely this year.

849-> Man Sought in Inquiry On Slaying at Waldorf
New York City police yesterday released a police artist's sketch of a man wanted for questioning in connection with the slaying of a bank executive at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Sept. 23. He was described as a white or Hispanic man in his early 40's, 5 feet 11 inches tall, 170 pounds and with straight black hair. The police said a hotel guest had seen the man with the victim, Kathleen J. Williams, shortly before she was found stabbed to death in a stairwell on the 19th floor of the Waldorf. The 30-year-old Miss Williams, a vice president of the Chase Manhattan Bank in Mexico City, was in New York on a business trip.

850-> LEBANESE MEET WITH THE ISRAELIS SOUTH OF BEIRUT
Lebanese and Israeli negotiators opened talks in this battered seaside town today with Lebanon hoping to achieve the withdrawal of foreign forces from its soil and Israel hoping to pave the way for a peace treaty with its northern neighbor. The talks, the result of intensive American efforts during the last three months to get the two sides to sit down together, were held in a seedy hotel called the Lebanon Beach, a relatively unscathed place considering the damage caused to Khalde during fierce summer fighting. Until Monday, Khalde, about four miles south of Beirut, was the site of renewed bloodshed during five days of exchanges between right-wing Christian militiamen and leftist Druse fighters. The fighting ended when the Israelis fortified the area Monday with tanks, heavy equipment and soldiers. Heavy Security Around Hotel The security around the muddy entranceway to the hotel was tight as the delegates made their way to a large blue triangular table. Israeli and Lebanese security men made individual body searches of the press, which was let into the conference room for formal opening speeches before the negotiators began their first day of work behind closed doors. At the end of today's session, a brief statement was issued saying only that an agenda had been discussed in a ''cordial'' atmosphere. The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday in the Israeli border town of Qiryat Shemona. The negotiations are expected to be tough and protracted. The Lebanese Government of President Amin Gemayel is anxious to keep the talks to a narrower focus than the Israelis, namely the withdrawal of all foreign forces in Lebanon - Israeli, Syrian and the remains of the Palestine Liberation Organization, which has forces in the central Bekaa and around the northern port city of Tripoli. The Israelis have persisted in pushing for normalization, open borders, trade and other steps leading to a peace treaty, a tricky thing for Mr. Gemayel, a Christian, who presides over a deeply divided country. Many Christians favor close ties to Israel but Lebanon's many Moslems do not and Mr. Gemayel has made overtures to the Arab world for assistance since coming to power in September after the assassination of his brother, President-elect Bashir Gemayel. Hints of the divisions were evident in opening statements made by the chief delegates today. The chief Lebanese negotiator, Antoine Fattal, a jurist, former diplomat and onetime acting director of the Foreign Ministry, praised the American mediation effort and said the United States had agreed ''to participate fully in its proceedings.'' While the Lebanese have been speaking of the American role as one of ''partners'' in the talks, the Israeli Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin has been talking of the American role as that of ''observers.'' Extend Government's Sovereignty Mr. Fattal also referred to Lebanon's ties with the Arab world when he said, ''Lebanon shall not undertake alone any action which may prejudice the extension of the peace process and security in the region; nor will Lebanon accept to jeopardize by any such action the fulfillment of the historical mission it has set for itself within the Arab world.'' Lebanon's paramount task, Mr. Fattal said, was to secure the withdrawal of foreign forces and the extension of the Government's sovereignty over the entire country. Mr. Fattal and David Kimche, Israel's chief negotiator, differed in their public comments. Mr. Fattal said that an armistice agreement between Lebanon and Israel that was concluded on March 23, 1949, had not been abrogated because ''Lebanon did not resort to any belligerent action against Israel.'' Mr. Kimche, who is director general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, disagreed, saying that on ''the eve of the six day war in 1967 the leaders of Lebanon at the time declared their association with the Arab armies.'' 'A State Within a State' He said that Lebanon was also a signer of an agreement in Cairo that permitted the P.L.O. to set up operations in Lebanon that he said became ''a state within a state.'' ''To establish what we call a state within a state and to operate freely from Lebanese territory against Israel is in complete violation of the armistice agreement,'' Mr. Kimche said. He then added that ''we hope to sign here an agreement which we believe will be but a step away from the full, final, formal peace treaty that we would like to see come about.'' The conflict was not between Israel and Lebanon, Mr. Kimche said, but had been with the Palestinians who ''transformed Lebanon into a base for aggression against us against the will of the Lebanese.'' The final statement was made by Morris Draper, a United States special envoy who had spent many weeks getting the two sides to the table at Khalde. Mr. Draper pledged United States assistance in reaching an agreement. ''The United States believes strongly that the legitimate security interests of Israel should be addressed and satisfied to the maximum extent possible,'' Mr. Draper said. ''At the same time, the United States supports Lebanon's independence, national unity and integrity and the restoration of full sovereignty throughout its territories.'' There was, he said, ''a good basis for confidence'' that the negotiations would be fruitful because ''Israel has affirmed it does not covet a single inch of Lebanese territory and that it wants to withdraw its military forces.'' ''For its part,'' he continued, ''Lebanon has affirmed it does not intend to allow its territory to become again a base for hostile actions directed against Israel.'' Then alluding to the many issues to be resolved, the American envoy said: ''Will we be destined to see a repetition of the violence, instability and suffering of the past? Or will we see imagination and vision on the part of the representatives at this table?''

851-> U.S. CRISIS EXERCISE REPORTS MAJOR GAINS IN ABILITY TO MOBILIZE
Pentagon and civilian officials recently tested the nation's ability to mobilize in a global crisis and found it substantially improved over nearly disastrous conditions in the past, senior military officials say. ''I now conclude we're in a markedly better position for a major mobilization and deployment of forces,'' said one official, who asked not to be identified. The officials discussed with reporters on Thursday the results of a 10-day exercise conducted in November by Pentagon officials and staff officers. At the same time, other agencies, including the White House, tested procedures for mobilizing the civilian Government. The officials said similar exercises in 1978 and in 1980 ''were almost disaster situations so far as mobilization plans and procedures were concerned.'' No forces were actually moved in the exercise, called Proud Saber 83. Instead, civilian and military officials, including Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, played roles in a simulated global crisis. Focused on Call-Ups Officials stressed that this was not a nuclear preparedness exercise. Instead, it focused on such things as call-ups of National Guard and Reserve personnel, activation of the Selective Service System and some industrial mobilization for gearing up factories to turn out weapons, equipment and supplies. Officials reported ''very extensive improvement'' in the way the services mustered their Reserve and Guard forces. Staff officers went through the motions of a simulated movement of the Rapid Deployment Force to the Persian Gulf area as well as deployment of other forces to Western Europe, South Korea, the Caribbean and Southeast Asia. It was found that the Defense Secretary's staff could ''man its battle stations'' and accomplish in hours some actions that once took as long as weeks, officials said. But they acknowledged that some problems remained. For instance, Guard and Reserve units that would have to back up the regular forces, particularly the Army, in the early weeks of a war are still not as well-equipped as they should be. ''We found we did not have a good handle on the equipment distribution problem,'' an official said. ''We are still behind in pre-positioning spare parts, medical supplies and other materiel.'' Some of the reported gains were a result of programs started by the Carter Administration. These included pre-positioning equipment stockpiles for a military division in Europe, developing a base at the British-owned island of Diego Garcia for operations in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf and adapting C-141 and C-5 planes to carry larger cargoes.

852-> WIFE OF DISSIDENT ACCUSES SEOUL
The wife of Kim Dae Jung, the most prominent South Korean opposition politician, says that authorities here are ''forcing'' her husband into political exile against his will. The Government of President Chun Doo Hwan said on Thursday that it had moved Mr. Kim from a prison where he was serving a 20-year sentence for sedition to a Seoul hospital. The authorities said that they were willing to let him go to the United States to seek medical treatment for an arthritic condition, and that his sentence might be suspended. Mr. Kim's wife, Lee Hee Ho, and South Korean Christian church leaders who are strong backers of Mr. Kim said in interviews late last week that the effort to move Mr. Kim out of South Korea was being carried out with the implicit approval of the United States. ''We are being forced out,'' said Mrs. Lee, who retains her maiden name in accordance with Korean custom, in a telephone interview from her home. ''We have no choice.'' Decision Welcomed by U.S. The shift of the 57-year-old Mr. Kim from prison was welcomed by the State Department after several years of negotiations by American officials for his release. Mr. Kim's wife, who is 60 years old, said Thursday that she planned to leave for Washington, D.C., with her husband and two youngest sons. But in interviews here before the weekend Mrs. Lee and some South Korean Christian leaders said that he had no wish to leave Korea and no need to go to America for medical treatment, and that he would prefer to remain in his homeland rather than go into exile. Speaking on behalf of her ailing husband, who is held in a tightly guarded ward at Seoul National University Hospital and may see no one but her, Mrs. Lee said that he needed to have an operation for arthritis but could perfectly well have it in Korea. Mr. Kim's wife said the Government had given her a Dec. 23 ''deadline'' to get out of Seoul with her husband and family, although the Kims' two youngest sons, also due to go, had no wish to leave Korea. Mrs. Lee, who seemed distraught, said the arrangement for the United States trip had been made between the two governments without consulting the Kim family until the last moment.

855-> PHOTOGRAPHY BOOKS
HUNGARIAN MEMORIES By Andre Kertesz. Introduction by Hilton Kramer. Illustrated. 194 pp. Boston: New York Graphic Society/Little, Brown & Co. $55. In 1912, the same year that he went to work at the Budapest Stock Exchange, 18-year-old Andre Kertesz acquired his first camera. Today, 70 years later, Mr. Kertesz is still photographing, and he is widely acknowledged as one of this century's most prolific, influential and lyric artists of the camera. ''Hungarian Memories'' contains more than 150 images made between 1912 and 1925, when the photographer left Budapest for Paris. It was in Paris that Mr. Kertesz's seemingly effortless style reached the height of its powers - where, for example, such masterpieces as ''Satiric Dancer'' and ''Chez Mondrian'' were taken - but even in his earliest Hungarian pictures, Mr. Kertesz's eye was remarkably assured. Examples abound, many of them classics: a couple wrapped in rapturous embrace (''Lovers,'' 1915); an underwater swimmer rendered headless by the refraction of water (''Esztergom,'' 1917); a blind fiddler being led down the street by a barefoot boy (''Abony,'' 1921). Other images, equally engaging, are reproduced here for the first time. Sometimes the young Kertesz was content to be a documentarian, journeying into the countryside by train and horse cart to record farm scenes and peasant children at play. Yet even in these genre pictures there is the sweet, lyrical quality that distinguishes his entire career. This applies as well to his photographs of World War I, taken from the perspective of a recruit in the Austro-Hungarian Army; they show the intimate side of warfare familiar to us from Bill Mauldin's cartoons of World War II but unknown elsewhere in photography. Mr. Kertesz is also widely admired for his experimental approach to the medium, and one of the many pleasures of this well-produced book is the discovery that the experimental spirit was with him from the start. His decisive-moment approach to action, his fascination with distortions and his predilection for compressed, Cubistic compositions - all hallmarks of his Paris years -are gloriously present in his Hungarian photographs. WALKER EVANS AT WORK With an Essay by Jerry L. Thompson. Illustrated. 239 pp. New York: Harper & Row. $18.95. This is no oversized, elegant tribute of the sort we have grown accustomed to seeing bestowed on photographers of both outstanding and indifferent achievements. What surely will stand as the ultimate selection of Evans's work, ''Walker Evans First and Last,'' was published four years ago. But ''Walker Evans at Work'' is something possibly of even greater value: a selective inventory of the artistic output of a photographer who more than any other put his stamp on American photography. It contains reproductions of no less than 745 Evans photographs, as well as excerpts from his writings (including letters, memorandums and notes) and selections from his formidable collection of signs. We see - not for the first time - Evans's 1932 Havana street portrait of a man in a white suit and hat, but we also are shown two other versions of the same man, one of them radically cropped. His neglected series of subway portraits is presented as the photographer himself planned to show it, reproduced as page spreads from an unpublished book Evans titled ''The Passengers.'' And we can read the unpublished ''Author's Note'' written for his classic work ''American Photographs.'' ''Evans was, and is, interested in what any present time will look like as the past,'' he wrote of himself in 1961. This historical consciousness is much in evidence, from his early (1928) snapshots of Coney Island bathers to his 1971 photographs of Robert Frank's antique cookstove. It is also clear that Evans was one of the first artists to recognize the link between photographs and signs - indeed, to see photographs as signs. This is apparent in his well-known 1935 picture of the scores of portraits in a Savannah photographer's shopwindow - a paradigm of Evans's view of photography as social catalogue, as sign, as memory. And it is apparent in the signs he collected, frequently by ripping them from their moorings after he had finished photographing them. Admittedly, the format of ''Walker Evans at Work'' sacrifices the sanctity of the individual pictures somewhat, but it does so to provide a sense of his entire work. WRIGHT MORRIS: PHOTOGRAPHS & WORDS Edited, with an introduction, by James Alinder. Illustrated. 120 pp. Carmel, Calif.: The Friends of Photography. Providence, R.I.: Distributed by Matrix Publications. $32.50. Toward the end of the ''Words'' section of this remarkable book, Wright Morris puts his always precise critical finger on the connection between photography and language today: ''Words now affirm the photographic image, as photographs once confirmed reality. ... To the extent the photograph is a ponderable object, it will have to be pondered with words.'' Does this account for the relative lack of wordless collections in the current crop of photography books and the relative surfeit of texts both analytical and self-serving? Perhaps, but nowhere do language and image achieve such complementary states of grace as in Mr. Morris's own ''Photographs and Words.'' The 61 plates exquisitely reproduce Mr. Morris's photographs from the years 1938 to 1947, when - armed with a view camera, two Guggenheim grants and considerable determination - he sought to document a vanishing part of American life. His subject here, as in his 19 novels, is his childhood, his roots in the character-building soil of the Great Plains. These photographs of farm interiors, grain elevators and ghost towns have been compared to the work of Walker Evans, and they do share a dignity born of a frontal approach to the subject at hand. But as James Alinder notes in his introduction, the two men had vastly different perspectives: Evans was an outsider in search of metaphors; Mr. Morris is an insider reflecting on his experience, trying to shape the shards of his past into something recognizable. ''Photographs and Words'' is also a literary event. Mr. Morris's essay traces his involvement in photography, beginning with a l933 trip to Vienna, and so goes beyond the childhood experiences evoked in his recent memoir, ''Will's Boy,'' and in his novels. The story of his adult years told here is not as evocative as that of his youth in his fiction, but it is informative, revealing and amusing. Although ''Photographs and Words'' does not follow the format of Mr. Morris's pioneering photo-and-text experiments ''The Inhabitants'' (l946) and ''The Home Place'' (l948) -the text comes first, then the images, as opposed to having them alternate - it still reveals how similar Wright Morris's writing and image making have been. Both lavish much attention on detail; both find meaning in everyday objects, in the contents of a desk drawer or in the profile of a Model T Ford. And both focus on an unreclaimable past, one that can be summoned only by the imagination, which in Mr. Morris's case is as essentially American as Proust's was French. AARON SISKIND: PLEASURES AND TERRORS By Carl Chiarenza. Illustrated. 280 pp. Boston: New York Graphic Society/ Little, Brown & Co. $45 until March 1, 1983, $55 thereafter. It is unusual, if not unheard of, for an extensive and forthright biography of a photographer to appear during the photographer's lifetime, but Aaron Siskind is very much alive at 79, thank you, and Carl Chiarenza's treatment of his life is candid indeed. The opening chapter, entitled ''A Portrait,'' begins, ''Meeting Aaron Siskind for the first time, one's first response is that this character is a crude, sharp-tongued obstructionist.'' The next chapter begins with the sentence, ''His beginning was not unique.'' But Mr. Chiarenza is merely setting us up to like ''this character,'' who, besides being an outspoken opponent of cant and nonsense, is the most accomplished abstract expressionist in photography. For those who find Mr. Siskind's close-ups of torn posters and graffiti-covered walls inspirational, and for those who find them mystifying, ''Pleasures and Terrors'' will be a revelation. The son of an unsuccessful immigrant tailor, Aaron Siskind grew up on the wrong side of the New York City streets. At 12 he became a soapbox orator, espousing radical politics, which he had to renounce to get his high school diploma. After graduating from City College he married a woman who was soon to go permanently mad, and he became a high school English teacher - for life, he thought. Instead he soon was given a camera, joined the leftist Film and Photo League and embarked on a brief but distinguished prewar career as a documentary photographer. Mr. Siskind's gradual conversion to the abstract, formalist style for which he is best known is one of the most remarkable shifts in the annals of modern photography, and Mr. Chiarenza pays it considerable attention, examining its roots in Mr. Siskind's social documentary work and detailing the impact of his friendships with Abstract Expressionist artists such as Franz Kline and Barnett Newman. Mr. Siskind went on to a distinguished career as a photographerteacher, first in Chicago at the Institute of Design and later at the Rhode Island School of Design. Mr. Chiarenza's text is best when dealing with the facts of Mr. Siskind's career and less convincing in its attempts to ascribe biographical meaning to the photographs themselves. The book includes 272 reproductions of photographs, of which the seldom seen images from the 30's are especially intriguing. PHOTOGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE 1839-1939 By Richard Pare. Introduction by Phyllis Lambert. Catalgue by Catherine Evans Inbusch and Marjorie Munsterberg. Illustrated. 282 pp. Montreal: Canadian Centre for Architecture. New York: Distributed by Calloway Editions. $55 until Dec. 31, $65 thereafter. Who but Richard Pare would have thought to say that ''Photography of architecture has been central to the development of photography itself''? Yet here is the evidence, a clear-cut case made with 147 well-reproduced photographs spanning 100 years, from early daguerreotypes and calotypes of ancient cathedrals to Modernist celebrations of skyscrapers. ''Photography and Architecture'' suggests that except for the human face, buildings have been photography's most enduring and popular subject. The reproductions show that the kinds of buildings that attracted the attention of photographers shifted frequently between 1839 and 1939. Photography's pioneers soon turned from photographing cathedrals to making views of cities, endowing the profane with its own sort of glamour. Some 19th-century photographers made certain cities their own: Carlo Ponti's Venice, Robert MacPherson's Rome, the Alinaris' Florence. Others headed off in search of civilization's roots, documenting the great ruins of Greece, Egypt and Palestine, while still others sought out the exotic in India, Burma and China.Most exotic of all, for Americans at least, are the views of early encampments in the West, including an 1885 panoramic tour de force of Grand Island, Neb., by J.R. Moeller. By the turn of the century, the book suggests, photography took the side of progress. Alfred Stieglitz' and Werner Mantz's images typify the devotion to the new - specifically, Modernist - architecture with which the book concludes. Only a few holdouts, notably Eugene Atget, Walker Evans and Berenice Abbott, chose to record the face of what was rapidly being replaced. Several photographers emerge as masters of the genre: the team of Bisson Freres, active in France from the 1840's to the mid-1860's; Felice Beato, who worked with James Robertson in Malta, the Crimea, Egypt, Palestine and India and on his own in China and Japan; and Carleton Watkins, best known as a scenic photographer but whose ''Buckeye Tree, Calif.,'' showing a whitewashed lean-to of a house nearly obscured by tree branches, is cited by Mr. Pare as the greatest 19th-century American picture in this collection, which is owned by the Canadian Centre for Architecture. The original photographs are in an exhibition that is traveling in 1983 to Chicago and New York. BRASSAI: THE ARTISTS OF MY LIFE Translated by Richard Miller. Illustrated. 223 pp. New York: The Viking Press. $45. Unlike the studio-bound portrait professionals of his day -Edward Steichen, Cecil Beaton et al - Brassai worked in situ, visiting painters and sculptors in their workrooms. The images in this book, which date from the 30's to the 60's, in a sense anticipate the style of environmental portraiture that we now associate with Arnold Newman. Many of them were taken for the French Surrealist magazine Minotaure in the 30's and Harper's Bazaar in the 40's and 50's. Brassai's subjects include more than a dozen artists from Pierre Bonnard to Jacques Villon, plus the dealers Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and Ambroise Vollard. In addition to providing us with glimpses of each of them, Brassai attempts to fashion their portraits in words, drawing on conversations he had with them over the years and on his prodigious powers of memory. These profiles are informal in tone and range from fascinating anecdote to tiresome gossip. An example of the former is Oskar Kokoschka's tale of his great passion for Alma Mahler, the composer's widow. After they proved incompatible, a disconsolate Kokoschka had someone fabricate a life-sized replica of his object of desire, which he kept dressed in the latest fashions for years. At the center of ''The Artists of My Life'' is Picasso. It's not just that he takes up 33 pages of the book, as opposed to Dali's 17, Matisse's 17 and Leger's 5. Picasso is on everyone's lips, it seems; Bonnard, Braque, Dali and others ask Brassai what Picasso is up to. Brassai's pictures of Picasso in middle age and of his sculptures are wonderful to behold, as is the 1944 portrait of Picasso's great subject, Dora Maar. And then there is Dali's Gala, the forgotten sculptor Charles Despiau, a spindly, gravely ill Giacometti, Matisse with his birds and his model - all riches for anyone interested in the art and artists of our time. UNCOMMON PLACES By Stephen Shore. Illustrated. 63 pp. Millerton, N.Y.: Aperture. $30. Stephen Shore burst into the skies of photography in the early 70's, dazzling observers with carefully conceived color landscape photographs taken with an 8 by 10 inch view camera. Using a view camera was audacious enough at the time, but Mr. Shore's decision to work in color, coupled with his dedication to deserted, almost empty spaces, created a sensation. By 1979, though, Mr. Shore had left the scene on an extended fishing trip, and his contribution soon was obscured by the razzle-dazzle of photographers even younger than he. If this modest survey of Mr. Shore's first 10 years of work does nothing more than serve as a record of his past accomplishments, it will have served an important purpose. I suspect it also will have a major impact on photographers too young to have carefully examined Mr. Shore's style when it first appeared. Basically he is a direct descendant of Walker Evans, possessed of the same fascination with the inhabited American landscape, but his more contemporary sense of structure - in terms of both architecture and photographic form - makes his pictures at first seem less energized. And while his subjects may be banal to some eyes - just as gasoline stations may be eyesores, or dirt roads may be desolate - his pictures are captivating, balanced objects of considerable visual complexity. Looking at the photographs now, in what seem quite faithful reproductions, it is possible to see a romantic streak verging on the full-blown tonal sentimentality of Joel Meyerowitz. There are indications of nostalgia: Two pictures have full moons in the sky; another shows a baseball game on a sultry summer Montana day. His occasional portraits, especially, exhibit feelings of some intensity. ''Uncommon Places'' suggests that Mr. Shore photographs with more emotion than he generally has been given credit for. THE HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY By Beaumont Newhall. Illustrated. 320 pp. New York: The Museum of Modern Art. Boston: Distributed by New York Graphic Society/ Little, Brown & Co. Cloth, $40. Paper, $18.95. THE WORK OF ATGET Volume II. The Art of Old Paris. By John Szarkowski and Maria Morris Hambourg. Illustrated. 190 pp. New York: The Museum of Modern Art. Boston: Distributed by New York Graphic Society/ Little, Brown & Co. $40. These two publications of the Museum of Modern Art are neither entirely new nor entirely old. ''The History of Photography'' is Beaumont Newhall's latest revision of his classic text, first published in 1937; ''The Work of Atget: The Art of Old Paris'' is the second part of a planned four-volume compilation of selected Atget photographs in the Museum of Modern Art's collection. Mr. Newhall's revision, the fifth over all and the first since 1964, incorporates much of the historical scholarship of the last two decades and attempts to come to terms with the last 20 years of photographic practice - Stephen Shore included. Despite Mr. Newhall's obvious lack of sympathy with today's image making and the fact that some seams are beginning to show in the historical sections that form the bulk of the book, the new edition contains a great many reproductions of photographs fresh to this reviewer's eyes and is an invaluable addition to the ranks of photographic literature. So is ''The Art of Old Paris,'' which contains images central to Eugene Atget's oeuvre -much more central than those in last year's volume, ''Old France,'' which focused on the countryside around the French capital. Paris was where Atget lived and took most of his photographs; the portrait of the city that emerges here is marvelously intimate, intelligent and breathing. Thus ''The Art of Old Paris'' is, in Maria Morris Hambourg's words, ''the heart of Atget's document of French civilization.'' It also includes Mrs. Hambourg's concise biography of the French master, which manages to give us a picture of the man's struggles with life without in the least tarnishing his genius. With allowances for the two volumes yet to come, this is probably the one Atget book to have if you are able to have only one.

856-> CREDIT MARKETS; SLOWER RATE DROP EXPECTED BY ANALYSTS
There is a widespread belief in the credit markets that short-term and long-term interest rates will decline further, though not as fast as expected and not without occasional interruptions. In the next few weeks, for example, some analysts say that a heavy supply of new issues might cause enough congestion to reduce prices and raise yields a bit. Such a correction would be a buying opportunity for those who think the long-term trend in rates is lower. For that reason, many analysts do not think that any upward bounce in rates would be large or long-lasting. Henry Kaufman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said in the latest issue of Comments on Credit that unless the Fed acts to accommodate lower short-term interest rates ''the markets are not likely to absorb an anticipated record $13 billion-13.5 billion Treasury refunding without some price give-up.'' Awaiting Action by Fed Such an increase in rates would likely be temporary, however. Mr. Kaufman said in a speech in Tokyo last week that he still expects overnight interest rates to fall to 6 percent or 7 percent while long-term Treasury bond yields fall to 9 percent and 10 percent. According to many analysts, the long-term downward trend in rates could be given a boost when the Fed acts to reduce short-term rates further. Some expected the Fed to announce last week a reduction in the discount rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, and they now say that such a move could come before or after the elections. Analysts at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company concluded in a weekly newsletter that the Fed's decision to temporarily de-emphasize the basic money supply data ''may not bring with it as much immediate easing in bank reserve pressures and related interst rate reductions as many market participants originally expected.'' ''In fact, the monetary authorities are likely to await additional financial and economic evidence on the impact of the already sharp declines in interest rates before deciding whether or not to further ease money-market conditions,'' the Lanston economists said. Disappointed Traders The latest example of how sensitive the markets are to the timing of the Fed's actions was last Friday, when disappointment that the Fed did not cut the discount rate led traders to reduce prices enough so that rates for Treasury bills rose more than a quarter percentage point and bond prices fell more than 2 points. Much of the decline came in late trading, but dealers said that a weakening of investor demand at current prices was apparant earlier in the week. Because the Fed has de-emphasized the basic money supply as a guide to monetary policy, many analysts look to the condition of the economy for clues to the Fed's monetary policy. The common conclusion is that further reductions in short-term rates will be forthcoming so long as the recovery is not under way. The relationship between changes of interest rates and changes in the economy is not stable, so some economists have a hard time saying how much stimulus would be provided by the recent drop in rates. One reason why rates did not contine to decline last week, analysts at Lanston said, is due to ''an emerging notion that interest rates have fallen suffiently to lay the groundwork for future recovery, particularly in such interest-sensitive areas as housing activity.'' Investors and Inflation The appearance of a reviving economy does not mean the end of declining interest rates, however. Many investors are still willing to buy bonds because of a conviction that inflation will remain subdued, even while the economy recovers. Edward Yardeni estimated in the latest issue of Economics Alert that the 1983 inflation rate might be around 3 percent, as wages rise by only 6 percent while worker productivity improves. On the monetary front, Frank Mastrapasqua, an economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham, said in Credit Market Comment that the recent growth in the money supply ''does not suggest that the monetary authorities have embarked upon a course that will elevate inflation and inflation expectations.'' Other analysts say that in the last few months of 1982 there is still a good chance for a substantial slow-down in money supply growth, which will allow the Fed both to come close to its targets and to tolerate lower interest rates.

857-> Decision File; Bankruptcy Plan Found Wanting
Abel Montano is paid $948 a month as a clerk at the World Bank in the District of Columbia. His expenses for himself, his wife and one child are $749 per month, and he owes $31,507 to creditors. So he filed recently for bankruptcy. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Columbia refused to confirm his repayment plan. And the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia concurred that the plan unfairly discriminated among creditors. In his application for a court-approved repayment plan under the 1978 bankruptcy laws, Mr. Montano proposed repaying creditors at the rate of $200 a month for about three years. He further suggested that he would repay in full $7,000 in loans that had been guaranteed by co-signers. As for the rest of his $24,500 debt, Mr. Montano offered to repay $245, or 1 percent. Mr. Montano argued that unless he paid his co-signed obligations in full, the creditors would proceed against the co-signers, who then would pressure him to repay the loans. This pressure, he said, would interfere with the ''fresh start'' the bankruptcy code is supposed to provide debtors. The law, stated the appellate court opinion, ''does not guarantee unqualified freedom from the pressures of bankruptcy. ''Insulation of Montano from worry does not justify the unequal treatment he proposes.'' Mr. Montano is left with the choice of modifying the repayment plan or declaring ''straight bankruptcy,'' which would require him to distribute his nonexempt assets to creditors. I.R.S. on Tips The Internal Revenue Service wants its share of the tip. The I.R.S. estimates that waiters and bartenders have been reporting only 16 percent of their actual tip income. So here come the regulations. Starting Dec. 31, 1982, the revenue service will require bars and restaurants with 10 or more tip-receiving employees to provide information about food and beverage sales. If the tips reported by employees amount to less than eight percent of gross sales, the bars and restaurants must provide the I.R.S. with an estimate of each employee's actual tip income. Employees who contend that they received less than an eight percent tip on the average may find an I.R.S. letter in their mailbox asking for an additional payment plus interest and penalty, according to Roderic Young, an I.R.S. spokesman. ''Or a good explanation,'' he added.

Gas Pipeline Explosion Leaves 5 Dead in Iowa HUDSON, Iowa, Nov. 4 (UPI) - A fiery explosion from a punctured natural gas pipeline killed three construction workers and two county inspectors today and sent up a column of fire that could be seen 30 miles away, the authorities said. ''The bodies were blown beyond recognition,'' said the Black Hawk County medical examiner, Albert Dolan. The explosion occurred when the construction crew, laying drainage tile, punctured the pipeline with a ditch-digging machine, according to a spokesman for Northern Natural Gas, which owns the pipeline. The dead workers were identified as Lester Huisman, 63 years old, and his son, Michael, 26, and Casper Niehaus, The elder Mr. Huisman was the owner of the construction concern doing the work that touched off the blast. The dead soil conservation agents were identified as Diane Runyan, 34, and Dave Krsnak.

859-> BRITON ASSAILS THE U.N. RESOLUTION AS 'ARGENTINE-INSPIRED CHARADE'
Foreign Secretary Francis Pym lashed out today at supporters of the United Nations resolution calling for negotiations on the future of the Falkland Islands, and rejected the General Assembly decision. Without mentioning the United States, which announced its support for the resolution two days ago, Mr. Pym said just before the vote that the ''result will bring little credit to those whose memories proved so short.'' The resolution, declared Mr. Pym in the House of Commons, is ''an Argentine-inspired charade.'' And he maintained that ''the whole idea of Argentina introducing a draft United Nations resolution calling for negotiations is absurd, after her flouting of the United Nations Charter and her defiance of the Security Council.'' In private, other Foreign Office officials here made clear that the British Government is deeply upset by Washington's action. On Wednesday John J. Louis, the United States Ambassador, met with Mr. Pym and was told of the British displeasure. Unusually Harsh Clash All told, the disagreement between the two allies has been unusually harsh. The altercation comes at a particularly awkward time because diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to resolve the impasse between Europe and the United States over sanctions linked to the Soviet natural gas pipeline. The British officials were also disgruntled because Washington's vote for the resolution came despite a personal cable from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to President Reagan appealing for support for the British position. Among Britain's difficulties with the resolution is the phrase urging that the negotiations ''take due account of the interests'' of the 1,800 Falklanders. Britain has insisted since the confrontation with Argentina began in early April that the wishes of the islanders were paramount and officials here said privately today that until this week they felt that the United States accepted that principle as well. Timing Wrong, Britain Says More generally, Britain believes that this is not the right time for negotiations. ''We cannot accept a call for negotiations on sovereignty after an unprovoked attempt to force the issue by invasion - invasion which made abundantly clear the extent of Argentine disregard for the rights of the islanders,'' Mr. Pym said during the general foreign policy debate today. There was evidence here of some support outside the Government for Washington's argument that the United States needs to mend its fences with Latin America, particularly because Mr. Reagan plans to travel there. ''If the vote helps to improve Washington's relations down south, that should not be grudged,'' said The Daily Telegraph in an editorial. The paper said that the United States had supported Britain on the important matters, including providing supplies during the war. Falkland Fever Runs High But Falkland fever still runs high in Britain. Just today Queen Elizabeth II bestowed a number of honors for the campaign in a Buckingham Palace ceremony. Little willingness is evident here for any transfer of title or control of the islands to Argentina, particularly after a war estimated to have cost $1.8 billion and continued heavy rebuilding and defense costs for the islands. ''We know what the Argentines mean by negotiation,'' Mr. Pym said, ''they mean a discussion of the procedures whereby sovereignty might most quickly be passed to them.'' That view was echoed by Dr. David Owen, the deputy leader of the Social Democratic Party. There could be no question of Britain's negotiating while ''we have not buried our dead,'' he said. In another indication of Britain's firm stand on the Falklands, Mr. Pym stressed in the debate today that his country had made a special contribution to international security by showing that ''aggression need not pay.'' ''Our response to the unprovoked, unlawful and totally unjustified Argentine invasion of the Falklands was widely respected,'' he said.

860-> DEMOCRATS PLEDGE JOB ACTION
Congressional Democrats, ignoring President Reagan's call to ''stay the course'' with his economic policies, are promising instead to push back-to-work legislation when the House and Senate return after the Nov. 2 elections. Democratic leaders sent a letter to all House Democrats on Monday belittling Mr. Reagan's view of the economic situation as ''pie-inthe-sky optimism.'' ''When we return to work Nov. 29, we must give top legislative priority to job-creation and economic recovery,'' the letter said. It was signed by the House speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of Massachusetts; the majority leader, Jim Wright of Texas, and the majority whip, Thomas S. Foley of Washington. ''We believe that the results of the Nov. 2 election will make it clear that the American people vastly prefer a back-to-work program to the President's stay-the-course philosophy,'' the letter said. The Democratic leaders said that proposals to create jobs were ''conspicuously absent'' from Mr. Reagan's economic agenda.

861-> Federated Slid 23% In 3d Period
Federated Department Stores Inc., the nation's largest department store chain, reported yesterday that third-quarter net income fell 23 percent, to $39.7 million, or 82 cents a share, from $51.6 million, or $1.06 a share, in the 1981 quarter. Sales rose to $1.8 billion, up 8.6 percent from a year earlier. Federated's stores include Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, based in New York; Filene's, Boston; Bullock's and I. Magnin, California, and Rich's, Atlanta. Howard Goldfeder, Federated's chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the third-quarter downturn to a weak economy that continued to depress consumer demand and to promotional programs that lowered gross margins. He also noted that stores in the Sun Belt have, for the first time, begun to show the impact of the recession. Mr. Goldfeder said that a planned expansion program also took its toll on earnings. During the quarter, Federated opened 11 new department stores, 7 new mass-merchandising stores, 5 new children's specialty apparel stores, 5 new off-price children's apparel stores and 16 new supermarkets. Two other store chains reported results yesterday. The May Department Stores Company, which has stores in 39 states, reported record third-quarter sales and earnings. Net income was up 41 percent, to $26.7 million, or 92 cents a share, on 7 percent higher sales of $885.6 million. This compares with earnings of $18.9 million, or 65 cents a share, on sales of $829.7 million in the 1981 quarter. The Allied Stores Corporation, whose stores include Garfinckel's, Brooks Brothers and Miller & Rhoads Inc., reported third-quarter earnings of $12.7 million, or 61 cents a share, up 27 percent from $10 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were $780.2 million, up 16 percent from $673.9 million in the 1981 quarter.

862-> HIT DRAMA 'PLENTY' MOVES UPTOWN TO BROADWAY
Three days before ''Plenty'' opened at the Public Theater in October, David Hare, the playwright and director, decided that the star needed a new coat for one scene. ''I assumed that would be no problem,'' says Mr. Hare, ''but I got a message back that all spending on the production had been suspended until Mr. Papp had seen the first preview.'' And so Mr. Hare did without the coat. On the night of the first preview, he was standing at the back of the theater during intermission. ''Joe came up to me and said - '' Mr. Hare lowers his voice and speaks out of the side of his mouth, American gangsterstyle - '' 'She gets the coat.' '' He laughs. ''It was his only comment.'' Joseph Papp's vote of approval was followed by lavish praise in virtually every review as ''Plenty'' went on to become a sold-out hit as well as the critical success of a rather lackluster theater season. Its triumphant reception downtown came as a considerable surprise to cast and playwright alike - because the play is English, because it is serious, and because it was not well received in London, among other reasons. But this week ''Plenty'' moves to Broadway, with previews that began last night for an official opening Jan. 6, and all concerned are now wondering whether its success will be repeated at the Plymouth Theater during the play's 13-week run with its original stars, Kate Nelligan and Edward Herrmann. 'Grave Reservations' About Move ''Plenty,'' which generated a great deal of controversy in England, tells the story of Susan Traherne, an Englishwoman who fought in the French Resistance during World War II, and her postwar life as a diplomat's wife. Haunted by memories of the intensity and meaningfulness of her wartime experiences, obsessed by disillusionment and bitterness as she watches the nation's hopes for peacetime society erode along with England's stature, Susan herself deteriorates into madness, destroying her husband's career along with their marriage. A metaphor for England's decline, the play is acid in its portraits of the hypocrisies of diplomatic life, English manners and mores, and such institutions as the Foreign Office, among other sacred cows. Still bemused by the play's success at the Public, the playwright admits to ''grave reservations'' about bringing it to Broadway. With a cast of 14 -unusually large for a nonmusical play on Broadway - the economics alone ''are terrifying,'' says Mr. Hare. ''It is so difficult to put a straight play on Broadway.'' Mr. Papp reports: ''We have to gross $120,000 to $130,000 a week just to break even on Broadway. We could break even at the Public with $16,000, because people are working for Off Broadway salaries.'' Furthermore, moving the production to Broadway has been nearly twice as expensive as staging it in the first place. ''The production cost $225,000 to mount at the Public, and it's costing us nearly $400,000 to move it and remount it at the Plymouth,'' says Mr. Papp. Such figures have their effect on members of the company. ''There's an added tension, knowing what huge sums of money are riding on a Broadway production,'' says George Martin, who plays a British diplomat. ''And at these prices, it's very difficult for audiences to be experimental: at $30 or $40 or $50 a person, you want to know what you're buying.'' The tastes of Broadway audiences - which generally run to musicals and comedies - are consequently a matter of considerable concern. Despite its critical success, ''Plenty'' is coming to Broadway with an advance ticket sale of $500,000, whereas ''Cats,'' for example - a musical that met with mixed reviews - had a record-breaking $6 million advance. ''I worry that the Broadway audiences will be too rich and old to dig it the way people did downtown,'' says Kate Nelligan, who stars as Susan Traherne. ''This is a play I never imagined in my wildest dreams would find its way to a commercial house. Not because the play isn't good - the play is superb - but we failed so dismally in London. The play is very insulting to many English people, and it's very hard to sit there and get insulted. Americans can sit there and it doesn't hurt them. I find it very encouraging that we're here. The play is very demanding and intelligent, and here we are, selling it in a commercial house.'' 'Pleased at the Response' Edward Herrmann, who won critical praise for his portrayal of Susan's husband, Raymond Brock, says that performing at the Public seemed to him ''more private.'' He says: ''You're sharing it with a smaller group, and you may be playing to a more highly educated, artistic public. The people who go to theater Off Broadway tend to be more interested in theater, while the ones on Broadway come for an event. You get the feeling that you're safer Off Broadway. But one of the things that's exciting about Broadway is that it's dangerous. You're opening to a bigger public, and this is supposed to be the standard by which other productions are judged. Broadway is the majors, and there's an added pressure. The trick is to use it creatively.'' But any differences between Broadway and Off Broadway audiences seem negligible compared with the dramatic contrast between how ''Plenty'' was received in New York and in London. ''I've been so pleased at the response,'' says Mr. Hare. ''It's all so completely new and different to me. I never expected people to turn out Off Broadway in such numbers. I think people see the play a lot more clearly here, because they don't feel themselves implicated directly. In England, people were made uncomfortable by its idea of English history. The play takes quite a critical view of postwar history; it obviously implies that wartime ideals were thrown away in the peace, during the years of Conservative government, and that we made particular fools of ourselves during the Suez crisis. It also attacks good English institutions like the Foreign Office. A lot of people told me the play would never make it here because it's so English. But American audiences see it as a portrait of a woman and a time, and they see it at one remove from their lives. And that one remove seems to have been the thing that made people like it so much here. ''The subject of the decline of England over the last 25 years is still a bitterly contentious subject in England,'' Mr. Hare adds. ''Everyone's diagnosis of what happened is different, and people take a very political view of what has gone wrong. How one views the play is very much affected by one's politics. In England, this is a lot more controversial play.'' Mr. Hare's surprise at the differences between English and American audiences has paralleled his introduction to differences in the mechanics of theater itself. ''Joseph Papp is an absolute monarch - the monarch of Ruritania,'' he remarks. ''The Public is his country: he runs it exactly as he wants to, whereas theaters in England pass through various people's hands at the will of the board. The artistic director is more of a civil servant, and at the back of his mind he's always thinking, 'I may be sacked.' The boards run the theaters, effectively. Here, if Joe decides he'll spend this year's budget painting the theater pink, he'll do it. The situation here is more vital, but more erratic, because it's at the whim of one man.'' 'Home of the Theater' Coming to Broadway has brought further revelations, many of them dismal discoveries about money. Mr. Hare was horrified to discover that in signing his Dramatists' Guild contract months ago, when he never dreamed that ''Plenty'' would make it to Broadway, he had in effect forfeited his own royalties until the play attained operating profits. ''There is apparently this clause I was not aware of,'' he says mournfully. ''Because it is so phenomenally expensive to transfer a straight play to Broadway, the attack of the producers is first upon the writer, because it is assumed that the writer is willing to gamble his royalties upon the success of the play. So you're paid nothing unless the play is taking in huge amounts of money at the box office; you're effectively investing in the production money which you never get into your hands.'' Nevertheless, even to Mr. Hare, Broadway still represents a certain standard of success, one that is particularly freighted with meaning to Americans in the company. ''Broadway is like the home of the theater,'' says Ellen Parker, who plays Susan Traherne's best friend, Alice. ''It's really special to be here. In my heart of hearts, it represents the best of the best. I don't know that it always is that way, but I still feel that about it.'' Mr Herrmann sums it up: ''When a play comes to Broadway, you know it has arrived.''

863-> SOME BROKEN FAMILIES RETAIN MANY BONDS
For a change, there are some good tidings about the American way of divorce. New research shows that caring feelings, friendly interactions and a significant degree of communication are not unusual among some former spouses in what social scientists call binuclear families. In such families, divorced spouses who were formerly part of a nuclear family have reorganized into a new system that can include former spouses, children and new partners. Investigators stressed, however, that the positive findings should be interpreted with caution. The number of such families whose encounters are relatively friendly is believed to be small, though growing, and such traditional attendants of divorce as bitterness, separation and dislocation still hold true in most cases. Study to Last Four Years Researchers in the Binuclear Family Project at the University of Wisconsin at Madison have completed the first stage of a four-year study of 98 pairs of former spouses who have children. The preliminary results include the following: - The stereotype that a divorced couples' relationship is disagreeable and conflicting fit about a third of the couples in the study. However, relationships that were generally caring, respectful and friendly were reported by 30 percent of couples who had joint custody, and 20 percent of the couples where the mother had custody. About 65 percent of the former spouses in the second group reported having conversations once a month, and one-third reported weekly interactions. - Slightly over one-third of the ''mother custody'' couples and two-thirds of the ''joint custody'' couples spent time together as units - groups that included children, former spouses and new partners. Some binuclear families got together each month to discuss decisions involving children, and a few planned holidays, outings and weekends together. - The divorced parents who shared child-rearing the most also interacted the most frequently, communicated more on matters not involving their children and perceived their relationship as generally supportive. They had significantly less anger at one another than other parents and believed that their children were harmed less by their divorce than children of other divorced spouses. - The couples who maintained the friendliest communication avoided one of the most disruptive elements of post-divorce life: going back to court. ''For an increasingly large segment of society, the divorced binuclear family is replacing the traditional nuclear family,'' said Dr. Constance R. Ahrons, who conceived the study and heads a team of 20 investigators. ''Many divorced spouses continue to relate with each other in ways that appear to be healthy and satisfying,'' she said. ''It's much more common than many people believe.'' The ages of the couples in the study ranged from 19 to 60, and their average length of marriage was 11.1 years. Among 54 of the couples, mothers had custody of the children; fathers had custody in 16 families, and there were 28 joint-custody couples. Concern About Previous Research ''Almost all the research prior to 1970 was based on clinical populations,'' Dr. Ahrons said, referring to studies of divorced spouses who sought some form of counseling. ''I'm not a Pollyanna - I'm not denying that very troubled, bitter couples exist. But they may have been overrepresented, for there are many divorced couples who relate well.'' The sample of 196 subjects was drawn from the divorce records of Wisconsin's Dane County in 1978, and they were first interviewed in 1979, a year after divorcing. Researchers interviewed 96 of the original couples and their new partners in a two-year follow-up, and a third interview is planned to complete the study. Former spouses who interact in a friendly way have sometimes been stigmatized in our society, Dr. Ahrons said. ''There was often a moralistic feeling on the part of relatives or those in the community,'' she said, ''that if the spouses can manage to get along in any way at all, then they shouldn't have divorced in the first place.'' Such couples had also been stigmatized by some mental-health professionals, she said. ''Some of the early treatment literature suggested that these former spouses were over-enmeshed in an unhealthy way,'' Dr. Ahrons said, ''and that they hadn't made a successful adjustment to divorce.'' The number of binuclear families is increasing rapidly. Projections from Census Bureau statistics show that close to 50 percent of recent marriages may end in divorce, compared with 40 percent two decades ago. There were 1,219,000 divorces last year, the National Center for Health Statistics has estimated. Now, close to 75 percent of divorced women and 83 percent of divorced men remarry. One in five of the 45.4 million ''married couple households'' in America is a couple where one partner was divorced, according to the recent calculations of Dr. Andrew Cherlin, a Johns Hopkins University researcher, and his colleague Dr. James McCarthy. As of June 1980, there were 9,250,000 such couples in America. In 5.5 million of those families, one or both spouses had children under 18, the Johns Hopkins researchers have calculated. By 1990, about half the children in America will have lived with a single parent for at least several months, according to the projections of Paul C. Glick, a former senior demographer of the Census Bureau. Study of binuclear families with friendly communication between the former spouses is so new, however, that no census or other statistics suggest their number. Although the Wisconsin research attests to their existence and has described their behavior, experts believe that their number may be small. ''Friendly divorce may be a growing trend, but it's growing from an exceedingly tiny base,'' said Prof. Frank Furstenberg Jr., a sociologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Conducting Five-Year Study Dr. Furstenberg and a colleague, Dr. Nicholas Zill, are conducting an ambitious five-year national study of 1,700 households with 2,300 children between the ages of 7 and 11. The study, supported by the Foundation for Child Development and the National Institute of Mental Health, may resolve some of the questions about ''friendly'' divorce and shed new light on divorce and remarriage. Dr. Furstenberg said: ''Most children in families where there has been divorce or separation are experiencing little contact at all with the nonresident parent, who is usually the male. Over half of the kids in our study have not seen the nonresident father over the last year. And of those, only a fifth have regular contact with him.'' 'Strong Bias' in Study In an interview, Dr. Ahrons said that there was ''strong bias'' in the sample of her study, since it was designed to observe binuclear families where both parents had continuing contact with the children. Couples were not chosen for study unless the parent without custody had communicated with the child within two months before the initial interview, and both parents had to live within 50 miles of Madison, eliminating from the study divorced couples whose lack of communication was partly the result of geographical separation. Dr. Furstenberg said he had no quarrel with the Wisconsin group's conclusions about friendly relationships between former spouses, but believed that other sorts of relationships might be more prevalent. ''It seems to me that the predominant mode when formerly married people are parenting is not co-parenting,'' he said, ''but 'parallel parenting,' where each parent operates as a self-contained unit. ''The two work in tandem,'' he said, ''but few couples are able to re-establish a coordinated system of child care. It's a very common way to separate from a partner where there may be much bitterness, while permitting continuing contact with the children.''

865-> FOR SPANISH CENTRIST, ALL IS DOWNHILL
Many people in Spain talk about former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez these days, and most regret the eclipse that seems to await him in Spain's third post-Franco general election next Thursday. Mr. Suarez, a thoughtful, well-tailored man, 49 years old, guided his country through the perilous transition from dictatorship to democracy. In the elections of 1977 and 1979, the Union of the Democratic Center, a centrist grouping of no fewer than 17 parties, emerged as the victor, and Mr. Suarez, its founder, led it in office as Prime Minister. But in January 1981 Mr. Suarez resigned, for reasons that have never been completely explained, and was succeeded by Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo. This year he formed a new, slightly more left-wing party, the Social Democratic Center, in the hope of winning in the current campaign enough votes to gain membership in a coalition under Felipe Gonzalez's Socialists. His effort seems to have failed. A comprehensive public-opinion poll published last week by El Pais, the Madrid daily, shows him with only 3.5 percent of the vote and no more than five of the 350 members of Congress. Only in Madrid, Barcelona and Avila does his new party stand much chance of gaining seats. An Uphill Struggle Campaigning here in the Basque country, Mr. Suarez has tried hard to overcome the prevailing popular notion that he is a burned-out case, a man whose hour has come and gone. But it is an uphill struggle. Although he gets free television time, along with four other national party leaders, he has little money for billboards or newspaper advertising, and he has had little time to build an organization in the hinterlands. Nonetheless, he stands for something in Spanish politics. He is the chief exemplar at the moment of the idea that a polarization between right and left is mortally dangerous, that it invites a renewal of the conflicts that led to the civil war or a coup by the army to halt a turn to the left. That was his message as Prime Minister, and it is a message with a special urgency as the nation approaches an election in which only Mr. Gonzalez and his right-wing challenger, Manuel Fraga Iribarne of the Popular Alliance, appear to have any real chance. The rump of Mr. Suarez's only party, the Democratic Center, has all but vanished as a force in the campaign. Mr. Calvo Sotelo has stepped aside in favor of Landelino Lavilla, and he does not even appear on television. Mr. Lavilla has spent lavishly on advertising - he had two full pages in this morning's paper in Navarre, in northern Spain -but he is faring little better, as the leader of a party that won 168 seats three years ago, than Mr. Suarez. Politicians of other parties, who would never dream of voting for Mr. Suarez, wish that he was running more strongly. They, too, think that an enfeebled center is bad medicine for the renewed, tentative Spanish experiment in democracy. 'We Need Suarez Around' ''People like Suarez are very necessary in Spain,'' said a Catalan nationalist in Barcelona. ''What this country wants is moderate, careful reform, and only a man of the center can provide it without awakening all of the old animosities.'' ''We need Suarez around,'' said a Socialist from Andalusia, in the south, ''to prove to the right-wingers that the country is not being taken over by rabid Marxists.'' But Mr. Suarez offended the army by his insistence that it be brought under sterner civil control and that promotion be based on merit rather than seniority or political influence, and that killed his chances with the right. His standing as the ablest centrist leader appears to have led the Socialists, the main opposition party for the last five years, to have done what they could to weaken him. A Basque politician here, who has watched from a privileged position the maneuvers of the national parties in Madrid for the last few years, offered the following diagnosis: ''The Socialists broke Suarez, although some of them thought it was a mistake. They preferred to flirt with Fraga on the right rather than make the center credible. Then the coup de grace was administered by Calvo Sotelo. By moving the election from next spring to this fall, he killed whatever chance Suarez had to build himself into the alternative that Calvo Sotelo and his party had ceased to be.'' Campaigning the other day in Santander, just west of here, Mr. Suarez spoke calmly and firmly, without notes, obviously seeking to build rapport with his relatively small crowds. What he seems to be reaching for is a populist image that sits uncomfortably with his well-cut suits and shirts and his air of urban prosperity. He argues that he is needed as a power broker among the center, the Socialists and Mr. Fraga. That is the role he played in the past. But the Spanish electorate appears to be in a mood for a clear choice this time, and only if Mr. Gonzalez falls short of a clear majority and needs a coalition partner, does there seem likely to be a major role for Mr. Suarez after Thursday.

To the Editor: During the MX debate on the floor of the House, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, a proponent of the missile, cited Gen. Douglas MacArthur's repeated calls in the 1930's for adequate funds to modernize our forces, even though it meant deficits (news story Dec. 8). But after the development of nuclear weapons, MacArthur said: ''The very triumph of scientific annihilation has destroyed the possibility of war's being a medium for the practical settlement of international differences.... If you lose, you are annihilated. If you win, you stand only to lose. War contains now only the germ of double suicide.'' If he were alive today, would MacArthur support the MX? ANNE M.

871-> BOGUS SECTIONS OF TIMES GIVEN TO NEWSSTANDS
Thousands of copies of a pamphlet designed to look like a section of The New York Times were distributed to some Manhattan newsstands Saturday night, but dealers and Times circulation officials said yesterday that few of the pamphlets had actually been inserted and sold with the paper. In a front-page notice to readers in late editions yesterday, The Times said that the pamphlet, bearing the title ''Profiles of the Times,'' was unauthorized and fraudulent. John D. Pomfret, executive vice president and general manager of The Times, said yesterday, ''We intend to pursue vigorously an investigation of this outrage in consultation with law- enforcement authorities.'' He added: ''As soon as we were alerted last night by our drivers to the appearance of the fraudulent publication, we began contacting newsdealers to warn them against inserting it in The Times. A mimeographed warning was also attached to the main news section and sports section of papers being delivered to dealers. Our drivers were sent out on special pickups to collect the bogus sections, and we are continuing to do that through Monday.'' Pamphlet Called 'a Total Lie' The 12-page pamphlet, using typefaces similar to The Times's, contained articles attacking Roy M. Cohn, the lawyer. One article was a purported interview of Mr. Cohn by Barbara Walters that both said had been fabricated. Other articles contained references to such people as Mayor Koch and Lewis E. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative candidate for Governor. Mr. Cohn condemned what he said were ''outrageous and false statements,'' and called the pamphlet ''a total lie from start to finish.'' Mr. Lehrman, when he appeared yesterday afternoon on the ABC television program ''This Week With David Brinkley'' with his opponent, Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, was asked about the pamphlet by Mr. Brinkley. Mr. Lehrman responded: ''We don't know who did it. We do know that it was a citywide, perhaps even a statewide, personal attack upon me by someone who obviously wanted to denigrate my campaign, my personality. It was clearly a personal attack against me. It had nothing to do with ideas or the issues. In fact it has been said to have been one of a kind. So outrageous a personal attack has never occurred in an election in New York State politics.'' Responding on the same program, Mr. Cuomo said: ''No, I haven't seen it nor do I know anything about it. I do know that Lew was not the only victim - that a very good friend of mine, Mayor Koch, was also victimized, as was Roy Cohn, an attorney who apparently has been the subject of this kind of attack before. I haven't seen it. I don't know anything about it. Obviously neither of us is attached to it, but it went way beyond Mr. Lehrman.'' Describing how the pamphlets were distributed, one newsdealer, Tony Lettich, who works at a newsstand at 86th Street and Broadway, said that six bundles of the pamphlets had been delivered to his stand between 6 and 6:30 P.M. by three men in a black van. ''They told me this was a supplement to The Times and should be put in the Sunday papers,'' he said.

872-> BRITISH CREDIT CARD NOW BUYS ANTIQUES
Michael Davis, who has built a career dusting cobwebs off the British antiques business by streamlining the shipping process, has developed a credit card. It allows foreign buyers, both dealers and private customers, to purchase antiques and then pay for them on delivery. The credit card, called Passport, is honored by 1,500 antiques dealers in Britain. Mr. Davis is discussing with a leading British auction house the possibility of enabling American buyers to make purchases with the card at its auctions. Before the introduction of Passport most antiques dealers in Britain were not equipped to offer credit-card purchases because it was too costly. Auction houses normally demand payment on the spot, although in recent years they have been offering credit to dealers. ''British antiques dealers, being so hard up, needed to be able to offer credit among their services,'' said Mr. Davis, who has been in the United States seeking some of the $12.5 million line of credit he says he will need for the card. ''We really wanted to make it easy for buyers to come to Britain.'' To obtain Passport one fills out an application form. ''There is no credit limit,'' Mr. Davis said, although credit is checked carefully through banks and Dun & Bradstreet. Card holders are charged a fee of $90, which includes the first year's annual subscription of $35. Interest on balances due is charged at the rate of 1 percent a month. Some 5,000 cards have been issued since August, 80 percent in the United States. Passport also offers shipping services, including consolidation, packing, insurance, customs formalities and delivery at the other end. Michael Davis (Shipping) Ltd. is the agent for these services. Mr. Davis, who began shipping antiques abroad 10 years ago, has yearly revenues of $20 million. Shipping costs run 10 to 15 percent of sales costs. With Passport buyers avoid foreign-currency transactions by paying their bills in dollars and do not pay until the goods are received. Dealers who accept the card are charged a 2.5 percent service fee, considerably below that required by major credit cards. For information on Passport write to 29 East 61st Street, New York, N.Y. 10021 or call 212-751-8891; outside New York City the toll-free number is 800-223-1087.

He was a defensive back who appeared in 61 games, intercepted eight passes for 111 yards and an average of 13.9 yards. At Harvard, from which he graduated in 1966, he played both offense and defense from 1963 to 1965. He still holds the Ivy League record for the longest pass-interception return for a touchdown, 104 yards, against Cornell in 1964. QUESTION: How many no-hit games have involved the New York Yankees? How many of those occurred at Yankee Stadium? The Yankees have been involved in 13 no-hit games, of which seven were hurled by New York pitchers, including Don Larsen's perfect World Series game, and six by opposing pitchers. Eight of those 13 games took place at Yankee Stadium. QUESTION: What colleges did Pete Maravich, Austin Carr and Rick Mount attend? What were their career basketball scoring statistics at college? Their point averages for each season? Who holds the record for the highest point average in a season? Maravich played three seasons for Louisiana State (1967-70); in 83 games, he scored 1,387 field goals and 893 free throws for 3,667 points, and an average of 44.2 a game, each of those figures being a major-college record. Carr, in three seasons at Notre Dame (1968-71), appeared in 74 games and finished with 1,017; 526; 2,560 and 34.6. Mount, in three seasons at Purdue (1967-70), played in 72 games and finished with 910; 503; 2,323 and 32.3. Freshmen were not eligible for varsity basketball when they played. Maravich's seasonal averages were 43.8, 44.2 and 44.5, the last being the major-college one-season record. Carr: 22.0, 38.1 and 37.9. Mount: 28.4, 33.3, 35.4. QUESTION: Have there been any National Football League games in which the attendance exceeded 100,000? Yes. The two Super Bowl games at Pasadena, Calif., for example. On Jan. 9, 1977, Oakland beat Minnesota, 32-14, before 103,438 fans, and on Jan. 20, 1980, Pittsburgh defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 31-19, before 103,985. QUESTION: Please explain how a boxer's reach is measured? The traditional method is to have a fighter stretch out both arms sideways and to measure him from finger tips to finger tips. QUESTION: Which players' numbers have been retired on the Pittsburgh Pirates, the St. Louis Cardinals and the Boston Red Sox? Pittsburgh: Bill Meyer (1), Willie Stargell (8), Pie Traynor (20), Roberto Clemente (21), Honus Wagner (33) and Danny Murtaugh (40). St. Louis: Stan Musial (6), Dizzy Dean (17), Lou Brock (20) and Bob Gibson (45). Boston: Ted Williams (9). QUESTION: Where and in what year did the sport of paddle tennis originate? In 1898, the Rev. Frank Peer Beal devised the game while assigned to a church in Albion, Mich. He was interested in creating a sport for children who would eventually turn to tennis, so he reduced the dimensions of a tennis court in half, to 18 feet by 39 feet. In later years, an adult-sized paddle tennis court was created. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Question Box is a regular feature of Sports@Monday.

874-> ABROAD AT HOME; AN END TO HATE
It is hard for outsiders to appreciate what many Israelis feel as Menachem Begin and Ariel Sharon corrupt the values of their country, turning it to the politics of militarism and hate. The official propaganda is effective, and no friend of Israel wants to hear bad news. But now an Israeli has expressed his anguish in words that burn through the propaganda and the wishful thinking. Jacobo Timerman, who survived torture by the Argentine regime and made it to Israel, kept a journal of his reflections on the war in Lebanon. The New Yorker has just published two installments; a book will follow. No one who reads it can fail to understand the urgency of the threat to Israel: the threat from within. ''The operation that became a war,'' Mr. Timerman calls the Lebanese invasion. From the beginning it was built on lies, its objectives concealed, its costs suffered without justification. He quotes the parents of Israeli soldiers who fell in this political war, and their words are hard to bear. The invasion was first said to be necessary to stop P.L.O. shelling of the Galilee; in fact, as Mr. Timerman writes, Galilee villagers were quieter ''than they had been for years.'' Then it was the threat of shelling that had to be removed. On June 8, the third day, Prime Minister Begin told the Knesset: ''If we achieve a line of 25 miles north of our border, then our work is done. All the fighting will end.'' But it did not end. Beirut was bombed, refugee camps flattened. Why? The concealed objective, Mr. Timerman says, was political: to destroy Palestinian nationalism. And it was built on years of indoctrination: the depiction of Palestinians as ''terrorists,'' a people with a rootless, almost criminal identity. Israeli soldiers, as they fight the war, discover that Palestinians are human beings - children, women, young men who like themselves ''take pride in their identity.'' Mr. Begin says that Israeli forces are under orders to be humane, but the soldiers know that the widening war in fact kills women and children - they do not know the reason for the war. ''The Israeli Army has lost something more than talent and resources,'' Mr. Timerman writes in the fifth week of the war. ''It has lost credibility, the deepest reason for its effectiveness: the conviction of each soldier that nothing about the causes and objectives of a war was hidden from him.'' But there is another side to that loss of certainty. The soldiers ask questions, and in that Mr. Timerman sees hope. For they may learn what their country is suffering from the policy of hate and fear - the policy of blindness to the Palestinian reality. ''The deterioration that is occurring in the social fabric of our country,'' Mr. Timerman writes, ''cannot be halted if we don't take to heart the true character of the Palestinian problem.... The alternative our government offers, no matter how it masks it, is to continue repressing the Palestinian people until we destroy their will to live and liquidate their national identity.'' In repressing the Palestinians, Israel burdens itself. The absorption of the West Bank, which proceeds in the teeth of Camp David, ''demands social and economic effort that is not only bleeding the country but chaining future Israeli generations to its defense.'' And there is the psychological cost. ''What kind of normality can there be when nearly 3.5 million Jews are prepared to turn nearly two million Palestinians into second-class citizens, with all the cultural, social and economic degradation this means?'' Mr. Timerman writes with the authority of a survivor, a man whose faith as Jew and a Zionist was tested in the fires of anti-Semitism. He cannot be put off by the tactic of labeling anyone who criticizes Mr. Begin's policy an anti-Semite. His criticism is the more compelling because it is directed not only at Mr. Begin and Mr. Sharon. He condemns the silence of Jewish leaders in the Diaspora, who allow themselves to be manipulated by Mr. Begin. He condemns the folly of the Palestinians, their reliance on terror and military fantasies. If there is to be hope now, Mr. Timerman says, Palestinian leaders must abandon their strategy of rejecting Israel. ''They will have to learn to survive on the basis of dignity in sorrow, on the message of the tragedy, on the morality of the victim - all of them attributes that previously belonged to the Jews and now belong to the Palestinians.'' And Israelis will have to learn that Palestinian identity cannot be destroyed without injury to the destroyer. For the two peoples are bound together. ''After more than 30 years, after several wars, after unutterable sufferings, the actors remain the same, and are in the same place. We remain, Israelis and Palestinians, the same dying people.... ''Only one new opportunity has emerged (from the war): the opportunity for mutual recognition of the two peoples.... Peace is the only opportunity.''

875-> 2 CONNECTICUT CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR DIFFER ON STATE OF THE STATE
The candidates for Governor have met in debates four times, and William A. O'Neill, the Democratic incumbent, and Lewis B. Rome, the Republican challenger, have differed on almost all issues, reflecting their contradicting views on the state of the state. Mr. O'Neill said in a debate Saturday that he should be elected because ''the State of Connecticut, the good old State of Connecticut, is in darned good shape.'' Mr. Rome said, ''Connecticut is not a well-managed state, and under Bill O'Neill, it doesn't have the capacity to be well managed.'' The debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters here. Mr. O'Neill, who took office on New Year's Eve, 1980, on the resignation of Ella T. Grasso, has drawn liberally from her record in describing why he should be elected to a full four-year term. Connecticut's level of unemployment, below the national statistics since 1975, is the point he stresses most often. Mr. Rome, however, has focused on several incidents of mismanagement and apparent corruption. One is a year-old case against Arthur Powers, who was appointed by Mrs. Grasso to be Commissioner of Transportation and who was accused of using the office for personal benefit. Other employees of the department have been charged with bid-rigging and receiving bribes, but no cases have been tried yet. Papers made public in the case show that one defendant carried contributions between a contractor and the Democratic Party, and although there was nothing illegal about this, Mr. Rome has been emphasizing the case. Neither the courts nor the debates have yet established the full gravity of the case. Mr. Rome has also cited several errors by the State Department of Education in calculating the amount of aid due to local school districts. Both candidates were evasive about one subject: new taxes. The growth in revenues from existing state taxes is expected to provide a large part of the money needed in the next fiscal year, but authorities independent of the candidates have estimated that nearly $200 million may be needed from new sources. Neither Mr. O'Neill nor Mr. Rome has proposed specific solutions. Until he took office 22 months ago, Mr. O'Neill, 52 years old, was Lieutenant Governor, and before that he was state party chairman and the majority leader in the House of Representatives, positions with little statewide public exposure. Except on a ticket with the late Mrs. Grasso, he has never run for office outside the East Hampton constituency that sent him to the House. In his effort to build a statewide following, Mr. O'Neill has paid for advertisements filmed in the East Hampton tavern he owns. Mr. Rome, a 49-year-old lawyer, served as Mayor of Bloomfield from 1965 to 1968 and entered the State Senate in 1971. As Republican fortunes waxed and waned, he served as majority leader and then minority leader in that body, leaving to seek his party's nomination for Governor in 1978. He ended up running for Lieutenant Governor, facing Mr. O'Neill for that office.

877-> CITY'S ELECTROSHOCK VOTE AFFECTING TREATMENT
Psychiatrists in Berkeley, Calif., were making arrangements yesterday for four patients undergoing electroshock therapy to get the treatment in hospitals in other California cities, according to a spokesman for the hospital where they have been treated. The plans were required by an unusual referendum passed by Berkeley voters Tuesday banning the use of electroshock therapy in Berkeley. Meanwhile, officials of the American Psychiatric Association in Washington, reflecting the concern among some members of the medical profession, were discussing possible legal action to challenge the Berkeley referendum. Berkeley voters supported the ban 25,380 to 15,765, or 61.7 percent to 38.2 percent. The ban rules that use of electroshock therapy, a treatment for severe depression, is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $500 and six months in jail. It is rare for voters to make a specific medical therapy illegal. Author Is Pleased With Outcome The author of the ballot question, Ted Chabasinski, an activist for the rights of mental patients, said he was ''delighted'' with the vote. He predicted the victory would provoke ''a lot more focus on shock treatment around the country.'' He said his group, Coalition to Stop Electroshock, would consider seeking to place a similar ban on the ballot statewide. John Blamphin, a spokesman for the American Psychiatric Association, said that his group would decide by next week whether to go to court. Because California has a state law regulating electroshock therapy, Mr. Blamphin said, ''There is a question if Berkeley as a local jurisdiction can go further and ban it.'' Mr. Blamphin said the psychiatric group might take legal action because it believed that ''patients ought to have access to all available medically accepted technology and forms of treatment without having to go to another city to get it.'' Referral to Others a Problem Another concern was the disruption in care that might result when Berkeley psychiatrists had to refer their patients to colleagues elsewhere. Rose Poirot, a spokesman for Herrick Hospital, the only one where electroshock therapy has been performed in Berkeley, said that the hospital would ''comply with the law as soon as it becomes official,'' meaning after action by the City Council. The earliest date would be Tuesday. Four patients now are being given electroshock treatment at Herrick, two as outpatients. Their last treatments at Herrick hospital will be this week, Miss Poirot said. Electroshock therapy has been a cause of dispute because some psychiatrists and patients contend it can cause permanenent brain damage and memory loss.

878-> 4 MINOR PARTIES FIELDING CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR
The candidates of four minor parties will appear on the ballot Nov. 2 in New York, with two of them seeking to elect statewide candidates for the first time. Two of the parties, the Unity Party and the New Alliance Party, have organized within the last two years, both in opposition to Mayor Koch's re-election. The other two, the Socialist Workers Party and the Free Libertarian Party, have been politically active for years. The Unity Party is an amalgam of small community groups, tenants' rights groups and labor unionists that came together a year ago to oppose the re-election of Mayor Koch and support the mayoral candidacy of Assemblyman Frank Barbaro of Brooklyn. Joseph Hyler, spokesman for the Committee to Elect Unity Coalition Candidates, said that they were encouraged by the 180,000 votes that Mr. Barbaro got as a Unity Party candidate and wanted to see if the party could grow around such issues as affirmative action, support of mass transit, affordable housing and full employment. Their goal is to obtain the 50,000 votes necessary in a statewide election to qualify a party for permanent ballot status. Without that status a party must, under state law, get 20,000 valid signatures on petitions every time they want to run a candidate. The Unity Party feels it needs permanent ballot status because, according to Mr. Hyler, ''people are interested in independent politics.'' At the same time, said Mr. Hyler, the party seeks to cross-endorse ''progressive Democrats'' and persuade the Democratic Party to take more progressive positions. While they generally support the Democratic-Liberal candidate for Governor, Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the party is running its own candidate for Governor, Jane Benedict of Manhattan. She is the head of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a vocal tenants group that was among the original members of the Unity Coalition. For Lieutenant Governor, the party is running Angela Gilliam, a political anthropology professor from Manhattan. The party has no other candidates for statewide office. The New Alliance Party began with a 1979 petition drive to recall Mayor Koch. Its first candidate was State Senator Joseph Galiber, who ran unsuccessfully for Bronx borough president in 1981. The New Alliance Party subsequently joined with the Unity Party in supporting Mr. Barbaro. The New Alliance Party split with the Unity Coalition over the issue of cross-endorsements of Democratic candidates. The party, said Nancy Ross, 39 years old of Manhattan, its coordinator and candidate for Governor, does not seek permanent ballot status. Rather, she said, it hopes to alter ''the balance of state politics'' by running against liberal Democrats who start to ''drift to the right.'' Her running mate is Lenora Fulani, 32 years old, a psychologist from Brooklyn. The Free Libertarian Party is the New York State chapter of the national Libertarian Party, which was founded in 1972 and has frequently appeared on the ballot in local, statewide and national elections. The party's presidential candidate in 1980, Ed Clark, got five million votes, 52,000 from New York State. John H. Northrup, the party's candidate for Governor, said that that showing convinced the party that it can get the votes needed for permanent ballot status. To that end, the national organization has earmarked $110,000 for Mr. Northrup's campaign - more than five times the amount it spent in 1978. Mr. Northrup, 31 years old, an accountant from Syracuse, stresses that only his program calling for a phased, four-year elimination of the state income tax qualifies as a ''real'' tax-cutting program. New Libertarian Candidates The party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor is David Hoesly, 39 years old, a research engineer from Rochester. Dolores Grande, a Manhattan lawyer, is running for attorney general; William P. McMillen, 39 years old, an accountant from Clifton Park, for comptroller, and James J. McKeown, a Binghamton accountant, for United States senator. The Socialist Workers Party is seeking to ''mobilize the power of all working people,'' said Muhammed Oliver, state campaign chairman. Its platform calls for scaling down military spending, eliminating unemployment and establishing the beginnings of a Socialist economy. The party's candidate for Governor is Diane Wang, 34 years old, a garment-center worker. Peter Thierjung, 27 years old, a sheet-metal fabricator, is running for Lieutenant Governor, and Steven Wattenmaker, 34 years old, an unemployed pipefitter, for United States senator.

879-> CONCERT: MAHLER'S NINTH
HIS arms hanging suspended from shoulders, his back straight and leaning forward, his hands caressing the air - Herbert von Karajan's conducting was an image of the sound itself as he led the Berlin Philharmonic in Mahler's Ninth Symphony on Saturday night, in his last appearance here this season. The musical musculature was as clear and precise as the shape of the conductor's gestures, the timbre as finely detailed as the layered motions of his fingers, the tempo as supple as his breath. For one who has only heard Mr. von Karajan on recording, the sight was remarkable. His orchestral sound has an unmistakable physicality; it takes place in space as much as in time. But it also seems disembodied, avoiding the indulgence of dance or embrace for a luminous precision. That was how his arms were used, connected unmistakably to a physical being, while articulating their own world. Mr. Karajan created an almost aerial vision of the Mahler symphony. He did not ramble through the grotesque lander of the second movement or the clipped madness of the third, but proceeded over them, half in observation, half in distraught sympathy. What could sound maudlin and banal in other hands, sounded unavoidable in these. The outer movements, with their obsessive repetitions, cycles of climax and frustration and intermittent daintiness, were brooding metaphysical journeys, leading, finally, to a crystalline transluscence. It was as if the neurotic compulsions of the music had been treated to analytical surgery, its skeletal logic made clear. But Mr. Karajan's was no cerebral exercise. It was music-making rare to these shores, a dissection at once physical and ethereal. And in the clarity of its understanding, it left a greater feeling of mystery.

880-> CURRENCY MARKETS; Dollar Declines Broadly While Gold Advances
The dollar fell to a three-month low against the Japanese yen and lost ground against other major currencies yesterday on speculation that American interest rates would fall further. Gold prices rose, winding up at $411.50 late in New York, up $7 from Tuesday. The dollar began the day by tumbling to a three-month low of 252.90 yen in Tokyo, down from Monday's close of 256.25 yen. Japanese markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. In United States trading, the dollar fell further to 250.50 yen, down sharply from Tuesday's late rate of 256.70 yen. The British pound, which fell below $1.59 on Monday, hitting a sixyear low against the dollar, rebounded against the dollar yesterday during European trading. In London, the British pound edged up to $1.5995 from $1.5963 on Tuesday. But the pound declined relative to the West German mark, Swiss and French francs. In later trading in the United States, the pound weakened again, to $1.5870 from Tuesday's $1.5965. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday, included: 2.5277 West German marks, down from 2.5517; 2.1677 Swiss francs, down from 2.1962; 7.1425 French francs, down from 7.2145, and 1.2258 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2266. Late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday included: 2.5180 West German marks, down from 2.5390; 7.1150 French francs, down from 7.1725; 2.1580 Swiss francs, down from 2.1870; and 1.2317 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2270. Gold edged up 5 cents an ounce in Hong Kong, to close at $403.59. It later climbed to $410.875 in London from $407.375 on Tuesday, and gained $3 in Zurich, to $408.75. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $6.40, to $411.20. In later New York trading, bullion was bid at $411.50 at Republic National Bank, up from $404.50 late Tuesday.

881-> FARM GROUPS SKEPTICAL ON GRAIN OFFER TO SOVIET
Farm organizations, grain traders and the commodities markets reacted skeptically today to President Reagan's offer on Friday to sell 23 million tons of grain to the Soviet Union. Experts said they did not expect Russian purchases to exceed last year's 14.8 million tons. Noting that the Russians have not bought any American wheat since November 1981, James F. Frahm, director of planning for the United States Wheat Associates, a marketing group, said he doubted that the offer would change the picture much. ''This is the Soviet reaction to trade sanctions against Poland,'' he said. ''They're making no secret of the fact that they're going to show the U.S. that they aren't dependent on this country for food and that no sanctions can make them change their actions.'' Corn, worldwide sales of which are dominated by American farmers, constituted most of Moscow's grain purchases here last year. Wheat is readily available elsewhere and the Soviet Union, the world's largest agricultural importer, last week bought 7.6 million tons from Canada. A week earlier, Moscow negotiated an agreement to buy about a million tons of wheat from France. A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Trade, Gene Podrazik, said of the market reaction: ''It rained all over Reagan's announcement on Friday,'' adding, ''The lack of activity on the floor today tells you how insignificant it was.'' Prices for grain and corn fell considerably on Friday and recovered weakly today. The President's offer of 23 million tons of grain was 15 million tons more than the maximum amount the Soviet Union can buy without Administration approval under an existing grain agreement covering the fiscal year that started Oct. 1. Last year, after the 16-month grain embargo imposed by President Carter was lifted, the Soviets also were offered 23 million tons, but bought only 13.9 million. The rest of the 45 million tons that Moscow imported came from other nations. Agricultural experts said that a provision in the President's offer that requires cash payment from the Russians would be a strong deterrent to Soviet purchases because the country's earnings from mineral and metals exports, particularly gold, have fallen drastically. Credits are available for grain purchases elsewhere, as they were with the recent Canadian and French purchases. In addition, the strong dollar and record crops in many countries have held down American exports of grain and other farm crops this year. For example, Italy and France became net exporters of wheat this year. In the first 11 months of the fiscal year 1982, which ended Sept. 30, farm exports were down 10 percent, to $36.7 billion, practically guaranteeing that farm exports would suffer their first year-to-year decline since 1969. Bleak Picture Outlined D. Gale Johnson, head of the economics department at the University of Chicago, said that the picture has seldom been worse for grain exports. ''Markets that were growing are declining. The Soviet Union is about as big as it can get. And the Common Market, instead of being an importer, is pushing all the grain it can out of that backdoor. None of it is good for the American farmer.'' According to Cargill, a large privately held grain company, the value of exports to the Eastern bloc, once an important growth market for agricultural products, tumbled 54 percent in the first half of the year. For Latin America and the Caribbean, the decline was 33 percent. In all developing nations, the drop was 18 percent. From 1978 to 1981, United States food exports to the developing countries grew at an annual rate of 22 percent.

883-> WITH A LITTLE GROWING EXPERTISE, COLUMNEAS ADD A TOUCH OF THE TROPICS
Tovah Martin is a writer and specialist in indoor plants. For too long, columneas were considered collector's items, difficult for the amateur to grow. But this impression can only be blamed on ignorance for many a more fastidious plant is eagerly invited indoors. The end to columnea's obscurity began in the early 1950's when two botanists from Cornell, Robert E. Lee and Harold E. Moore, Jr., created a series of columnea hybrids that were easy to grow. Retailers were greatly impressed. Within a few years not only were the new hybrids widely grown, but their parents were appearing on the market. A rush of cross-breeding followed and columneas finally realized well-deserved fame. Columneas inhabit the tropical regions of Mexico, Central America, Bolivia and northern Brazil. They were introduced into Europe in the mid-1700's and are named for Fabio Colonna. This honor was bestowed for a landmark compilation of botanical data published in 1592, the first of its kind illustrated with copper plates. Certainly columneas exhibit many qualities to recommend them as indoor plants. With a little expertise, a tidy specimen can be maintained. The blossoms, which resemble tiny dragonheads, are sizable and colorful. Most species exhibit flowers of equal or larger size than those of hybrids and the blossoms display comparably sharp and brilliant colors. Columnea species set buds in autumn. In the native lands, columneas are subjected to substantially lowered nighttime temperatures at this time of year, often a 10-degree drop from day to evening. In cultivation the plants react favorably when given an autumnal diversity in climate. At this time, indoor thermostats may be set to 55 degrees at night as buds form. During the winter a more moderate 65 degree night-time temperature should be maintained. Columnea microphylla, with its lank chains of tiny, rounded leaves, requires a marked drop in temperature to set cherry red flowers. C. hirta, an impressive winter bloomer, bears bright orange blossoms with the same cooling-off period. C. hirta grows as a fuller specimen than most species. The furry-leaved stems form an oval ball. C. Mortonii, a species from Panama, displays fire engine red blossoms encircling tufts of velvety green leaves in late winter. C. gloriosa, and its even more stunning cultivar, Superba, seem to be affected more by daylength than temperature when setting fall and winter buds. The long chains of soft foliage, appearing in light green in C. gloriosa and of a maroon hue in Superba and their sizable blossoms make this pair easily the choicest. From each hooded, vermillion and yellow throated flower, a long white style protrudes, much like a dragon bearing its fangs. Most new hybrids are everblooming and require no cooling-off period. Notable amongst them are Bonfire, Orange Fire and Early Bird which bloom in combinations of orange and yellow throated flowers. Campfire offers red-tipped flowers which blend into a yellow tube. These new hybrids should be the first for beginners since they tolerate less than perfect conditions. In the tropics columneas grow as epiphytes where they straddle rotten tree trunks or are tucked in the crevices of boulders, perching anywhere that vegetable debris has accumulated. Frequent precipitation furnishes roots with a continual supply of moisture and excellent drainage assures they never stand in water. These conditions can be duplicated with a porous, well-drained soil mixture of equal parts perlite, peat moss, coarse sand and compost. Perlite is preferable to vermiculite because it affords better aeration. The columnea's cascading habit lends itself as a hanging plant. The most commonly used container is a clay pan. Since columnea roots grow horizontally rather than vertically, a shallower pan leaves no unpenetrated soil. Keep them tightly potted to encourage flowering. In the rain forests where columneas dwell, humidity remains constantly high. Providing an atmosphere of at least 50 percent humidity may prove difficult. Shallow pans of water to evaporate over heat sources will help. Another solution is to rest pots on a damp pebble and water tray. A humidifier remains the most effective means of increasing moisture. Most columneas share a tendency toward delicate, easily water damaged foliage. Misting can be detrimental. Allow plants to dry out between soakings and then only use tepid water taking care not to wet foliage. Droplets of cold water on leaves will often cause mottling, shrivelling and sometimes denuding, especially if the plant is subjected to bright light. Columneas are one of the few groups of flowering plants which can be grown in an eastern or northern exposure and thrive. Fluorescent lights are also suitable, 12 to 14 hours of artificial light daily. Pruning and propagating is possible in any season. Prune back old stems severely in spring, especiallly on winter blooming species to encourage new growth. Root cuttings in moist sand or soil. Cuttings are self-branching and need not be ''pinched.'' Another method of propagation is to hand-pollinate flowers to set seed formed in white, yellow, or pink ornamental berries. When the fruit is soft and ripe, collect the seed and sow by sprinkling lightly on the surface of fine soil. Germination is in approximately two weeks. Columneas are commonly confused with another member of the Gesneriad Family, Aeschynanthus or lipstick plant. These plants bear many similarities including shiny, paired leaves and brightly colored tubular flowers. Although aeschynanthus were introduced into Europe a century after the first columnea, they won instant acclaim as house plants and so enjoy a longer history. When not showing flowers, the plant displays the ornamental calyx in terminal clusters. Few foes pester Gesneriads. Occasionally mealybugs infest the plants, but these can be easily eradicated with a cotton swab dipped in rubbing alcohol. Cyclamen mite is a troublesome pest on columneas, its presence is detected by malformed and twisted new growth. An application of kelthane destroys these insects before they deface the plants.

884-> WIN YOUR OWN GLEN COVE PASS
FOR $10, you too can play The Game of Glen Cove, a Monopoly-style board game sponsored by the city's Chamber of Commerce in which the luckiest ''chance card,'' labeled ''Soviet Mission,'' allows the bearer to pay no taxes, pick up a beach permit at City Hall and then proceed to Morgan Park - where the Russians were barred from swimming last summer. On the board, a property next to City Hall is identified as the Soviet Mission by a hammer and sickle. Credit for putting the Soviet Mission on the game goes to Dr. Robert Finley, president of the Chamber of Commerce and superintendent of the city schools. The idea for a board game based on Glen Cove was proposed last spring when the chamber received promotional material from Michael Glenn Productions of Allen Park, Mich., which will manufacture the game. Alan Koenig of Glen Cove, who describes himself as a ''self-employed promoter,'' organized the game's financing, selling the board's 36 properties for $100 and $200 to area retail and industrial businesses whose names will appear on the board. Profits from the game, estimated at 50 percent of the gross, will go to the city's Chamber of Commerce, the Booster Club, the P.T.A. and the high school R.O.T.C. Mary Ann Regis, assistant director of the Chamber of Commerce, said 1,500 games had been ordered and would be delivered before Christmas. Persons wishing to buy a game may call 676-6666.

885-> WHERE OYSTERS ABOUND
Wherever you turn in St. Marys County you find a midden of oyster shells. To Bob Shaw, the garrulous naturalist who manages the Chancellor's Point Natural History Center near St. Marys City in this historic, unpretentious, often bypassed corner of southern Maryland, the reason is simple: ''People have been eating oysters here for 10,000 years.'' Walk into this alluring world, washed by bounteous Chesapeake Bay and the briny Potomac and Patuxent Rivers less than a two-hour drive from Washington or Baltimore, and the chalky white material peeking from a corn or tobacco field or melon patch near a stately mansion will be that of the ubiquitous shell. ''We can tell from the oyster rings, which are like tree rings,'' Mr. Shaw says, ''almost what month the oysters were shucked.'' The more popular Blue Ridge Mountains and the Atlantic Coast have long deflected visitors from this peninsula, where roads end suddenly at places like Point Lookout, Point Look-in, Point No Point, Piney Point Lighthouse and Tall Timbers and where oysters may not be as plentiful as they were for whoever was eating them 10,000 years ago - but they are still abundant and good. Sometimes when the tide is low and freakish winds are blowing water into the bay from the rivers and creeks and coves, you can actually walk out and pick up oysters from the sand. Otherwise, you get them through the toils of the watermen, who use hand tongs to scoop them out of beds in shallow waters and sell them to middlemen. But if today's sojourners look elsewhere, the proximity to Washington was something that didn't escape notice of the military strategists in 1814 when the St. Marys shores on the Patuxent became the staging area for the British march on Washington and later the burning of the capital. Convenience to Washington was also behind establishment in 1943 of the Patuxent Naval Air Station at Lexington Park, where the newest aircraft are tested in flights over Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic. You shouldn't let the honky-tonk, macadam strip of bars, gas stations, fast-food eateries and shopping centers around the base color your views about the county. Go a few miles in any direction and you can step back into the 18th century - for example, at the Sotterley Plantation, which is the oldest continuously working plantation in America, a few miles downriver from Horse Landing, where the British debarked. St. Marys is oyster country. But it's also crab country, eel country, bluefish country, hog country, corn country and tobacco country. Tobacco was the big money crop for the 17th-century settlers, and it is still the money crop. Little has changed except the design of the barns where the tobacco leaves are dried. If smoking is serious, so is eating - as serious as it is in France, though a lot simpler. You see some of this in the corn-fed corpulence of the prize hogs at the County Fair, in the slurping gluttony of the Oyster Festival, in any number of crab feasts (''all you can eat for $5'') and in the old-fashioned bull roasts. Gustave Flaubert could have been describing the St. Marys County Fair when he took Madame Emma Bovary to the agricultural fair at Comices in northern France where the ''squatting hogs dug their groins into the mud'' and where the peasant women ''in blue stockings, flat shoes and rings of silver smelled of milk.'' You don't go there for French cuisine or the elegance of Continental restaurants. Instead, you hit places like Duffy's Tavern on Scotland Beach, Evans Seafood on St. George's Island, Drift Inn on State Route 6 or Copsey's on State Route 235 for oyster stew, fried oysters, crabs, crabcakes, crab soup, broiled bluefish, broiled rockfish and a pitcher of beer, all served on oil cloth or brownpaper wrappings. These are Bruegelian places where you are expected to make a pig of yourself, where shells and skeletons and exoskeletons pile up in mounds in front of you or on the floor and where you are given full leave to lick your fingers and pick your teeth. They are places the kids love, places you come back to. At Duffy's Tavern, from whose waterfront tables you might see a bugeye, dory, skipjack or pungy working the bay or a sloop on a broad reach out of Solomon's Island or Tall Timbers merely enjoying the day, an assortment of hats hangs from the ceiling. Margaret Duffy, who makes she-crab soup from her grandmother's recipe and waits on tables besides, explains: ''People leave their hats because they want to come back.'' Elisavietta Ritchie, a poet who lives on the Patuxent River, writes: ''The beach is coarse with broken shells. Each rush of surf shatters bits of fossils, barnacles and skulls from sandstone matrices.'' The county's waters also present to her in the poem ''Eel Country'' a ''driftwood dragon tressed with seaweed lace, twisted claws outstretched to split the sea'' while ''crested egrets guard their nests in bent oaks convolute with vines.'' St. Marys County, in other words, is a naturalist's, as well as a poet's, paradise. From his museum at Chancellor's Point, the naturalist Shaw picks out a 12-million year-old shark's tooth and reconstructs the Miocene marineland that used to cover the coastal plain as far inland as Washington. ''St. Marys is a fossil museum,'' he says ecstatically ''because the glacier stopped just at the edge of the county.'' There is almost a continuous record of life from the ancient lyropecten to the modern scallop, from yesterday's balanus and turritella to today's barnacle and snail. The Chancellor's Point Natural History Center shows firsthand how land, river, marine life and later people interacted. Open from dawn to dusk every day except Christmas, it is ideal for walks, picnics, school tours and swimming before or after jellyfish season, which generally runs from Independence Day to Labor Day. Everything you want to know about the harvesting of oysters, as well as the maritime history of the Patuxent River and Chesapeake Bay, meanwhile, is graphically presented at the Calvert Marine Museum on Solomon's Island, just across the Patuxent from Route 235 over a new bridge that links St. Marys with Calvert County by way of State Route 4. You can tell you're at the museum when you see the Drum Point Lighthouse, clearly visible from the Solomon's end of the bridge, an octagonal cottage on stilts. Chancellor's Point is about two miles south of St. Marys City, which may have been envisioned as a ''metropolis'' when Leonard Calvert and his band of 200 Roman Catholic colonists landed there in 1634 but is today little bigger than it was in the 17th century. The original village, which is being dug out by archeologists, was the fourth permanent settlement in English America and the first capital of Maryland. It was established during the bloody religious wars in Europe as a center of religious tolerance, where Roman Catholics would not be persecuted. Men of different faiths sat as equals in the Maryland Assembly until the end of the 17th century. Calvert's settlers sailed across the Atlantic in two barques or pinnaces, known as the Ark and the Dove, and a replica of the Dove lies in the water just behind the reconstructed State House. Robert J. Hurry, a young history graduate of St. Marys College, shows people around the incredibly compact vessel at 50 cents a head, 25 cents for children. You can't leave St. Marys City without also learning about Godiah Spray and his 17th-century tobacco farm. The reconstructed farmhouse and barns, inside a zigzag log fence intended to keep out undesirables, are just down Rosecroft Road about a mile from the State House. Godiah Spray worked his land in the 1650's and 1660's. He was strongly Roman Catholic. The seven members of his little community included indentured and newly freed servants. His wife, Rebecca, served hoe cakes from the brick fireplace below the wattle and daub chimney. Life of the Sprays is re-enacted by players provided by Living History Productions of the Maryland Committee for Humanities as what coordinator Burton K. Kummerow calls ''historical soap opera.'' It's fun. You actually taste the hoe cakes, see where the family slept, get a sense of the hardships of the frontier. Living History is big and promises to get bigger over the next two years as preparations are made for celebrating the 350th anniversary of the founding of the colony. To Mr. Kummerow, St. Marys City is a ''living museum.'' The whole county is called by others ''America's best-kept secret.'' The people living there like it that way. Inside the State House you meet Charles Cannetti, born in Manhattan, retired from the Air Force and now a member of the St. Marys County Creative Arts Forum, which produces plays and musicals during the summer at an outdoor theater on the wharf by the Dove. ''I wouldn't live any place else,'' he says. ''It's tranquil. There's no industry, so you can breathe clean air, and if you like watersports you've got them all. If you go out all day in a boat, they don't pack you in the way they do at Sheepshead Bay.'' The St. Marys climate is mild, which means that the marigolds and coxcombs bloom well into the fall around the historic mansions with names like Sotterley, Cremona, Mulberry Fields, Tudor Hall, West St. Marys Manor and Charlotte Hall. This unusual cluster of fine houses recalls several centuries of gracious living, and the finest of them, Sotterley, which immediately transports you into the way of life of a Maryland gentleman during the first quarter of the 18th century, is open to the public. From the gardens of herbs, vegetables and flowers, you can look across lawns and then fields dotted with grazing sheep sloping down to the Patuxent River, and you think of Turner and Constable landscapes. From the 100-foot columned, flagstone terrace a string quartet plays Mozart several times a summer. Sotterley is like a smaller scale Mount Vernon, but warmer and less austere. It was and still is a plantation. One slave house remains intact of the row that lined the dirt road down to the Patuxent wharf, where hogsheads of tobacco were rolled onto boats for export overseas. The elegant, paneled rooms of the mansion are open to the public (June 1 to Sept. 30, and other times by appointment - phone 301-373-2280), and tours are intimate, informal. ''The emphasis is on making the visitor feel a guest,'' says Lisette Day, a docent. Especially notable: the shell alcoves flanking the fireplace in the Great Hall and the Chinese Chippendale staircase, one of the few of that genre to survive from Colonial times. Upstairs in a study is the ''partners' desk'' once used by J. P. Morgan, paternal grandfather of the last owner, Mabel Satterlee Ingalls, who deeded the property to the Sotterley Mansion Foundation, which now manages it. J. P. Morgan sailed his 110-foot Corsair up the Patuxent to visit the mansion. Others drive Route 235, turning east on State Route 245 at the Hollywood crossroads. Many great houses have a resident ghost, and Sotterley is no exception. It is said that at night one can hear the horse of George Plater 5th galloping up a pebbled path to reclaim the mansion that in 1822 he gambled away in a dice game.

888-> WEEK IN BUSINESS; DOW STAYS AHEAD IN HEAVY TRADING
The Dow Jones industrial average finished at 1031.46, a gain of 38.36 points for the week. But a rally attempt to reach a new closing high ran out of steam late in the week. The New York Stock Exchange had its second heaviest trading week on record. The G.N.P. grew a weak 0.8 percent in the third quarter, off from the 2.1 percent growth rate last quarter. The money supply rose $3.2 billion to $468.3 billion for the week ending Oct.20, up from a revised total of $465 billion the previous week. Common Market nations agreed to reduce their steel exports to the U.S., by about one million tons from the 1981 level, under a threeyear pact announced by President Reagan. Housing starts rose 14.4 percent in September, the best gain in more than a year. Personal spending rose 1 percent in September, the third monthly gain in a row. Personal income edged up 0.3 percent. Factory utilization dropped to 69.1 percent in September, the lowest rate since the recession in 1974-75. New orders for durable goods rose 0.2 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted $73.25 billion. Chemical Bank cut its prime rate a half point, to 11.5 percent. Bache was fined $400,000 by the New York Stock Exchange for permitting the Hunt brothers to speculate so heavily in silver, endangering the firm's survival and failing to give a timely notice of the silver crisis that had developed in early 1980. An S.E.C. report, meanwhile, criticized six brokerage firms and the Big Board for their roles in the crisis. Three senior officials at Hutton joined Bache, surprising Wall Street and following, by three months, the appointment of Hutton's president, George L. Ball, to head Bache. President Reagan said the Agriculture Department would spend $1.5 billion in the next three years to buoy farm exports. The 1982 Nobel Memorial Prize for Economic Science was awarded to George J. Stigler, a University of Chicago professor. Chrysler said it would suffer a strike rather than grant wage increases sought by the United Automobile Workers after the membership rejected, by a 2 to 1 margin, Chrysler's latest offer. Union Carbide's income fell 48.8 percent in the third quarter and Philip Morris' was up 20.3 percent. Trans World Corporation and UAL posted a rise in profits. Among banks reporting, BankAmerica's operating income fell 13.7 percent, but Citicorp and Bankers Trust posted gains. Braniff and Pacific Southwest Airlines announced a joint venture in which P.S.A. would acquire some of Braniff's planes, operate its routes and hire some of its employees.

889-> LONDON ESPIONAGE TRIAL SPURS DEBATE IN CANADA
The London espionage trial of a Quebec economics professor has led to calls in Canada's Parliament for a fuller explanation of the case and has raised broader questions about the effectiveness of Canada's security laws. Specifically, some legislators want to know why the suspect, Hugh Hambleton, a 60-year old Laval University professor charged with passing secrets to the Soviet Union, is being tried in Britain rather than in Canada. They also want to know why officials here warned Professor Hambleton that he might face trouble if he traveled to Britain. These questions have come up amid observations that there have been no successful prosecutions for suspected breaches of Canadian security laws for 15 years. Government officials have said that answers to such questions may improperly influence the British trial. Robert Kaplan, the Solicitor General, and Mark MacGuigan, the Minister of Justice, refused to comment on an assertion this week by Mr. Hambleton's lawyer that his client had been a double agent working for the French and Canadian authorities to infiltrate the K.G.B., the Soviet state security agency. But Allan Lawrence, a Conservative Member of Parliament who was Solicitor General when the Hambleton case first broke three years ago, emphatically rejected the double agent explanation. Mr. Lawrence said that when he interviewed Mr. Hambleton, the suspect never indicated that he had worked for the Canadian Government. He said it had been his intention to charge and prosecute Mr. Hambleton for espionage, but the Conservatives had then been swept from power and replaced by the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Mr. Lawrence said on Wednesday that he believed Mr. Kaplan, his successor as Solicitor General, had not tried Mr. Hambleton because of what he said were Liberal Party policies of ''making deals'' with Canadians accused of being traitors in order to get information. Two days later, despite continuing silence in Parliament, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported that they were sending an officer to London with documents to aid the prosecution of Mr. Hambleton. This move cast doubt on the assertion that the professor had worked for Canadian intelligence, but it gave weight to criticism suggesting that Canadian laws were so hopelessly ineffective that the only way spies here could be brought to account was to have them travel abroad. Mr. Trudeau, at a news conference on Monday, said no charges had been filed against Mr. Hambleton because there had been insufficient proof to obtain a conviction under the Canadian Official Secrets Act. During questioning in Parliament Mr. Kaplan said Mr. Hambleton volunteered valuable information after the threat of prosecution was withdrawn in 1980. He also said the police advised Mr. Hambleton that he faced a ''hostile reception'' if he carried out plans to go to England for a sailing holiday. Mr. Kaplan offered no explanation why such a warning had been given to a man now charged with maintaining espionage links with Soviet agents from 1956 to 1979. Mr. Hambleton, whose parents were British and who held both Canadian and British nationality, traveled to England despite the warning, and was arrested there last June. The case has again focused attention on what some Liberal and Conservative politicians have condemned as a porous national security network, undermined by a key law that Government officials concede is inoperative. That law, the Canadian Official Secrets Act, has been denounced by two judicial commissions as being too broad in its wording to have validity. ''It covers everything and yet nothing,'' said a Justice Department official. Mr. Kaplan is seeking to replace it with new legislation as part of what he recently described as ''a general adjustment of Canada's security policy.''

890-> THE CITY; Heart Attack Fatal To Robbery Victim
A self-employed distributor of handbags and umbrellas suffered a fatal heart attack Tuesday night as he was telling two police officers that he had been abducted from outside a Brooklyn bank and robbed of about $2,000 in cash, the police said yesterday. The victim, 47-year-old Nathan Esses of 1789 East Second Street in Brooklyn's Bensonhurst section, told the police a man and a woman had overpowered him as he was about to deposit the day's receipts at a branch of the National Bank of North America at 465 Kings Highway at 8 P.M. Tuesday, Detective Ed Croissant said. The two forced Mr. Esses into his van and drove to a gas station at McDonald Avenue and Quentin Road. There, the two handcuffed him and fled with the money. Mr. Esses stopped a police car, and while describing the robbery, suffered the heart attack. He was taken to Coney Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.

891-> Peso Curbs Are Eased By Mexico
Mexico's central bank today announced a sharp devaluation of the peso, effective Monday, for transactions in the controlled market. A statement by the bank said the buying and selling rate of the peso for ''essential'' foreign payments would fall to 95 to the dollar from 50. A free-market rate for designated ''nonessential'' foreign-exchange transactions - such as to buy dollars for private travel to the United States - would also come into effect Monday. That rate, currently set at 70 pesos to the dollar, will float and be determined by supply and demand, the bank added. The statement said the exchange rate on the controlled market would be allowed to fluctuate to maintain Mexico's trade competitiveness, and it estimated the initial decline at 50 percent. According to the new regulations, the controlled rate will be applicable to most exports and imports of goods and to private and public repayment of foreign debts. The bank also announced an average 10 percent reduction in taxes on imports financed under the controlled market to make the cost of imported goods as low as possible. It also said that gold and silver markets would be reopened Monday based on international prices for both metals and the free-market exchange rate. The new regulations, which were first announced Dec. 10 by President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado, replace a two-tier system imposed last September under which a ''preferential'' rate of 50 pesos to the dollar and an ''ordinary'' rate of 70 was established. The central bank also warned that dollars would continue to be scarce, limiting private purchases to $1,000 and by companies to $5,000. It said a special exchange rate of 70 pesos to the dollar would be maintained for debts contracted before Dec. 20 to avoid company bankruptcies. But it said this rate would be allowed to slip much faster than the controlled rate to eventually end the difference in quotations between them. The extent of the devaluation of the peso in the free market will only be known when banks open Monday, but bankers said it could drop to about 130 to the dollar, or about seven-tenths of a cent, against the current ''ordinary'' rate of 70 to the dollar, or about 1.4 cents. A fall of that magnitude would put the free-market rate close to parity with the black market rate and with the dollar-exchange houses along the American border.

892-> Topics; Public Entertainments; Broadway Theater
For all lovers of drama, a list of performances enjoyed during a noon walk around Times Square: 1. On 42d Street, an old man and two life-size mannequins are seated in a raised booth under a sign that says ''Intermission.'' He is playing a guitar and singing - so softly as to be almost inaudible - Elvis Presley hits. He does not expect payment, he doesn't even seem to expect an audience and what it all means only Samuel Beckett knows. 2. On 44th Street another man, with crippled legs, is doing remarkable stunts using his wheelchair as a balancing base. Fellini would have made him famous. 3. On Seventh Avenue three small boys are tapping, rapping and passing the hat. All they need is Gene Kelly. 4. Around the corner, a tall thin woman is castigating a short fat man. ''It could have been different,'' she says. ''I could've had a big job.'' Her audience is reminded, irresistibly, of the famous line from ''On the Waterfront'': ''I could've been a contender.'' All that theater - and no waiting on line, no $40 price tag and no seat in a balcony pretending to be a mezzanine. Is there a better bargain on Broadway?

893-> T.D. STEINWAY OF PIANO MKAER
Theodore Davis Steinway, who retired in 1979 as chief engineer of Steinway & Sons, the piano manufacturer, died on Monday at his home in Llewellyn Park, N.J., after a long illness. He was 68 years old. Mr. Steinway was a great-grandson of Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg, the German immigrant who founded the concern in a Manhattan loft in 1853 and later moved it to Astoria, Queens. Like several other third- and fourth-generation members of the family, Theodore Steinway spent his entire business career with the company. He graduated from Harvard College in 1935 and became an apprentice at the Steinway factory, working in several phases of the business until he entered military service in 1941, before the start of World War II. He eventually became an intelligence officer at the headquarters of Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines. Returning to Steinway in 1946, he was placed in charge of engineering in 1947. In that capacity, he directed research and development until his retirement. He also was a director and assistant secretary of the company until 1972, when it became a division of CBS Inc. Mr. Steinway is survived by his wife, the former Josephine Seitz; a son, Theodore Alexander of Llewellyn Park; two step-daughters, Tina Steinway of New York and Tari Perlstadt of East Lansing, Mich.; two sisters, Elizabeth Chapin of New York and Lydia Cochrane of Chicago; and three brothers, John, the present chairman of the Steinway company; Henry, the retired chairman, and Frederick. The funeral will be private. A memorial service will be held at a later date.

894-> MOTHER AND SON KILLED IN FIRE
A 26-year-old woman and her 7-year-old son were killed and another son was critically injured early yesterday in a fire of suspicious origin at a Manhattan apartment building, fire officials said. The dead were identified as Marie Nieves and Martin Goytia. The other son, Jesus Goytia, 5, was listed in critical condition at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. The blaze, at 445 Audubon Avenue at West 187th Street, in the Washington Heights section, began shortly before 2 A.M. in a stairwell next to a market on the ground floor of the building, officials said. Capt. Tom Martin of the Fire Department said the staircase and second floor of the three-story building were in flames when firefighters arrived. ''It looked like someone had doused the stairs with gasoline,'' said Captain Martin. He said he and two other firefighters forced their way through the flames into the victims' third-floor apartment, directly above the market. All three victims were taken to the medical center, where the woman was pronounced dead. Both children were treated for smoke inhalation and burns, hospital officials said, but the elder child died at about 2:45 A.M. Eight firefighters were injured, none seriously.

895-> TV: 'NBC WHITE PAPER: REGAN AT MID-TERM'
IT is that time of year when television news departments feel a compulsion to subject the body politic to its annual checkup. An early entry, an ''NBC White Paper: Reagan at Mid-Term,'' can be seen tonight on NBC-TV at 10 o'clock. Three correspondents - Chris Wallace, Marvin Kalb and Mike Jensen -undertake to relate the President's actions over the last two years to his character as revealed in his youth in the Middle West, his career in Hollywood, his role as a spokesman for General Electric and his tenure as Governor of California. No surprises are to be expected in this kind of retrospective view of so relentlessly explored a figure, but the recent past is linked intelligently to the less recent past. The reporters direct our attention, in particular, to the ways in which deeply held attitudes of the President toward big government, both in Washington and Moscow, have been translated into cuts in social programs and increased spending on arms. The tone is generally but gently critical; Mr. Reagan is characterized as ''not much of a reader.'' Mr. Wallace reminds us that despite his sermons on the virtues of hard work and selfreliance and a reputed stubborness in defense of his programs, Mr. Reagan proved politician enough in Sacramento to compromise when compromise was required, and is doing likewise in Washington. The hour's only funny line comes from Arthur Laffer, father of the Laffer Curve, whose theory - that a tax cut for business must bring prosperity - captured a susceptible Administration. Says Professor Laffer now: ''I couldn't be more optimistic than I am today about the future of the American economy.'' The gloomy economic situation at home is stressed over troubles abroad. Tom Brokaw visits Peoria, Ill., the politically conservative area near where the President grew up, to see how Middle Westerners are feeling about their favorite son in these hard times. Opinions are mixed. Mr. Brokaw also serves as co-anchor with Roger Mudd, who makes sensible if unstartling observations in his usual amiable way. Neither Mr. Mudd nor Mr. Brokaw explain why two men are needed to supply brief comments between the segments. WNEW-TV's entry in the annual catastrophes-of-the-year stakes, '' '83: At the Crossroads,'' is perfect in its way. Being shown next Sunday at 8 P.M., it offers a fast-forward look backward at the world as delivered by 12 months of local news programs. It's an hourlong barrage of hackneyed pictures of missiles and marches and massacre in Lebanon and murders in Central America and antinuclear rallies and unemployment lines in the United States, plus 10 seconds on famine in Africa, interspersed with politicians and nuclear-freeze advocates and Jewish spokesmen and union leaders and ordinary New Yorkers giving their opinions in two-minute snatches that pop out like balloons in a comic strip. Opponents of the Administration's arms and economic policies dominate. Attention is given to South Africa as a world danger spot, but whether out of ideology or oversight, Poland is not similarly acknowledged. Enough undigested ideas are spooned out - like the need for ''a new political structure'' - to send a viewer reaching for his Rolaids. The narrator of this mishmash is a breathless John Roland, who favors us with his assessment of where things may be getting better and where they are getting worse. Mr. Roland, anchor of the 11 P.M. news on WNEW-TV, Channel 5, has a loyally parochial frame of reference; his hopes for a Middle East settlement are high because of apparent divisions among Jewish New Yorkers. The only diverting aspect of this hour is the incidental music, all classical - but it is not nearly diverting enough.

896-> SYBARITIC BEDROOMS: ALL THE TRAPPINGS
ATRIO of new home-furnishings boutiques are providing soft and sensual linens for the bedroom and bathroom that will help make staying at home a cosy, if costly, experience. The wares reflect the personal tastes and design esthetics of their three creators. The trend is to the overdressed bed, square bed pillows, frills, flounces, appliques, soft plaids and sherbetlike pastels. ''I believe there is a new kind of romanticism,'' explained Agnes Comar, the Parisian-based designer whose new shop is at 816 Madison Avenue, at 67th Street. ''We need to comfort ourselves when we are at home,'' she added. ''I believe in soft and tender colors, fabrics and bedrooms.'' Mrs. Comar's is a sophisticated, refined and personal collection that emphasizes subtle ornamentation. Particularly interesting is the champagne-colored pleated fabric with which Mrs. Comar has draped the walls of the shop and edged sheets and pillows. It sells by the yard ($17 in white, $25 in champagne and gray per 36-inch-wide yard). It is a polyester version of the pleated silk material that was championed by Mariano Fortuny, the dress designer., All the linens are 100 percent cotton. A standard pillowcase starts at $30, a twin-size fitted sheet at $50, a flat twin-size sheet at $170, a square pillowcase from $60 and a bath sheet from $70. Mrs. Comar's signature floor poufs are $530 and $630. A four-poster bed, also draped in the pleated fabric, is covered in a cascade of pillows. The current palette is kept to white, pale green, beige and pale apricot. Both bed and table linens are subtly detailed, with insets and stitchery and designs that allude to butterflies and sea gulls. While the pleated fabric need not be ironed, the all-cotton sheets and pillowcases require ironing. But all the linens are machinewashable. ''Nowadays, it's just not possible to do things that can't be machine-washed,'' Mrs. Comar said. Tricia Guild, who is based in London, calls her collection Soft Furnishings USA. It is being presented in a trellised new boutique on Macy's sixth floor and includes sheets, comforters, dust ruffles, pillows, tablecloths, napkins, lampshades, china, shower curtains and towels. The designer emphasizes watery patterns that are predominantly pale pink, blue and tan. Tables are festooned with tablecloth over tablecloth; beds are decorated with clusters of pillows, and there are ruffles, ruffles everywhere - a sweet and affordable interpretation of the English country style. Bathmats are $22 each, comforters $120 to $200. ''Luxurious, nice and practical stuff in the right fibers, like cotton, linen and wool,'' said Julia McFarlane of the things available at Ad Hoc Softwares, the shop she and her partner, Judith Auchincloss, will officially unveil on Nov. 15. Situated at 410 West Broadway, at the corner of Spring Street, the store will specialize in bed and table linens, fitness equipment and accesssories for the bedroom and bathroom including blankets and sheets, pillowcases and rugs, ballet bars and travel kits. There are also yarn-dyed woven sheets, all-wool blankets from Texas and Oregon, square handstitched pillowcases from France and handwoven rag rugs. A square white pillowcase from France is $50; a plaid twin-size sheet is $60; all-wool blankets are from $60 to $220. The emphasis is on graphic stripes, madraslike plaids and solid colors. ''No flowers or ruffles,'' said Mrs. Auchincloss. ''Well maybe an occasional sprig,'' countered her partner. The shop interior, designed by Redroof Design, includes a wall rail system for displaying the linens, which also hang on bars from the ceiling. ''We wanted to bring everything off the shelves and give a sense of air through the fabrics,'' said Miss McFarlane. ''This is a more sensual store than our uptown one,'' Mrs. Auchincloss said, referring to their more high-tech and hard-edged uptown emporium. ''We're getting older, we needed softer,'' Miss McFarlane explained.

The weekly Der Spiegel published new allegations today against former Economics Minister Hans Friderichs in connection with tax exemptions for a major private holding concern. Mr. Friderichs, now chairman of the giant Dresdner Bank, is one of 10 politicians and businessmen under investigation by the Bonn public prosecutor for suspected bribery. The case involves suspicion that the privately owned Friedrich Flick holding concern gave millions of dollars to political parties in return for tax relief on the proceeds of a major sale of shares in the Daimler-Benz Motor Company. Der Spiegel published what it said were documents collected by the public prosecutor from the Flick files, purporting to show that Mr. Friderichs received $152,000 from Flick for his Free Democratic Party while he was minister between 1972 and 1977. Mr. Friderichs and the other suspects have denied wrongdoing.

899-> RUTGERS SNAPS COLGATE STREAK
Alan Andrews caught two touchdown passes from Jacque LaPrarie, and Bill Houston scored on a 94-yard interception return today as Rutgers sent Colgate to its first loss of the season, 34-17, at Rutgers Stadium. Colgate had more yards in total offense, but was victimized by the Scarlet Knights' ability to strike for the big passing play. Of Rutgers's 344 total yards, 142 came in three passing plays, two to Eric Johnson for 101 yards, and one to Andrew Baker for 41. All three receptions led to touchdowns and allowed Rutgers to break the game open and score its fourth victory against three losses, including a last-second defeat at Boston College last week. Colgate (5-1) lost for the first time since winning its final two games last season and first five this season. The biggest play for Rutgers came at 8:27 of the opening quarter when Houston intercepted Steve Calabria's pass at the Rutgers 6-yard line and ran downfield untouched for a touchdown. The return for a touchdown was the second longest in Rutgers history, the longest being 100 yards by Mike Wittpenn in 1919. Sixth Interception ''We waited for something to happen after they took a 3-0 lead, and the interception came,'' said Houston, who had three interceptions last week against Boston College and now has six for the season. ''I hesitated first when I got the ball but then I saw no one around me and I took off.'' Houston's touchdown gave Rutgers the lead for good. Brian Byrne had kicked a 27-yard field goal for Colgate after a 69-yard drive stalled at the Rutgers 11. ''Colgate outplayed us in the first half,'' said Coach Frank Burns of Rutgers, ''but we came up with the big plays. Our quarterback did well and our blitz was successful.'' LaPrarie, a left-handed sophomore quarterback, completed 12 of 19 passes for 196 yards, two touchdowns and was not intercepted. Eric Hochberg, who replaced LaPrarie toward the end when the outcome was no longer in question, was successful in his only attempt for 27 yards. Calabria completed 21 of 41 for 218 of Colgate's 418 yards. Bill Kovach caught seven for 112 yards and Joe Kozak three for 58, one for a touchdown. Colgate's other touchdown came on Gil Terenzi's 2-yard run. Albert Smith and Joe Burke scored the other touchdowns for Rutgers, with Alex Falcinelli converting all the extra points. Falcinelli had one field-goal attempt, from 35 yards away, which he missed. Colgate failed when it went for the 2-point conversion after Kozak's touchdown but succeeded after Terenzi's when Steve Kinney, a flanker, completed a pass to Bill Cullen.

900-> LONG ISLAND JOURNAL
EAST HAMPTON town officials have announced plans to buy a 50-acre tract of land for $385,000 and then subdivide it into 100 half-acre lots that would be sold to local families. The property, known as Montauk Lawns and owned by Malcolm Shaw, was subdivided before the adoption of current zoning requirements. The old file map indicates 999 undersized lots; town officials said that a redrawing would create about 100 half-acre lots. These would be sold for about $4,000 each to town residents who meet the eligibility requirements, which have yet to be determined. The proposed purchase is part of a town plan to provide housing for low-and moderate-income families. Town Councilman Walter Hackett, who has backed the project, said a local housing authority would be set up to supervise it. The announcement of the project follows news that another townsponsored project to provide housing for low- and moderate-income families in Montauk is in jeopardy. The town planned to buy houses on a former United States Air Force base in Montauk, renovate them and sell them to 27 local families. However, town officials learned this month that a Congressional subcommittee had recommended to the General Services Administration, the Federal agency that handles the disposal of Government property, that East Hampton's application be denied. The town had intended to buy the buildings and the 25-acre site for $81,000. The 27 families have already invested $1,500 each, according to Town Supervisor Mary Fallon, and planned to buy the houses for $41,500 plus contractual and closing costs. The 27 applicants were selected last January by lottery and a rating system from the 144 who applied. Supervisor Fallon told the families that the town would continue to fight for its approval. For more than a year, civic groups in Valley Stream have been seeking a public hearing in order to protest an expansion of the Green Acres shopping center that would virtually double the size of the mall. The expansion is expected to add a department store, more than 100 smaller stores and a parking garage to the mall, which now has two department stores and about 100 other stores. Local groups are finally getting the hearing, sponsored by the village government, tomorrow night. However, it may be a case of locking the barn door too late because about 50 percent of the expansion work has already been completed. John Tanacredi, chairman of an ad hoc committee on the Green Acres mall expansion, said that the hearing should have been held before any work was permitted. ''However,'' he said, ''we are still hopeful of getting the expansion scaled down, and we also want the governmental agencies involved -the town, the county, the state and the city - to take actions that will alleviate the problems we will have as a result of this expansion.'' The problems he expects to adversely affect the residents of the village include a major increase in traffic and air pollution; a rise in crime, which Mr. Tanacredi called an already ''serious problem'' in the shopping center, and economic damage to village merchants. The former village administration in Valley Stream favored the expansion, Mr. Tanacredi said, and therefore did not draft its own environmental impact statement but instead let the Town of Hempstead act as the lead agent on the project. In April 1982 the town released a report showing there were no environmental objections to the project. Work began shortly thereafter. John Mastromarino, the village's deputy mayor, said the present village administration opposed the expansion. But he said that since the expansion was taking place just outside the village's boundaries, the village had no legal power to stop it. The East End Arts and Humanities Council in Riverhead has a new executive director. She is Stacia Smales, who last week left the Sea Cliff-based Full Sea program, an organization involved in promoting boating, to take the reins of the council. A veteran of the nonprofit arts field, Miss Smales, who is 32 years old, had previously administered Horizon Concerts, worked for a company involved in developing nonprofit theater groups, directed the Hudson Guild and founded and headed the Mime School of Boston. She went to Full Sea three years ago. Although Miss Smales, who plans to move her family of two young children to the East End at the close of the school year, said that ''it's too early to think cogently about plans for the future - there's so much that is exciting and enthralling going on here that it will take me a while to catch up'' -she did say she would make fund-raising a top priority. The 10-year-old council is facing a deficit that could be as much as $16,000. ''Since there's a current shift away from Government funding,'' Miss Smales said, ''we're going to have to look to foundations and corporations to pick up the slack. I'm especially intrigued by the prospect of weasling money out of corporations. That's the real challenge - to tap the Long Island corporations for the support we deserve.'' Miss Smales replaces Mardythe DiPirro, who left the council after eight years as its director to pursue other interests. ''Mardy did such a marvelous job,'' her successor said, ''that I just hope I can adequately take her place.'' Tomorrow, Nassau and Suffolk Counties will start taking applications for HEAP, the acronym for Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides direct Federal aid to eligible families to help cover their fuel bills. New York State expects to receive $237 million in Federal money for this winter's program, the same amount it received last winter, although Congress has not yet approved appropriations for 1983. The states are acting on a continuing resolution that expires Dec. 17. Last year, Congress made $1.875 billion available for the program, which is administered by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. In Nassau and Suffolk, residents not receiving public assistance and under the age of 60 may obtain applications for the program at any New York State Employment Office. Residents over 60 can get applications at local citizens' centers. Questions about the program will be answered at the Nassau County Department of Senior Citizen Affairs or the Suffolk County Office for the Aging.

901-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Florida Suspends 4
The University of Florida said four basketball players would be suspended until Dec.1 for involvement in charging 326 unauthorized telephone calls worth $1,600 to the University Athletic Association. The players are Ronnie Williams, last year's Southeastern Conference scoring leader; Rodney Williams, Vernon Delancy and Tony Rogers. Coach Norm Sloan said they would be allowed to practice with the team during the suspension. Sloan said Nabe Barker and George Jackson, other players involved in the case, were not suspended because they were charged with offenses to a ''lesser degree.''

902-> SUDDENLY, BONDS ARE BELLES OF THE BALL
THE BOND MARKET, once the domain of institutions and the very rich, has gone plebian in recent years and has been drawing far more money from household investors than the stock market. In the last eight years, individuals invested $196 billion in all kinds of Treasury securities and $55 billion in the tax-exempt market, while their sales of common stocks exceeded purchases by $109 billion. This year, public demand for tax-exempt bonds issued by state and local governments has been especially heavy. These bonds are exempt from Federal income tax, and in some cases, state income tax. Why should an investor choose notes and bonds instead of stocks or a money market mutual fund? In essence, the public has been attracted to the bond market by the availability of 10 percent and higher interest rates that seem high compared with the 5 percent rate of inflation over the last year and forecast for next year. Furthermore, bond yields have recently been higher than the yield on money market funds and considerably higher than the dividend yield on common stocks. In 1982, money began flowing more readily to the long-term bond market once short-term interest rates declined to levels that were less than the yields on long-term bonds. That is in contrast with 1981 and early 1982, when yields on short-term securities were higher than on long-term bonds - a condition which detered investment in long-term bonds and drew billions of dollars to the money market funds. Besides offering yields that are often higher than those of shortterm issues, investments in bonds have traditionally attracted those who want to be certain of receiving income for years into the future. Such certainty is not possible with common stocks, whose dividends may be cut or elimianted, or with money market funds, whose yields can fluctuate widely. For example, the investor in a money market fund who was earning a 13 percent yield early in 1982 was receiving less than 9 percent late in the year. The investor in 14 percent Treasury bonds, meanwhile, is earning $140 of interest per year for every $1,000 bond, a return that will continue until maturity, no matter how much the price of the bond fluctuates in secondary market trading. Another reason for buying bonds in recent years has been the possibility of a quick price appreciation that can compare favorably with a well-chosen common stock. For example, between June and November, the price of long-term Treasury bonds rose more than 25 percent, in addition to paying a hefty yield. That kind of performance caught the eye of many investors, especially those who think that the decline in long-term bond yields is not over. If the yield for 30-year issues was to fall to 9 percent in the next year, as many analysts say is possible, the price of the 10 3/8 percent Treasury bonds due in 2011 would rise from 99 1/4 when they were issued in early November to slightly more than 114. If yields were to fall to 8 percent by 1984, the price would rise to 126. The higher prices result from falling yields because investors would be willing to pay more money for the right to receive the $103.75 of interest received every year by the owner of $1,000 of 10 3/8 percent bonds If the general level of interest rates were to rise, the interest paid on the 10 3/8 percent bond would not seem so attractive, and the bonds price would fall - to 94 1/2 if yields were 11 percent by the end of 1983 and 87 if yields were 12 percent by late 1984. Price fluctuations such as these are not inconceivable in the bond market, where swings have been even larger in the last few years. Because bond yields have fluctuated so widely lately, today's investors are confronted with a universe of bonds with vastly different coupons. Just among Treasury issues in the 30-year range, for example, the range is from 7 5/8 percent to 14 percent. For all kinds of bonds, the difference between face value and a discount price (one that is below face value) or a premium price (one that is above face value) is included in the calculations of that particular issue's yield to maturity. Investors should understand that the yield of a premium-priced bond will decline if the issue is retired (at a price of 100) before the stated maturity, whereas the yield on a discount-priced bond will be increased if it is retired before maturity. In the Treasury market, the question of early retirement is of little importance since the Government's issues are not refundable except for issues with an original maturity of 30 years, which may be retired after 25 years. For tax-exempt and corporate issues, however, investors are much more wary of paying premium prices because those issues may typically be retired before maturity at the issuer's option. Thus, if interest rates fall, investors recognize that the issuer may sell new bonds to pay off the old, high-coupon debt. That leaves the investor in the unenviable position of having to reinvest at a time when yields are lower. In the corporate market, most utility and telephone company bonds are refundable after five years, whereas most industrial company issues are protected for 10 years. Canadian borrowers typically offer 15 years of protection from refunding. Most tax-exempt issues are protected from refunding for 10 years, though practices vary and investors should make certain of the provisions that apply to their bonds, especially those that are selling for more than face value. The importance of premium and discount prices is especially great for the various kinds of securities that are backed by pools of home mortgages, such as federally insured mortgages that back Government National Mortgage Association pass-through securities or the mortgages underlying tax-exempt housing revenue bonds. IN THE CASE OF GINNIE MAE SECURITIES, the monthly payments of principal and interest go to the investor, including any prepayments of mortgages that might occur. The certificates are advertised as having an eight-year average life, but that assumption has been far wrong at times. For example, early in 1982 the depressed state of the housing market meant few homes were being bought and sold, and there were relatively few prepayments of mortgatges. Thus, the principal amount of the certificates was being retired at a rate barely faster than the 30-year life of the underlying mortgages. Now, however, housing market conditions have improved, and some homeowners are trying to refinance their old, high-interest-rate mortgages at the lower current rates. The danger to buyers of 14 and 15 percent Ginnie Maes who paid more than 100 is that the old high-rate loans will be repaid quickly, in effect resulting in the redemption of the certificates at a price of par. Since bonds are long-term securities but are not necessarily longterm investments, the buyer of a bond must consider the liquidity of the instrument. Liquidity refers to the ease with which an investor can find a buyer. Purchasing Treasury issues at auction or tax-exempt issues at the initial public offering allows the individual buyer to get a price that is fair and roughly equal to that paid by large institutional investors. However, when it comes time the sell, it is a fact of life that there is a penalty to be paid when small, odd lots of bonds are liquidated. An odd lot would be anything less than $100,000 of bonds, with the oddest lots of all being less than $25,000. Securities dealers and banks will buy odd lots, but only at a price that pays for the overhead and protects them against the risks that they might not quickly find another buyer for those exact securities. The result means that the odd-lot seller gets a price that is a few points less than the ''market'' quote for the same issue if it were to be bought or sold in a million-dollar block. In general, the Treasury market is the most liquid secondary market, where small investors get a price that is closer to the ''market'' levels quoted to multimillion-dollar investors than is the case for tax-exempt issues. For many issues, such as the three-anda-half-year certificates of deposit offered constantly by large securities firms in amounts of $100,000 or less, and the zero-coupon Treasury issues, securities dealers promise, but do not guarantee, to buy back the securities on demand. The tax-exempt market, consisting of about $400 billion of securities issued by 40,000 different local governments and authorities, is the most popular market for individual investors, who have absorbed about two-thirds of the new issues in the last two years. Because interest paid on securities of state and local governments is exempt from Federal income taxes, the return on those bonds is far greater than the return on corporate and Treasury issues whose interest is taxable as income. Though tax-exempts are the most popular bond investment among individual investors, it is the most difficult of markets for the unsophisticated investor to understand because there are so many different kinds of issues, each with a different coupon, price and credit quality. Yields vary widely among bonds of similar maturity and quality rating, and there are other distinctions that depend on the local market for the thousands of small issues of less than $1 million dollars. Because of the difficulty of intelligently selecting among the thousands of different tax-exempt bonds, many investors prefer to buy an interest in a pool of tax-exempt bonds rather than the bonds themselves. By purchasing an interest in a pool of securities, the small investor can diversify his holdings and collect interest as often as monthly rather than twice a year as with bonds. The common way of investing in a pool of tax-exempt bonds is through the unit investment trusts created by securities firms, which sell interests in the pool in minimums of $1,000. As interest is paid on the bonds, and as bonds are retired, the buyer of the unit investment trusts is repaid. Tax-exempt mutual funds, on the other hand, consist of a pool of bonds that constantly changes as fund managers seek the best-performing investments. The tax-exempt market is a favorite arena for the practice known as tax-swapping, whereby the investor sells some securities at a loss and reinvests in some other issue, presumably with an increase in quality or yield. The practice can be rewarding, since the loss can be used to offset other income, meaning that the Government pays for part of the bill. For the small investor, the best sources of information about upcoming tax-exempt issues and yields of recently sold issues are the weekly and daily editions of the Bond Buyer, a trade publication that is the bible of the industry. Other sources include Moody's Bond Survey, published by Moody's Investors Service, and CreditWeek, published by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. All three publications originate in New York, and include other articles about interest rates and the credit markets. The Bond Survey and CreditWeek are also useful sources about upcoming and recent corporate bond offerings. Another source of information is the Blue List, a daily listing of bonds offered for sale by securities dealers that is published by S.& P. This list is typically not shown to the public, but a broker might obtain a copy just to help the investor understand what types of securties are avialable at what prices. For investors in Treasury securities, it is easier to keep abreast of market developments because there is only one issuer to watch. Besides newspaper reports of upcoming sales by the Treasury, your broker should have information about upcoming auctions, which are held on a regular schedule. There is no way of knowing exactly what yield will result at these auctions, but with a little effort there are two ways an individual investor can guess the yield of upcoming issues to within a quarter of a percentage point. One method is to look at the yield of outstanding Treasury issues of like maturity, which will be close to the yield a daily the new issue. Another way to estimate auction results is to follow news reports of activity in the Treasury market during the days preceeding an auction. During that time, securities dealers are busy looking for buyers, to whom they quote yields for the new issue. By the day predeeding the auction, the quoted yields will probably be close to the average set at the auction. Investors in tax-exmept and corporate issues are sure to be confronted with ratings assigned by Moody's and S.& P. These ratings are not infallible, and it is common to find similarly rated issues with different yields, or else the same issue with a different rating. Most large instititional investors do their own credit research, and sometimes reach conclusions different from the rating agencies, which may not have the same opinion about certain issues. In general, the four highest-rating categories are called investment grade, and are assigned to issues for which the issuer clearly has the ability to pay interest and principal. The highest rating, Aaa at Moody's and AAA at S.& P., is reserved for a shrinking number of companies with the strongest financial condition. The lowest investment grade category is Baa at Moody's and BBB at S.& P. Companies with ratings below investment grade may still meet all payments due to bondholders, but the rating agencies have decided that companies' financial conditions are not strong enough for an investment-grade rating. A high rating can be comforting but is no substitute for paying attention to the affairs of a company in which one has invested. Companies such as Chrysler and Internatioal Harvester were once investment grade. Security Comes in Cats and Tigers AT A TIME of high long-term interest rates and a weak economy characterized by rising bankruptcies, investors were looking earlier this year for securities that would lock in the high yields while offering protection from the risk of default. To fill that demand, several Wall Street firms created a new kind of security combining the best features of zero-coupon bonds with the high credit quality of the United States Treasury. The first publicly offered issue of Treasury Investment Growth Receipts, or ''Tigers'' for short, was created by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith. Soon after, Salomon Brothers began offering ''Cats,'' or Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities. Along with similar issues with less-catchy names, sales of the new zero-coupon, Treasury-backed issues have totaled several billion dollars during 1982. Although the Treasury does not sell zero-coupon securities, the securities firms create their own by ''stripping'' the semiannual interest payments from the corpus, or principal amount of Treasury notes and bonds. The interest payments and the face amount are sold separately, each then being zero-coupon securities paying no interest. A 20-year Treasury bond, for example, could be the raw material for zero-coupon securities with maturities ranging from six months to 20 years. The zero-coupon feature satisfies the desire to lock in yields that are thought to be high because all of the investor's return comes from the difference between the low purchase price and the face value at maturity. The yield is thus guaranteed in a way that is not true for regular Treasury issues, whose yield to maturity will change depending on interest rates at the time the investor reinvests the semiannual interest payments. Another version of zero-coupon securities with Government backing is the long-term certificates of deposit issued by banks or savings and loan associations. The backing comes from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insure deposits up to $100,000.

906-> TWO COUNTRY CLASSICS
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Sarah Newell is on the staff of the Book Review. GONE TO EARTH By Mary Webb. 288 pp. New York: Virago/The Dial Press. Paper, $7.95. PRECIOUS BANE By Mary Webb. 288 pp. New York: Virago/The Dial Press. Paper, $7.95. THE Virago Modern Classics series has been quietly reprinting neglected novels for 10 years. Each time the work of a relatively obscure author is reissued, it is hard to understand why it had ever been allowed to go out of circulation. Mary Meredith Webb, mystic custodian of the Welsh-English border country now joins the list with her two most lyrical novels, ''Gone to Earth'' and ''Precious Bane.'' An essayist and poet as well as a novelist, Mary Webb was born in Shropshire in 1881 and began writing during World War I. But it was not until 1924, with the publication of ''Precious Bane,'' that a substantial readership came to respect her quiet genius; and it is for this country classic that Mary Webb has been remembered ever since. When she died at the age of 46, literature lost a voice that promised to speak for Shropshire as poignantly as Thomas Hardy had spoken for Wessex, Emily Bronte for Yorkshire. Set in the wilds of Ellesmere in western England at the beginning of the 19th century, ''Precious Bane'' is narrated from the safety of old age by Prudence Sarn, whose ill-fated early life forms the basis of the book. She tells of a time still drowsing in bucolic oblivion soon after the Industrial Revolution. It is a time when people go to country fairs to sell honey and find wives; when a spartan fare of broth, mutton and bread is spiced with quinces, jargonelles, mint cakes, warm ale. It is a time of intense superstition too: Born with a harelip, Prue is persecuted as a witch by her country neighbors. The almost daily humiliations drive her further from human society and enhance her profound love of nature, whose own cruelties she chooses to forgive. Prue's only friend, Jancis, is the daughter of another outcast, Wizard Beguildy, who claims to have the souls of his enemies stopped up in bottles at his house in the woods. Jancis is plump and honeyhaired, with a round, red, roselike mouth - a perfection that torments Prue, who longs to be free of her deformity, to be kissed on the mouth by a lover. Prue meets the man of her dreams while preparing yarn at a ''lovespinning'' to make Jancis' wedding sheets. At the approach of the weaver, Kester Woodseaves, she hides in a corner, afraid that her affliction will jeopardize what she feels, inexplicably, to be a predestined love. The two write quaint but passionate love letters to each other under the guise of helping the romance between Jancis and Prue's brother, Gideon, neither of whom can write. Prue's disbelieving joy when Kester finally not only looks at her without flinching but assures her of his devotion is a triumph of pathos and poetry. ''GONE TO EARTH,'' first published in 1917, is a passionate, almost defiant exaltation of a solitary life spent close to the land. It is the story of Hazel Woodus, who lives with her pet fox and her father, Abel, in a tiny cottage in a hollow beneath a windy, birchcovered hill. Aimless beekeeper, coffin maker and harpist, Abel is happiest whenever a village child dies, for then he can meld his skills into a show of purpose: With the wood left over from tiny coffins, he can make new hives, and he can wring more tears from the mourners with his melancholy harping. Hazel's unfettered existence is destroyed by the intrusion of two men. Edward Marston, the feckless preacher of God's Little Mountain, marries Hazel but seeks only to protect her innocence. Jack Reddin, to whom Hazel is subsequently drawn, responds all too willingly to her sad, puzzled yearnings for human passion. If only the principled Marston had overcome his sexual qualms in time, Hazel would never have been wooed by Reddin, would never have carried his child. As the tragedy of errors unfolds, Mary Webb draws on the full force of the countryside to underscore the beauty and freedom that Hazel is losing. Following passages that exult in the bright, cloud-swept skies and ripe meadows of Hazel's wanderings, she conveys the musty sensuality of Reddin's estate, Undern Hall: ''Cherries fell in the orchard with the same rich monotony, the same fatality, as drops of blood. ... It was then, when the scent of the elder blossom, decaying fruit, mud and hot yew brooded there, that the place attained one of its most individual moods - narcotic, aphrodisiac.'' Mary Webb has been called a feminist, and there are passages in her books that seem to deplore the subjugation of women, as in her ruminations on Hazel's marriage to Marston: ''She would become ... the servant of the china and the electro-plate and the furniture, and she would be the means by which Edward's children came into the world.'' But Webb's empathic fervor extends further, to the scorned, the maltreated. She especially abhorred blood sports, but not in a mawkish way. In both of these novels, the pursuit of ''vicarious suffering'' is a crucial and dramatic element. The Death Pack and Black Huntsman of local legend in ''Gone to Earth'' lurch into terrifying focus when the Silverton Hunt and Jack Reddin (embodiment of ''all men's desires - predatory, fugitive, or merely negative'') hound Hazel into a quarry in the final chapter. A bull-baiting scene in ''Precious Bane'' pits a mob of rowdy yahoos and their hysterical terriers and mastiffs against a small, worried white bull, ''tied to a staple in the wall ... grumbling to itself.'' Webb's books are full of local dialect, mystic lore, folk ballads and a pantheistic reverence for the sights and sounds of the landscape that surrounded her. As she wrote of one of her characters, her ''ideas of God were vague and shadowy. ... There was more here, on this airy hill, than could be seen or touched or heard.'' Mary Webb found refuge not only in ''the wistfulness which is the past'' but in the glimpses of an older England to be seen in rural hamlets and farmsteads. There is, she said, ''a permanence, a continuity in country life which makes the lapse of centuries seem of little moment.''

908-> THE REGION; Man Is Sentenced In Extortion Case
A man who boasted to undercover agents of his ties to organized crime was sentenced today to five years in prison after being convicted Oct. 22 of transporting $300,000 obtained by extortion across state lines. ''There is no doubt there was an aura of organized crime in this case,'' said Federal District Judge H. Curtis Meanor, who also fined the defendant, Dominick D'Agostino, 66 years old, $10,000. Mr. D'Agostino, who is appealing an eight-year sentence for racketeering in association with former State Sen. William V. Musto, was allowed to remain free on $250,000 bail.

914-> COMPANY NEWS; U.S. Home to Buy Brigadier Industries
The U.S. Home Corporation, the nation's largest on-site home builder, announced today that it had agreed to buy a controlling interest in Brigadier Industries, the nation's seventh-largest maker of mobile homes, for $25.4 million. Guy R. Odom, board chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Home, said the acquisition of Brigadier would ''provide U.S. Home with a beginning point in the company's commitment to being the dominant builder in more segments of the shelter industry.'' U.S. Home is currently building homes in 294 communities in 135 cities in 18 states. It completed 14,308 homes during 1981. Brigadier, which is based in Thomson, Ga., manufactured 8,364 mobile homes during the same period. Under terms of the acquisition agreement, the 6.3 million outstanding shares of Brigadier stock would be converted, tax-free, to U.S. Home common stock having a market value of about $25.4 million. U.S. Home would issue .15696 to .21975 share for each Brigadier share. The precise amount would be based on the average closing price of the U.S. Homes stock during a 15-day trading period before the mailing out of the proxy statement. U.S. Home closed at $22.375 today on the New York Stock Exchange, down 25 cents. U.S. Home said that shareholders owning about 53.7 percent of Brigadier had agreed to vote their shares in favor of the merger. The company also announced third-quarter net income rose 59.5 percent, to $3.4 million, or 22 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or 15 cents a share, in the third quarter of 1981. Third-quarter revenues rose 10.5 percent, to $241.3 million, from $218.4 million a year earlier. New orders for the third quarter totaled 3,448 units, up 21.3 percent from the 1981 third-quarter figure of 2,843 units.

915-> Chess: Soltis and Martz Share Title In U.S. Open Championship
The grandmaster Andrew Soltis of New York and the international master William Martz of Wauwatosa, Wis., tied for first place in the United States Open Championship in St. Paul. Each received a $1,650 prize for his winning score of 10-2. Because he topped Martz in tiebreak points, Soltis will now be seeded into the next United States Invitational Championship. Finishing a half-point behind to share third place in the 440-player Swiss system event were the grandmaster Arthur Bisguier, the international master John Watson, Joseph Bradford and Tom Unger. A Lead in Development In the eighth round, Soltis demonstrated the value of a lead in development in defeating John C. Meyer. After 3 KN-K2, Black could have transposed to a kind of French Defense with 3 ... P-Q4; 4 PxP, PxP; 5 P-Q4, but the black QP would likely be more vulnerable than it usually is. Again, after 3 ... N-QB3; 4 P-KN3, Meyer was probably right in forgoing 4 ... P-Q4, which led, in the Moehring-Antoshin game, Zinnowitz 1966, after 5 PxP, PxP; 6 B-N2, P-Q5; 7 N-Q5, N-B3; 8 N/2-B4, NxN; 9 NxN, B-Q3; 10 O-O, O-O; 11 P-Q3, B-K3; 12 Q-R5, to a slight advantage for White. Still, there was no need for 4 ... P-Q3, which meant that, in later advancing 8 ... P-Q4, Black had a tempo less than necessary. This was to become all the more important now that the game was opening up. Possibly, after 11 QBxN, Meyer should have developed with 11 ... B-Q2 rather than further Soltis' development with 11 ... PxP; 12 NxP. He may have intended to play 12 ... B-B3?, but this loses a pawn to 13 NxN, QxQ; 14 QRxQ, BxB; 15 N-K7ch, K-R1; 16 NxB, QRxN; 17 BxP. After Soltis' 14 Q-N4!, Meyer had no choice about defending against the mate threat by the weakening 14 ... P-KN3, since the alternative 14 ... B-B3?; 15 QR-Q1, Q-K2; 16 B-N4 costs Black the exchange. Soltis' 18 Q-KB4!, threatening 19 Q-K5, made life difficult for Meyer, but 18 ... RxR; 19 RxR, P-QB4; 20 Q-K5, P-B3 would at least have taken care of the immediate danger. Instead, Meyer's 18 ... R-Q4? permitted 19 RxR, BPxR; 20 Q-K5, P-B3; 21 QxPch, winning a decisive pawn. After 29 R-K4, the black QP either had to fall, putting White two pawns ahead, or else Black had to concede a lost king-and-pawn ending with 29 ... R-B6; 30 R-B4, RxR; 31 PxR. Therefore, Meyer gave up.

917-> BOTH PARTIES VIEW ELECTION AS A TEST OF REAGAN POLICIES
Republican and Democratic leaders pressed their conflicting arguments on unemployment and Social Security yesterday in preparation for an election that the White House regards as a referendum on President Reagan's economic policies. With the approach of the voting on Tuesday, Republican leaders, acknowledging the harm to their candidates from the 10.1 percent national unemployment rate, said they were resigned to significant losses in the House of Representatives. But a late resurgence of partisan feeling among Democrats also forced the Republicans to mount a strenuous defense of a Senate majority they once regarded as secure from erosion. Reagan Asks for Patience Mr. Reagan, just back from a campaign trip to five Western states with important Senate races, yesterday broadcast a radio appeal for patience with his economic leadership. He asked voters not to turn on his programs after only a ''13-month trial.'' (Page 37.) But Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, responding for the Democrats, said the Reagan program had weakened the economy. He echoed a theme many Democrats have used in the fall campaigns to attack an Administration plan to attempt Social Security reform after the election, warning voters in a radio address that the Administration has ''a secret post-election plan to slash Social Security and tarnish the golden years of the elderly.'' Costly Campaigning Thirty-three Senate seats and all but two of the 435 Congressional seats are at stake in this election to decide the makeup of the 98th Congress. Two seats in redrawn Georgia districts will be decided Nov. 30. While local issues have been a factor in most of the contests, much of the $98.5 million raised by the candidates went into a television advertising battle centered on the overarching question of which party more fully deserved the blame for the nation's economic ills. Mr. Reagan, with his ''stay the course'' theme, stumped in 13 states to say that his policy of lowering inflation while unemployment increased is a painful corrective necessitated by past Democratic failures. The Democrats, although generally fearful of criticizing Mr. Reagan personally, labored to stir a tide of populist resentment by suggesting that his Administration is willing to sacrifice wage earners' jobs and cut Social Security benefits for the sake of its pro-business fiscal ideology. Oddly, Democratic candidates and the Republican strategists at the White House found themselves united in arguing that the Congressional elections amounted to a referendum on Mr. Reagan. But many Republican candidates resisted this interpretation, preferring to campaign on local issues rather than to invite voters to base their Congressional vote on their feelings about Mr. Reagan's economic program. The major national public opinion polls uniformly found voter preference running in favor of Democratic candidates. The New York Times/CBS News Poll put the Democratic edge at 52 percent to 38 percent. The Gallup Poll found respondents favoring Democrats by 55 percent to 45 percent, and the Harris Poll showed a 52 percent to 40 percent advantage for Democrats. Such findings, while they measure the general national trends rather than district-by-district standings, led to predictions by leaders of both parties of significant, if not record-breaking Democratic gains in the House. Richard Richards, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said the Democrats would gain 20 seats. Privately, White House officials predicted the Democratic gains at 25 seats or more. The Democrats now hold 241 seats and the Republicans 192. Martin Franks, director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, projected a more modest gain of 15 seats for the Democrats. But Patrick Caddell, the Democratic poll taker, came closer to stating the expectations of most leaders of his party in predicting a gain of 30 seats. Crucial Senate Margin Losses of that magnitude would seriously damage Mr. Reagan's conservative coalition in the House and make it essential for the Republicans to protect their controlling margin of 54 seats to 46 seats in the Senate. The most striking late development in the campaign was a shift of public mood, reflected in campaign polls taken in many states, that posed a threat to the size of that Republican edge. Analysts in both parties said only an unexpected landslide could shift control of the Senate back to the Democrats. Such a landslide, undetected by the pollsters and spurred by a massive shift in voter choices over the last weekend of the campaign, occurred in 1980, when the Republicans won control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter century. Most recent estimates of potential Republican slippage were in the range suggested by Vincent Breglio, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. ''We might go down to 52 if the bottom drops out of a couple of races,'' Mr. Breglio said, attributing the possible decline to a pro-Democratic swing of opinion that set in about 10 days ago and placed several Republican incumbents in tighter races than had been expected. But because the Republicans hope to defeat one or two embattled Democratic incumbents, they see no direct threat to control of the Senate. Even so, the opinion swing illustrated the partisan trend that is posing difficulties for many Republicans. 'Electorate Is Polarized' ''Clearly, the electorate is polarized,'' said Mr. Breglio. ''I've been in the polling business for years, and I've never seen it like it is this year. If you're looking at 10 Democrats and nine of them are voting partisan you know it's polarized. With those Democrats coming home, it makes it tough for Republican incumbents.'' The trend toward polarization was felt at the White House by planners of Mr. Reagan's participation in these off-year elections. Mr. Reagan finished this campaign following a defensive strategy that marked a sharp retrenchment from the plan the White House was pursuing as recently as Labor Day. At that time, Mr. Reagan and his advisers were planning an aggressive strategy based on the one used in 1934 by Franklin D. Roosevelt, the only President since the Civil War to lead his party to a gain of House seats in an off-year election. The Democrats picked up nine seats that year, after Mr. Roosevelt told voters that he needed a stronger force in Congress to protect his New Deal reforms. Officially, the Republicans were still committed today to this strategy of ''breaking history'' on the Roosevelt model. But their real hope was to hold their House losses to a figure that could be called below average. In all mid-year elections since World War II the average loss for the party with the White House has been 33 seats. Postwar Presidents whose parties have newly taken the White House have lost an average of 11 seats. Mr. Richards, the Republican chairman, said the Republicans faced losses because ''we got clobbered'' in Congressional redistricting and because economic recovery had not occurred as rapidly as Mr. Reagan said it would. ''Those things have obviously dampened our prospects,'' he said. ''But at the same time, it's certainly not disaster, as has been predicted.'' Following is a summary by region of the prospects for the Senate and House races. The Northeast Except for an appearance for Representative Millicent Fenwick in New Jersey, Mr. Reagan avoided stump appearances in this region, so as not to spur Democratic turnout against three Republican Senatorial candidates who apparently hold narrow but vulnerable leads. They are Representative Fenwick, who is running against Frank R. Lautenberg for an open seat formerly held by the Democrats; Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, and Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island. Republican Party professionals are particularly worried about Mr. Chafee. They say Rhode Island is typical of heavily Democratic states where otherwise strong Republican incumbents could be swept away if the unemployed vote in large numbers or if Republican ticketsplitters cast protest votes against Mr. Reagan's policies. In turnout-sensitive states or districts, voter participation approaching 40 percent is regarded as a plus for Democrats. But in the last off-year election, in 1978, only 37.9 percent of all eligible voters cast ballots. Massachusetts has one of six Congressional districts in the nation where two House incumbents were thrown together by redistricting. Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat, is leading in the polls over Representative Margaret M. Heckler, a moderate Republican with a strong pro-consumer record. The Midwest For the Republicans, an unexpected area of trouble in Missouri was highlighted on Friday in a poll by The St. Louis Globe-Democrat, which showed State Senator Harriett Woods, a Democrat, deadlocked with Senator John C. Danforth, the Republican incumbent. A month earlier, Senator Danforth, who has tried to distance himself from Mr. Reagan's economic policies, led by 56 percent to 39 percent in a similar poll. Strategists on both sides now believe another threatened Republican, Senator David Durenberger of Minnesota, will probably withstand a challenge by Mark Dayton, a Democrat whose personal spending appears likely to approach $6 million. In contrast to those Republicans who subtly distanced themselves from the President, Mr. Durenberger criticized Mr. Reagan's policies, questioned his intelligence and suggested that a Presidential appearance would cause protest demonstrations in the state. From the start of the campaign, White House strategists singled out the Midwest, with its ravaged industries, and the Plains states, with a staggering farm economy, as their weakest area. One House race in particular illustrates the shift in fortunes: Two years ago, Representative Jim Dunn, a Michigan Republican, rode Mr. Reagan's coattails and upset Bob Carr, a three-term Democratic incumbent. Now, Mr. Carr is back, pressing Mr. Dunn by running against Mr. Reagan's economic policies in Lansing and Pontiac, where unemployment has hit 28 percent. The South Since Gov. Charles S. Robb of Virginia started campaigning for him, Lieut. Gov. Richard J. Davis, the Democratic Senate nominee, has drawn even with Representative Paul S. Trible Jr., a Republican, in one of the nation's closest races. The winner is to replace Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr., an independent who caucused with the Democrats and who is retiring. The other Senate races are not in doubt. Between them, Texas and Florida have seven of the nation's 21 newly created Congressional districts. Democratic legislatures drew the boundaries of many new districts to favor their party, but Mr. Richards nonetheless predicted Republicans would get the ''lion's share'' of the 21. In any case, Florida's new Ninth District provides the purest test of the impact of the Social Security issue among the elderly. State Representative George H. Sheldon, the Democrat, has told the district's retired citizens that his oppponent, Michael Bilirakis, would help Mr. Reagan cut Social Security benefits. Democratic analysts said that State Representative Robert G. Clark, a Democrat from the Mississippi Delta, is likely to become the state's first black Congressman in a century. Republicans are watcing three of their incumbents in heavily black districts, Albert Lee Smith Jr. of Alabama, John L. Napier of South Carolina and Robert W. Daniel Jr. of Virginia, as a measure of minority participation this year. Peter D. Hart, the Democratic pollster, has predicted a heavy minority vote because ''blacks hate Ronald Reagan with a vengeance.'' The West Even after Mr. Reagan's campaign schedule was cut to 11 days from 14 because fewer Republicans wanted him in their states, he was still welcome in the West, except for his home state of California. There, the latest California Poll showed Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., the Democratic Senate candidate, trailing Pete Wilson, the Republican, by 47 to 41 percent. Mr. Reagan stayed out because Republican strategists thought his presence would be divisive. But on Thursday and Friday, the President swept through five Western states that make up a crucial battleground in the Senate struggle. Mr. Reagan visited the states of two embattled Democratic incumbents, Howard W. Cannon of Nevada and John Melcher of Montana, in the hope of tilting their close races to the Republican challengers. He also appeared with three Republican incumbents, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming and Harrison (Jack) Schmitt of New Mexico. The Salt Lake Tribune reported that Mr. Hatch moved to a 10-point lead in his race. Mr. Wallop's campaign staff claimed he had an even bigger lead. But party professionals on both sides agreed that Mr. Schmitt is slipping against his Democratic opponent, Attorney General Jeff Bingaman. Like many hard-pressed incumbents this year, Senator Schmitt attacked his opponent with harsh television commercials. But the factually flawed attacks have apparently created a backlash of sympathy for Mr. Bingaman. The Republicans hope to gain House seats in newly created districts in Washington, Oregon, Colorado and Utah. In California, each party has a high-profile incumbent in a tough fight. They are Representative John H. Rousselot, the very conservative Republican who is the House's leading recipient of money from political action committees, and Representative Phillip Burton, Democrat of San Francisco.

918-> 2D THEATER AT THE MODERN
It says something about the Museum of Modern Art's new movie theater that will open tonight that only steps away, as one enters, hang many of the master paintings of this century. Museum officials say that placing the theater, its second, next to the galleries is deliberate: emphasizing the relationship of pictures to moving pictures, elevating films at their historic best to an art form. When Jeffrey Schulman, the chief projectionist at the Roy and Niuta Titus Theater II, shows this evening's inaugural film - ''Atlantic City,'' which will be introduced by its writer, John Guare, to mark the 70th anniversary of Paramount Pictures - the audience will be seated in what is considered the most technologically advanced moviehouse in the country for sound, projection equipment and sightlines. Mary Lea Bandy, director of the Modern Museum's film department, said the museum was now the only one in the United States with two movie theaters. Mrs. Bandy said that the second theater was needed for more specialized film programs and lectures that would attract a more limited audience. Both theaters will eventually be open simultaneously. 'His and Hers' Museum theaters I and II both bear the name of Mr. Titus and his wife. The couple donated $1 million to refurbish and endow the original 460-seat movie auditorium - which is dark while the Museum of Modern Art is being reconstructed - and a second million to pay for construction of the new 229-seat house in the west wing. ''My friends kid me and call them the His and Hers theaters,'' said Mr. Titus. The 73-year-old son of the late Helena Rubinstein, whose cosmetics empire he headed until his retirement, explained: ''I've been a movie fan since I was 10 years old and used to watch the silent cliffhangers and serials. William S. Hart, Fritz Lang, movies like 'Birth of a Nation' - I grew up with them. I wanted to do something to let new generations have the fun of seeing these and the other wonderful films in the museum archives.'' Preservation - turning unstable old nitrate reels into more durable triacetate stock before the film crumbles -is the department's long-range project, Mrs. Bandy said. What immediately impresses a visitor testing the seats in the theater is the generous amount of leg room -moviegoers who prefer to slouch almost needn't bend their knees. The architect, Cesar Pelli, has supervised placing the seats so that viewers don't face the back of someone's head but can see the screen in between the open sightlines of those seated in the row ahead. A half-dozen places have been reserved in the last row for moviegoers in wheelchairs. A Old Steinway Piano Films will be shown on Super-8, 16-millimeter and 35-millimeter projectors and will enjoy the latest sound equipment. The screen itself can be adjusted so that any size film can be shown and subtitles will not be chopped off awkwardly. The 8,000 films in the museum's collection include everything from Edwin S. Porter's ''The Great Train Robbery'' (1903) to the latest work by an experimental director in the ''Cineprobe'' independent film makers series, which opens next Monday with the premiere of Swiss director Isa Hesse-Rabinovitch's feature-length ''Siren Island''

919-> Yankees and City Still Seek Accord
A meeting in State Supreme Court yesterday between lawyers for the city, which owns Yankee Stadium, and George M. Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, failed to resolve the dispute over whether the Yankees will open their 1983 home season in the Bronx or in Denver's Mile High Stadium. Justice Burton B. Roberts, who is mediating the dispute, told the lawyers to return to court next Wednesday. Yankee Stadium is to undergo repairs during the winter, and the dispute is about whether the work will be completed in time for the Yankees to open a threegame home stand on April 11.

920-> BOSTON BANK CHIEF YIELDS POST
Richard D. Hill, New England's most influential banker, announced yesterday that he will step down Jan. 1 as chairman and chief executive officer of the First National Boston Corporation, holding company for the nation's 17th-largest bank. The move, an apparent attempt to clearly establish the next generation of the bank's top leadership, would occur two years before the 63-year-old Mr. Hill reached the bank's mandatory retirement age. He will continue as chairman of the executive committee of the bank and the holding company, the company said. He will be succeeded by William L. Brown, president and chief operating officer of the bank and the holding company and a longtime friend and associate of Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill said yesterday that he had been working on his succession for six years. ''We have so many good people bubbling up here that I feel like a cork in a bottle,'' he said. Successor Is 60 Mr. Brown himself is 60, which means he could hold the reins of New England's biggest bank for only four years before he would be scheduled to retire at 65. His apparent successor at that time would be 46-year-old Ira Stepanian, currently the bank's vice chairman who was named yesterday to succeed Mr. Brown as president and chief operating officer. Mr. Stepanian thus will be in the same position on Jan. 1 that Mr. Hill occupied in 1966 when he was elected president of the bank. At that time, Lloyd Brace stepped down as chairman two years before his scheduled retirement, turning the chairmanship over to Roger Daman and the presidency over to Mr. Hill. At the time, Mr. Hill, like Mr. Stepanian, was 46 years old. Mr. Brace also continued as chairman of the executive committee. ''I will involve myself in external work - calling on customers, association work and working with the foreign branches,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview yesterday. Lender of Last Resort As chairman of the First National, Mr. Hill's national influence surpasses that of most regional bankers. First National is by far the biggest bank in New England and, as Mr. Hill said yesterday, ''is sort of a lender of last resort'' for the entire region. The bank is active internationally and has one of the oldest and largest branch networks in Argentina. In addition to its international operations, and the breadth of services it performs for other banks in the New England area, it has gained a reputation for innovation. It has been an important lender to specialized industries, particularly the film business. Mr. Hill's directorships of other corporations also suggest his position in the New England economy. They include the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Boston Edison Company, the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Polaroid Corporation and the Raytheon Company. He is currently president of the prestigious International Monetary Conference, which limits membership to only several dozen of the world's leading banks, and is vice chairman of the advisory council on Japan-U.S. Economic Relations.

921-> ST. JOSEPH ROLLS, 28-7
St. Joseph High of Trumbull, unbeaten in five games, defeated previously unbeaten Fairfield Prep, 28-7, in a Metro Bridgeport Conference game in Trumbull. New Canaan (4-1) surprised Greenwich, 18-8, in an inter-divisional Fairfield County Conference game at the losers' field. For St. Joseph it was a combination of the passing of the quarterback Bob Ventresca and the split end Pat Donegan in a rugged defense that beat Prep, now 5-1. Ventresca had his finest day of the year, hitting 15 of 27 passes for 175 yards. Three of his passes went for touchdowns with Donegan on the receiving end of each. Donegan caught nine passes for 125 yards. Joe McNeil's fumble recovery at the Prep 28 set up of the first touchdown pass, a 6-yard toss midway through the first period. After Prep tied the score at 7-7 on Steve Loglisci's fourth-down 4-yard run, the Cadets fought back to grab a 14-7 halftime lead on a 4-yard Ventresca-to-Donegan pass play with two seconds left in the half. St. Joseph, winning for the 30th straight time at home since 1977, improved its lead to 21-7 on the opening series of the third period with Donegan scoring on a 32-yard touchdown aerial. Greenwich, 5-1, was locked in an 8-8 tie at halftime with New Canaan before the Rams' Mike Dayton booted a 35-yard field goal at 5:15 of the third period. Jason Cooper's 1-yard run accounted for the final New Canaan touchdown. Kevin McDonald and David Cullen traded first-half scores for the Cardinals and Rams respectively. Ansonia defeated Derby, 21-0, at Ryan Field in Derby for its seventh straight series victory. A crowd in excess of 10,000 saw the Chargers dominate play with Doug Goumas, Gordon Hotchkiss and Gerry Antrum getting the Ansonia touchdowns. Both teams entered with 5-0 records. In Fairfield County Conference action, Lance Lonergan and Tim Taylor scored on 2-yard runs in Staples's 14-6 victory over visiting Norwalk. McMahon of Norwalk won its fifth in a row, downing host Wilton, 14-7, as Dwayne Shaw gained 154 yards and scored on a 1-yard plunge. Gerald Roman caught an 18-yard pass for a touchdown from Roy Carlberg while Chuck Veley tallied for the Warriors. McMahon is 5-1.

923-> MUSIC: DEBUTS IN REVIEW; ROGER SALENDER, CLARINETIST, AMONG RECITALISTS
The five debut recitalists of the week included two pairs of players of the most familiar instruments, violin and piano. But the best of the bunch was a clarinetist, Roger Salander, who performed Friday night at Carnegie Recital Hall under the auspices of the Austrian Institute. Austria was involved because Mr. Salander - who was born in New York, graduated from the Juilliard School and taught at the University of Southern California and in Montreux - now lives in Vienna. He is professor of clarinet at the small, private Vienna Conservatory and a regular substitute in the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera. He also directs the summertime Catskill Institute for Advanced Musical Studies in Arkville, N.Y., which is affiliated with the Vienna Conservatory. Mr. Salander is a superior artist, no holds barred. His program, expertly and idiomatically accompanied by Harald Ossberger, offered music of Debussy, Poulenc and Stravinsky, as well as a quintet of five pleasing character portraits, ''Pentagramm,'' by Erich Eder de Lastra, which was dedicated to Mr. Salander and meant to be descriptive of his personality. The climax of the program came with the Brahms Sonata in E flat (Op. 120, No. 2). We are hearing a good deal of Brahms this year, and much of it sounds earnest but also thick and clotted - attributes that are too often transmitted to the reputation of the composer. But in a performance like this - adept, flowing, un-self-consciously at home with the style -Brahms's supposed weight drops away, leaving a fluent and subtle musician. Mr. Salander is that, too, and it would be good to hear him in recital again. Of the two violinists, the more distinctive was Syoko Aki, who appeared at the 92d Street Y Thursday night. Miss Aki came to this country from Japan in 1962 to study at the Yale School of Music, and has taught there since her graduation. She has taught elsewhere, too, but she had every reason to feel at home at the Y, since she is the concertmaster and a founding member of the Y Chamber Symphony, as well as a frequent soloist with that ensemble. But Thursday still marked her formal New York recital debut. Perhaps reflecting her longtime experience with teaching orchestral and chamber music, Miss Aki is an exceedingly small-scaled violinist. Her tone is delicate and precise, her pitch accurate, but her approach to music that ordinarily demands kineticism and even a certain roughness remained determinedly polite, not to say dainty. This was most notable in Bartok's Sonata for Solo Violin. But Miss Aki had the artistic skill to draw one into her world. The slow movement of the Bartok was unsurprisingly eloquent, but the Presto that followed worked well enough on its own terms, too. Elsewhere, Miss Aki picked music that suited her style, with Mozart and Schubert. She also offered Leon Kirchner's knotty but expressively intense Sonata Concertante. Mr. Kirchner accompanied his own piece, and Joan Panetti was the expert pianist for the Mozart and Schubert. Sergiu Schwarz, an Israeli violinist who has studied with Dorothy DeLay at Juilliard, gave a recital Wednesday night in Carnegie Recital Hall. He, too, began with Brahms, in the form of the Sonata No. 2 in A (Op. 100), which sounded technically confident but also stiff and detached. But Mr. Schwarz settled down thereafter, with a surging performance of the Franck Sonata in A and authoritative accounts of Benjamin Lees's Sonata No. 2 (1972), Bloch's ''Avodah'' and Saint-Saens's Introduction and Rondo Capricioso. Mr. Schwarz is an impressive technician, but at this stage of his career his temperament might tend toward the broader utterances of the concerto literature. Still, his recital, very deftly accompanied by Kyoko Hashimoto, was a most promising affair. Of the two pianists, by far the more persuasive was Allan Sternfield, who was at the Y last Sunday night. Unlike Mr. Schwarz, an Israeli based in this country, Mr. Sternfield is an American who studied at the Peabody Conservatory with Walter Hautzig but who now lives in Jerusalem. His recital began with a downright odd account of C.P.E. Bach's Sonata in A (W. 55, No. 4). The oddities lay in the phrasing, which was neither Romantically songful nor motoric in the manner of Glenn Gould. Instead, Mr. Sternfield picked his way gingerly through the piece, disrupting its momentum with peculiar rubato and cadential hesitations. Thereafter, however, he shown to far better advantage. Samuel Barber's Sonata in E flat minor (Op. 26) is always good to hear, and Mr. Sternfield gave an impassioned statement of the score. Paul Ben-Haim's Music for Piano (1967) sounded comfortable, neo-Classical and personable. Mr. Sternfield ended the evening with a powerful account of Mussorgsky's ''Pictures at an Exhibition.'' Less successful was Yulia Lipmanovich, who emigrated from Russia in her teens, studied at Juilliard and in England, and who now lives in Israel. Her performances late last Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Recital Hall were expansive in outline but often unsettled and inaccurate in detail. Her best work came in lyrical, self-effacing passages, but her program, consisting of major statements by Bach-Busoni, Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt, offered too little of that.

924-> SOVIET DIPLOMAT IN IRAN DEFECTS AND FLEES TO BRITAIN
A Soviet diplomat has defected from his post in Iran and fled to Britain, and officials here suggested that they thought he could give Western intelligence agencies extremely valuable information. The defector, identified as Vladimir Andreyevich Kuzichkin, has been given ''permission to stay'' in Britain, Government officials here said today. ''This is not an ordinary run-of-the-mill affair,'' one official said. ''He is one of the most significant to come our way in quite a while.'' American intelligence agents in London are expected to seek permission to interview Mr. Kuzichkin. Some experts speculated that Mr. Kuzichkin was attached to the Soviet intelligence organization, the K.G.B., and would be able to provide information about its activities in the Middle East. The officials, who refused to be identified, said the diplomat was being debriefed near London. He fled the embassy in Teheran in June and arrived in Britain a few days ago, the officials said, but they would not say where he had been in the interim or what he had been doing. Mr. Kuzichkin is in his mid-30's and was listed as a Vice Consul in the Soviet Embassy in Iran. Soviet Embassy Asks to See Him The Soviet Embassy in London, which declined to comment on the reports, asked for consular access, according to British officials, and the request was reportedly passed to Mr. Kuzichkin. There has been no indication that he has agreed. The wording used by a Home Office spokesman in announcing that Mr. Kuzichkin has ''permission to stay'' suggested that he has not yet been granted political asylum, possibly because he has not asked for it. There have been some cases of requests for political asylum being turned down. Official sources said that Mr. Kuzichkin's main role in the Soviet Embassy in Teheran was contact with the Communist Tudeh Party. Despite the strongly religious nature of the Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Tudeh Party operates openly and has wide support in Iran. With Iran's strategic importance in the Middle East, the United States and other Western governments have been watching the progress of the Tudeh Party closely since the 1979 revolution. Mr. Kuzichkin's defection could help the West by hurting relations between Iran and the Soviet Union. Relations between the two countries have been improving lately. Diplomatic sources said that Mr. Kuzichkin was married but that his wife had not defected with him. They do not have children.

925-> TRADERS GROW NERVOUS ABOUT MESA'S INTENTIONS
The stock of the General American Oil Company of Texas slid $3 a share yesterday to $43 in hectic trading on the New York Stock Exchange amid nervousness that the Mesa Petroleum Company might abandon its $40-a-share offer for 51 percent of General American. Mesa's chairman, T. Boone Pickens Jr., said in a telephone interview from his Amarillo, Tex., headquarters that ''a lot'' of arbitragers called ''to find out if there's any chance we'll drop. ''We don't have to make that decision right now,'' he said, ''and I don't know when I'll make it, but the possibility certainly exists that we could drop.'' Offer and Counteroffer Mesa announced its offer on Dec. 20, but General American's share price rose well above $40 as traders guessed correctly that Mesa would be outbid. On Dec. 23, General American offered $50 a share for 8 million shares, or almost one-third. That, together with the 26 percent held by the Meadows Foundation Trust, whose trustees include top managers of General American, would deprive Mesa of control. What concerns traders, however, is that General American, in its offer, reserved the right to back out if Mesa withdraws. In a related development, Mesa yesterday accused General American of unleashing ''kamikaze defensive tactics'' to prevent Mesa from having a ''fair opportunity'' to bid for General American. Mesa Files Suit In a suit filed in Federal District Court in Wilmington, Del., against the company and the Meadows Foundation, Mesa charged management with ''scorched-earth tactics'' that would give control of the company to the foundation and create ''a financial catastrophe for G.A.O.'' General American had contended earlier that its $50-a-share offer might make the oil and gas company less attractive to Mesa and ''could cause Mesa to terminate'' its $40 offer. Mesa said that the $50 offer provided that shares could not be withdrawn after Jan. 7, but would not be paid for until at least Jan. 21. Mesa argued that General American could thus have control during that time of more than half the stock, including the shares held by the Meadows Foundation, without having paid for it. Mesa asked the court to enjoin the offer, nullify bylaw changes that strengthen management and to cancel hefty severance payments for all employees in the event of a Mesa takeover. General American, calling the charges ''frivolous,'' said the suit was a ''typical knee-jerk reaction by someone trying to buy a company at an inadequate price.''

927-> Money Funds Show Decline
The assets of the nation's money market funds dropped $309 million in the four days through Tuesday, to $230.9 billion, the Investment Company Institute announced yesterday. It released the data a day earlier than usual because of the Veterans Day holiday. The data are normally based on the five weekdays ending each Wednesday. The decline followed four consecutive weekly increases. The institute noted that, even with the decline, the net gain in assets for the five-week period has been $6.2 billion. The decline came in the institutional funds category, with 45 of them reporting a total drop of $631 million, reducing total assets to $44.2 billion. Analysts have said that much of the money being invested in the stock market recently has come from institutions. The 152 general purpose funds, including one new one, added $239 million, raising assets to $72.8 billion, while the 70 broker-dealer funds gained $83 million, to $113.8 billion in assets. The Donoghue Money Fund Report, an industry newsletter that calculates yields on the money market funds, said it would announce the latest yields today.

928-> ARTIFICIAL HEART PATIENT HAS BEST DAY SINCE 1st OPERATION
Dr. Barney B. Clark stood up, with assistance, and bore some of his weight on his own feet today for the first time since he received an artificial heart on Dec. 2. Dr. Clark had no apparent periods of mental lapse in what his doctors said was his brightest day since he suffered several seizures Dec. 7. His mental improvement was apparent to his family, particularly to his son, Dr. Steven Clark, a Seattle surgeon. ''He feels the man he is talking to is his father,'' said Dr. Chase N. Peterson, the University of Utah vice president for health sciences. It was also the second consecutive day Dr. Clark, a 61-year-old retired dentist, showed unambiguous signs of progress in his recovery from complications following the implantation of the mechanical device. Dr. Clark sat in a chair for 30 minutes again this morning. With him were his wife, Una Loy Clark, and Dr. Clark and his wife, Terry. Felt Much Better After Dr. Clark returned to bed, he told Dr. William C. DeVries, the surgeon who leads the team caring for him, how much better he felt because he had sat in a chair for the second time in two days. He also sipped water for the first time since Dec. 14, when he had an emergency operation to replace the left side of the artificial heart. The operation was necessary because a valve had broken. Because ''things have gone so well in the last 36 hours, the doctors would keep moving'' to increase Dr. Clark's physical activity and to begin to let him eat, Dr. Peterson said. Today, for example, they arranged to let Dr. Clark drink juice. He gets most of his nourishment, of up to 3,000 calories a day, through a feeding tube. Tube Restricts Speaking Dr. Clark can only mouth words. He cannot speak normally because he has a hole called a tracheostomy in the front of his throat. A tube connected to a respirator enters that hole. But Dr. Clark is breathing on his own, although he is still connected to the respirator. As a protective measure, the respirator is set in such a way that it can take over if he does not breath on his own. Because Dr. DeVries wants Dr. Clark to sleep well, he prescribed a very small dose of Valium, 2.5 milligrams, Friday night, and it seemed to help him sleep very well, Dr. Peterson said. Last night, the same dose had no effect, Dr. Peterson said, so Dr. DeVries increased it to 5 milligrams, still a small dose. Dr. Peterson said the change reflected ''the restlessness that is appropriate'' to his improving condition. ''The more progress he makes, the more he can make, and the more strength he gets, the more he will be active,'' Dr. Peterson said. Dr. Peterson said that the publicity Dr. Clark and his family have received has been ''a positive factor'' in his recovery. Today was Dr. Clark's 18th day since the polyurethane heart was implanted. It has beaten more than 2 million times in his body.

932-> ART MUSEUM SHIFTS CHIEFS
Pontus Hulten's reign as director of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art will end next March, even before the museum opens. The board of trustees has appointed him founding director and named Richard Koshalek, now deputy director and chief curator, to replace him. Mr. Hulten has accepted French President Francois Mitterrand's request to direct the artistic-cultural program of the 1989 World's Fair in Paris, where Mr. Hulten served from 1973 to 1981 as the first director of the Centre Georges Pompidou. As founding director, Mr. Hulten's involvement with the Los Angeles museum will be half-time from March 1983 to March 1984 and one-quarter time thereafter. He expects to continue his involvement with the museum while living and working half the year abroad. ''I am very pleased the board has been able to develop an arrangement whereby I can accept Mr. Mitterrand's invitation but still be actively involved with the museum as it moves towards realization,'' said Mr. Hulten, a native of Sweden who is formerly the director of the Museum of Modern Art in Stockholm. 'Adviser on Whole Process' ''I will continue to work with the whole museum but I will concentrate on some aspects,'' he added, citing the creation of the temporary galleries and the museum's first two shows. ''I can do a lot of things while traveling, such as making contacts. I will continue to be an adviser on the whole process. The idea for the Museum of Contemporary Art originated three and half years ago, when several prominent collectors and Mayor Thomas Bradley decided that Los Angeles needed a museum in contemporary art. The museum subsequently became part of a $1 billion development project in the Bunker Hill section of downtown Los Angeles. Among the roughly 50 works of post-World War ll art now in the permanent collection are paintings by Frank Stella and Morris Louis and sculptures by Mark di Suvero and Donald Judd. ''Pontus will continue to be involved in the building of the collection,'' Mr. Koshalek said. Ground-breaking for the museum is expected to take place in April 1983. The museum intends to open with a range of exhibitions and performing arts programs in the fall of 1983 in temporary quarters in some downtown warehouses, with a range of exhibitions and performing art programs. Mr. Koshalek was formerly curator at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and director of the Fort Worth Art Museum. In 1976 he took over as director of the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, where he invited artists, writers and composers to help organize exhibitions and programs. He has been with the Los Angeles museum since 1980.

933-> AROUND THE WORLD; Iran Says Its Artillery Pounded Iraqis in South
The Teheran radio said today that Iranian artillery pounded Iraqi military positions on the Shatt al Arab waterway in southern Iraq in the last 24 hours. The radio said the Iranians killed 15 Iraqi soldiers and destroyed military targets in the fighting. In Baghdad, an Iraqi military communique said that Iraqi fighter planes and helicopter gunships killed 41 Iranians. The Iraqis said the air strikes in the southern and central sectors of the front in the Persian Gulf war also caused heavy Iranian losses of equipment. The Teheran radio, quoting a military communique, said antiaircraft batteries drove off Iraqi planes trying to bomb targets in Iran. The radio, in a broadcast monitored in London, said the two warring nations were engaged in artillery duels across their border.

935-> A VIVID AS WELL AS GRAPHIC ARTIST
ROCKWELL KENT An Anthology of His Work. Edited by Fridolf Johnson. 358 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $60. He was a painter, an industrial design draftsman, a muralist, a writer, an architect and builder, a successful dairy farmer, an explorer and even something of a musician. But it is as an illustrator of books that Rockwell Kent was best known. His powerful and innovative book graphics, which included everything from full-page lithographs and wood engravings to borders, capitals and bookplates, have had great influence on the entire range of graphic arts in this country for three generations. Beginning in 1914, with ''Architectonics: The Tales of Tom Thumbtack, Architect,'' Kent illustrated 37 volumes during more than 55 years as a book artist. They included not only his own books of travel and adventure but such famous works as Casanova's ''Memoirs'' (for which he supplied a portfolio of illustrations in 1925), Voltaire's ''Candide,'' Thornton Wilder's ''The Bridge of San Luis Rey,'' Alexander Pushkin's ''Gabriel,'' Herman Melville's ''Moby Dick,'' Chaucer's ''The Canterbury Tales,'' Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass,'' Goethe's ''Faust,'' ''Beowulf,'' Shakespeare's ''Venus and Adonis'' and an edition of his complete plays. It is obviously fitting that in the centenary year of Kent's birth there should be the magnificently printed ''Rockwell Kent.'' The editor, Fridolf Johnson, was trained as an artist himself, and this book is a rare feat of bookmaking, with 400 very large reproductions that are not only lavish in presentation but meticulously accurate and printed on specially made papers, hand-sewn and magnificently bound. For those who love his prints and drawings it is pure treasure. But it has also 90 reproductions in color of paintings, many of them reproduced here for the first time. Kent, of course, was not only a superb artist but a great prankster, a true Yankee eccentric and a very controversial political figure. During World War I the Canadians drove him from a home he had built in the Maritime Provinces because they suspected he was a spy for Germany. During and after World War II he was widely denounced by superpatriots in this country as a dangerous sympathizer with the Soviet Union. In some ways he obviously enjoyed this sort of controversy; on his passport application he refused to answer the question whether he was or ever had been a Communist, and he fought the State Department before the Supreme Court, which ruled finally that neither he nor any American citizen had to answer such a question. But in some ways he was hurt too. Infuriated at American galleries and institutions that shunned his art because of the political controversies he was embroiled in, he gave an enormous collection of his work to the Soviet Union in the 60's. His gift made him a popular hero in Russia and, to be sure, in the Kremlin. He also wrote a few deliberately provocative books, not only about politics but about his own life. He added to the popular confusion about him by his own occasional obfuscation of dates, times and places and a few contradictions about his own thinking and intentions. But Fridolf Johnson has interspersed among the splendid reproductions in this volume pages from Kent's writings, letters and notes that, along with Mr. Johnson's own brief biography of the artist, clear up virtually all the mysteries. All in all, it is a fine 100th birthday tribute to a thoughtful, troublesome, profoundly independent, odd and kind man who made an imperishable contribution to the art of bookmaking in the United States. - D.J.R.B.

937-> OUR MAN FROM ALASKA GOES OVER BIG IN BRASILIA
When Langhorne Anthony Motley was named the United States Ambassador to Brazil a year ago, a lot of people grumbled. ''I know, I was one of them,'' said Lowell C. Kilday, director of the State Department's Office of Brazilian Affairs in Washington. ''A lot of eyebrows were raised. We looked at Brazil, the most important country in Latin America, and thought, 'What's going on around here sending a guy like that?' '' In Brasilia, the outgoing Ambassador, Robert M. Sayre, was asked by the Federal Reserve Board head, Paul A. Volcker, then visiting Brazil, who his successor would be. ''Some real estate agent from Alaska,'' was the acid response, according to two other people who participated in the conversation. The Complaints Are Qualified A land developer, Republican Party stalwart and former Air Force officer, Mr. Motley came here from Anchorage as one of the host of political appointees with which the Reagan Administration has filled its ambassadorial ranks - to the distress of many career diplomats like Mr. Sayre. The American Foreign Service Association says that one of every three such appointments have been going to noncareer people under President Reagan after the Carter Administration had succeeded in reducing the number to one in every four. But today the complaining in State Department corridors over the phenomenon carries a conversational asterisk exempting Mr. Motley. In a year he has gained extraordinary access to the highest levels of the Brazilian Government, earned the high regard of other ambassadors in Brasilia, won over the most traditional diplomats in his own embassy and gained the singular tribute of being hailed as ''our'' Ambassador by a major Brazilian newspaper. He played a principal role in setting up President Reagan's coming trip here, dealing directly with Brazil's president, Jaoa Baptista Figueiredo, by White House telephone while the Brazilian leader was campaigning in interior cities for candidates in elections held Nov. 15. If the two Presidents follow the practice of their first meeting in Washington in May, Mr. Motley will be doing the translating when they get together in Brasilia Dec.1. Brazilian Background a Help Mr. Motley has brought to his assignment one great advantage. Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, he speaks fluent Portuguese down to the accompanying gestures and unprintable expressions. ''A lot of Brazilian editors have told me they have to clean up his interviews,'' an embassy press officer said. Secure knowledge of the local tongue, impatience with diplomatic formalities, and a feel for gossip and barracks room humor can get you a long way with Brazil's ruling military, and that is where Mr. Motley has gone. He has driven his pickup out to Mr. Figueiredo's farm on a number of occasions for drinks with the President himself or barbecue lunches with the presidential palace ''grupo'' that runs the country. State Department officials said the embassy reporting from Brazil had grown far more informed and other ambassadors in Brasilia have been making it their habit to drop in on Mr. Motley for briefings before they take their home-leave trips. ''When Motley first came, I wasn't prepared to be impressed,'' said one. ''Who is this Republican businessman, I thought. But I've grown to have a lot of respect for him.'' Mr. Motley has become a familiar figure in Brazilian public life because of his willingness to talk to the press and to be interviewed on television. He earned the admiring editorial in Sao Paulo's Jornal da Tarde after making speeches to business and banking groups in the United States arguing that Brazil's economy was being unjustly compared to those of Mexico and Argentina. The newspaper complimented Mr. Motley for doing a job that it said should have been expected from Brazil's own Ambassador in Washington, Antonio Azeredo da Silveira, a former Foreign Minster with a history of feuding with the United States. Telling It Like It Is The son of a former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Rio, Mr. Motley has gotten high marks from the sizable American business colony for his combative response to Brazilian charges that United States protectionism is crippling the economy here. ''He really tells it like it is and we appreciate that,'' said Joseph W. O'Neill, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo. Mr. Motley commonly points out that millions of Americans wear Brazilian shoes and challenges critics to find any Brazilians in American footwear. He also notes that so many Bandeirante aircraft have been sold to American commuter airlines that there are now more Americans than Brazilians flying in such planes. Forty-four years old and boyish-looking, he dresses in loafers and loose-fitting suits and often walks around with his hands thrust into his trouser pockets. It has not been uncommon for people to ask him where the Ambassador is. Known as Tony, he said that even his mother never called him Langhorne. She is half-Brazilian and half-British and still lives in Rio. His father, an executive with Atlantic Refining in Rio, died in 1950 in a plane crash in Porto Alegre. 10 Years in the Air Force Mr. Motley lived in Rio until leaving for college at the Citadel in Charleston, S.C., when he was 17. He spent the 10 years after graduation in the Air Force before retiring to civilian life and helping create the largest real estate company in Alaska. He served for two years as the state's Secretary of Commerce and Economic Development and then spent four years lobbying in Washington against environmental groups in the Alaska lands debate. He has worked closely with the Alaskan Senators, Ted Stevens and Frank H. Murkowski, each a Republican. In 1978 he and Senator Stevens were the only survivors of a plane crash in Anchorage that took five lives. He is outgoing and informal and works a room like a politician. ''I've never seen a political appointee who got to know so many people so fast,'' said Mr. Kilday. He plays soccer with the handymen and gardeners and opens his residence pool on weekends to embassy staffers who live in Brasilia's faceless ''superquadra'' apartment buildings. For July 4 this year, he gave a party for more than 2,000 people at his house with American beer and baked beans, parachute jumps, square dancing and treasure hunts. ''He had everyone there from Cabinet officers to janitors,'' an embassy staffer said.

938-> Under 40
To the Editor: It isn't a crime to speak of writers in terms of a generation, since, after all, writers of roughly the same age have had experiences in common, and such experiences tend to influence a writer's work. In his letter (Nov. 14) C. David Heymann takes John Irving to task for having referred to writers ''under 40'' in reviewing a book of mine. The tone of his comments are out of all proportion to whatever objections a reasonable man might have to such a phrase. The fact of the matter is that John Irving is a serious, gifted writer who has a large popular following and who has been generous in his praise of other writers. Such a combination is too much for Mr. Heymann and others like him, and they become desperate to establish nit-picking opposition. They ... give living proof of Ambrose Bierce's remark that eccentricity is a means of distinction so shallow that only fools use it to demonstrate their incapacity. CRAIG NOVA c/o Sanford J.

940-> A Moving Delay Costs Finance Unit a Bonus
The city's Finance Department started shifting about half of its offices from Manhattan to Brooklyn yesterday. The move is costing the city more than expected, and it leaves behind a building whose future is far from certain. Renovation of the Brooklyn building, which will accommodate about 1,200 employees, cost $1.9 million more than expected. And, because the renovation work at 345 Adams Street in downtown Brooklyn took longer than planned, the agency lost a $1 million bonus for leaving Manhattan this weekend. The bonus was offered last March by the Bank Leumi Trust Company of New York, which had planned to use the Manhattan offices, at 139 Centre Street, as an operations and computer center. The bank, whose application for a tax abatement has been given a negative recommendation by the staff of the Commercial Incentive Board, had been anxious to make it own move, but now says that it may move its offices to Garden City, L.I. In a recent letter to the incentive board, which has not yet ruled on the abatement request, the bank said that the project might no longer be ''economically justifiable,'' especially without a tax abatement. It also cited the lower rents in Garden City and the city's proposal to build a jail across from the Centre Street building.

941-> LIEDER: HERMANN PREY AND SCHUBERT
THE world of German lieder is small, serious and hieratic. Its practitioners guard the tradition like a sacred scroll, and audiences treat them like priests. One of today's chief priests is Hermann Prey, who at 53 years old seems to be improving with age, and who brought a programmatically satisfying, interpretively fulfilling evening of Schubert songs to the 92d Street Y ,ast night. Throughout his career, Mr. Prey has been dogged by the inescapable spectre of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, whose position, mostly for better but sometimes for worse, as the quintessential lieder singer of the day - and the standard against which all his contemporary competition must be measured - has cast Mr. Prey into an inevitably subsidiary role. But the two men's technique and style are actually very different, and in Mr. Prey's vocal maturity his virtues, and especially his virtues in comparison with his rival, become ever more apparent. Mr. Prey has a strong, forthright, operatic baritone with a curious larmoyant quality, and he has preserved his youthful strength of voice without audible deterioration. His timbre seems to have darkened slightly over the years, however. This allows him to sing Schubert's grander, more masculine songs - like ''Prometheus,'' which he offered last night - in a manner far preferable to the hollow bluster Mr. Fischer-Dieskau must muster in the same repertory. Conversely, Mr. Prey lacks the ideal lyrical grace, wit and charm. Mr. Fischer-Dieskau provides a flawed alternative, since with him even the most innocent songs are compromised by selfconsciousness. But there is a pervasive, four-square stolidity to Mr. Prey's singing that his deepened artistry only partially overcomes. Still, last night's recital, accompanied in an admirable if sometimes rather clipped manner by Helmut Deutsch, was a winning one. Mr. Prey's program was devoted entirely to Schubert settings of poetry by Goethe, in honor of the 150th anniversary of the poet's death. The songs ranged from 1814 to 1822 and covered the widest possible spectrum of moods, from the dark and tragic to the lyrical and loving to narrative parables to cosmic philosophizing. Schubert has sometimes been slighted for the seeming naivete of his Goethe settings: ''Walking by the great man's side, the child of genius does not necessarily take in all he is saying,'' wrote Richard Capell, the author of a book on Schubert's songs, as quoted in the Y's program notes. But all lieder settings are fated to lack the complexity of great poetry; words dart more quickly, if less profoundly, than tones. What makes Goethe and Schubert so compatible is the way they disguise subtlety and complexity beneath simple, even childlike surfaces. No one has ever written clearer, more lucid German than Goethe, and no one has ever come forth with weightier ''Germanic'' thoughts. Schubert may have been a more innocent soul, but his music, too, wedded heart and hidden meaning. Mr. Prey's insight into this symbiosis was never in question last night, and he conveyed that insight with singing that was commanding from a technical standpoint and deeply considered, interpretively. Technically, his mezza voce effects and ability to sustain a legato line in the hushed quiet of ''Meeres Stille'' sounded especially beautiful. And interpretively, perhaps the high point came with his tour de force in ''Erlkonig,'' which ended the first half of the recital. Here, his skill at differentiating four characters - narrator, father, child and ghost - and at containing them all within one, coherent, ongoing statement, was little less than masterly.

942-> Bridge: Greenberg Team Captures Winter Regional Knockout
A formidable quintet headed by Alan Greenberg of New York captured the Winter Regional Knockout Team title at the New York Hilton Saturday night. Teamed with him were Ira Rubin of Paramus, N.J., and Fred Hamilton of Hollywood, Fla., both 1976 world champions, and Jim Cayne and Alan Sontag of New York. In the final match, decided by a strong first half, they won by 33 international match points against John Lowenthal, Phillip Martin, Drew Casen and Bob Blanchard, all of New York. On some deals the task of deciding whether the right final contract was reached may not be entirely clear even in the post-mortem. On the diagramed deal from the knockout final a violently competitive auction developed after South had chosen a semi-psychic opening of one diamond. He was decidedly short of the normal high-card values for a one-bid, but he certainly had distributional power. Settling for a Penalty Cayne, as West, made a pre-@emptive jump to two spades, and later took the opportunity to cue-bid diamonds. The partnership eventually reached six spades, but South carried on to seven diamonds. West's pass suggested a grand slam effort, but Sontag, as East, decided to settle for a penalty. The defense had no trouble taking three tricks for a penalty of 500. The post-mortem argument centered on whether East should have ventured seven spades. This would probably have gained 17 points, although the declarer might have been lured by South's opening bid into an attempt to drop a singleton spade king. A failure in the grand slam would have led to a loss of 12 I.M.P.'s, for in the replay the contract was again seven diamonds doubled after rapid auction beginning with five diamonds. If the grand slam was an even money chance, the odds of 17-12 would be most attractive. But the opening bid made it more likely than not that South held the spade king; and there was some danger of a quick heart ruff. The decision whether to bid seven would also be close in the unlikely event that North-South stayed out of the auction, as they might do with the vulnerability reversed. The point to note is that six spades is not a certainty, for a club lead would leave that contract in jeopardy. NORTH S K 6 H J 3 D K J 8 6 2 C K J 8 3 WEST EAST S A J 4 3 S Q 10 9 7 5 2 H A 10 9 7 5 4 H K Q 8 6 D Q D - C A 7 C 9 6 5 SOUTH (D) S 8 H 2 D A 10 9 7 5 4 3 C Q 10 4 2 North and South were vulnerable.

943-> Chemical Benefits
The Chemical Bank subsidiary of the Chemical New York Corporation said it had created a flexible benefits plan that allows employees to purchase a range of benefits to meet individual requirements. Under the plan, employees would be free to choose extra benefits to supplement the bank's basic benefit plan. The bank said it would reimburse employees for what they spend on the optional benefits through a $300 deposit it will make to each employee's ''spending account.''

944-> Advertising; MCI Aims At Market For Pagers
MCI COMMUNICATIONS was just another competitor to Ma Bell in the long-distance phone business. Then it discovered advertising, and it quickly drew away from the rest of the pack. Next week, it is going to start testing to see whether it can do the same in the more crowded field of telephone pagers - you know, the beepers you thought only doctors wore. Gerald H. Taylor, who was vice president-marketing for the longdistance push, is now president of MCI Airsignal, the subsidiary running the pagers in 41 mostly medium to small markets. And the agency is Ally & Gargano, the same shop that is now spending the $25 million a year for the long-distance advertising. The Dallas effort breaks Monday, and will be in both newspapers and television. The headline in the full-page ad will read, ''The Greatest Tool for Business Since the Telephone.'' MCI is promoting a digital display unit that not only beeps and flashes a red light, but also supplies the phone number the subscriber is supposed to call (or any other relevant seven-digit number). New Yorkers should be familiar with the concept, since New York Bell first started advertising a similar unit here in August 1981. The TV commercials - A.& G. is preparing two 30-second ones - demonstrate the Executive Pager and promote it as a superior business tool. Both spots end up with ''So call us . . . before your competition does.'' Counting production costs, MCI is spending about $340,000 for the five-week test. Texas is the best market for the MCI long-distance phoning service but the target audience for it is different - mostly women - so the commercials ran on daytime television. Now, trying to reach the business executive, Airsignal will be running its TV spots during prime time, news and sports programming. And Gary P. Tobin, vice president-public relations for MCI, did not hesitate to remind the assembled group that only about four weeks after going into testing for the long-distance service, the program went national. Was he trying to say, ''This could happen again?''

945-> TOPICS; Overheated; Defending the Wreckers
We now have the White House's first line of defense to charges of chiseling by Reagan appointees to the Legal Services Corporation. ''There shouldn't be a Legal Services Corporation,'' declares Ed Meese, the White House counselor, apparently meaning that the way to stop excessive consultant's fees is to kill the program, intended to provide lawyers for the poor in civil cases. If you don't like that argument, he has another: The Presidential wrecking crew has been working longer hours than others who have run the program since 1974. Indeed it has -devising rules that limit the agency's role, and trying in general to put the corporation out of business. These responses border on arrogance. It is not for President Reagan to say whether this program should or should not exist. Congress rightly rejected two Administration requests to kill the corporation, sticks by the law creating it and has worked repeatedly to protect it from White House attacks. The President's duty is to faithfully exe-cute the laws - not unlawfully execute the program.

946-> Review Asked On Oil Tax
The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court today to review a ruling by a Wyoming judge that overturned the ''windfall'' oil profits tax, which has brought the Government $26 billion in revenues in two years. The Government urged the Justices to overrule the Federal judge in Cheyenne, Wyo., who struck down the tax as unconstitutional because it exempted oil produced in Alaska. The Government stands to lose sums of ''enormous magnitude'' unless the High Court acts, Acting Solicitor General Lawrence Wallace warned in legal papers released today. Mr. Wallace said the Government stood to gain $50 billion from the tax in the next five years. Six months after former President Carter signed the tax into law in April 1980, the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an organization of oil producers, and 30 other trade associations sought to have the law overturned and to obtain billions in refunds. On Nov. 4, Federal District Judge Ewing Kerr held the tax violated a clause of the Constitution that required that taxes ''be uniform throughout the United States.'' Judge Kerr stayed his ruling, allowing the Treasury Department to collect the tax while the courts resolved the issue.

947-> PRACTICAL TRAVELER: RUNNING INTO TROUBLE ABROAD
M illions of Americans travel abroad every year and a minority of them - a minority that comes to thousands of people - run into trouble of some sort or another and go to the nearest United States embassy or consulate for help. Most of the problems are mundane: a lost passport, stolen traveler's checks, an injury or an illness. Frequently, however, the problems are more complicated and, according to John Caulfield, a spokesman for the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs, they are most likely to occur in countries whose cultures or political systems are most unlike those in the United States, such as certain locations in Asia or in Communist countries. Travel in the Soviet Union, for example, can be vexing for Americans who fail to recognize that standards of conduct are different. ''It is the Soviet Union; it is not the U.S.,'' Mr. Caulfield says. ''Things will be done differently.'' For example, an American may think nothing of photographing a beautiful bridge, an immense dam or, in cinema verite, a crowded slum. In such circumstances in the Soviet Union, the American tourist can get into trouble. ''U.S. citizens have had film confiscated, been temporarily detained or interrogated, and have even been asked to leave the U.S.S.R. because of violations, usually unwittingly, of Soviet regulations on photography,'' the State Department representative cautioned. Similarly, a typical American tourist may think nothing of taking a ''souvenir'' from a hotel, such as an ashtray or a towel, but that would be considered a serious offense in the Soviet Union (and in many other countries, as well). It is puzzling to Mr. Caulfield and others why so many Americans continue to try to smuggle drugs, especially through the Soviet Union and other Eastern bloc countries, where surveillance is known to be particularly high. About all a United States embassy or consulate can do in cases like that is to notify the American's relatives and assure that the arrested people get legal counsel appropriate to the country where the offense occurred. Most problems tackled by the consulates do not involve arrests. ''We get letters every day with complaints, and we get thousands of requests for assistance,'' Mr. Caulfield says. Some of the typical problems involve the following: Dual citizenship: The United States does not recognize this, but many other countries do, with some of them maintaining that their nationality can never be ended. If, for example, an American who was born in Hungary returns there to visit relatives, he or she may find that Hungary considers the traveler both an American and a Hungarian. In that case, Hungarian nationality could subject the traveler to the draft or other laws, or similar unpleasantness. Therefore, the State Department recommends that the traveler use only a United States passport with a visa stamped in it beforehand by the foreign government, a recognition of the validity of the American passport. Such a traveler confronted by dual-nationality assertions is advised to notify the United States embassy or consulate as soon as possible. Antiques: The State Department says that most Eastern European countries, notably the Soviet Union, do not allow antiques and the like to be taken out of the country. It suggests that such souvenirs be purchased only in special tourist stores, never from someone who approaches the tourist on the street with an offer to sell an antique, a samovar or an icon. The object may very likely be a fake and, even if it is real, it may be confiscated by the Russian Government and the traveler may be detained. Sales: Many American travelers are approached on Russian streets and asked to sell their clothing, which is popular in the Soviet Union and hard to come by. Such sales are illegal, the State Department says, and should be avoided. By the same token, black market currency exchanges are to be avoided: The rubles may be counterfeit, the exchange rate may be unfavorable instead of a bargain, and there is always the risk of a knock on the head. Besides, many governments require that tourists show receipts for currency exchanges, something hard to ask for in a dark alley. T he countries with the most American tourists - Mexico, Canada and those in Western Europe - have the most tourist problems, simply because of the number of people involved. The less-visited countries have fewer but more complicated problems. Probably the most complicated place for Americans just now is Libya, since United States passports are not valid there and Washington has advised Americans not to travel there, making it the only country now in that category. Someone who got in trouble in Libya would have no place to turn to for assistance. While it is not illegal for Americans to travel to Cuba, Iran, Vietnam and Albania, very few do so, and little or no assistance is available to those who do. There are many things that an embassy or consulate can do to assist a traveler in difficulty. If a passport is lost or stolen, a duplicate can usually be issued within a day. If it is a non-Englishspeaking country, there will be lists of English-speaking doctors and lawyers available to help. The embassies and consulates are not there to help American tourists make hotel reservations or select restaurants, however. One tourist from Manhattan's Lower East Side recently wrote to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato to praise the staff of the United States Consulate in Genoa, Italy, for coming to her aid when her purse was snatched. The consulate employees took her to an English-speaking doctor for treatment and then helped her file her report with the police. In addition, they got her passport reissued quickly and helped her book a room back in the hotel that she had checked out of before her purse was snatched. Another New Yorker, Norman Lieberman of Brooklyn, was not fortunate enough to have been near a consulate when he ran into trouble in the Soviet Union, but his difficulties serve to illustrate some of the potential problems faced there by American tourists. Mr. Lieberman was detained by the K.G.B., the Soviet security and intelligence organization, after he took photos of an outdoor market in Odessa in the Ukraine. ''I had read the brochure put out by the tour agency and I understood that I should not take pictures of railroad yards,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''But I hardly thought that an open-air market in Odessa would be objectionable.'' On reflection, Mr. Lieberman believes he made two mistakes: going out without the Soviet Intourist guide, which supposedly is permissible, and then taking so many pictures, 17 exposures, perhaps, that some K.G.B. agents became suspicious. ''And I was well dressed, so I stood out,'' Mr. Lieberman says. To add insult to his injury - being hustled off to a K.G.B. station, questioned and having to give up his film - Mr. Lieberman says he apparently was the subject of an attempted shakedown by one of the K.G.B. agents, who followed him into his cab and said in English, ''Nikon ... present ... me,'' but Mr. Lieberman held on to his camera. The State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs has published a free pamphlet for American tourists to the Soviet Union, ''Tips for Travelers to the U.S.S.R.'' It can be obtained by writing, preferably on a postcard, to the Passport Service, State Department, Room 386, 1425 K Street N.W., Washington, D.C. 20524. Other pamphlets in the ''Tips for Travelers'' series cover the Caribbean, China, Cuba, Eastern Europe, Greece and Mexico, and they can be obtained at the same address. The Bureau of Consular Affairs has other free brochures with helpful advice - ''Your Trip Abroad,'' ''Travel Tips for Senior Citizens'' and ''Travel Warning on Drugs Abroad.'' They can be obtained by sending a postcard to the bureau at the State Department, Room 6811, Washington, D.C. 20520.

948-> BROOKS SHAKING UP LINE COMBINATIONS
When a hockey coach starts juggling his line combinations, it is sometimes a sign of panic and sometimes an attempt to slap complacent players into more-alert performances. Herb Brooks is changing the Rangers' combinations. But despite the team's five losses in its first seven games, he insists he is not panicking and is not punishing his players. He says that an evaluation of how each line has been working has convinced him that they all can work better. ''If it's not broken, don't fix it,'' he said after Sunday night's 5-3 loss to Los Angeles at Madison Square Garden. ''But it looks pretty broken to me.'' Brooks has an additional reason to make line changes: Robbie Ftorek is ready to return after missing several weeks with a groin pull. Ftorek, a center, led the team in playoff scoring last spring with seven goals and four assists. And his line mates finished second and fourth among Ranger playoff scorers, Don Maloney with 10 points, Eddie Johnstone with 8. Those three will be reunited for Wednesday night's home game against Vancouver, Brooks said. That means Mike Rogers, who has been centering for Maloney and Johnstone, will get new wings. In practice yesterday, Rogers played between Anders Hedberg and Kent-Erik Andersson, which was an extension of a change Brooks began Sunday night. For Sunday's game, which followed an 8-2 loss in Montreal the previous night, Brooks made one major shift among the forwards. He moved Rob McClanahan, a fleet left wing, off Ulf Nilsson's line with Hedberg and onto Mark Pavelich's line, with Ron Duguay at right wing. Andersson then moved into McClanahan's spot with Nilsson and Hedberg. Switching Rogers to be the center for Andersson and Hedberg means a demotion for Nilsson, who is still struggling to recover from a knee operation that sidelined him all last season. ''I talked it over with Ulf and he understands the situation,'' said Brooks. ''He's the type of player who can turn things around in the playoffs, or late in the season, a world-class player. But right now he's struggling a little. His skating is a step behind, and when he gets into traffic, he doesn't have that solid base under him for the grinding game. ''It's not that he's floating - he's working as hard as he can, and that's obvious. Down the road a bit, we'll look at his performance again and decide whether to increase his ice time.'' Also demoted by these changes was Mikko Leinonen. ''We've got four guys for three spots on the fourth line,'' Brooks said, referring to Leinonen, Nilsson, Mike Allison and Nick Fotiu. ''Actually it's three guys for two spots, because we like to keep Nicky in the lineup.'' Fotiu sets an example for the others, because, despite his limited ice time and talent, he tries harder than almost anyone else. ''The big difference between us and the Islanders is that everyone on their team knows how to body-check,'' Barry Beck said Sunday night. ''I don't mean trying to ram people through the boards; I just mean taking the body. We've got to do that more, to show each other we really want to help each other by being willing to go in the corners, to get hit, to get some stitches, even.''

950-> Hasty Tailoring for Jobs
Suddenly, everyone has a plan to reduce unemployment. House Democrats unveiled theirs yesterday. Senate Republicans are perfecting theirs. The Department of Transportation has one, the Labor Department another. Even President Reagan is finally thinking beyond his ''stay the course'' slogan. It's all a healthy showing of concern, but it has an unhealthy tinge of political jockeying. Nothing would be more hollow than to lunge for a quick jobs package that produces little new employment, and more inflation. The jobless rate, 10.4 percent in October, is almost certainly still rising. The economic outlook remains limp. Yet the electiondriven urge to do something propels proposals of every kind: Create more job training or curtail illegal immigrants; promote exports or curtail imports (Detroit's protectionist local-content bill); increase Federal funding for research or for ''enterprise zones.'' For the moment, the most fashionable approach is public works projects, for highways and bridges, for instance. What was once known as pork-barrel is now costumed as ''infrastructure.'' Before Congress gets carried away in a trendy tide, there is need for some honest cost-benefit analysis. Take public works. The nation's highways certainly need repair, but how much unemployment would such a program relieve? It would be slow to crank up, could cost billions and create jobs for only a fraction of the 11-plus million out of work. Or take immigration. The Simpson-Mazzoli bill, which we strongly favor, would reduce the flow of illegal workers, at very small cost. In any case, no single remedy holds the answer. Public works programs would help one segment of the unemployed, immigration reform another. Whichever remedy, or package of remedies, is most effective, the money must come from somewhere. The good news out of Washington is that the Administration now takes seriously a rise in the gasoline tax. That would have double merit. It would raise revenue and conserve oil. On both counts, the bigger the better, and let it not be used only for roads and bridges. Inflation is only dormant, not dead, and the deficit must be reduced at the very time that new spending programs are added. To do this, Congress must cut into military spending, insure that Social Security is adequately funded, curb the runaway costs of health programs and look hard at next year's scheduled tax cut. It's a formidable agenda, made more so by mounting joblessness. The unemployment problem reaches almost all sectors of the economy. None of the new proposals could generate jobs as much as a solid upswing and no measure could come into play as quickly as a further drop in interest rates. Jobs programs are worth pursuing, but they can only help a little, and only if cut with more care than the hasty tailors in Washington have so far displayed.

951-> LINE IS BETTER WITH AGE
SAN DIEGO THEY have this pact: That they will all play until they are 40 years old and then retire. Or, maybe, they won't retire at 40. If Russ Washington, Doug Wilkerson and Ed White can maintain their current level of play, why should they retire? They are three-fifths of the offensive line of the San Diego Chargers, and they have made Dan Fouts the quarterback least likely to be abused by the defensive players. Washington, the right tackle in his 15th season, is 36; White, the right guard in his 14th season, and Wilkerson, the left guard in his 13th season, are 35. After tonight's game against the Cincinnati Bengals, in a rematch of last season's American Football Conference championship game, they will have played in 563 National Football League games combined. Add the experience of the left tackle, Billy Shields, an eighthyear player who is 29, and the center Don Macek, a seventh-year player who is 28, and the total games played is 770. At the moment, not a team in the league has an older line, and not a team in the league has a better one at protecting its quarterback. In four victories and two defeats this season, Fouts has thrown 222 passes and has been sacked five times. That is an average of one sack every 44 passes. He has not been dropped since the Denver Broncos got to him three weeks and 88 passes ago. In three of the six games, Fouts has not been sacked. ''I expect not to get touched in a game, just as they expect that I don't get touched,'' said Fouts, the starting quarterback since his rookie season in 1973. ''I guess I'm spoiled.'' Fouts has a great reverence for his line, and its members for him. They have dinner together the night before every game. If Fouts has not been sacked in the previous game, he pays the check. If he has been sacked, the linemen pay. It is a tradition that began in 1979, the first of three consecutive seasons in which Fouts passed for more than 4,000 yards, and in no way is the dinner patronizing. Last winter, after the Chargers lost to the Bengals in the title game, Fouts and the linemen were honored at a local dinner. When it was Fouts's turn to speak, he moved to stand behind the linemen, who were seated as they would line up at the line of scrimmage. Fouts opened his remarks by saying, ''I feel more comfortable behind my guys.'' ''Dan is a very sincere man,'' said White, the most loquacious of the three elders and the last one to join the Chargers, coming in a trade from the Minnesota Vikings in 1978. ''He seems to have an offensive lineman's mentality, that is, he's not lofty because of the fact he's the quarterback. He's down to earth. He likes hanging around the linemen, and that makes us feel good.'' Washington, Wilkerson and White have more in common than a rapport with their quarterback and longevity. They also have had remarkably parallel careers. Each began as a defensive lineman, each suffered a knee injury when he was past the age of 30 and each has played in the Pro Bowl. Their personalities, however, are remarkably different. Washington, the largest of the three at 6 feet 7 inches tall and 295 pounds, joined the Chargers as a first-round draft choice from Missouri in 1968. He played defensive tackle for two seasons before he was switched to offensive right tackle, where he has played and started ever since, except for the 10 games he missed in 1980 because of a knee injury. His teammates call him Big Roo, because his initials are R.E.W. ''He's the most introverted of the three of us,'' said Wilkerson, who is known as Big Moosie. Many of the Chargers are known as Big Something or Other. White is Big Ed. Fouts described Washington as a ''quiet prankster'' and a man whom ''I have never seen mad.'' Fouts also said Washington was ''the best athlete I have ever seen for a man his size.'' White added: ''Roo is an extremely fluid athlete, who stymies people, engulfs them on the line.'' In the offseason, Washington, his wife, Inez, and their two children live in the South Pacific on Truk Island, not far from Guam. Washington's favorite sport after football is scuba diving, which is about all there is to do on the island. ''There,'' said Washington, ''I'm out of touch with the rest of the world. It's nice and quiet and relaxing.'' Wilkerson, who is 6-3 and weighs 258, was the Houston Oilers' first-round draft choice in 1970 from North Carolina Central, and as a rookie, he played defensive end. The Oilers traded him to the Chargers after the season for a tight end, Willie Frazier. Wilkerson replaced Bill Lenkaitis at left guard in the first exhibition game of 1971 and has been there ever since, except for the four games he missed in 1979 with a knee injury. If White, the former N.F.L. arm-wrestling champion, is stronger than Wilkerson, as White insisted he was, it is not by much. Wilkerson has the arms of a longshoreman. ''I work out a great deal, lifting weights in the offseason,'' Wilkerson said. ''I like to take care of my body.'' He also has unusual speed for an offensive lineman. ''I know he can run a 4.8 40,'' said White, meaning 4.8 seconds for a 40-yard dash. ''He may be faster.'' Wilkerson was somewhere between Washington the introvert and White the extrovert. During offseasons, Wilkerson has worked for the San Diego Chamber of Commerce as director of membership. White, who is 6-2 and 279, came to the Chargers as the result of a contract dispute with the Vikings, who had drafted him on the second round in 1969 from the University of California and switched him from a defensive lineman. After the trade, in which the Vikings received the running back Rickey Young, White replaced Macek at right guard, and Macek replaced Ralph Perretta at center, thereby establishing the current line. In addition to his skills, White brought to San Diego big-game experience. He played on four Super Bowl teams with the Vikings. Not coincidentally, in his first season with the Chargers, they finished with a 9-7 record, their first winning season in nine years. In regular-season games from 1979 through today, the Chargers are 37-17. ''Big Ed,'' said Fouts, ''borders on genius. He has a real quick mind, real creative. We talk a lot about business together. He's got big ideas and a lot of things going for himself. As a player, he's one of the toughest guys I have ever seen.'' As a pro, White has played beside only three tackles on a regular basis: Grady Alderman, when White played left guard for Minnesota from 1969 through 1973; Ron Yary, when he played right guard until the trade, and Washington. As a Charger, White has started all but one game, against Denver in 1978, which he missed with a knee injury. During the offseason, he has been a landscape engineer. Two of his more recent projects were lawns around the homes of Fouts and Ed Luther, the backup quarterback. Dave Levy coaches the offensive linemen. He was formerly an assistant coach under John McKay and then an associate athletic director at Southern California, and he had never worked in the N.F.L. before Don Coryell, the coach of the Chargers, hired him in 1980. Last season, the Chargers allowed the fewest sacks in the league, 19. Levy described his job as one of an observer. He said he refined his players' skills, relating to them, ''as dancers, musicians and golfers.'' ''We don't blow assignments here,'' Levy said. ''I can count on one hand the number of assignments blown since I have been here. That speaks very well of our practices. After all their years, these three people still study well in our movie meetings, and don't sit back and say: 'I have played against this guy for 10 years. I know what he does.' These guys have no ego problems.'' Fouts, more than all the other Chargers, has benefited most from the line's success. Since White arrived, he has never completed fewer than 58.8 percent of his passes. This season, he is at 64.4, which would be his best ever. ''What sets these guys apart,'' he said of all five linemen, ''is the way they communicate without even talking during a play. They have a great feel for the game. Sure, I expect them to retire some time when they see fit. And when they do, well, I'll just be thankful they stuck around as long as they did.''

952-> CUOMO HAS PLANS ON TRANSIT FARE THAT HE HOPES CAN END DEADLOCK
With tonight set as the deadline for keeping the current New York City and suburban commuter transit fares, Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo said yesterday that he was prepared to step in with compromise proposals that he hoped would resolve the deadlock over transit financing in Albany. Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said they would convene at 6 P.M. today and were prepared to hold ''an allnight vigil, if necessary,'' while the Legislature meets, debates and - they hope - reaches a compromise. On the M.T.A. agenda will be a proposal to raise the 75-cent subway and bus fare to $1 and to increase by 50 percent fares on the lines to Long Island and to Westchester and other northern suburbs. The $1 fare in the city could go into effect by tomorrow night. Commuter fares would rise on Jan. 1. Mr. Cuomo declined to detail the compromises he had in mind. ''I have 111 ideas,'' he said, ''but you don't address them until you have to.'' Reasons for Optimism When asked about his positive outlook in the face of rising transit deficits and legislative impasses in both Washington and Albany, Mr. Cuomo - who survived two close challenges to win the election for Governor - said, ''After the year I've had, how could I not be optimistic?'' Richard Ravitch, the chairman of the M.T.A., said that the authority must present a balanced budget to the State Financial Control Board by 11 A.M. tomorrow. He said the budget would be balanced either through increased Government subsidies or through fare increases. Disagreements over two possible save-the-fare plans - one put forward by Democrats and the other by Republicans - account for the legislative deadlock. On Thursday night, the Democratic-controlled Assembly passed a tax of 44 cents on every $100 of payroll on private employers in the 12 counties served by the M.T.A. But the Republicans, who dominate the State Senate, rejected the tax and said they would return to Albany today to pass a one-half percentage point increase in the sales tax in the region. The sales tax in New York City is 8 1/4 percent. It is lower in suburban areas. Both plans would raise roughly $225 million toward closing the M.T.A.'s $300 million deficit through the end of 1983. Taken with an anticipated $75 million increase in Federal transit operating assistance, M.T.A. officials said fares could be held at current levels until 1984. With the Democrats and Republicans both wanting to help hold fares, but offering different solutions, some compromise plans were put forth over the weekend. One compromise involved a combination of the two taxes. The payroll tax would be imposed in the five counties, or boroughs, of New York City, while the sales tax would be levied in the seven suburban counties - Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Rockland and Orange. In this way, revenue would be raised through one tax in the city to close the $187 million deficit of the Transit Authority, the M.T.A. subsidiary that runs the city's subways and buses. A second tax in the suburban counties would close the $113 million deficit on the Long Island Rail Road and the Harlem, Hudson and New Haven Divisions. Manfred Ohrenstein, the Manhattan Democrat who is minority leader of the State Senate, said he had offered the two-tax compromise on Friday only to ''show how ridiculous the Republican sales tax was.'' Yesterday, he said the proposal was no longer under serious consideration by Senate Democrats. 'Variations on the Theme' However, yesterday one key Republican Senator said that a similar two-tax compromise was under consideration by Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, the Republican majority leader. In terms of reaching a compromise, Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on the Channel 2 program ''Newsmakers'': ''There are all kinds of variations on the theme that you could look at. We're not out of possibilities.'' The Governor-elect takes office Jan. 1. Before offering his own ideas, Mr. Cuomo said he would like to see if the Senate indeed had the 31 votes needed to pass the Republican sales tax proposal. ''I don't believe they do,'' he said. However, Senator Norman J. Levy, the Merrick, L.I., Republican who heads the Transportation Committee, said the Republicans had the necessary votes to pass the sales tax. The sales tax, however, is not likely to pass the Assembly, where both Republicans and Democrats have expressed strong opposition. Confident of Compromise Mr. Levy said he was confident that a compromise would be reached before the M.T.A. deadline. ''It is clear that the majority in both houses are committed that there be no fare increase,'' he said. However, Senator Ohrenstein was not optimistic that a solution could be reached in time to avert a fare increase. He said that his members - in the hope that fare increases imposed today could later be reversed - were prepared to remain in Albany ''for the next two weeks.'' ''I'm bringing my skis,'' Mr. Ohrenstein said.

953-> AROUND THE NATION; Judge Tells U.S. to Free 108 Cubans From Prison
A Federal district judge today ordered the Government to start releasing 108 Cuban refugees who have been held in the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary since their exodus by boat from Cuba in 1980. Judge Marvin Shoob said the Government must change its ''unreasonable and arbitrary'' policy of refusing to allow individual volunteers to sponsor refugees in their transition to American society.

954-> SOVIET GRANTS PARTIAL AMNESTY FOR ITS CELEBRATIONS
The Soviet Union declared an amnesty today to mark the 60th anniversary of its formal merger as a federation of republics, but the decree indicated that it excluded those convicted of political offenses and other crimes considered serious under Soviet law. The amnesty followed the pattern of those declared on the occasion of past celebratiions, such as the 60th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the 50th anniversary of the Soviet Union and the 50th anniversary of the Revolution. In all cases, political offenders were excluded and other exceptions were so wide as to sharply reduce the numbers released. Western estimates of the number of people serving sentences for political offenses range up to 10,000. They include those in labor camps and those who are serving periods of enforced residence, usually in remote areas. Amnestied Categories Listed Those to be released include youthful first offenders serving terms of up to two years; people with less than six months left to serve; World War II veterans and holders of official awards who are serving terms of up to five years, and, regardless of the length of the term, women with children under 18 and expectant mothers, men over 60 and women over 55. Tass said the amnesty would not apply to ''persons convicted of particularly dangerous crimes against the state, especially dangerous recidivists,'' a phrase that in the past has been used to cover political offenders. Soviet law provides prison terms for a wide variety of political crimes, covered by catch-all provisions in the Criminal Code making virtually any criticism of the Government or the Communist Party, or of any official, a potential offense. Tass listed some of the crimes specifically excluded from the amnesty. They included premeditated murder, intentional inflicting of serious bodily injury, assaults on the life of a uniformed policeman or a police volunteer, some cases of rape, robbery and looting. Also excluded from the terms of the release were those convicted of large-scale embezzlement of public property, some cases of black marketeering, theft of firearms, ammunition or explosives, acceptance of a bribe, bribery or acting as go-between in bribery, and malicious hooliganism. Comparison of the decree with the earlier amnesties indicated at least two additions to the list of excepted offenses. These were deliberate violations of labor-camp rules and evasion of prescribed treatment for alcoholism, drug abuse and venereal disease. Soviet journals have indicated that a rising incidence of alcoholism and venereal disease, in particular, has the authorities concerned. Alcoholism is said to be a major contributing factor to low labor productivity and a high rate of absenteeism on factories and farms.

955-> THE NATION; NObel Laureate Has a Kind Word For Reaganomics
The Reagan Administration last week took heart in the economy's movement - the gross national product expanded eight-tenths of 1 percent in the third quarter - but there was some question whether it was turning the corner or going in circles. While housing starts, the stock market and personal spending were up and one major bank dropped its prime rate to 11.5 percent, 685,000 newly unemployed persons lined up for jobless benefits and private economists told Congress things wouldn't be getting better very soon. One of the few economists with anything cheerful to say was University of Chicago Professor George J. Stigler, whose classically conservative studies earned him the Nobel Prize for Economic Science last week. Professor Stigler, whose theories more or less jibe with the Administation's, took the occasion to praise President Reagan's ''remarkable success'' in fighting inflation. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige was similarly enthusiastic about the G.N.P. growth. Mr. Baldrige interpreted the sluggish increase as a harbinger of ''solid economic expansion in 1983 and beyond - recovery is baked into the cake right now.'' Other Commerce Department officials waxed sanguine as they reported that housing starts rose 14.4 percent in September while personal income went up 1 percent. However, the experts who testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress saw few signs of relief. Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the American Stock Exchange, said the economy ''cannot quite seem to turn the corner to a sustainable economic recovery.'' And Donald Ratajczak, a Georgia State University economic forecaster, said flatly that ''there is no recovery at this stage.'' If not, Professor Stigler might be the last one to say Government activism could hasten a turnaround. The University of Chicago has been a hotbed of supply-side theory, and Mr. Stigler's particular specialty is the study of Government regulation, which he opposes. He concedes that Mr. Reagan's deregulation program ''has not been a stunning success,'' but blames that on the resistance of labor and management.

956-> In THE WINGS, IF REAGAN DOESN'T RUN
What would happen in the Republican Party if President Reagan decided not to seek a second term? For several weeks, White House aides have been fighting to stifle the speculation raised by this question. But Mr. Reagan's refusal to send an unequivocal signal about his plans has created a stir of submerged political activity among some prominent Republicans who might run if Mr. Reagan stepped aside. To be sure, no one wants to appear anxious to shove the President into retirement. But, in a series of interviews, Republican political professionals and Reagan Administration officials of diverse loyalties agreed that several of the party's leading figures have quietly prepared themselves to dash for the nomination if Mr. Reagan retired after one term. Many Republican leaders also agreed that the preference of White House strategists to delay an announcement until Labor Day 1983 or later has created a situation in which potential candidates are almost forced to engage in contingency planning for a Reagan withdrawal. ''It creates a problem for those who are sort of waiting in the wings,'' said Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, who first asserted that he thought Mr. Reagan ought to run again. But, he added: ''If he doesn't, the Republican Party has got to have a nominee. That's the point.'' Packwood to New England Lyn Nofziger, a Reagan loyalist of undisputed zeal, observed that the longer Mr. Reagan delays announcing for a second term, the more intense this speculative campaign activity is likely to become. Already, the maneuvering has created strains and aggravated rivalries within the party. For example, White House officials regard Senator Dole, Senator Robert Packwood of Oregon and Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York as altogether too eager for Mr. Reagan to retire. Senator Packwood has even scheduled a week of speeches in New England next month, leading to speculation that he might enter the 1984 primaries, even if Mr. Reagan runs for re-election, as a gesture of contempt for the President's economic and social policies. ''We'll go up there and if that scares hell out of the White House, that's fine,'' said a Packwood associate. ''It's a test to see what kind of reception he gets. It's a test to see if they talk about him as a man with a future or a loose cannon.'' Right now, Mr. Reagan's political advisers seem more amused than frightened by talk of a kamikaze challenge by Mr. Packwood. But surrounding such talk is an unsettled political atmosphere that has raised questions about the party's unity and fed a new wave of speculation about the Republican succession after Mr. Reagan. Fear on Budget Policies One factor in this restive situation is the fear that Mr. Reagan's budget policies could lead to economic collapse rather than the recovery he has promised. Many Republican strategists say they believe that this would open the way for a moderate such as Mr. Dole or Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee. Senator Baker has tried to avoid any sign of premature interest in the Presidency. But within the party, it is widely assumed that Mr. Reagan's passing, whenever it comes, will force Mr. Baker to decide whether he wants to play for the main chance or settle for the life of a venerable Senator. Among Republicans, it is also widely known that Mr. Baker, Mr. Dole and Mr. Kemp all maintain political action committees that can be converted to Presidential fund raising in a blink. Even so, the main destabilizing force in the Republican political environment is neither campaign fever nor doubt about Mr. Reagan's policies. It is the almost universal belief that Mr. Reagan will refuse to designate Vice President Bush, a moderate, as his successor. If he did pick Mr. Bush, some White House aides say, Mr. Reagan would risk a rebellion among his hardcore supporters. ''Nofziger's group, that old Reagan group, that is their second cause in life, that Bush is never going to be President,'' said a Republican close to both Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan. ''It will be a big fight in the party.'' Main Street or Wall Street? Mr. Reagan can prevent this fight and help assure continued Repulican control of the White House by seeking a second term. If he shows any inclination to step aside, those arguments can be used to push him into another campaign, just as they were used to encourage President Eisenhower to run again in 1956. Some Republican strategists believe that if Mr. Reagan did leave office after one term, Mr. Bush and Mr. Kemp would become the main initial contenders in a crucial ideological struggle to determine whether the Republican Party would tilt toward Wall Street or Main Street over the next decade. In this speculation, Mr. Bush is viewed as the candidate of the ''board room Republicans'' and Mr. Kemp as the candidate of the ''blue-collar conservatives.'' Backers of other candidates dismiss this analysis as too neat. For one thing, conservatives such as Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada or Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina might woo the right wing's middle class activists from Mr. Kemp. Certainly, moderates such as Mr. Dole, Mr. Baker and even Mr. Packwood could challenge Mr. Bush for the party centrists. Some of these men, even in private, are said to discourage talk about their plans for 1984 if Mr. Reagan retired. But their aides and friends, often with the tacit approval of the potential candidates, are planning for them, because everyone knows that if the President suddenly withdrew late in 1983, only those candidates who already had good political advisers, a skeletal national organization and some fund-raising capability would have a chance. 'You've Got To Be Anxious' Mr. Nofziger, despite his ties to Mr. Reagan, sympathizes with those who are awaiting a signal from the President. By keeping Mr. Reagan's plans a mystery, he said, the White House political strategists have created a situation in which other Republicans have no choice but to position themselves to run in 1984. ''Look, if you want to be President, you've got to be anxious,'' said Mr. Nofizger, the former White House political director. ''You don't want to get down to October or November where there's a straw poll coming up in December in Florida and caucuses in Iowa in February and a March primary in New Hampshire and get caught without an organization.'' Right now, White House aides tend to regard every prominent Republican as guilty of premature Presidential ambition until proven innocent. Those who want an early declaration from the President, one Reagan adviser observed, should realize that the Democrats would then be able to denounce every Reagan initiative of 1983 as a reelection gimmick. ''The President's job is not to make life convenient for five or six other guys whose total name recognition is about 29 percent,'' said a second White House aide, expressing contempt for any prospective candidate ''who gets froggy and starts jumping around'' before Mr. Reagan has made up his mind. Froggy or not, some of the party's best known figures seem to find themselves in the situation defined by Mr. Dole. ''My view,'' the Senator said, ''is the President should and will run. If that doesn't happen, then there are a lot of Republicans around the country who would have a sudden interest in going to Iowa or New Hampshire. In the meantime, those who have that interest would have to mark time. ''Of course,'' Mr. Dole added, ''you can mark time in different ways.''

958-> COURTS LIMP ALONG AS LEGAL AID STRIKE GOES ON IN NEW YORK
After nine weeks of a strike by 550 Legal Aid Society lawyers, New York City's court officials and district attorneys say that the courts have managed to take up much of the slack with private lawyers but that postponements have begun to worsen the backlogs of criminal cases. Cases have been put off whenever possible, and as a result one administrative judge said that when the strike ends, it could be four to six months before the backlogs can be dealt with. The new backlogs are adding to an existing problem of limited trial capacity at a time of record criminal indictments. If the strike does not end by Jan. 1, these officials say, the trouble for the courts could become more serious. A Limit to 'Making Do' ''We just can't continue to limp along as we've been doing,'' said Joseph B. Williams, the administrative judge in charge of all criminal proceedings in the city. ''We've been making do, but there is just so much we can take before grinding to a halt.'' Another result has been the over-@burdening of the city's crowded jails. Last Friday they held 10,150 prisoners, 10 percent more than their official capacity. Most of the prisoners are awaiting trial, according to the Correction Department. ''Normally our population goes down in the last couple of weeks before Christmas,'' said the department's spokesman, Edward Hershey. ''But it has not gone down this year. We have no way of knowing for sure how much of this is due to the strike, but common sense would tell us that the strike is responsible for some of the problem.'' There is no sign that an end to the walkout is near. On Thursday the lawyers voted 321 to 141 to reject the society's proposal that they return to work while a panel of three arbitrators resolved the wage dispute. ''I think it's tragic that they didn't reach agreement on this thing,'' Judge Williams said. The society has represented the poor in criminal cases under a contract with the city since 1966. It also handles civil matters, including proceedings before administrative boards that determine Social Security and unemployment benefits. In the last city fiscal year, ending June 30, the society took on about 154,500 criminal and 16,000 civil cases. A Strain on Supervisors During the strike the society's 118 supervising lawyers, who are excluded from the union, as well as 35 to 50 lawyers who are not honoring the strike, have been handling as many pending civil and criminal matters as they can. In addition the society's staff of 20 paralegals has been handling cases before administrative boards. On the criminal side, where most Legal Aid lawyers are normally assigned, private lawyers have also been called upon to help, mainly in arraignments. They are known as 18-b lawyers, after the section of state law that allows localities to appoint them to represent indigent defendants. ''The supervisors are breaking their backs, and the 18-b's are picking up the slack,'' said Mario Merola, the Bronx District Attorney. ''However, I don't think we can go beyond Jan. 1. They have indicated that they cannot continue to operate at this capacity.'' 'Plenty of Cases' to Try Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, agreed, saying that because of the extra work by supervisors and private lawyers, the strike's impact on the criminal courts had been minimal. ''There is such a backlog of cases that so far it really hasn't had that much effect,'' Mr. Morgenthau said. ''There are plenty of cases to keep the trial parts busy.'' In Queens, however, District Attorney John J. Santucci had a different assessment. ''We are beginning to feel the impact of their absence, and we feel it most strongly where there is a case with multiple defendants, with one represented by a private lawyer and the other by Legal Aid. Then we are confronted with a dilemma: Do we separate the cases and let one go ahead and not the other? Or do we keep them together and lose a great deal of time?'' Judge Williams said the supply of private lawyers willing to take over cases previously assigned to the society was dwindling, largely because of sympathy for the strikers. Need for Due Process Stressed ''Someone has to respond to this,'' he said. ''Have we traded off due process for fear we will be called union-busters or scabs? We're more concerned about human rights in South America than we are about people right here on Rikers Island.'' In part, the strike is over wages, but the union, the Association of Legal Aid Attorneys, has also made demands concerning working conditions. It wants to limit caseloads and exempt lawyers from working the 1 A.M.-to-9 A.M. shift of arraignments in Manhattan. Another issue has been the status of one lawyer who was dismissed during contract negotiations. Under a two-year contract that will expire next June 30, salaries range from $18,500 for those not yet admitted to the bar to $39,500 for lawyers with at least 12 years' experience. But wages can be renegotiated after the first year. The contract contains an automatic 3.4 percent raise, effective last July 1, but the lawyers have not yet received it. The society has offered what amounts to 5.3 percent on top of the automatic 3.4 percent - a total raise of 8.7 percent. The union, however, says its members are already entitled to the 3.4 percent and is insisting upon 9 percent more - a total of 12.4 percent more than they make now. Union Hardens Its Stance The vote last Thursday to reject arbitration by an overwhelming majority was a surprise to many people, including some of the strikers. But many of those who began the walkout with reluctance are now insisting that the strike go on until a negotiated settlement is reached that would justify the time they have lost from their jobs. Gary Greenberg, who has been with the society for 11 years, originally voted against the strike because, he said, it was ''illconceived.'' But Thursday he voted to continue it. ''Once we've crossed the Rubicon,'' he said, ''we have to do what we have to do. For me, what the strike is about is not money, but it's saying to management that it must work with us to resolve some of the problems.'' After the vote, the society issued a statement that accused the union of having ''lost sight of the mission of the society.'' Effects on Poor Dispute ''It is clear that many of the members of the union are willing to abandon legal representation of the poor of this city,'' the statement said, noting that the society had been created to represent them. But the lawyers insisted that the strike was for the benefit of their clients. One lawyer, Jonna Schuder, said that because of low pay, some lawyers could not afford to work for the society. ''Every single person on that line cares a great deal about their clients or they wouldn't have taken this job,'' she said. ''In the long run it's going to be much better for our clients. That's why people are willing to strike.'' Mayor Koch appointed three lawyers to study possible alternatives to the Legal Aid Society, including the establishment of a public defender's office. They were to issue their report on Dec. 10, but decided to put it off because the strike was still going on.

960-> AFTERSHOCK OF LAYOFFS HITS LACKAWANNA
The death in Lackawanna was a long time coming. But to a person who has known the death of an elderly parent or of a friend who had lain unconscious a long time, the death in Lackawanna, while almost sure to come, was no less shocking, meant no less pain. David Yetman demonstrates this. Mr. Yetman, 35 years old, is an American steelworker. That is, he used to be, and would still like to be. But the announcement Monday that the Bethlehem Steel Corporation plans to close its plant here all but means that he and 7,300 others won't. Mr. Yetman has worked at his trade - for decades a basic American trade - one week in the last 16 months. He earned $12.99 an hour, his basic wage, when he worked at the Lackawanna plant. But, laid off in September 1981, Mr. Yetman now earns $3.50 an hour on the 5 P.M.-to-2 A.M. shift as a custodian @for Mr. Janitor, an office and factory janitorial company. Hopes to Start a Construction Job In January, Mr. Yetman, married and the father of a 6-year-old son, hopes to begin a second job - the 8 A.M.-to-4 P.M. shift, in construction. He hopes to earn $5 to $6 an hour in that job. Together, Mr. Yetman will not earn what he made as a steelworker, but the Yetmans are making do, putting food on the table, making mortgage payments. ''You have got to work and not sit around and feel sorry for yourself,'' he said. Yet, as Mr. Yetman sat sipping an O.V., as Old Vienna beer is known in these parts, in the Park Grill, a drive of a minute or two from the Bethlehem Lackawanna plant, he was, he said, shocked by the company's announcement Monday that it was closing its plant, although he, like most Lackawanna residents, believed for a couple of years that the plant might be closed. For Mr. Yetman, the announcement means he will not be called back to work, not complete his 30 years in the mill. ''That's all I wanted to do, work in the steel plant, stay 30 years,'' he said. He said of Bethlehem's announcement: ''It's a shock.'' He said of Lackawanna's future: ''It's going to be zero.'' For decades, the Bethlehem Lackawanna plant was the backbone of Lackawanna, named for an old steel company that came here in 1899. The plant brought smoke, dirt, grim factory houses. But it also brought relatively high wages; employment, in the years following World War II, for more than 20,000, and 65 percent of Lackawanna's property taxes. Industry has long been the economic center of this area. It came here with the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the economic growth generated by the Civil War and the booming decades that followed. Bethlehem took over the Lackawanna plant in 1922 and doubled its capacity by 1930. It made strip and sheet steel for automobile bodies, tin cans and office furniture. By the late 1930's, the plant was producing one-twentieth of the nation's steel. Demand for Steel Diminishes But in the last 20 years, the American steel industry has changed markedly. Japanese and European manufacturers began to turn out high-quality steel. Often, American companies say, foreign wage rates were far below those paid in America. The foreign companies also benefited from major government subsidies, the American manufacturers say. Steel markets eroded, with plastics and other materials replacing steel. American companies, in the view of many experts, did not invest in the newest steelmaking technologies. Twice in 1981, Walter F. Williams, Bethlehem president, visited Lackawanna to dampen rumors that the Lackawanna plant would close. But Monday, Donald H. Trautlein, the company chairman, said the company had decided to close the Lackawanna plant's basic steelmaking operations, ending the jobs of 3,900 workers and meaning that 3,400 laid-off workers would not be called back to work. A galvanizing line and a bar mill, newer facilities employing 1,300 workers, are scheduled to remain open. No Promises by Company But there are no promises. The announcement, for all practical purposes, seems to mean the end of the Lackawanna plant. It seemed an unusual time for such an announcement, two days before Christmas. Christmas lights are everywhere in the Lackawanna night, outlining houses, in windows, on Christmas trees. Creche scenes stand in front of churches and on front lawns. The carillon at the basilica of Our Lady of Victory, a huge, domed Roman Catholic structure, made of white limestone, which sits on a hill and dominates Lackawanna, plays Christmas carols as night descends on the city. A councilman, Anthony Caferro, says the timing is not important. ''What difference does it make when they announce it,'' he said. ''It has the same effect, whenever they say it.'' Word Circulates Swiftly The word, when it came, spread through Lackawanna like fire before a wind. Laura Evans, at Evans Jewelry, heard it on the radio. So did Joe Paolini, proprietor of Paolini's Restaurant, which, it is reputed, has the best cup of coffee in town. Dick Corcoran, a union staff man, was called to the plant; a man from the company gave him the news. George Jacobs Sr. and Gene McDonald, at Jacob's Shoe Store, heard it from a union man from the United Steelworkers of America's John F. Kennedy Center, the union hall. Ralph Palante, a barber on Ridge Road, heard it on television. So did Bahry Cuhan, at Parson's Pharmacy, who immediately called his partner and gave him the news. ''It's got to hurt,'' Mr. Cuhan said. One thing is for sure, said Robert Marciniak, the City Comptroller, Bethlehem Steel knows how to keep a secret. Everywhere in town, at City Hall, the union hall, at Curly's Bar, at Parson's Pharmacy, at the local newspaper, The Front Page, at the Park Grill, at Paolini's Restaurant, people are engaging in economic discussions about imported steel, subsidies, labor costs. Sometimes the discussions become highly animated, even pretentious, as they did in meetings at the union hall and, well into the night, at Curly's Bar. Blames Poor Management Today, having coffee in Paolini's Restaurant, a dozen or so steel workers said Bethlehem was treating Lackawanna unfairly. ''They never put nothing in there,'' said George Mandiak, in involuntary retirement after 32 years in the plant. ''We got the best workers in the world, but the company is holding that plant together with glue.'' ''Poor management, I blamed it on,'' said Fred Plandowski, a crane operator who made steel Monday night in the No, 18 furnace, and has 29 years in the plant. ''You can't run a business like that and make money.'' Some economists attribute the industry's plight to high wages and the refusal of presidents of United Steelworkers locals to accept concessions. Steelworkers are the highest-paid industrial workers in the world, this argument holds, and industry labor costs are exorbitant. This was not a theory that played well in Paolini's Restaurant. Companies' Motives Questioned Tom McMasters, laid off after 19 years in the plant, said the companies were demanding concessions but giving almost nothing in return. ''It was take it or leave it,'' Mr. McMasters said. The men said that, while some parts of the plant were old, with some cranes dating to the 1930's, for example, other parts had been modernized. As for doing something, no one seems to know what to do. Some union men were suggesting that the move by Bethlehem was a ploy to force concessions in the 1983 steel industry bargaining. But this does not seem to be the case, and Bethlehem says the decision is irrevocable. Lackawanna's Mayor, Edward J. Kuwik, has agreed to serve on a task force appointed by Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo to study the situation, but Mr. Mandiak, in Paolini's Restaurant, said: ''The task force is a joke. The Mayor said the problem is too enormous for a small community like Lackawanna, with some 22,000 residents, to do much about.'' Plant to Close at End of 1983 The men in the restaurant agreed that when the plant is shut - the closing is scheduled for the end of 1983 - most young people will not be financially able to live in Lackawanna. The town will be a dwindling city for old people, they said. In a way, the town, with its Christmas decorations, its people with their strong faces and clear camaraderie, seems robust. It was agreed at the Park Grill -which had once attracted scores of steelworkers every night, but this night had just two men, Mr. Yetman and Mr. Caferro, who owns the place - that the people who would be most hurt by the closing would be workers in the mid-30's through the mid-50's. Younger workers can find other jobs, the men said; older workers will retire. Mr. Yetman said, ''We'll survive, yes.'' But he noted: ''You don't have no money. Just enough to pay the bills.''

962-> NONFICTION IN BRIEF
NEVER DONE A History of American Housework. By Susan Strasser. Illustrated. 365 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. Cloth, $22.50. Paper, $11.95. Only a genuine miracle-cleaning product could have abolished the layers of grime accreted in the houses of the past century, heated by wood and coal stoves spitting fire and spilling ashes, lit by greasy, sooty kerosene lamps. The annual ritual of spring cleaning might occupy an entire week of work, and a household advice writer of the 1880's commented that it was ''a terror to everyone and above all to gentlemen.'' (Perhaps the spectacle of so much domestic labor was simply too direct a challenge to the cozy myth of the home as a place of retreat from industry.) Women, too, shrank from work of such home-wrecking proportions. '' 'House' is being 'cleaned,' '' Emily Dickinson observed. ''I prefer pestilence.'' The sentimentalization of the home and the housewife has obscured the record of how much work - productive and reproductive - women at home have contributed to the American economy. A refreshing corrective is Susan Strasser's ''Never Done,'' a lively anecdotal book that reconstructs the tasks done at home and some beliefs and attitudes about them, as they have evolved from the early 19th century to the present in the United States. Miss Strasser, who teaches American history and labor studies at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., draws on household advice manuals, advertisements, surveys done by social workers, popular literature and novels to illustrate the changing relationship between the household and the industrial economy as two interrelated units producing goods and services. Her material shows convincingly that the home, far from being a refuge from the 19th-century factory and the 20th-century corporation, has been distinctively shaped as a place of work by a developing industrial economy. As the market in factory-produced consumer goods expanded, for example, the popular literature encouraged homemakers to become consumers and caretakers, emphasizing buying and mothering rather than producing goods for use at home. One example from the book's many illustrations is an ad that depicts a just-married couple standing before an awesomely efficient-looking sewing machine prominently brandnamed Domestic. While the wedding guests dance in the background, the commanding yet tender groom supports his wispy bride, somewhat weighed down by her yards of white tulle, while she gazes at her new means of production. It's hard to imagine that so gentle and trusting a creature could stand upright, let alone operate a foot treadle. Several other illustrations and photographs suggest the more likely conditions under which a woman might be found sewing: stitching bodices by the piece in her tenement apartment. OUT TO WORK A History of Wage-Earning Women in the United States. By Alice Kessler-Harris. Illustrated. 400 pp. New York: Oxford University Press. $19.95. ''The world does not accord any privileges to women,'' complained a working woman in 1874. ''If she was to fight for her interests, they would say how 'rough' and 'coarse' she is. Society would put her finger of scorn on her. Why is it can a woman not be virtuous if she does mingle with the toilers?'' Morals and convention were among the informal social sanctions that, along with formal laws, have limited the power of the millions of women who have worked for wages in the United States since girls first hired out as servants in the colonies. The anonymously written letter quoted above is one of those eloquent personal responses Alice Kessler-Harris uses to illustrate the often painful process by which women have been encouraged to do certain jobs and prevented from doing others. The view that woman's true vocation was that of homemaker, so forcefully advanced in the 19th century by male preachers and doctors as well as by somewhat misguided women reformers, stigmatized those women who had to work for money and defeated their efforts to get secure jobs at living wages. In this impressive and deftly written book, Miss Kessler-Harris, a professor of history at Hofstra University, draws on a vast range of sources to describe the transformation of women's employment from colonial times to the present and to document the ways in which gender expectations have structured the labor force participation of women wage earners. The ideology of separate spheres, for example, did not prevent employers from hiring unmarried daughters, widows and single mothers, but it did constrain women's efforts to assert their rights. Miss Kessler-Harris notes that women were as militant as men in the labor struggles of the 1870's and 80's, when the Knights of Labor supported the rights of women workers and endorsed the principle of equal pay. Twenty years later, however, the A.F.L., focusing its efforts on protecting the jobs of male craft workers, was much less attentive to organizing women. Miss Kessler-Harris also discusses the campaign for protective labor legislation, partly inspired by concerned middle-class women reformers. Full of misplaced sympathy for the plight of the exploited woman worker, reformers tried to improve her situation by limiting her ability to earn wages and encouraging her to stay at home. An example or two cannot do justice to the variety of material and ideas the author draws together to explain how women workers have functioned as a low-paid reserve labor force, and why, as wage work became the rule rather than the exception for women in the 20th century, they found themselves in marginal jobs stereotyped as feminine. AN ECONOMIC HISTORY OF WOMEN IN AMERICA Women's Work, the Sexual Division of Labor, and the Development of Capitalism. By Julie A. Matthaei. 381 pp. New York: Schocken Books. $29.50. Simone de Beauvoir, considering in 1949 the status of ''the second sex,'' observed that women had no common version of their feminine experience, ''no past, no history, no religion.'' ''They live dispersed among the males,'' she wrote, making that statement of fact sound, all at once, exceptionally sad. In the intervening years and particularly in the last 10 to 15 years, a generous amount of scholarship has been devoted to reconstructing a female past. Julie A. Matthaei, a professor of economics at Wellesley, has drawn on this large foundation in her provocative and often original synthesis, ''An Economic History of Women in America.'' In part a historical account of how the sexual division of labor has continually shifted in response to the requirements of an industrial capitalist economy in America, her book adds an additional twist by examining how ''men's work'' and ''women's work'' have taught people the male and female behavior traits upon which the sexual division of labor has been based. Work, suggests Miss Matthaei, is the critical experience that has shaped changing notions of masculinity and femininity. Her study begins with the two earliest American economies, the plantation economy of slavery and the family economy of the colonists. Within the colonial household, she identifies two distinct economic spheres. Husband and wife might work side by side, using the same technology to produce woolen cloth, but nevertheless their purposes were separate. Men produced goods to sell for income; women produced household necessities to conserve income. As factory production began to dominate the market in the 19th century, the two spheres inherent in the colonial household evolved into the two spheres of home and industrial workplace, also segregated by gender. And as increasing numbers began to work outside the home in this century, the spheres re-emerged in ''masculine'' and ''feminine'' occupations, the definitions of which have shifted over time according to the requirements of employers. Secretaries used to be men, before office work was made routine, wages cut and the job redefined to emphasize service. The constant, argues Miss Matthaei, has been a socially determined sexual division of labor that segregates jobs, reinforces gender distinctions and continually perpetuates the concept of opposites in the two sexes. The book's broad sweep occasionally causes the author to sacrifice historical complexity in favor of a complex argument, and specialists will probably disagree with the author's account at various points. But if ''An Economic History of Women in America'' is sometimes awkward as a historical narrative, this ambitious book is nonetheless among the most thought-provoking to have emerged from the recent study of the second sex.

963-> ART VIEW; YALE'S ART GALLERY HONORS ITS FOUNDING FATHER
One hundred and fifty years ago last Monday the Yale Art Gallery - then known as the Trumbull Gallery - first opened its doors. Due jubilation has marked the anniversary - not least at a mammoth dinner last night at which the painter Robert Motherwell was scheduled to be the main speaker. And if you happen to be in New Haven at 3 P.M. this afternoon you can try to get into the lecture hall of the present Yale Art Gallery, where the Governor's Foot Guard Band, which has been in existence since the year 1775, will be making a brave noise with fife and drums. Yale in this matter has plenty to celebrate. It has a distinguished gallery building (by Louis Kahn). It has multifarious collections and an eager public. It has an important role to play in both graduate and undergraduate studies. Furthermore the present director, Alan Shestack, and his colleagues are well aware that art seen in first youth is never forgotten. This stands to reason, after all. Studenthood is a time of hypersensitivity. In any good university ideas fall from the air like meteorites, and it has finally got through to the academic world that a great work of art is also the embodiment and distillation of a great idea. If properly read, the history of art is the history of everything. Anyone for instance who is studying the intellectual history of France in the 18th century is the richer for seeing the bust of Diderot - critic, novelist, playwright and encyclopedist - by Jean-Antoine Houdon that stands in the Yale Art Gallery. If you are grappling with the notions of ''realism,'' ''reality'' or ''the real,'' there is a ''Still life with Dried Fruit'' by the 17thcentury Spanish painter Francisco Mantilla that will give you plenty to think about. If you are a student of psychology and have to define the nature of alienation, you cannot afford to miss the painting by Vincent van Gogh called ''The Night Cafe.'' And if the avant-garde in any or all of its forms is your special subject, you will find in the Yale Art Gallery major works by Kandinsky, Malevich, Brancusi and Mondrian that are fundamental to the achievement of the first half of this century. It is in contexts of this kind that a particular charm attaches to university art galleries. It is here, if anywhere, that the young people who may one day set their stamp on the country will first feel the impact of art. What they see, and how they see it, are as important as what they read and hear. But this has only lately been recognized, and Yale is no exception to the rule that university art galleries have grown up every which way. Logic has rarely dictated their evolution. It so happens that Yale has had alumni whose names will be forever associated with one aspect or another of the university's collections. They include James Jackson Jarves for early Italian painting, Stephen C. Clark for the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, Mabel Brady Garvan for the American decorative arts, Rebecca Darlington Stoddard for Greek and Etruscan vases. The gallery also houses the objects and artifacts that were dug up in the 1920's and 30's on the site of Dura-Europos, a Roman frontier town in Syria. Individually remarkable as all these things are, their very diversity reflects the role of happenstance in the development of a university art gallery. This particular gallery began with the paintings and drawings of John Trumbull. It was Trumbull who got the original gallery built (to his own design, by the way). Not only was it to be a monument to his own achievement, but he made sure that he and his wife would be buried beneath it. (He also got Yale to guarantee him an annuity of $1,000 for life). Haunted for much of his career by what he construed as failure and rejection, he was not going to settle for anything but the royal treatment in New Haven. It was not simply that he thought himself a very good painter. He believed that he had made a unique contribution to the history of the United States. He was the public orator, the spokesman for the soldiers and the statesmen who made the United States possible, the historian who had worked from the primary sources. His was the true record, and he deserved his monument. Posterity has borne him out, in that there must be few Americans who have not at one time or another seen the signing of the Declaration of Independence through Trumbull's eyes. His portraits of Washington, Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton impress by their evident authority. His battle pictures give off a sense of exalted energies. His miniature portraits and drawings of men and women of the day bring them to life with an exceptional immediacy. In that context he deserved well of his country. So it makes sense that the sesquicentenary should be marked by a full-scale exhibition of the Trumbull bequest, even if there are paintings in it that would have been better left in store. Organized by Helen A. Cooper, Curator of American Painting and Sculpture at the Yale Art Gallery, the show includes as much as - if not more than - anyone could possibly want to see of Trumbull's output. And it has a monumental catalogue, with contributions both by Mrs. Cooper and by six other eminent scholars in the field. (The catalogue costs $19.95 in soft cover and $45 in hard cover). Even Trumbull himself could hardly ask more. His was in many ways a very curious case. Unlike most early American artists, he came from the ruling class (his father was Governor of Connecticut). A Harvard graduate, he was aide-de-camp for a time to George Washington. Had he so wished, he could have been private secretary to Thomas Jefferson. He undertook diplomatic missions for Chief Justice John Jay. A distinguished career in the public service was his for the asking, and we may sense that his father never ceased to regret that he was primarily a painter. ''Connecticut is not Athens,'' he said when John Trumbull reminded him of the place of honor that was accorded to the arts in ancient Greece. Trumbull senior wasn't silly, either. John Trumbull applied himself to his studies as an artist with an exemplary devotion, but there were kinds of painting - much prized at the time - for which he really had no talent at all. There are moments during our tour of the present exhibition when we may well ask ourselves if worse paintings in the high style can ever have been put on show in a major museum. Such is the absurdity of his literary, allegorical and religious subjects that they would reduce even a condemned man to helpless laughter. What he did have on the other hand was a wonderful sense of the direct and unpretentious contact that can be established between artist and sitter when the image is small enough to hold in the hand. His battle pictures do not always hang together in compositional terms, and they sometimes remind us that although he called himself ''Colonel Trumbull'' to the end of his days, he had never had to draw his sword in anger. But those battle pictures have a certain brio, and when they include a likeness of this or that historical figure the result always carries conviction. He could bring off the equivalent of a state portrait in a way whose very stiffness suggests a young nation that is still unused to ceremony. And when he tackled a British subject, ''The Sortie Made by the Garrison of Gibraltar,'' he once more displayed his mastery of the small-scale physiognomy. He made a contribution to the origins of American landscape painting, and he made some very pretty architectural drawings. Beyond that, I can say only that although this show clearly had to be done it droops overall.

965-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Plenty of Sweepers, Not Enough Litter S ince early last week, in neighborhoods that include leafy Forest Hills and crowded Chinatown, the Sanitation Department has been testing four different types of mechanical sweepers to see if there's a better way to keep the streets clean. By all accounts, the experimental machines are safer, can travel faster and hold far more litter than the 450 sweepers now working the streets. Unfortunately, they are also about twice as costly as the $30,000 Elgin devices now in use. The testing won't end until midmonth, so no one in the department would say whether any of the sweepers look promising. One official, though, didn't think much of outsized vehicle that acts as a giant vacuum cleaner. ''It's been knocking down more leaves from the trees than it's been picking up,'' he said. So they could be shown off, all four devices were gathered yesterday outside a sanitation garage at Canal and West Streets. It was hard to tell how well any of them worked, though. A bureaucratic imperative is that places must be cleaned up before higher-ups arrive. Sure enough, this time there wasn't a trace of curbside litter to be found.

967-> THE REGION; Harris Conviction Upheld on Appeal
Jean Harris's conviction for murdering Dr. Herman Tarnower, the author of ''The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet,'' was upheld today by New York State's highest court. In a unanimous decision, the seven-member Court of Appeals upheld Mrs. Harris's conviction for second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. Mrs. Harris is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County. The court rejected, among other things, an argument by Mrs. Harris's defense attorney, Herald Price Fahringer, that the police had violated Mrs. Harris's right to speak privately with her attorney. Mr. Fahringer had argued that the trial judge was wrong to allow testimony by a police officer who overheard a telephone call from Mrs. Harris to her attorney the night of the fatal shooting at the Tarnower house. ''Oh, my God, I think I've killed Hi,'' the police officer testified Mrs. Harris told her attorney. The judges said that such a comment from Mrs. Harris was spontaneous and thus not barred from use at the trial. ''The statement was neither induced, provoked nor encouraged by the actions of the police officers,'' wrote Judge Domenick Gabrielli in the court's decision. An associate of Mr. Fahringer said the ruling would be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

968-> THE SOCIAL SECURITY STEW SIMMERS
When Congress returns from the campaign trail, Social Security reform will be right at the top of the agenda. But since it is such a volatile and dangerous issue, the lawmakers will need all of their craft and courage to come up with a solution for the system's deep-seated financial woes. Exactly how explosive this issue can be has been amply demonstrated in recent days. It has been ticking steadily throughout the election campaign, threatening to blow up in Republican faces. Now the Republicans may have touched off the mechanism by their own actions, and the Democrats can not restrain themselves from trying to capitalize on the impact. The Republicans accuse the Democrats of playing politics with a critical problem. ''They have succeeded in making it impossible to discuss Social Security in any rational way,'' complained Rich Galen, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. The Democrats just smile and count the votes. ''We cannot disguise our glee,'' said Bob Neuman, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. A Haunting Letter The latest brouhaha ignited six weeks ago when Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan, the chairman of the Congressional Committee, wrote a fund-raising letter that focused on Social Security. In test runs, the letter did not draw well, and was quickly scrapped, but the Democratic National Committee ''stumbled on it'' this week when one recipient sent it to party headquarters. To the Democrats, the letter was the political equivalent of manna from heaven. In it, Mr. Vander Jagt offered three alternatives for reforming the financially troubled system, and asked Republicans to cast mock ballots on their preference. One option was to make the system voluntary, a move that would almost certainly destroy it, in the view of some experts. Mr. Vander Jagt's suggestion was particularly inopportune because President Reagan has spent the last 18 years trying to live down a proposal, made while campaigning for Barry Goldwater in the 1964 Presidential race, favoring a voluntary retirement program. A Republican campaign strategist, who did not want his name used, called the letter ''very unadvised'' and added, ''To have anything associated with the Republican Party mention a voluntary retirement system is a red flag.'' The Democrats have come charging at that flag, nostrils flaring. ''It gave us a wonderful opportunity to flail away at the suspicion that the Republican Administration has a hidden agenda that includes fundamental cuts and changes in Social Security,'' Mr. Neuman said. ''This tipped their hand.'' Democrats Pounce on Issue On Thursday, Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the Speaker of the House, issued a statement calling on the President to ''repudiate immediately'' the fund-raising letter. Today, the Speaker urged Mr. Reagan to put off any consideration of Social Security reforms until after the new Congress convenes in January, presumably with more Democratic members than the current membership, which returns for a lame duck session on Nov. 29. In New Mexico today, Charles T. Manatt, the Democratic Party chairman, scrapped the campaign speech he was going to deliver and substituted one that declared, ''Clearly the Republicans are sending out the signal that they are hell-bent on drastic revisions and crippling cuts in Social Security.'' Democratic allies in organized labor and senior citizens' groups joined the chorus with their own denunciations of the letter. In fact, the Democrats were already planning to make Social Security a major part of their final campaign push. Two five-minute commercials that will be broadcast on network televsion this weekend will stress the issue, and local party candidates are broadcasting their own advertisements containing the same message: A vote for the Republicans is a vote against Social Security. Reagan Counterattacks ''Any consultant worth his salt,'' said Mr. Neuman, the Democratic spokesman, ''will shelve the lesser issues and go heavy on Social Security ads this weekend.'' Faced with this double-barreled blast from the Democrats, President Reagan decided to bring up the Social Security issue on his own and try to control the damage. Speaking for Republican candidates in Montana and Wyoming on Thursday, Mr. Reagan denounced the Democratic attacks as ''sheer demagoguery,'' saying it was a ''dishonest canard'' to imply that he favors cutting the benefits of current recipients. ''Over the next few days,'' he cautioned, ''when you hear the other side say these things, just hold your nose and smile.'' He received reinforcements from Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, who weighed in with a newly minted study that accuses Democrats of sponsoring legislation in 1977 that trimmed retirement benefits by as much as $130 a month. Mr. Galen, the spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, sought to dismiss the flap by saying: ''The letter didn't test very well, so we stopped it. The current discussion is six weeks after the fact.'' But he acknowledged that the campaign missive could backfire on the Republicans, saying, ''We are worried that the Democrats will demagogue this issue and scare people to the point that they'll vote for the Democrats based on their fears.'' Through President Reagan's time in the White House, the Social Security issue has been sticking to him like a tar baby. Early in 1981, he pointed out the long-term financing problems facing the system and proposed changes that would postpone and reduce benefits for future recipients. The political reaction was so devastating that eventually the White House withdrew the proposal and appointed a commission to study the problem and report back after the elections. Meanwhile, with White House endorsement, Congress adopted a package of budget cuts, some of them involving Social Security. The most important was elimination of the minimum benefit, which is received by some of the nation's poorest citizens, most of them women. The Democrats, looking to the election, proposed a series of riders to restore that benefit and forced Republicans to cast embarrassing votes against it. Finally, Mr. Reagan let his allies off the hook by changing his position and endorsing restoration of the benefit. But Democrats all over are reminding voters that many Republicans voted three times against the benefit before feeling the heat and reversing course. Now the Republican letter adds ammunition for these salvos. ''It's one of those things,'' said Mr. Neuman, ''that you hope will happen in the final days of a campaign.''

971-> Market Place; Toronto's Gain In Technology
THE Toronto Stock Exchange, long dominated by the shares of oil, mining and forest product companies, is now seeing a boom in technology stocks. This sector has been so strong that many technology stocks have doubled in price this year. Five small companies have gone public in 1982 and more are expected to enter the market in the next 12 months. Although the new technology stocks have generally done well, some older, established companies have done even better. Technology stocks are capturing investor interest at a time when traditional areas, such as oil and gas, steel, pulp and paper, look as if they are not about to make a quick recovery, said David McLeish, vice president of the Toronto investment firm of Walwyn Stodgell. ''This recovery is going to be slow and oriented to improved productivity,'' he says. ''So all the things that add to productivity, such as data processing and communications, are going to be the growth areas.'' Reflecting that view, Northern Telecom's share price has more than doubled this year, to $85 from $41. Northern Telecom, of Mississauga, Ontario, is one of the largest telecommunications companies in North America, with sales last year of $2.57 billion. It has plants in Canada and in the United States, where its recent growth has been principally centered. Fully 60 percent of Northern Telecom's sales this year are expected to be in the United States, while overall sales of telecommunications equipment in Canada are expected to drop 10 percent this year. Northern Telecom, formerly Northern Electric, operates its Canadian research operations in Ottawa, which has come to be known as Silicon Valley North. Northern Telecom has benefited from the planned breakup of A.T.& T., and its sales to Bell will total $150 million (United States) this year. Analysts think its sales to A.T.& T. will double in 1983. One big reason for Northern Telecom's strong performance on the stock market is its introduction of a system to link competing electronic office machines, such as word processors and computers. The company has also offered a way to send high-speed data over existing telephone lines. This will allow large companies to build private data networks. Spar Aerospace of Toronto has seen the price of its shares rise to $26 from $6 over the past year. Spar manufactured the maneuverable arm that traveled aloft in the Space Shuttle and it received considerable publicity during the flight of Columbia. Spar also signed a contract with the Brazilian Government to supply two telecommunication satellites at a cost $125 million (United States). Another company, Mitel, based in Ottawa, competes with Northern Telecom. Mitel makes switches and private telephone exchanges and its shares have soared to $35 from $15 this year. Mitel has entered into an agreement with the International Business Machines Corporation to study the joint manufacture of computer-aided telecommunications equipment. Little is known about the agreement, but the glamor of the I.B.M. name has not hurt the Ottawa company. The two men who founded Mitel, Terry Matthews and Dr. Michael Cowpland, still run the company. Both men are former employees of Northern Telecom. The shares of Gandalf Technologies, another Ottawa company, were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at the beginning of the year at $12. Gandalf now sells at $19 a share and has been as high as $27. Gandalf makes telecommunications equipment, including a line of modems, which allow computers to exchange information over telephone lines. Develcon, which is in the same business lines as Gandalf, was trading in July at $7 a share and is now trading at $13.38. Based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Develcon is one of the few high-technology concerns in western Canada. Other companies that went public this year include Linear Technologies of Burlington, Ontario, trading at $6.38, near its issue price, and Cableshare of London, Ontario, which is trading at $3.75, down from its high of $7.25. Also, NABU Manufacturing of Ottawa, which tried and failed earlier this year to raise $25 million through a private placement with institutions, has gone to the stock market to raise cash and expects to be listed soon on the Toronto exchange. In the interim, its shares are trading on the over-the-counter marker. There are now 22 technology stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange, which has 1,200 issues, and there could be as many as 30 technology stocks by this time next year. Among the companies planning to go public in the next 12 months is GEAC Computer. In the past year, it has installed computers in the libraries at Yale and Princeton and has just received a contract to install computer equipment at the public library in Houston. C.T.G. Inc., a supplier of business telephone systems in the interconnect market, also plans to enter the stock market. The interconnect business opened after a Government agency ruled that businesses did not have to rent telephones from Bell Canada but could buy the instruments. Peter Legault, a communications analyst with the Toronto firm of MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier, says, ''The market is ripe for this kind of thing. There is a lot of cash left in the institutions and there is a lot of interest left in high-tech stocks.'' But Mr. Legault says investors should be wary. He worries that many of these companies are using their new-found cash for working capital rather than investing in new projects. He said he favors companies that have solid contracts rather than just ideas.

972-> 2 IN SENATE RACE SPAR ON RECORDS IN CONNECTICUT
Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr. and Representative Toby Moffett sparred tonight over each other's votes on social issues, as they debated with two other candidates for the United States Senate from Connecticut. Mr. Weicker, the two-term Republican incumbent, chided Mr. Moffett for voting for a recent measure containing a Federal tax increase, which Mr. Weicker said cut $20 billion from Medicaid and Medicare programs. Mr. Moffett, the Democratic candidate, replied that the tax measure was aimed at reducing the Federal deficit and had been supported by Democrats such as Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. ''Lowell, come on, let's not cloud the truth,'' Mr. Moffett said, drawing cheers from his supporters in the audience at the Holiday Inn here. Fifth of Six Debates The exchange occurred during the fifth of six debates between the Senate candidates on Connecticut Public Television. Although tonight's topic was social issues, the other two Senate candidates - Lucien P. DiFazio Jr. of the Conservative Party, and James A. Lewis of the Libertarian Party - used the appearance mainly to urge viewers to vote for them as alternatives to Mr. Weicker or Mr. Moffett. ''A vote for them is like picking your own pocket,'' Mr. DiFazio said of the two major-party candidates. Mr. Weicker and Mr. Moffett generally agreed on such things as their support for the equal rights amendment and for the United States Supreme Court decision permitting some abortions. Restoration of Cuts Mr. Weicker said that as a member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee he had gotten the Reagan Administration to restore ''billions of dollars'' in funds for social programs that had been earmarked for reduction, while the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives where Mr. Moffett served ''didn't restore one nickel.'' The Senator also defended his recent filibusters in the Senate against legislation dealing with school prayer and busing as a defense of the Constitution. ''You've got to fight for it,'' he said. The two candidates also clashed over an assertion by Mr. Weicker that Mr. Moffett had voted to cut the minimum benefit payments for Social Security. When Mr. Moffett challenged Mr. Weicker to cite specific votes and yielded a few seconds from the three minutes allowed for his closing statement, the Senator mentioned two votes. ''What was the date?,'' Mr. Moffett shot back. ''You're on record,'' Mr. Weicker said. The disagreement was not resolved, but Mr. Moffett said at one point, ''I'll tell you something, the minimum benefit was restored after you voted to knock it out on the Senate side.''

973-> 25% JERSEY FARE RISE APPEARS CERTAIN
Governor Kean and legislative leaders agreed today to study ways of bridging a projected $62 million revenue shortfall, but they conceded little could be done to prevent a 25 percent rise in bus and rail fares on Dec. 1. ''The fare hike is going in unless the Legislature acts in some way to prevent it,'' Mr. Kean said after an hour-long meeting with Democratic and Republican party leaders. The Governor said declines in tax revenues had ''wiped out'' a $54 million surplus built into the fiscal 1983 budget. For that reason, he said he would veto any supplemental appropriation approved by the Legislature. Democratic leaders, whose party controls the Legislature, said there was little chance they would approve the $19.5 million supplemental appropriation that NJ Transit, the state's mass transit agency, needs by Nov. 9 to forestall the fare increases. Mr. Kean and the leaders met to discuss the projected $62 million shortfall that was forecast last week, based on declines in revenues from the state's three major taxes. Figures for July and August showed sales tax receipts down $8 million to $9 million from the anticipated amount, and income tax collections were about $10 million short. Corporate tax collections for those two months and for September were off by $40 million to $42 million. Recession Blamed for Drops The declines were attributed to the recession, and if the current trends continue, administration officials said, the state could end the fiscal year next June 30 with a $62 million shortage. Assembly Speaker Alan Karcher, Democrat of Middlesex, labeled that estimate ''conservative'' and said the Democrats believed the gap would be at least $120 million. Governor Kean and the leaders said they had agreed to form a special committee to explore options, including tax increases, reductions in state services, further public employee layoffs or a combination of each. They said they would wait until October's corporate tax figures were in before fashioning their plans, since those revenues are expected to be somewhat better than for the previous three months. The one plan the Governor has eliminated is raising the income tax for people earning more than $50,000 a year. Legislation to do that is pending in the Senate and has been endorsed by some Republicans and Democrats, including Mr. Karcher.

974-> TV: A NO-NONSENSE 'KING LEAR'
WITH a new executive producer, Shaun Sutton, for the last two of its six seasons, ''The Shakespeare Plays'' tonight at 8 on WNET, Channel 13, confronts the monumental challenge of ''King Lear.'' The director is Jonathan Miller, who succeeded Cedric Messina as executive producer of the series two years ago. Starring Michael Hordern as Lear, this is not the colossal production that the play always commands in the mind's eye but seldom achieves in actual performance. Neither is it pedestrian. Whatever his occasional faults or excesses, Mr. Miller is never pedestrian. There are the usual Miller touches, which seem calculated to be quirky. The costumes, reflecting Shakespeare's time, are Jacobean in inspiration, subtle studies in black, gray and white. The staging is geared entirely to the television camera. Rarely has the closeup been used so relentlessly, as the small screen is crammed with one face or a collection of several faces, often with a key subsidiary character or two hovering in the near background. The settings are almost perfunctory, for the most part consisting of dark fabrics arranged around serviceable playing areas. The result, as with much of this fine series, is that the play is definitely the thing. On one very basic level, ''The Shakespeare Plays'' is meant to be an outstanding primer, a collection of productions that will give the viewer a sound and illuminating understanding of a master playwright. The experimental interpretations can, and undoubtedly will, come later. In this sense, ''King Lear'' succeeds splendidly. Mr. Miller employs a crisp, no-nonsense pacing, perhaps merely to bring the production in at slightly more than three hours (there has been some minor snipping of the text). The Lear story does raise questions of credibility, not least in the old man's utterly unreasonable dismissal of the loving but stubbornly silent Cordelia. Mr. Miller has, quite admirably, tackled that point directly: '' 'King Lear' has many of the qualities of a folk tale, a fairy tale,'' he says in his introductory remarks. ''Even the three sisters have a relationship among themselves very similar to those in 'Cinderella.' In fairy tales, all sorts of magical events are taken for granted, and if people say they are in disguise, then for the purposes of the play, you accept that they are unrecognizable.'' Accepting that much, this is very much a ''sensible shoes'' production. At the very outset, it is emphasized that Lear is tragically flawed. As one daughter points out, ''He hath ever but slenderly known himself.'' Subsequently, his betrayal by Goneril and Regan, his descent into madness and his return to brief moments of lucidity with Cordelia form a direct line on the journey to discovering his own humanity. At the same time, the parallel subplot of Gloucester, with his villainous son Edmund and his abused son Edgar, is given just the right dramatic weight to reinforce the tragedy of King Lear. The role of Lear demands grandeur, a presence that is unmistakably bigger than life. One thinks of a Laurence Olivier, who is indeed scheduled to tackle the part in a London stage production. Mr. Hordern is not an Olivier. He is an accomplished actor who has excelled in character roles. But he has played Lear twice before, in a stage production directed by Mr. Miller and in a previous BBC version of the play. Physically, Mr. Hordern resembles one of those seedy types that Donald Pleasence might portray in a Harold Pinter play. Emotionally, however, he captures to a remarkable extent the searing power of an old and powerful man realizing that he is a fool, that the world is evil, the playpen of oily flatterers. While he is not overwhelming, Mr. Hordern is mightily convincing. The rest of the cast is exemplary. John Shrapnel is an admirably sympathetic Earl of Kent. Anton Lesser, who has been playing Hamlet in a London production directed by Mr. Miller, is a noble Edgar, Gloucester's good son, and Michael Kitchen is a thoroughly base Edmund, Gloucester's bad illegitimate seed. Gloucester himself is portrayed movingly by Norman Rodway. The Fool, done up in white face and a feathered hat, is realized with exceptional dignity by Frank Middlemass, the actor who can be seen as the delightful headmaster in the ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation of ''To Serve Them All My Days.'' Among the women, Brenda Blethyn makes a coolly sweet Cordelia, while Gillian Barge and Penelope Wilton manage to chew up the scenery as, respectively, Goneril and Regan. These are indeed the wicked sisters, as obvious as in any fairy tale. In the end, this ''King Lear,'' thanks to Mr. Miller and Mr. Hordern, works not spectacularly but quite rewardingly.

975-> N.F.C. Playoffs a Tangle of Ifs
The National Football Conference's playoff picture is so uncertain that, with one weekend of games remaining, seven teams are still in contention for the two remaining berths. The situation in the American Conference is somewhat less muddled. The Giants are one of six teams in the N.F.C. that have 3-5 records, still have a chance for postseason play and trail Tampa Bay (4-4), the only other club that is still in the running and that has not yet clinched. The Giants play the Philadelphia Eagles, who are also 3-5, Sunday in Philadelphia. Because of the National Football League's complex tiebreaking procedure, the Giants' chances are slim. To make the playoffs they must defeat Philadelphia, and three of the four other 3-5 teams must lose - Chicago to Tampa Bay, San Francisco to the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans to Atlanta. The Giants would then get a playoff berth ahead of the final team that is now 3-5, Detroit, no matter how the Lions fared next Sunday, because they beat the Lions this season. Eight Deciding Steps The tiebreaking procedure involves eight steps, in this order of priority: - Head-to-head competition. - Conference records if an equal number of games have been played among the teams tied. - Records in common games (but with a minimum of three games). - Conference records if an unequal number of games have been played among the teams tied. - Net points in all games. - Net touchdowns in all games. - Strength of schedule - A coin toss. Should the Giants win and all the other 3-5 teams lose, the Giants and Tampa Bay will qualify for the final playoff positions, based on overall records. But a victory by Chicago or San Francisco would eliminate the Giants because of a better conference record than the Giants, in an unequal number of games. And a victory by New Orleans would eliminate them because of a better record against common opponents. What are the chances of the other teams in the running? The Buccaneers, who are 4-4 and 2-3 in the conference, are in the best position of determining their fate. If they defeat Chicago Sunday in Tampa, they will qualify for the playoffs and eliminate the Bears, regardless of what else happens. San Francisco can qualify with a victory, but only if New Orleans or Tampa Bay loses. Bears Could Oust Bucs A victory by Chicago over Tampa Bay would eliminate the Bucs and enable Detroit and San Francisco, if those teams won, to qualify based on superior conference records. But Chicago would qualify only if Detroit or San Francisco lost. For New Orleans to qualify, Detroit, Chicago and San Francisco would all have to lose, in which case New Orleans and Tampa Bay would qualify. As for the American Conference, only two berths remained available after Miami's victory over Buffalo last night, and there were three teams in contention. One immediate effect of the Dolphins' victory was to make the Pittsburgh Steelers the sixth team in the conference to qualify and delay the Bills' bid for the playoffs. The Bills, 4-4, are one of the three teams that will be playing for two remaining A.F.C. positions in games Sunday: the New England Patriots (4-4) and the Cleveland Browns (4-4) are the others. If the Bills win or tie against the Patriots they will clinch a berth.

976-> THE REGION; Nail-Wound Victim Able to Walk Again
Linda Archipolo, the Massapequa, L.I., teen-ager who was critically injured when struck in the head by a nail fired from a power gun, has begun walking again, a hospital spokesman said today. Miss Archipolo, who is 19 years old, was working in a fast-food restaurant in Massapequa Park last Aug. 11 when the nail came through a wall from an adjoining store. The spokesman for the Nassau County Medical Center, Ed Smith, said Miss Archipolo was walking with a special splint to support her knee and ankle, and was showing improvement in other areas.

978-> WORKING PROFILE; SECURITY COUNCIL'S 'MR. INDISPENSABLE'
There is in government a type of person who excels at being indispensable. The boss says he needs a memo first thing tomorrow; Mr. Indispensable stays through the night to get it done. The boss needs a few discreet telephone calls made to Senators and diplomats; Mr. Indispensable does it. The boss wants all the publicity; Mr. Indispensable recedes into the shadows. Robert Carl McFarlane who is deputy to William P. Clark, President Reagan's national security adviser, is that man in the White House when it comes to foreign policy. By most accounts, ''Bud,'' as the 45-year-old former Marine colonel is known, is the man who actually runs the staff of the National Security Council and the interdepartmental committee system on a dayto-day basis. He is credited by White House aides as being a major shaper of the President's recent Middle East peace initiative, specifically with being a principal draftsman of the speech. He is also generally credited, along with Mr. Clark, with revitalizing the system for coordinating different departmental positions, a system that was moribund for the first year and a half of the Reagan Administration. Hard-Liner and Realist Those who work with Mr. McFarlane describe him as being both a hard-liner on dealing with the Soviet Union and in military matters, but also as a realist, someone who quietly works to remove some of the rough edges of the Reagan national security policy. Administration officials who have watched Mr. McFarlane and Mr. Clark work together say that Mr. Clark is the overseer, the keeper of the flame, the one who knows what Mr Reagan really thinks. Mr. McFarlane, they say, does almost everything else. By most accounts, Mr. Clark gives his deputy a free run not only because Mr. McFarlane knows far more about foreign and military matters and far more about how to make the system function than he does, but also because Mr. McFarlane is the kind of man who does not deliberately seek publicity. Characteristically, he refused to be intervewed or photographed for this article. ''Bud is going to hate this article,'' said one of his longtime friends, ''no matter what it says.'' Said another: ''Bud doesn't mind having his picture in the paper and getting some recognition as long as it happens without his approval.'' He was referring specifically to the attention given Mr. McFarlane last year when former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. dispatched him to Israel for some tough private conversations with Prime Minister Menachem Begin. At that time, Mr. McFarlane held the sixth ranking position in the State Department, that of counselor. Mission to Pakistan Mr. Haig used him for special assignments, such as pushing the Pentagon to devise military options for dealing with Cuba and Central America. Mr. Haig also sent him on a secret mission to Pakistan to try to persuade leaders there not to go forward with plans to build nuclear weapons. It was in the State Department that Mr. McFarlane began working closely with Mr. Clark, who was then Mr. Haig's deputy. Mr. Clark asked Mr. McFarlane to come along to the White House with him to cement working ties with Mr. Haig. As a Marine accustomed to following orders and as an experienced staff man, Mr. McFarlane made the necessary shift in loyalties. Now, Mr. McFarlane sits in a tiny office, separated from Mr. Clark's corner office only by an even tinier office occupied by an executive assistant. Mr. McFarlane held that position himself for two years when Lieut. Gen. Brent Scowcroft was the national security adviser to President Ford. And for two years prior to that, he was the military assistant to Henry A. Kissinger, then President Nixon's national security adviser. It was a heady place to be for a Marine major. And it was there that Mr. McFarlane built his reputation as the quintessential staff man. As a rule, the quintessential staff man never ascends to high, visible office. But it was in that capacity that Mr. McFarlane met General Haig, who was serving Mr. Kissinger and Mr. Nixon in various capacities. Off to Okinawa ''Bud is very smart, very thoughtful, very loyal, keeps his own counsel and avoids publicity,'' said Mr. Scowcroft, ''and that's a pretty good combination.'' According to friends, the Marines did not appreciate Col. McFarlane's White House and political experience, felt that he had gotten too soft and so sent him to Okinawa in 1977. Feeling unappreciated and unhappy about President Carter's foreign policy, the colonel retired from military service and joined the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He returned to the State Department in 1981. People who see Mr. McFarlane only at a distance often describe him as being ''wooden'' or ''an automaton.'' Close friends report that he can be garrulous and even zany at small social events. There is, however, not much social life for Mr. McFarlane, who seldom arrives at the office later than 7 A.M. and leaves late at night, six and sometimes seven days a week. He helps prepare Mr. Clark for the early morning meeting with the President and often goes himself. Index Cards at the Ready He is seen reaching into his pockets throughout the day, pulling out three-by-five index cards to jot down notes. He is often on the secure telephone with the few other men who keep the wheels going each day, Under Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger and Deputy Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci 3d. They decide who will be responsible for what issues, and what information and recommendations need to be conveyed to Mr. Reagan and when. Mr. McFarlane also spends a good deal of time with other White House aides who find him one of the few foreign policy people they care to talk with and who have come to respect his political judgment as well. That quality in a man who was graduated from Annapolis and spent his life in the Marines surprises some people until they they discover that he was born into a political family. William Doddridge McFarlane, the colonel's father, was a Democratic Congressman from the 13th Congressional District of Texas from 1932 to 1938. Inevitably, there has been talk around the White House about what will happen if Mr. Clark moves on, and the possibility that Mr. McFarlane himself has a good crack at being national security adviser.

980-> Advertising; The Error Of the Mass Audience
IN recent years, says Robert H. Levenson, vice chairman and senior creative person at Doyle Dane Bernbach International, he has sensed a growing tendency among advertising people to think of their audiences ''in terms of multitudes.'' That's too bad, he said this week, because ''the essential thing in persuasion is to remember that there are individual human beings on the receiving end of your messages.'' Mr. Levenson has sent out a lot of messages in a quarter century of writing advertising copy at Doyle Dane, penning them on behalf of such folks as Volkswagen, Mobil, Sara Lee and Clairol. These days, he has responsibility for Doyle Dane's creative work on the international scene. Doyle Dane underscored the importance of its international operations this week in announcing a parting of the ways with Procter & Gamble. The agency said it believed in growing with its international accounts -some of which P.& G. had come to think conflicted with some of Doyle Dane's domestic work for P.& G. ''What this event this week does,'' Mr. Levenson said, ''from my own international perspective, is give us, internationally, the opportunity to show the kind of work that we can do to a number of clients who were not available for us to talk to before.'' When he is not musing about new business, Mr. Levenson does some reflecting about his industry in general, and he has come to feel, as he put it in an interview, that the ''power of television'' is probably the biggest reason for the tendency to think of consumers in terms of multitudes. This is because of the huge size of television audiences and the high price of television advertising time, he says. The error of that view, he said, can be seen in the behavior of millions of television viewers who were suddenly denied National Football League games to watch. When those millions were watching the games, he said: ''We treated them as a group, didn't we? And all the advertisers - the beer business and the car business and the like - who bought all of that advertising time were thinking of all those people collectively. Now, as it turns out, those people have been doing some very different, individual things'' with their new-found spare time. But it is understandable that advertising people have tended toward the mass view, he says. ''What happens to you,'' he said, ''not just as a copywriter, as anyone in the agency business or in the clients' organizations, is that you know there is an audience of that magnitude out there, and that they are so expensive to reach.'' The result, he said, is that ''you tend to forget that they are individual human beings; you tend to aim low'' in crafting advertising materials. ''Would you use a particularly colorful part of speech that you feel might go over the heads of some people in that audience?'' he went on. ''You tend not to do it.'' Mr. Levenson declined to single out pieces of copywriting to illustrate his point. But he said: ''What it tends to do is to make the messages more and more similar to each other.'' What that means, he said, is that ''it's pretty hard to distinguish much of the beer advertising from much of the other beer advertising; there are more similarities than there are differences, and I think that is probably true of automobile advertising,'' too. ''And then,'' he continued, ''there's a similarity in the major soft drink advertising; there's an awful lot of stuff on the beach.'' This flatness and sameness in advertising winds up costing the advertisers something, Mr. Levenson suggested. If consumers see similar commercials coming at them from makers of soft drinks, beer and automobiles, he said, then the individual ad ''needs more repetition in order to distinguish itself from its competition - and therefore becomes costlier, but I'm not sure by what factor.'' As it happens, at Doyle Dane, he said, ''we consider flatness and sameness to be a grave sin.'' And by the same token, he said, he likes young copywriters ''who aren't scared and who haven't learned a lot of bad habits.''

981-> 'OUTRAGE!': DRAMA BEHIND DRAMA
It was a case of art following life. Audiences at a new play at the Kennedy Center called ''Outrage!'' see a drama about a man who takes the law into his own hands, killing his daughter's murderer after the murderer has been freed on a ''technicality.'' What they don't see is the behind-the-scenes drama that led to the last-minute scrapping of the play's original ending, in which a jury found the distraught father not guilty of murder, but, instead, found the criminal justice system itself guilty as charged. The playwright, Henry Denker, changed the ending after officials of the Kennedy Center suggested that the father's acquittal could too easily be mistaken as an endorsement of vigilante justice. The play now ends with the curtain dropping just as the judge turns to the audience-as-jury and asks it to render its verdict. 'Some Emotional Release' Mr. Denker, who based the play on his own novel, said the purpose of the original ending was ''only to give the reader some emotional release.'' He said he wanted to portray ''a dilemma we're all living through,'' adding that ''it had not occurred to me'' that the verdict of acquittal would be taken as a statement of approval for the character's action. But he said he agreed to the change after Roger L. Stevens, the Kennedy Center's chairman; Harry C. McPherson Jr., its lawyer, and Thomas R. Kendrick, the director of operations, expressed their misgivings about the ending. ''I saw their point,'' Mr. Denker said. ''Someone could think the play was endorsing lynching, and I agree that's very dangerous.'' Mr. Denker, a lawyer who has written six Broadway plays and numerous other plays and novels, said he never felt that his arm was being twisted to change the ending. According to Mr. Kendrick, ''Outrage!'' was just about to go into previews, and in any event the Kennedy Center was fully committed to going ahead with the production. 'I'd Never Change It' He first toyed with keeping the not-guilty verdict but adding a brief epilogue in which the defense lawyer expresses some uneasiness about his legal victory. But for the first preview, on Dec. 9, he decided to try ending the play before the verdict. That worked, he concluded. ''Having seen it once in front of any audience, I'd never change it now,'' he said. Mr. McPherson, a special counsel to President Johnson, said that he read ''Outrage!'' at Mr. Stevens's request and ''very modestly put forward my two bits as an amateur critic.'' ''My concern was that the play didn't really cause the audience to do anything but cheer,'' he said. ''God knows there are strong reasons for cheering, but there are also strong reasons for being very disturbed. My feeling was that we ought to be left with a good deal more ambiguity, with an acknowledgment of how grave a matter it is to free the killer of another man.''

982-> PUNK ROCK: RAINCOATS, FROM BRITAIN
The Raincoats, a British punk-art-rock-feminist band that was one of the more curious but also most admired products of the late 1970's new-wave rock scene, gave its first New York concert in more than two years late Wednesday night at Danceteria - the beginning of a short East Coast Tour that ends up tonight at the kitchen, the avant-garde performance space. The set had a curiously unformed quality, which seemed partly ideological but also partly accidental. Ideological, because this band came together during the apex of the British punk movement's emphasis on amateur creativity - the philosophy that we should all make music for one another. The front line of Ana Da Silva, a Portuguese-born guitarist and singer; Gina Birch, a singer and bass player, and Vicky Aspinall, a singer, violinist and pianist, sings with hoarse, untrained voices and, except for Miss Aspinall, betrays no particular skill at instrumental work. On records, this odd folkishness makes a piquant contrast to the sparseness and ingenuity of the songs and arrangements, with straightforward rock leavened by a delicate, Orientalized eccentricity vaguely reminiscent of the Y Pants, the New York women's band that uses toy and miniature instruments. In person, however, the Raincoats' same fragile charm is not always so evident. There were reasons for that Wednesday. The less important were a group of women hecklers and a feedback-ridden sound system. More complex was the presence of three male backup musicians, an all-purpose guitarist-bassist-cum-saxophone player, a drummer and percussionist. Quite apart from the intrusion of men into this women's preserve, the newcomers' more overtly proficient but less individualized playing provided a foil against which the three women seemed needlessly naive. Still, the Raincoats write songs that are fascinating in their viewpoint and ingenious in their sound. And, at their best, the three women perform those songs with a haunting authenticity. Perhaps later in their visit they will be heard to better advantage, and perhaps later in their careers they will finally find the committed woman drummer they have always sought. John Rockwell

983-> 6 ARE KILLED AS FIRE SWEEPS CONDEMNED 3-STORY BUILDING
Six persons, including four children and their pregnant mother, were killed here this morning in a fire in a three-story tenement that a judge had condemned because of extensive fire and safety violations. Neighbors said the mother, with her youngest child in her arms, had screamed for help from the third-story window but had refused to jump or to drop the child. They said smoke then engulfed her and she disappeared from view. Ossie Laurin, who operates the Econ-O-Wash laundry a few doors from where the fire occurred, said the woman, Myra Reeves, had called to him from the window during the fire. ''She yelled for help,'' Mr. Laurin said. ''She had the baby on her hip and just kept yelling for me to help. There was a little smoke coming out of the window, but suddenly smoke shot out over her head and I didn't see her anymore.'' Rescuers Driven Back He said he and another neighbor, Alric Lynch, had tried to go up the stairs but had been driven back by flames. In addition to 26-year-old Myra Reeves, who was in her ninth month of pregnancy, the victims were identified as her children - Stephen, 2; Michael, 4; Lamont, 6, and Vernon, 7 - and Steve Pertiller, 35, who lived with them. The blaze, which started shortly after 7 A.M. at 202 Monticello Avenue was declared under control within half an hour. Officials were still investigating its cause tonight. Eight other members of the Reeves family - Myra Reeves's sister, Cheryl Reeves; her four young children, the parents of the Reeves women and their brother - escaped unharmed from a second-floor apartment. A fireman, John Morrison, suffered second-degree burns. Ordered Out in March Judge Elaine Davis of Municipal Housing Court said that last March she had ordered Myra and Cheryl Reeves to vacate the building and that the women's parents, who own the building, had also been told about the hazardous conditions, which were discovered during inspections. Judge Davis said that she had heard about the fire on the radio ''and I was horrified.'' ''I had ordered the daughters out and their children,'' she said. ''I told them that under no terms were they to remain in that building.'' Judge Davis said that Myra Reeves's father, Henry Reeves, had told her that he would repair the building, but that she had ordered it condemned anyway. ''There was no way he could have made the repairs,'' the judge said. ''The building was in such severe condition that the only alternative was condemnation.'' She said she had told the family that if they wished to risk their lives by staying in the building she could not prevent them but that the children were not to be housed there. Robert R. Shortell, the city's Director of Fire Prevention, said that the building, which is in an area where empty, boarded-up buildings abound, had a number of fire violations at the time it was ordered condemned and that some of them had been repaired. He said that smoke detectors had been installed and that their alarm had alerted some of the residents this morning. Mr. Shortell said there were reports that the women and children had moved out earlier this year but that they moved back in about a month ago. The Reeves family bought the building about six years ago, neighbors said, and members of the family had lived in it for about nine years. Efforts today to reach the family members who own the building for comment were not successful. The police said that they were in seclusion with relatives after the fire and that they could not disclose their whereabouts. Fire Capt. James Geraghty said that the apartment where the victims died had an improperly installed gas space-heater. He said that the unit was not properly vented. He said the apartment also had flimsy wood paneling. ''That's what caused the rapid spread of the fire,'' he said.

984-> RETREAT TO A MEXICAN SPA
EDEN ROSS LIPSON is an editor of The New York Times Book Review. BY EDEN ROSS LIPSON T here are vacations we dream about, holidays we plan and necessary interruptions that turn out to be exactly what we need. In my case the provocation was winter in Manhattan, and in the previous three months our family had survived major surgery, holidays, four birthdays and a wedding. The family consists of three children, four cats and two working adults, one of whom announced that he had an important brief due and would get to planning a scuba-diving holiday for us, soon. On a Wednesday morning it finally became clear that what I wanted and needed, desperately, was to be taken care of and left alone, simultaneously, and very soon. At 10 A.M. a friend who had been to Rancho la Puerta just happened to call the office. Fate. At noon, 9 A.M. their time, the pleasant voice in Tecate, Mexico, said yes, they had one vacancy, starting Sunday for the following week. Destiny. The ranch, one hour south and east of San Diego, Calif., just over the border, was started in 1940 by Deborah Szeckley, now better known for her smaller, more glamorous Golden Door resort in Escondido, Calif., then a child-bride of 18 starting out with her first husband. They set up tents on a 150-acre plot that backed into boulder-strewn foothills of the Sierra Madre Mountains in upper Baja California and began a serious vegetarian retreat. Times change, and today the ranch is a ''fitness resort'' consisting of low brick and stucco buildings, swimming pools and tennis courts, set among gardens of almost biblical lushness and featuring exercise, diet and quiet. Guests stay in comfortable cottages and villas. My suite did not have a working fireplace, but as I was alone and tired, and collapsed at 7:30 at night, it didn't matter. I did have a bedroom view of the mountain in the distance, an olive tree alive with birds and a prairie-dog castle in the foreground, a private, sunny patio to one side and a front door that opened to a heated swimming pool fitted with Jacuzzi hoses on a timer. There are heaps of fresh towels in the rooms and more available for the swimming pools. Meals appear in the dining hall punctually. There is an open fire and coffee and tea available day and night in the recreation hall. The new treatment center offers massages, herbal wraps, facials, manicures and pedicures all day long. Activities are scheduled from 6 A.M. yoga through daytime exercise classes to after-dinner movies and lectures. There are 4,000 books in the library. But, best of all, you don't have to do anything. The ranch routine is planned for visits of a week or two, with a Saturday to Saturday schedule, but aside from missing the weighing-in it made no difference that I arrived on Sunday afternoon. I was greeted, I feared, too cordially, and led off to the beauty treatment center to make appointments even before I saw my room. But it was fortuitous, because I had a wonderful massage only minutes later, a perfect way to begin to unwind. Before dinner I was given a strolling tour of the grounds and facilities, and after that I was sweetly, completely, on my own. I've always been the fastest kid on the block with an airplane ticket, eager to travel, keep moving, explore. But this time I wanted not to move, not to decide where to go or what to eat, not to organize new friends for some activity. Moreover, I was unhappily carrying a cocoon of baby-lard around my middle, the classic last 10 pounds of the previous year's pregnancy. The ranch program is designed so that you can go on a 1,000-calorie-a-day regimen and get a great deal of supervised exercise easily. The dining hall blackboard lists the day's menus and their calorie counts. If you are dieting, the 150-calorie breakfast consists of a boiled egg (and medium meant a six-minute egg, perfectly between hard and soft), a piece of fruit, and half a piece of toasted thick homemade bread. Lunch is either a fruit or vegetable salad or a hot vegetable dish. If you are following the diet there is a sample plate at the buffet showing how much to take. There's also a small serving of yogurt, fruit or acidocious (a yogurt drink) as well as a thin vegetable soup. If you aren't dieting - and many of the ranch's guests aren't - there are lots of extras. At breakfast there's cereal, scrambled eggs, bread and butter. At lunch and dinner there is always bread and butter as well as a ''muchas-calorias,'' a casserole, sweet potatoes, rice or some such, but you must ask for it. Alternatively, if you don't like the lunch or dinner, dieting or not, you can have a ''blitz'' plate of lettuce, cottage cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, onions and spicy salsa. At dinner the guests are seated and the soup, salad and main course are served family style. The fruit desserts are passed around. Fish is served twice a week. Having been food obsessed all my life, I was startled to realize that I had no food fantasies, was uninterested in conversations about food, and had no difficulty at all adjusting to the vegetarian fare. I was never hungry and I didn't cheat. If I ate too fast, that was part of the tension I brought with me. That I didn't notice until Thursday that there was no salt or sugar was less surprising because I don't crave salt and don't drink coffee. The exercise program is organized into 45-minute classes of varying difficulty and scheduled mornings and afternoons. The 15 minutes between classes actually are needed for pulling clothing on and off - one lives in leotards, tights and sweatsuits and running shoes layered in varying combinations. One chooses from slow-stretch classes, special classes like ''Backs and Bellies'' and ''Absolutely Abdominals,'' and vigorous ''Golden Door'' workouts that include a 7-minute stretch of aerobic dance exercise. The most vigorous activity at the ranch is the 6:30 A.M. mountain hike, for which I was told, as I huffed pathetically the first time I tried it, one should be running 2 1/2 to five miles a day. The mountain is steep but satisfying. The morning smells of sage, camphor and rosemary, and the bird songs were magical. On clear mornings a sliver of Tijuana and the Pacific Ocean, 35 miles away, are visible from the top of the mountain. Alternatively, if the hike is daunting, there is a 7 A.M. meadow walk. The whole idea of beauty treatments seems luxurious to me and I loved the massages, the manicure and pedicure. But I hated the herbal wrap. I was game, I'd never had one, it sounded innocuous and seemed a popular treatment. Along with six other women I was ushered into a darkened room lined with beds. There was Mozart playing softly on the phonograph. One at a time, the beds were draped with steaming hot, herb-infused linen sheets and we lay down and were wrapped up in the sheets, like so many wet mummies. We were then covered with blankets, the towels we had worn into the room were draped around our shoulders, our eyes covered with moistened pads and we were left to sleep for nearly an hour. The others may have slept. I thought I was being buried alive and lay there terrified, feeling trapped, panicky and sodden. Finally, and with difficulty, I unwrapped myself and escaped. Later, when I heard others raving about the relaxing, slimming benefits of herbals I thought perhaps I had just been too tired and I ought to try it again and see if the passage of a few days had changed my attitude and response. If anything, it was worse because I knew what was going to happen. I lasted about 20 minutes, feeling virtuous for having tried again, and almost deliriously relieved to be free of that heavy wetness. The ranch is co-ed and at capacity the number of guests ranges from 80 to 125 depending on the number of doubles. The week of my stay there were 85, including 16 men, about half with their wives and half alone and working on weight problems. Guests came from all over the United States and Canada and ranged in age from 20 (the week for two was a graduation present a Dallas mother gave her daughter) to mid 70's. Only a few women could have been called fat. Another few were both slim and fit. Most wanted to loose a few pounds. Most of the women worked outside the home, many in high-pressure jobs. More than half the guests had been to the ranch before and found the routine of rest, exercise and diet wonderfully soothing, a great way to ''cool out'' or take a break between projects. I enjoyed mealtimes and class conversations and plan to stay in touch with several people I met, but I appreciated most the tactful understanding of my need for privacy and renewal. Depending on whim and will power, you can take part in up to seven activities and classes a day, play tennis for hours, loll by the pool, in the hot tubs, or just be massaged and pampered. Many of the instructors sell tapes of their class routines and you can take the cassettes back to your room and flail some more, or take them home with you to try to maintain the drill. I knew enough to start exercising fairly slowly and have a massage daily, and was able to avoid crippling muscle strain. I pushed myself steadily and by the end of the week I went up the mountain at a reasonable snail's pace and could keep moving, later, through a whole ''Golden Door'' class. Different instructors have different styles. One day, in a class called Jazz Exercise, we hustled around to Olivia Newton-John's ''Physical,'' the next day we pranced out a finale to ''A Chorus Line'' and a third day we did a little belly dancing to music from a Turkish caravan. I didn't weigh myself in until Monday, and by Saturday I had lost 3 1/2 pounds (average for women, men lose more). I'm sorry I didn't do measurements because the changes were visible, multiple blessed inches. My clothes fit very differently and my family was most impressed. Better still, in the next five weeks at home I lost another seven pounds without making a particular effort, and I maintained a modest stretch routine. Last spring I wore clothes that hadn't fit in years and jeans I had thought were surely souvenir relics of youth. While I never intend to be so tired again, I would like to go back to the ranch for another self-interested break in the routine. But I would do it differently. I'd stay up at night for the Betamaxrecorded movies, the lectures, or just to talk to some of the other guests gathered by the fire in the recreation hall. Since I wouldn't be so tired, I'd plan the trip in advance and persuade a friend to go with me (that way my husband could go scuba diving guilt free). Since I live on the East Coast I would fly to San Diego a day early, spend an afternoon at the city's zoo, and get rid of the jet lag so I could start the ranch program at a higher energy level. It was pure luck that there was an opening at Rancho la Puerta when I needed it; I couldn't count on that happening again. Making arrangements How To Get There Most of Rancho la Puerta's guests fly to San Diego International Airport, where they are provided complimentary bus service to the ranch, a 45-minute drive southeast in Tecate, Mexico, just across the border from Tecate, Calif. Bookings are generally made three to four months in advance by writing to Rancho la Puerta, Tecate, Calif. 92080 or by calling the ranch's office in San Diego at 714-478-5341 Monday to Friday 8 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. or Saturay between 9 and 4, Pacific time. Guests must have Mexican tourist cards, which are readily available at border crossings and airports. What It Costs Single accommodations are priced from $750 to $1,750 a week, doubles from $600 to $1,000; all are individual adobe-brick cottages. The price includes meals, the exercise program and the use of all facilities (tennis courts, swimming pool, whirlpool, Jacuzzi and sauna) as well as the accommodations.

986-> WEST GERMAN POLICE SEIZE MOST-WANTED TERRORIST
The police arrested West Germany's most-wanted terrorist fugitive today in a wooded area outside Hamburg where he was digging an underground arms dump. The arrest of the 30-year-old Christian Klar, one of the remaining leaders of the Red Army Faction, comes only five days after two of his comrades, Adelheid Schulz and Brigitte Mohnhaupt, were captured in a suburb of Frankfurt. The Federal Prosecutor's Office said that a second person had fled from the woods west of Hamburg where Mr. Klar was seized, and that he was being sought. Mr. Klar was reportedly armed with a pistol and carried a false identity card. The arrest of Mr. Klar, whose thin face is shown on most-wanted posters across the country, is a political bonus for the new Government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and a severe blow to the terrorist band. Group's Leadership Depleted Justice Minister Hans Engelhard said the arrests this month had taken the ''driving force'' out of the small Red Army Faction. The terrorist group was given its name by its leaders, Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, before they died in 1977. Mr. Klar, a former Heidelberg university student who joined the terrorist movement in 1976, has long been suspected of involvement in the murders in 1977 of two Swiss border guards and of Jurgen Ponto, a banker, and Hanns-Martin Schleyer, an industrialist. The Red Army Faction terrorists are also held responsible for last year's unsuccessful assassination attempt on Gen. Frederick J. Kroesen, the United States Army's European commander. After Miss Schulz and Miss Mohnhaupt were arrested last week, the police found a grenade-launcher that had been used in the attack against General Kroesen in Heidelberg. The authorities said that coded plans of Red Army arms depots found on the two women last week had led the police to the thickly wooded area outside Hamburg where Mr. Klar was surprised this afternoon. U.S. Installations Attacked Though the authorities appear to have the Red Army Faction on the run, there have recently been a number of relatively minor attacks on United States military installations in West Germany. It is not clear what terrorist group has been responsible for this low-level intimidation campaign. A powerful bomb destroyed 20 cars and damaged buildings at a American military housing area in Giessen on Oct. 31. Yesterday a bomb was discovered hidden in a fire extinguisher in a 20-story American housing complex in Eschborn outside Frankfurt. With the arrest of Mr. Klar, some 20 hard-core Red Army Faction militants are believed to remain at large. Among them are Inge Viett, Silke Meir-Witt and Susanne Albrecht, the goddaughter of the slain banker Mr. Ponto, who was shot when he resisted a kidnapping attempt. Some 40 terrorists and their supporters have been brought to trial since West Germany was shaken by violence during the 1970's. Eleven of them are serving life sentences.

987-> Silver Shadow Sail Winner
Silver Shadow, sailed by Jim Plaxton of Ontario, finished first on corrected time among the larger yachts under the International Offshore Rule in the first race of the Long Island Sound Invitational fall series today. Silver Shadow, a CNC 41 in Class B, beat John Thomson's Infinity, the Class A winner, by eight seconds. Plaxton said that he had made most of his time on the second leg, a spinnaker reach. George Coumantaro's custom 65-foot sloop Bomerang was the first to finish, completing the 23.5-mile course in 2 hours 58 minutes 20 seconds. Blue Yankee, sailed by Robert Towse, was first in the single I.O.R. class over the shorter 17-mile course. Privateer, an SNS 42-foot sloop entered by Maritime College, placed first among the larger yachts in the performance handicap fleet. A record number of yachts, 151, entered the series conducted by the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, but only 80 finished. Thirty-to-35-knot winds caused a dismasting, a torn mainsail, a broken boom and many shredded spinnakers. The race for the two smallest classes was canceled by the committee. The John B. Thomson Senior Memorial Trophy will go to the I.O.R. yacht with the best overall performance for the three-race series, which continues Saturday and Sunday.

988-> BUSINESS CONDITIONS; DETROIT LOOKS AHEAD
For Detroit, the only good thing one can say about 1982 is that it is nearly over. All in all, this is likely to be the auto industry's worst year since 1958. After a weak first half, hopes that the July tax cut would spur sales have been dashed. Production, which was already at low levels, has been slashed an additional 25 percent since June, to just over 422,000 units in September. As of the middle of October, the United Automobile Workers reported that more than 237,000 employees were idle, the highest level in the last 22 weeks. If there is any good news, it is in inventories. In conjunction with production cuts, deals offered on 1982 models have reduced inventory levels from around 88 days of supply in August to roughly 70 today. ''The trend in inventories throughout the year has been good,'' said Maryann N. Keller, an industry analyst at Paine Webber. ''In general, there are very few car models with inventories over 100 days of supply, which is viewed as the point when stocks get to be really troublesome.'' While leaner inventories should place domestic manufacturers in a better position to take advantage of a rise in demand when it finally comes, the market is not likely to come surging back, Mrs. Keller said. ''Consumers are not likely to lose their concern with price for a long, long time,'' Mrs. Keller predicted. Moreover, it is very doubtful Detroit could handle the business if demand did pick up sharply. ''This industry almost physically could not go from 5 million cars built this year to 8 or 9 next year,'' Mrs. Keller said. ''Not only have assembly workers been furloughed, but supplying industries are also in very poor shape.''

990-> SPORTS WORLD SPECIALS; O Say Can You Sing?
Just like everyone else in Milwaukee last Friday, Frances Langford found herself caught up in the community's delirium over the Brewers as they prepared for their World Series game that night against the St. Louis Cardinals. ''This town is going crazy,'' said the former star of the Broadway stage, movies and radio. ''Everyone here is behind the Brewers. I went to a supermarket this morning and the motto 'Go Brewers' was stamped all over the checkout slip. It's like that all over town - you can't get away from it.'' But later on Friday, Miss Langford was in the eye of the cheering hurricane. She had been selected to sing the national anthem before the start of the opening game in County Stadium. ''I'm a big Brewer fan,'' said Miss Langford, who is married to Ralph Evinrude, the chairman of Evinrude Motors and an investor in the Milwaukee franchise. ''O.K., I have to be. But I really love this team.'' Miss Langford, who grew up in Lakeland, Fla., said that baseball and many other sports had been part of her upbringing before she attended Southern College and then used her husky singing voice to propel her to a career in show business. Miss Langford recalled that during World War II, when she was a featured singer on the Bob Hope radio programs, she had accompanied the comedian and his troupe on eight overseas trips to entertain American servicemen. She also made singing appearances before military audiences later in Korea and Vietnam. ''Singing the national anthem is nothing new for me,'' she said before her appearance. ''I've been singing it all my life, all over the world. It is a little difficult to sing because the range is so wide and the lyrics are a little difficult. But I don't anticipate any trouble. I'll just go down to the ball park a couple of hours before game time and speak to the organist, Frank Charles, about how we'll do it. We probably won't even rehearse.'' Miss Langford said that in recent years, her only other public singing appearances had been with Hope at some charity benefits in Florida. ''Oh, and we also own a restaurant called The Outrigger in our hometown of Stuart, Fla.,'' she said. ''Every once in a while I get up and sing a few songs.'' Miss Langford admitted that she had eagerly looked forward to singing the national anthem, though. ''It's the thought behind it that thrills you,'' she said. Thomas Rogers

992-> PAPAL CURB ON VATICAN BANK SEEN
Pope John Paul II issued today, at the opening of a meeting of the Sacred College of Cardinals, a document apparently intended to limit the Vatican's financial activities. The Pope's statement, in the form of a letter of instructions to the Vatican's Secretary of State, Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, came at a time when the operations of the Vatican bank are under scrutiny by a committee of 15 cardinals. Their report will be communicated to the College of Cardinals. The Pope made no mention of activities on which Vatican money must not be spent, but unofficial sources, including priests, believed that the Vatican bank would be barred from supporting private banks engaged in speculative activities. No official sources offered comment. The 15 cardinals discussed last week a document presented by three bankers who are also prominent Roman Catholic laymen. They were appointed by the Vatican to study the relations between the Vatican bank, the formal name of which is the Institute for Religious Works, and the Banco Ambrosiano, a private Milan bank that collapsed earlier this year. The Milan bank's president, Roberto Calvi, was found hanged in London. The Ambrosiano failure involved about $1.4 billion in questionable loans that were accompanied by letters of patronage, or endorsement, from the Vatican bank. Joseph Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia, a member of the committee of 15, said in an interview over the weekend that Ambrosiano had ''exploited'' the Vatican bank. The report of the three Roman Catholic bankers has been said here to exonerate the Vatican bank and its chief, Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus, an American. Cardinal Krol was thought to be supporting that view. However, a Vatican source said today that the Cardinal's view may not be fully shared by other members of the committee of 15, and consequently the findings of the three-banker panel may be submitted to the full College of Cardinals for review. The Pope's opening speech in Latin to the 102 cardinals assembled in the Hall of Synods here this morning made no mention of the bank scandal. But his letter to Cardinal Casaroli, while not speaking directly of the past, appeared to chart a new course for the future. Stating that the Vatican, while a sovereign state, did not ''possess all the ordinary characteristics of a political community,'' the Pontiff said that it must therefore avoid certain activities proper to normal states. He continued: ''The apostolic see does not develop, nor can it develop, the economic activity that is a characteristic of a state; and the production of economic goods and the enrichment of its revenues are excluded from its institutional aims.'' ---- Stake in Ambrosiano ROME, Nov. 23 (Reuters) - A former senior official of the Banco Ambrosiano said today that the Vatican indirectly owned 16 percent of the failed bank, according to parliamentary sources. The statement by Roberto Rosone, former vice chairman of Ambrosiano, is likely to sharpen the controversy over the role of the Vatican bank in the collapse last August of the Milan bank, the sources said. Officially published figures show the Vatican bank had a direct stake of 1.6 percent in Ambrosiano. Mr. Rosone was giving evidence to a parliamentary commission of inquiry into the activities of the P-2 Masonic Lodge, the exposure of which last year revealed a web of links between politicians, financiers and businessmen and led to the fall of the Government. The former bank officer, who narrowly escaped assassination earlier this year, was a close associate of Roberto Calvi, the Ambrosiano chairman whose death last June set off events leading to the bank's collapse.

993-> Q&A
Q. When a mosquito bites us, we itch almost immediately. Wouldn't it be more advantageous for the mosquito to evolve so we are not allergic to its bite? Then we would leave them alone. A. No scientific observers were present when man and mosquito evolved, so any answer must be somewhat speculative. However, it would certainly seem that mosquitoes would be better off if they could feed on us without resistance or resentment. Dr. Thomas Eisner, an entomologist at Cornell, points out that until recent times there were not many humans in the world, compared to all the other warm-blooded animals, and therefore there was little selective evolutionary pressure for mosquitoes to adapt to humans as a food source. Humans can swat a mosquito and kill it, but most four-legged animals can't. Therefore there is little risk of death to any individual mosquito as a result of annoying, say, a horse. Now that there are a great many humans, there should be evolutionary selection toward a mosquito that can come and go without a human feeling the sting, or perhaps even hearing the buzz. Only time will tell. Q. Why can I stop my car from rolling down an incline with little expenditure of energy, but could not do it standing outside the car trying to hold it back? A. A car is made to stop by dissipating its kinetic energy in the form of heat. The brakes turn kinetic energy to heat by making the disk or drum rub against the pad or shoe, and the driver need not exert energy equal to that of the car's motion to make the brakes work. Even without power assistance, the force that applies the shoes to the drums is much greater than the force the driver exerts on the pedal. The driver's pedal force is multiplied by mechanical levers and hydraulic systems and by designing the brakes so that once the shoe is in contact with the drum a mechanical linkage squeezes the two in tighter contact yet.

994-> CITY OPERA: 'LA BOHEME'
The New York City Opera is currently offering its production of Puccini's ''La Boheme,'' and Thursday night's performance featured neat, attractive, serviceable sets and staging by Lloyd Evans and Cynthia Auerbach and a consistently professional cast of singers. Both sopranos, Diana Soviero as Mimi and Inga Nielsen as Musetta, created big, vivid primary colors with their voices, but there were few attempts - successful ones, at least -at subtle shading of tone or dramatic emphasis. Michael Myers as Rodolfo was one of the City Opera's more pleasant-sounding tenors of the season. It is a light voice; but except for scattered moments of distress, it carried well and was pleasingly accurate. Mr. Myers's main problems were with his lower register, where sound tended to fade and at times even to disappear altogether. The lower men's voices - Dominic Cossa as Marcello, Spiro Malas as Colline and John Brandstetter as Schaunard - were consistently strong, and their steady quality shored up the entire evening. Don Yule, William Ledbetter, Harris Davis, J. Randolph Peyton, George Bohachevsky and Madeleine Mines filled the other roles. Vincent La Selva, the conductor, accompanied with reasonable care in the opera's major arias, but elsewhere he was a man in a hurry. His hasty tempos in Act II overtook and overran the chorus on stage; and in the ensemble numbers, Mr. La Selva seemed to go his own busy way and leave his principals to keep up as best they could. The coordination between stage and pit had an improvisatory quality most of the night.

995-> KOCH PUSHING PLANS TO AID YOUTH CENTER AFTER DEFEAT ON JAIL
After giving up a proposal to place a juvenile detention center on top of the jail to be built on the edge of Chinatown, Mayor Koch said that plans would be pressed to improve the old Spofford Youth Center in the Bronx. ''For a reasonable time we will use Spofford without commencing any other institutions,'' the Mayor said Friday. He added that improvements at the center might cost several million dollars. The original idea had been to close Spofford, which was built in the Hunts Point section in the 1950's, and replace it with two centers, the one at the Chinatown jail and the other at a site to be chosen. Bellamy Compromise But a number of groups had protested the proposal to put a 156-cell juvenile center on the upper floors of the 500-cell jail for adults, to be built at White and Centre Streets. Opponents said it was wrong to mingle facilities for the two age groups in one structure. In a compromise fashioned at the behest of the City Council President, Carol Bellamy, the jail was approved by the Board of Estimate on Thursday, 7 to 4, with the juvenile center dropped . The $71 million jail is scheduled to be finished in 1985. Neighbors of the new jail said, however, that they were not mollified by the removal of the juvenile center. They had argued at a Board of Estimate hearing that they did not want another jail of any sort in the area. The nearby Men's House of Detention, known as the Tombs, is being renovated.

996-> SUPERVISOR AT REACTOR QUESTIONED
Contending that the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island could have been averted, an attorney for the Babcock & Wilcox Company outlined in cross-examination yesterday what he contended were additional discrepancies in the testimony of the supervisor on duty during the accident. In Federal District Court in Manhattan, the attorney, Robert B. Fiske, indicated that the discrepancies could have been intended to cover control room errors after the accident. Babcock & Wilcox, which made the reactor that malfunctioned at the plant, is being sued for $4 billion by the General Public Utilities Corporation, which operated the plant through a subsidiary, the Metropolitan Edison Company. The utility says that Babcock & Wilcox withheld revised safety procedures prepared after a similar incident at another Babcock reactor 18 months earlier. Babcock & Wilcox contends that the plant's operators had all the information needed to avoid the accident but were too poorly trained to deal with it. Supervisor Is Questioned In cross-examining the shift supervisor, William Zewe, Mr. Fiske sought to show that control room data gave the operators a number of unmistakeable signs that a key valve had stuck open. Mr. Fiske also contended that Mr. Zewe recognized these signals shortly after, if not during, the accident, then changed the facts about what he knew when testifying before several investigative bodies and in the current trial. In the accident, when the valve stuck, large quantities of radioactive steam from the reactor system escaped into a drain tank. Because the valve problem went undetected for two hours and 20 minutes, the escaping steam filled the drain tank, blew out a safety disk and, condensed into water, flooded onto the reactor building's floor where sump pumps were tripped automatically in an attempt to clean it up. Babcock & Wilcox has acknowledged that no single instrument in the control room showed the key valve was open. But Mr. Fiske argued that the valve's condition should have been easily deduced from several figures displayed accurately by instruments in the control room: the temperature of the steam escaping the valve; the temperature, pressure and water level in the drain tank; the action of the sump pumps, and the pressure in the reactor building. Change in Testimony According to Mr. Fiske, Mr. Zewe has often changed his testimony regarding that data since the accident occurred March 28, 1979. For example, in direct examination earlier in the trial, Mr. Zewe testified that the temperature at the crucial valve was around 280 degrees when the accident occurred. But in several earlier investigations he reported that it was much lower. The lower temperature would indicate that the valve was closed but experiencing some leakage; the high temperature would indicate something was wrong, perhaps that the valve was stuck open. Mr. Fiske charged that Mr. Zewe changed the figures to cover up the fact that he knew right after the accident that the temperature at the valve was far too high and did not know how to react. Mr. Zewe said that he got the readings from one of his operators and that what he testified to earlier was what he believed at that time. At one point Federal District Judge Richard Owen, who is hearing the civil trial, interposed himself in the questioning. If the temperature at the valve was 285 degrees for more than an hour, and normal was 130, he asked Mr. Zewe, why had not he assumed something was wrong with the valve? ''I can't put myself back in that time frame,'' Mr. Zewe said. ''You're aware that there is on whopper of a problem,'' Judge Owen said, ''and yet an hour and 20 minutes and you haven't got a handle on it?'' By this time, Mr. Zewe's attorney, David Klingsberg, was on his feet. Judge Owen made a placating gesture. ''I'm exploring his motivation,'' the judge said. ''Something got lost in the translation, as they say.''

997-> Police in Moscow Arrest 60 At Silent Vigil on Rights Day
About 60 people in a group marking United Nations Human Rights Day with a silent vigil in downtown Moscow were arrested on Friday, witnesses said. Western correspondents who saw the roundup said several people were detained after removing their hats in a traditional Soviet sign of protest against human rights violations. But most of those arrested were just standing at the base of the statue to Pushkin, the witnesses said. No violence was reported.

998-> BOOKS OF THE TIMES
TEACHING A STONE TO TALK. Expedi- tions and Encounters. By Annie Dillard. 177 pages. Harper & Row. $12.95. I'LL grant the effects are always powerful in Annie Dillard's ''Teaching a Stone to Talk: Expeditions and Encounters,'' a collection of 14 essays by the author of ''Pilgrim at Tinker Creek'' and ''Living by Fiction,'' among other books. I was amused by the icy wit of ''An Expedition to the Pole,'' in which Miss Dillard compares a contemporary Roman Catholic mass, conducted to the accompaniment of a guitar group called Wildflowers, with the extremes to which humankind has pushed itself to reach the poles of the globe. She finds especially ridiculous the Wildflowers' singing of the Sanctus -''Heaven and earth (earth earth earth earth)/Are full (full full full)'' - as well as the fact that when Robert E. Peary reached the North Pole in 1909, he planted there, according to L.P. Kirwan, ''the colours of the Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity at Bowdoin College, of which Peary was an alumnus.'' To this Miss Dillard reacts wryly: ''Wherever we go, there seems to be only one business at hand - that of finding workable compromises between the sublimity of our ideas and the absurdity of the fact of us.'' I was stunned by the dramatic climax of ''Total Eclipse,'' at which point the author discovers why she and others screamed at the crucial moment. ''The second before the sun went out we saw a wall of dark shadow come speeding at us. We no sooner saw it than it was upon us, like thunder. It roared up the valley. It slammed our hill and knocked us out. It was the monstrous swift shadow cone of the moon.'' ''Less than two minutes later, when the sun emerged, the trailing edge of the shadow cone sped away.'' ''It had clobbered us, and now it roared away. We blinked in the light. It was as though an enormous, loping god in the sky had reached down and slapped the earth's face.'' And I got a sense of esthetic fulfillment from Miss Dillard's title essay, ''Teaching a Stone to Talk.'' She does know a man who has undertaken such an exercise, she confesses. But what she is getting at is not so absurd. Once upon a time, the Hebrew people asked God to quiet down. ''Let not God speak with us, lest we die,'' the people told Moses. Moses took the message, passed it along, and God agreed. But now that the Sacred Grove has been abandoned, we ask that the smallest stone may talk. That is figuratively what science and religion are up to. That is what Miss Dillard is doing in all her meditations on nature - asking God to speak to us through His stones. Yet I wonder at times if Miss Dillard isn't too effective with her imagery, if she doesn't sometimes strain for her results. I think of the eagle she writes of that a man once found with the dry skull of a weasel fixed by the jaws to its throat (''Living Like Weasels''), or of ''the lopped head of a boa, open-mouthed, on a pointed stick'' ''for decoration,'' (''In the Jungle''), or of a small deer in a village in Ecuador slowly choking itself to death in its struggle to remove a rope from around its neck. (''The Deer of Providencia.'') Sometimes I wonder if Miss Dillard isn't doing more - or is it less? -than proving she can stare unblinkingly at nature's indifference to suffering. At times I wonder if she isn't simply trying to spook us. Still, her final piece gives me pause about drawing any hard conclusions. In it she writes of standing by the bank of ''a sunny backwater upon which dozens of water striders are water striding about. They seem to be rushing so they don't fall in. I soon discover that these insects are actually skidding along on the underside of a cloud. The water here is reflecting a patch of sky and a complete cumulus cloud. It is on the bottom of this cloud that the water striders are foraging.'' Now, it could be that something about this image touches a universal nerve - something about the way that the earth and the sky are connected in it. But I know that it touches a chord in me, that it sprang a trapdoor into my past and dropped me sprawling into some dreamy childhood afternoon when there was nothing more pressing to do than watch water striders skittering along the undersides of clouds. It opened me clean up. Thus sensitized, I was particularly alert to the sound of the bicycle in the woods behind Miss Dillard as she stands by that sunny backwater, the sound of the cards slapping against the spokes of the wheel as the child on the bike comes whirring down the hill. ''I can see her through the woods downstream where the road evens out,'' writes Miss Dillard. ''She is fine, still coasting, and leaning way back.'' ''We do love scaring ourselves silly,'' the next paragraph begins. Miss Dillard scared me, because, as she has earlier warned us, the cards that are slapping the spokes of the child's bike happen to be aces and eights, the ''dead man's hand'' in poker, and the phrase ''leaning way back'' comes from an article the author once read on how to jump off a speeding train if you ever have to. But nothing so very dreadful happens. The fall that ensues is not off a bike but out of timeless childhood afternoons of watching water striders skid along clouds. This is what the piece is about, what ''Teaching a Stone to Talk'' is about - the fall into nature and relentless time. What I'm trying to get at is only this: If such an offhand image can do such things to me, then I can't really speak for what the other images in the book may do to you.

The Phillips Petroleum Company announced it had agreed to sell its Sealright Company Inc. subsidiary for an undisclosed amount to a group of investors composed mainly of Sealright management. Phillips said the new owners, which also include investors headed by George K. Baum & Company, would continue operation of the company's dairy and food packaging operations under the Sealright name. Phillips purchased the Kansas City-based concern in 1964. The transaction will be closed by Dec. 31, subject to approval by the Phillips board of directors, the company said.

1001-> Aims of the Trade Forum
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was formed in 1948 in an effort to encourage international trade. A major purpose was to reduce tariffs and other barriers to trade, but of equal importance was to assure all trading nations equal access to one another's markets. The 88 countries that are full ''contracting'' parties to GATT are pledged to give each other equal treatment in the application and administration of tariffs and other barriers. Industrialized nations, however, are permitted to give priority to imports from developing countries. All the major industrial, non-Communist countries belong. In addition to the 88 full members, 30 countries apply GATT rules in practice, but are not formal members. They include Mexico, Taiwan, Algeria, the Bahamas and the United Arab Emirates. Most Communist countries, including the Soviet Union, are outside GATT. A key function of GATT, whose 300-person secretariat is based in Geneva, is to provide a forum in which trade disputes or problems can be settled. That is the objective of the meeting that opened in Geneva yesterday. There have been seven special ''rounds'' of negotiations aimed at reducing barriers to trade. The most famous were the Kennedy Round, between 1964 and 1967, and the Tokyo Round, from 1973 to 1979. These talks, preceded by minsterial meetings such as the one in Geneva, led to reductions in overall tariffs on manufactured goods of about 34 percent.

1003-> Real Estate; Suburban Strength in Office Field
THE Westchester County office market has not been immune to the problems of the economy. But at a time when many office markets around the country are experiencing a slowdown, if not paralysis, this one appears to be doing well. Some experts find that the supply of Westchester office space currently exceeds the demand. Meanwhile, construction of several new buildings is under way, leasing is active and plans are being made for future development. This market, which borders New York City, is made up mainly of suburban office parks for major corporations and downtown office space in White Plains and a few smaller cities. An interesting aspect of the Westchester County office market is the fact that many experts say it is doing better than Manhattan or Connecticut's Fairfield County, which is also a wealthy area catering to corporate giants. ''Westchester lies between Manhattan and Fairfield, but Manhattan shows some signs of overbuilding,'' said Martin S. Berger, president of the Robert Martin Company, a large Westchester County developer. ''In Fairfield there is a heavy inventory of unleased space and space that is being sublet by corporations that are obviously cutting back due to the recession conditions. But Westchester, on the other hand, is doing very well.'' He suggested that Westchester builders had been more careful about the potential for overbuilding. He also noted that several major companies in the county (the Nestle Company, for example) had expanded their operations, contributing to real estate growth. G. Thomas Dadakis, who runs his own real estate company, agrees with some of these conclusions. ''Fairfield had all the action for a few years, but now it's Westchester,'' said Mr. Dadakis, who has brokerage offices in both Greenwich, Conn., and White Plains. Nearly everyone argues that Westchester's cheaper rents are a factor, but no one agrees on exactly what the figures are. Hyman Goldfeld, a major developer in Fairfield County, said rents in Westchester County were $10 a square foot less than in Stamford, Conn. In Stamford, he said, he charges $30 a square foot. Mr. Goldfeld is a joint venture partner with a British firm, London & Leeds, in a large project at Rye, N.Y., called Royal Executive Park. Eventually it will comprise 10 buildings with 900,000 square feet. Three buildings are complete, and two of them are leased. Mr. Goldfeld said he believes the office market in Westchester is better than anywhere else in New York, New Jersey or Connecticut. The county airport, which can serve corporate planes, is a factor in Westchester's favor, Mr. Goldfeld said. Mr. Dadakis said Westchester County rents had been about twothirds of Fairfield Country rents in recent years, but ''now they're within a dollar or two of each other.'' Rents in Westchester County, he said, now average about $15 to $18 a square foot. In new buildings, rents are as high as $25 a square foot, he said, and tenants pay for their own electricity. When landlords start offering free rent, it is usually a sign of weakness in the market. Mr. Dadakis said some landlords were giving free rent for as long as six months. But free rent, he added, is usually only for tenants signing long-term leases of 10 years or more. Mr. Dadakis also said that the amount of space available for immediate occupancy in the county had tripled since last spring. His survey shows there is now 1.9 million square feet available. Of that total, 990,000 square feet is prime office space. Mr. Dadakis noted that the market was exceptionally tight last spring. Most of the increase in space availability, according to Mr. Dadakis, ''is in the secondary, previously occupied buildings which have been vacated by tenants moving into newly constructed buildings.'' He said: ''While these older buildings may not be as desirable as newly constructed space, their asking prices can be as much as 50 percent less. The demand for office space has continued while the supply has increased substantially.'' The increased supply and the amount of older space on the market has caused rental prices to stabilize during the last six months, he said. The Schulman Realty Group, which owns 2 million square feet of office space in Westchester County, reports that its buildings are 99 percent leased. Other experts said the vacancy rate for the whole county might be as low as 2 percent. Among projects the Schulman organization is planning is a new office building for White Plains. The land has been purchased from the Fisher Brothers, large Manhattan developers, and Schulman will retain the project's name: Purchase Park.

1004-> SUSPECT IN A BRINK'S CASE AIDING U.S.
A self-styled leader of a group charged with several armored-car robberies and murders pleaded guilty to Federal charges yesterday, representing the first conviction growing out of the 1981 Brink's robbery in Rockland County. The guilty plea was made in Manhattan by Tyrone Rison, a 35-yearold Georgia resident, who agreed to cooperate with Federal authorities, providing a major breakthrough in the investigation. Mr. Rison admitted his own participation in the 1979 escape from a New Jersey prison of Joanne Chesimard and in several armored-car robberies, including a 1981 Bronx robbery that involved the killing of a Brink's guard. Miss Chesimard, a former leader of the Black Liberation Army, had been serving a life term for the slaying of a New Jersey state trooper in May 1973. He also admitted that he had taken part in three aborted attempts to carry out the Brink's robbery in Rockland County, but said he had not been present at the actual robbery, which resulted in the killing of two Nyack police officers and a Brink's guard on Oct. 20, 1981. Mr. Rison indicated that he had helped plan the $1.6 million Brink's robbery in Rockland County in 1981 and called himself the ''mastermind'' of a $500,000 robbery of another armored car in the Inwood section of Manhattan in 1980. He also said he had been waiting outside the prison during Miss Chesimard's escape. In pleading guilty, Mr. Rison described himself as one of five leaders of the group responsible for the armored-car robberies, murders and other crimes. He said the leaders were known as ''The Action Five.'' Besides himself, he said, the leaders were Mutulu Shakur, Nathaniel Burns, Donald Weems and Samuel Smith. Mr. Shakur is a fugitive wanted on Federal charges. Mr. Burns and Mr. Weems are awaiting trial on state charges in the Rockland County case, and Mr. Smith was killed in a shootout with the police in Queens. Mr. Rison waived his right to an indictment and pleaded guilty to two charges that were filed against him yesterday by the Federal prosecutors, Stacey J. Moritz and Robert S. Litt, in Federal District Court. The prosecutors told Judge Vincent L. Broderick in yesterday's court session that Mr. Rison had agreed to cooperate and was now in Federal custody serving a 12-year sentence for a separate bank robbery in Georgia. Mr. Rison was previously arrested and convicted for the Georgia robbery, which took place in December 1981. His wife, Emma, was also convicted in the Georgia case. His agreement to cooperate has won the release of his wife, who will be relocated with her children, under Federal protection. The new Federal charges accused Mr. Rison of participation in a racketeering conspiracy for several years and the robbery of a Brink's armored car in the Bronx on June 2, 1981, which involved the killing of the guard, William Moroni. Mr. Rison could face a maximum of life in prison, but his cooperation could result in some leniency. Several marshals stood nearby providing tight security in the courtroom during the guilty plea by Mr. Rison. When Judge Broderick asked him if he understood the charges, Mr. Rison replied firmly, ''Yes, I do, Your Honor.'' Mr. Rison is also known as Little Brother, according to the charges, which described him as a participant in a ''criminal enterprise'' composed of individuals who associated in a group for the purpose of committing numerous crimes, including armed robbery, kidnapping, murder and escapes from prison. The group also used some of the proceeds of successful robberies to finance ''a network of apartments and other residences known as safe houses,'' the charges said, adding that the ''safe houses'' were used to harbor members of the group who were planning robberies or hiding from the authorities. The charges identified 16 persons accused of being members of the group, in addition to Mr. Rison. All have been identified in earlier Federal or state charges growing out of the Brink's investigation. The individuals that the new charges named in the group with Mr. Rison included the six defendants awaiting trial in New City, N.Y., for the 1981 Brink's robbery and killings in Rockland County. Besides Mr. Weems and Mr. Burns, they are Katherine Boudin, Judith A. Clark, David J. Gilbert and Samuel Brown. Others accused of being members of the group included several persons indicted in Manhattan last week on related Federal charges involving armed robberies and Miss Chesimard's escape from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Clinton, N.J. They include Mr. Shakur and Mr. Burns, who is a defendant on both state and Federal charges. The others are Cecil Ferguson, Edward L. Joseph, Sylvia Baraldini, Susan Rosenberg and Cheri Dalton. Miss Rosenberg and Miss Dalton are fugitives. The charges against Mr. Rison also named four others as members of the group. One of them was Mr. Smith, who was killed in the Queens shootout. The others are William R. Johnson, who was arrested in Central America recently as a fugitive in the Rockland County case; Marilyn Buck, also a fugitive in the Rockland case, and Kamau Bayete, who was previously identified as a suspect cooperating in the investigation. Mr. Johnson's wife, Cynthia Boston, is scheduled to surrender to Federal authorities in Manhattan today. She had been released as a suspect in the Brink's case, but later fled after receiving a subpoena and refusing to cooperate with the Federal grand jury.

1005-> PAPERBACK TALK; A FIX ON THE FUTURE
''This is a tumultuous time in trade book publishing, a shakedown period. When it's over, fewer companies will be left and they'll be publishing a wider variety of materials.'' The prediction comes from Oscar Dystel, the man who became president of Bantam Books in 1954 when it was losing money and turned it into this country's preeminent paperback publishing house. Mr. Dystel - who came to book publishing via the Harvard Business School and the magazine business - has a new perspective on the book industry today; having recently cut his ties with Bantam, which he had been serving as a consultant since January 1980, he has set up his own consulting firm, Oscar Dystel & Partners. From his suite of offices in Rockefeller Center, he is now looking at the big publishing picture, and he shared some of his observations during a leisurely conversation one autumn afternoon. Over all, he sees a ''great future'' for the trade book industry, but he is critical of some current trade practices. A Major Mistake. ''There's a repelling look about the paperback racks today''; title after title assaults the eye with raised metallic letters, he says. ''It's difficult to generalize about this business, but a number of houses seem to be concentrating on trend publishing, imitative publishing. People are doing books to fill out a list in the erroneous belief that they need so many titles per season. It's an enormous mistake. The way to build a house is one title at a time. Each one should be unique; each should have enduring value.'' New Patterns of Power. ''The key to the business is this: Power lies with the holder of the copyright,'' Mr. Dystel declares. In the recent past, hard-cover houses bought rights from authors, published original works that they marketed through bookstores, and sold paperback houses the right to reprint selected titles for limited periods of time. The paperback houses then got those titles to a mass audience by selling them through supermarkets, newsstands and such. In the 80's, when paperback houses often acquire original works, they may sell hard-cover rights to other publishers who bring the books out first; they may publish both hard-cover and soft-cover editions themselves; or they may publish only in paperback. Whatever format or formats they use, they sell a great many books in bookstores as well as in mass market outlets. And when they follow past practice by buying reprint rights from other firms, they now ask for -and frequently get - longer license terms. Indeed, Mr. Dystel points out, Bantam recently obtained a license that runs for the length of the copyright period instead of for a much shorter time, as is the norm. Meanwhile, hard-cover publishers are trying to expand their range of options too, sometimes by exercising reprint rights instead of selling them. Mr. Dystel thinks they may make it a habit to repossess reprint rights - or, in the trade argot, revert them - as paperback licenses expire. And when old-line trade houses do decide to publish reprints of their own titles, Mr. Dystel believes they can gain access to the mass market. The way he put it was: ''If a large hardcover house reverted all the titles it has published and put them in its own paperback line, it would have power.'' A big, well-managed house with a strong list, he says, could reach the mass market through major chains and selected independent wholesalers. In his view, it would not need the services of a national distributor, the sales agency which has historically been the middleman between paperback houses and wholesalers who service retailers. Looking ahead, Mr. Dystel forecasts an end to the ''imitative hysteria'' that he objects to (''People will get fed up with romantic fiction, occult novels and thrillers''), and he declares that ''we have to be thinking about new ways of merchandising books.'' Perhaps, he suggests, variable discounts are worth considering; maybe publishers should raise the prices of good books that sell slowly by 20 to 25 percent and also improve the discount at which booksellers buy them. That kind of profit structure would bring the earnings from such books more into line with earnings on fast-moving titles and thus encourage people in the trade to keep them available. Pursuing the topic of variable discounts, Mr. Dystel notes that computerized billing makes them practical and tosses out one more notion for industry insiders and the public to ponder: What about instituting smaller discounts for booksellers on some blockbuster books? Consider the implications of that. Print That Pass. Publishers stand ready to help fans who feel shortchanged by this fall's National Football League strike arrange their own periods of contact with America's favorite contact sport. See: -''The Illustrated N.F.L. Playbook,'' an Official N.F.L. Publication which is new this year from Workman ($6.95), chock-full of colorful diagrams, charts, definitions and commentary by coaches and other experts, and designed ''to help fans at all levels see inside the game''; -''The 1982 National Football League Media Information Book,'' which the N.F.L. puts together for broadcasters and writers so that they can spout statistics with alacrity (it's also available to the public through Workman, at $7.95); -''The Complete Handbook of Pro Football,'' New American Library's illustrated annual (Signet, $3.95) that profiles the players who started sitting the season out on Sept. 21 and offers feature stories and statistics.

1006-> S.M.U. TOPS TEXAS TO STAY UNBEATEN
At the end, it was not the surprising new look of Southern Methodist University's Pony Express - with the senior tailbacks Eric Dickerson and Craig James lining up together in a power formation - that led the Mustangs to their wild 30-17 victory over Texas today at Memorial Stadium. The difference between the two strongest rushing teams in the Southwest Conference was two passes. One deflected into the hands of Bobby Leach, S.M.U.'s sophomore receiver, for a bizarre 79-yard touchdown after Texas had tied the score in the fourth quarter. The other fell incomplete when the Longhorns had a chance to tie the score again. ''Like Dandy Don in his days, huh?'' James said. The Mustangs, 7-0, are off to the school's best start since 1947, long before Don Meredith was the quarterback. They extended the nation's longest major-college winning streak to 11 games and preserved their No.4 ranking in the weekly wire-service polls, their highest in 22 years. Both tailbacks passed the 4,000-yard mark in yards gained by rushes and passes in their careers. Dickerson rushed for 118 yards, including a 60-yard run that set up his 2-yard touchdown in the second quarter. He has now gained 4,107 yards on rushes and receptions. Punted With Accuracy James rushed for 57 yards, made three punts that fell inside the Texas 20-yard line, and caught a 46-yard touchdown pass that gave him 4,007 yards and touched off the final S.M.U. celebration with 49 seconds to play. Moreover, Dickerson and James appeared in an offensive alignment that had never been used in their four years at S.M.U. They lined up together in the backfield, with Reggie Dupard, a freshman, as a third tailback. The alignment was not quite a power-I formation, and not quite a wishbone. A broken bone, perhaps. But it was the pass to Leach, more than any other play, that led to the unfurling of this banner at the end: ''SMU 100% Cotton.'' The Mustangs are serving a probation imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association that has not been completed. But the sanctions were not severe, and the Mustangs appeared on major network television for the first time in two seasons today, and are eligible for a bowl appearance. With a 4-0 conference record, they are tied with Arkansas for first place in the S.W.C., whose champion receives an automatic berth to the Cotton Bowl. Lance McIlhenny, S.M.U.'s junior quarterback, completed just one of his first six passes. He also committed the fumble that led to the 51-yard touchdown pass from Robert Brewer to Bobby Micho that cut the Longhorns's deficit to 10-7 early in the fourth quarter. A 41-yard field goal by Raul Allegre tied the score with 8:35 to play, and the first two S.M.U. plays that followed gained a total of 1 yard. On third down and 9 from the S.M.U. 21, Leach ran a short curl pattern designed to gain enough yardage for the first down. But McIlhenny was forced to scramble to his left. ''At that point,'' Leach said, ''the play was busted. The timing was thrown off, so the defensive backs were thrown off.'' Leach thought the ball would be intercepted. ''I tried to stop and say, 'I've got to make a tackle.' '' Under pressure, McIlhenny threw a pass that was headed directly at the defensive back Jitter Fields. But the ball struck Fields on his right shoulder pad and caromed backward into Leach's hands. ''The ball scraped off my arm,'' Fields said. ''I guess I should say I should have had it.'' ''I never saw the ball at all,'' Leach said. ''I just felt it in my hands and looked down at it and thought, 'Now I've got to run with it.' '' The Longhorns had a chance to tie the score again on their next possession, after they drove from their 18 to the S.M.U. 44. Brewer threw a pass up the middle for Herkie Walls, the senior wide receiver. But the ball went through Walls's hands, and on the next play, Russell Carter intercepted at the S.M.U. 30. That led to a 33-yard touchdown pass from McIlhenny to Jackie Wilson that gave the Mustangs a 23-10 lead. Before the season, James was mentioned in the Southwest as an equal of Dickerson as a Heisman Trophy candidate. But that consideration ended weeks ago as James grew upset with his more limited alternating role. He complained this week to a reporter, and although Coach Bobby Collins said James had been misquoted, James repeated today that he had not. But he had no further complaints. ''How many teams are 7-0?'' he said. Arkansas 38, Houston 3 HOUSTON (AP) - Danny Walters returned an interception 93 yards for a touchdown, and the quarterback Brad Taylor ran for two touchdowns and passed for another to lead Arkansas in the Southwest Conference. Arkansas is 6-0 over all and 3-0 in the league. Texas A&M 49, Rice 7 COLLEGE STATION, Tex. (AP) -Gary Kubiak threw five touchdown passes, three to the split end Don Jones, in the Southwest Conference game. The Rice coach, Ray Alborn, tried to give his team an emotional lift by having the players change into jerseys with their names on them, but Rice still fell to 0-7.

1009-> DWIGHT MACDONALD IS DEAD AT 76; CRITIC HAD ACERBIC VIEW OF POLITICS
Dwight Macdonald, the author, essayist, editor and gadfly critic of books, films and politics, died yesterday at Metropolitan Hospital of heart failure. He was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, L.I. Known for the wry, witty style he brought to his articles in such magazines as The New Yorker, Mr. Mac-donald nevertheless felt the swirl of political contention for much of his life. He set out as a Stalinist but then passed through Trotskyism, anarchism and pacificism and often seemed like a one-man anti-Communist Left movement all by himself. He was too much of an individualist and inborn skeptic to be beholden to any confining ideology for long. Though he admitted he had mellowed in recent years, he never was far from the jousting in public print that marked the much-splintered left in the years before and after World War II in this country. Named to National Institute Despite those decades of at times bitter argumentation, his literary merits earned him election in 1970 to the National Institute of Arts and Letters, the honor society for the arts chartered by Congress. He also held visiting professorships at a number of colleges over the years and taught at John Jay College in New York in the mid-1970's. ''I was a Trotskyist once,'' he observed in 1970 during a discussion of labeling people in politics, a practice he regarded with some disdain. ''Then I became an anarchist, and then I lost interest because I saw no possibility under Eisenhower. I began to worry about politics again only about 1965 -and that was over Vietnam. I'm not a radical now in the sense of believing in a revolutionary solution. But I don't fell particularly conservative.'' The Vietnam War, in fact, was the last catalyst to bring Mr. Macdonald into the national political fray. In 1968, he joined other activists on the campuses to speak out against American involvement and to urge young men to defy the draft even if it meant going to jail - in itself a criminal offense. How He Saw Disobedience ''I have reluctantly decided that civil disobedience is the only answer to the immorality of our times,'' he declared then. ''This is the first time in my life that I have ever felt obliged to violate the law.'' Among the books Mr. Macdonald wrote were ''Henry Wallace: The Man and the Myth'' (1948); ''The Ford Foundation: The Men and the Millions'' (1956), ''The Memoirs of a Revolutionist: Essays in Political Criticism'' (1957), and ''Essays and Afterthoughts: 1938-1974.'' He also edited ''Parodies'' (1960), an anthology of prominent authors from Chaucer to Max Beerbohm and beyond. Mr. Macdonald had the relatively rare distinction among contemporary authors of having one of his 1963 collections, ''Against the American Grain,'' reissued in 1980. The dedication of ''Parodies'' - a book that was greeted in The New York Times Book Review as a ''splendid compilation'' - read, ''To my dear sons Michael and Nicholas, without whose school bills this anthology would not have been made.'' Looked Beneath the Surface Mr. Macdonald had an eye for the underlying significance of events in politics and culture, a flair that made his writings more enduring than those of many other contributors to periodicals. In addition, he had the courage of his integrity that let him take a stand, revise his own opinions as the years passed and admit the errors of earlier conclusions. His witty and frequently learned criticism in The New Yorker, Esquire and other magazines appeared in collections that retained their interest and focus when the pages of the original publication had yellowed. He also applied unsparing standards of classical excellence and shunned flashy writing that impresses without containing substance. His New Yorker articles included profiles of Dorothy Day, the Roman Catholic social activist, and Roger Baldwin of the civil rights movement; a hard-hitting review of Webster's Third New International Dictionary; and a broadside at the Revised Standard Version of the Bible that defended the King James Version. Unafraid to engage in literary skirmishes with his peers, he also was the author of a much-discussed series of articles seeking to define the cultural divisions between those belonging to what he termed American ''mass-cult'' and ''mid-cult.'' Essays on who belongs to which appeared in his ''Against the American Grain.'' Criticized Warren Panel A critical post-mortem on the Warren Commission findings in the assassination of President John F. Kennedy came with his ''The Ghost Conspiracy'' in 1965. The author William Barrett, in his recent book ''The Truants, Adventures Among the Intellectuals,'' wrote: ''Macdonald had some kind of galvanizing power, either generating arguments of his own or attracting them down on his head, so that when he was present, disputes seemed to go off like small firecrackers all over the place.'' ''He is one of the very few political and social thinkers since 1940 to have maintained independence of mind and a style uncorrupted by the editorial politics of the journals he has contributed to,'' wrote Eric Mottran, a lecturer in American literature at Kings College, University of London, And Hannah Arendt, the antifascist philosopher, writing about Mr. Macdonald in The New York Review of Books in 1968, had the article entitled, ''He's All Dwight.'' Graduated From Yale in 1928 Dwight Macdonald was born in New York City on March 24, 1906. A bookworm from age 10, he attended the Collegiate School and the Barnard School for Boys in New York and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1924 and from Yale in 1928. He began to write as a boy, stimulated by his English teachers and such subjects as Greek. At Exeter, he helped edit the weekly school paper and monthly literary magazine. Majoring in history at Yale, he also won several literary prizes and was chief editor of The Yale Record, a columnist for The Yale News and managing editor of the Yale Literary Magazine. Mr. Macdonald got a job in 1929 at the magazine Fortune, then being started by Henry R. Luce, and stayed on for seven years at a time when the magazine staff included James Agee, Archibald MacLeish and John Kenneth Galbraith. Not committed to capitalism like Mr. Luce, Mr. Macdonald resigned in 1936 over changes made in an article of his on the United States Steel Corporation. It was about that time that Mr. Macdonald started reading Marx, Lenin and Trotsky, an experience that changed him in a few short years from a liberal to a radical to an ardent anti-Stalinist by the time World War II erupted. In 1937, he joined the magazine Partisan Review, which had been turned into revolutionary socialist but anti-Stalinist publication. Wrote for Trotskyist Journal As a member of the Trotskyist Party, he contributed to its monthly even as he began to write for The Nation, The New Yorker, Harper's and other periodicals. During World War II, which he opposed, he founded Politics as its publisher, editor, chief contributor and proofreader. A ''small'' antiwar magazine, it nevertheless was noted for its literary worth, featuring such authors as Andre Gide, Albert Camus, Victor Serge, Simone Weil, Bruno Bettelheim, Meyer Schapiro, John Berryman, Marianne Moore and Mary McCarthy before its demise in 1949 for lack of money and Mr. Macdonald's desire to devote more time to his own writing. In 1951, he became a staff writer for The New Yorker, remaining one until 1971. During that period he was also film critic for Esquire. Standing more than 6 feet tall, he and his white goatee became a familiar sight on college campuses as a lecturer, speaker and political agnostic. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and, from 1968 on, served as chairman of Spanish Relief Aid. Mr. Macdonald, whose first marriage to the former Nancy Gardiner Rodman ended in divorce, is survived by his wife, the former Gloria Lanier; two sons, Michael and Nicholas, both of New York City, and two grandchildren. A funeral service was scheduled for 1 P.M. Thursday at the Unitarian Church of All Souls, 1157 Lexington Avenue, at 80th Street.

1010-> THE WORLD; Arab League Stops at the Brink On Ousting Israel
Most countries at the United Nations neither love their enemies nor listen to their speeches. Harsh and frequent condemnation - as when the General Assembly dumps on Israel - is also acceptable diplomacy. But throwing a member out of the club went too far, the 21-member Arab League conceded last week. A Libyan-led attempt to expel Israel was dropped by the Arabs and other Islamic countries in the face of near-universal disapproval. They retreated to another verbal assault on Israel in a letter of condemnation to be read during tomorrow's debate on credentials. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said last weekend that if Israel were excluded, Washington would leave too, taking along its 25 percent contribution to the budget of the United Nations and to any affiliated agency that expelled Israel. Other countries might have made up some of the missing dollars, as Libya and Iran volunteered to do, but a United States walkout could have sunk the General Assembly politically. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar also advised the Arabs that the ouster would probably have ended the mission of 7,000 United Nations troops in Lebanon and have crippled the organization's aid program for Palestinians there. Washington contributed nearly one-third of the $193 million that the United Nations channeled to the Palestinians last year. Cooler heads among the Arabs deplored the timing. American sympathy for the Palestinian cause had risen since the Lebanon invasion and the massacres at the Shatila and Sabra camps; Washington's support would be crucial in obtaining Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon; President Reagan has offered a peace package that Israel has rejected - all of this as an Arab League delegation headed by King Hassan II of Morocco was calling on Mr. Reagan last week. In a parallel clash, an Algerian resolution in the International Telecommunications Union last week was watered down, 61 to 57, deleting a move to bar Israel from the agency's conference in Nairobi.

1011-> OUTDOORS; Knife-Makers Put Talents on Display
M any of this country's most talented creators of custom-made knives are displaying their work at the New York Sheraton this weekend. The occasion is the fifth annual, three-day, New York Custom Knife Show. Tickets are $6 for one day, and the hours are 5:30 P.M. to 11:30 P.M. tomorrow, 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturday, and 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Sunday. The Sheraton is at 55th Street and Seventh Avenue. Although the steels and higher-priced mass-produced knives approach the quality of some of the handmade blades, there is a special appeal to the latter because they were shaped and finished by hand. It is similar to the difference between hand-cut dovetail joints on a cabinet and those made with a router. Those made with a router are just as strong and sometimes more precise, but the magic is gone. Handmade knives, whether for skinning a deer or cleaning trout, also reflect the style of their maker, and the potential buyer can nearly always find one that delights both eye and hand. Some handmade knives are cherished for other reasons. I have one made with an apple wood handle that pleases me greatly, not only because apple has a wild and delightful grain but also because the knife's maker, George Herron of Aiken, S.C., fashioned the handle from wood I gave him. I remember the ancient, dying tree and the meadow in which it stood every time I use the knife. Another small hunting knife I own was made by hand in Finland. The blade is crudely done and shows grinding marks, although the steel is of just about the right hardness: hard enough to hold an edge and soft enough to be readily sharpened. I treasure that knife because of the workmanship that went into its bone and leather handle and its leather and engraved-bone sheath. I don't carry the Finnish knife on camping, canoeing or hunting trips because the loop of braided rawhide with which one hangs the sheath from one's belt appears to be rather flimsy and I don't want to spoil the integrity of the sheath by affixing something more substantial to it. The Herron knife is with me always when I am in the woods. Many people obtain such a knife, as I did, for essentially utilitarian reasons, but collectors probably account for more than half the sales of handmade knives. Although all the knives these craftsmen make will do a superlative job of cutting, some are so ornate and so handsome, that their owners do not use them. Mr. Herron fashions about half a dozen knife styles, all intended for practical use, although he will, on request, make one to a customer's specifications. He is a past president, and currently a director, of The Knifemakers Guild which has 217 voting members and more than 60 so-called probationary members. The guild was formed in 1970. Although Mr. Herron's knives are made to be used, he says that about half his output goes to collectors. According to Paul Tausig Jr., producer of the show, well-known actors and entertainers are or have been collectors, with Peter Fonda, Johnny Cash, the late Steve McQueen, Robert Culp, Robert Stack, Sammy Davis Jr., Buddy Hackett and Clint Walker among them. N o matter who owns them, knives are collected because the owners enjoy looking at them and handling them. Knives of that type have tripled in value during the last decade. Present prices for a custom-made knife range from about $50 to $5,000. Almost every kitchen has some of those horrible knives made of stainless steel so soft that they are useless. In recent years, however, there are some excellent stainless steel knives being used in both mass-produced knives and custom-made knives, steels that hold an edge as well as high carbon steel. The main advantage of stainless steel is that it resists tarnishing and rust. In the home, if one will wash and carefully dry a high carbon steel knife immediately after using it, there is no advantage to switching to high-quality stainless steel, which, because of the chromium content, is a bit more difficult to sharpen. Visitors to the New York show will see a large variety of knives, ranging from the practical - albeit beautifully designed and executed - to what Mr. Herron calls the ''art pieces that some fellows make that would be a shame to use.'' They will also see daggers and folding knives and will discover that in some instances they may have to wait a few years for a knife that catches their fancy to be made.

1013-> HEART PATIENT UNDERGOES SURGERY TO CORRECT AIR LEAK COMPLICATION
Dr. Barney B. Clark, who on Thursday became the first recipient of a permanent artificial heart, was taken back to the operating room this evening so doctors could correct the first complication to his recovery. In a one-hour operation, the doctors sealed several leaking air-filled blisters in Dr. Clark's lungs that they said were unrelated to his artificial heart mechanism. Dr. Clark's artificial heart is driven by an air compressor attached to his body by hoses. Problem Called Minor Dr. Chase N. Peterson, vice president for health affairs at the University of Utah Medical Center said the complication was ''minor.'' He said the surgery this evening meant ''a pause in the recovery,'' not a setback. Nurses attending Dr. Clark, who had been taken off the critical list early this morning, noticed swelling around his chest and neck this afternoon. Doctors diagnosed the problem as subcutaneous emphysema, small pockets of air forming under the skin, arising from blebs, or blisters, in Dr. Clark's lungs. Dr. Clark was taken back to the operating room at 5 P.M., where the same team of doctors who rescued the 61-year-old retired dentist from death a few days ago found the cause of the first complication to his recovery. At 6:10 P.M., a spokesman at the University of Utah Medical Center said the operation was successful and that Dr. Clark had been returned to his room. Calls Sunrise 'Beautiful' Until the swelling was noticed, Dr. Clark had been recovering rapidly. When he awoke this morning, with the sun rising over the snow-capped Wasatch Mountains and striking the window shades of his hospital room, he said, ''It's beautiful. I feel good.'' Because his new, polyurethane heart was working so well, he was taken off the critical list at 7 A.M. His condition was described as serious but stable. Reconstruction of Operation A minute-by-minute reconstruction of the extraordinary, tensionfilled implantation procedure early Thursday, and the critical hours that followed, shows that the anesthesiologists emerge as some of the most important members of the team, in addition to the surgeons, the developer of the device and the patient himself. These anesthesiologists put Dr. Clark to sleep by using a risky narcotic 100 times more potent than morphine, which they thought, correctly, would not stop his dying heart, as they feared conventional anesthetics would. When doctors returned Dr. Clark to the operating room this evening, they noted that the new artificial heart allowed them to use a general anesthetic to put him to sleep, because he no longer had a weak natural heart to worry about. These and other key elements of the medical procedures were disclosed in a series of interviews and conversations with hospital officials and several of the doctors and nurses involved. Wasn't Expected to Live Dr. Jeffrey L. Anderson, who arranged for Dr. Clark to meet with the members of the artificial heart unit of the University of Utah Medical Center, said Dr. Clark was not expected to live when his heart condition was diagnosed in 1980. Dr. Clark was suffering from cardiomyopathy, a disease in which the muscles of the heart eventually deteriorate to such a state that it cannot function. At 61 years of age, Dr. Clark was too old for a human-heart transplant and all other forms of treatment had failed. By last Monday his condition had worsened and he was rushed to Salt Lake City by helicopter ambulance. Doctors on the artificial heart team examined Dr. Clark and agreed that he was a suitable candidate. In the presence of members of the university's ethics committee, Dr. Clark read and signed an 11-page consent form explaning possible risks and complications arising from the surgery. He signed the form a second time the next day. On Tuesday the doctors took X-rays, echocardiograms and performed other tests. They scheduled the operation for Thursday morning. Meanwhile, they prescribed more drugs to try to reduce the excessive fluid that had accumulated in Dr. Clark's body and to correct other abnormalities. Operation Rescheduled But Dr. Clark's condition turned rapidly worse. His heartbeat, already abnormal from a condition called chronic atrial fibrillation, developed a variety of other, much more dangerous rhythms that did not respond to the standard therapies. On Wednesday afternoon, Dr. Ken Casey, a cardiologist, had to thump on Dr. Clark's chest with his fist to keep the heart beating. Later Wednesday, not long afterward but still before the operation could proceed, Dr. Clark's heart began to beat in a potentially lethal rhythm called ventricular tachycardia. The doctors were frightened, they acknowledged, and they decided to move up the operation. The Operation Begins Dr. Clark was wheeled to the operating room at 10:10 P.M. Wednesday as doctors hovered over the monitor that recorded his heart beats. The anesthesiologist, Dr. Nathan Pace, likened the initial operating room scene to a circus. About 30 people were there, about twice the usual number. Ordinarily, Dr. Pace prescribes sedatives to calm patients before they go to the operating room. But Dr. Clark was sicker than any patient to whom he had ever given anesthesia. Dr. Pace was worried that such sedatives might further weaken Dr. Clark's dying heart and that it might stop before Dr. William C. DeVries, chairman of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the health center, could begin the operation. Dr. Pace told Dr. Clark: ''I want to make you comfortable, but I don't want to hurt your heart. If you feel you will be placid enough, I won't give you anything.'' The patient and anesthesiologist made a deal. ''We didn't give him anything at all,'' Dr. Pace said. Doctors Nervous In the operating room, Dr. Pace began to insert tubes into several of Dr. Clark's arteries and veins. Some would be used to monitor his blood pressure and heart function. Others would be used to inject fluids and nourishment. Dr. Pace noticed a television camera focusing on his hands as he stuck Dr. Clark with a needle. ''It was the only time I felt nervous, with all those people watching me,'' Dr. Pace said. The needle went in on the first try. Then it was time to induce anesthesia to render the patient unconscious. Dr. Pace decided on a narcotic drug called Fentanyl, which has a quicker effect on the brain than other drugs. It has less of a depressant effect on the heart and circulatory system that traditional drugs and its effect last several hours. The doctors were still worried that Dr. Clark's heart might stop. As the patient's chest was shaved, surgeons stood by ready to open his chest, massage his heart and put him on the heart bypass machine if needed. As the Fentanyl went into his body, Dr. Clark, who was cooperative and placid, became progressively less responsive. Muscles Are Paralyzed Dr. Pace and a resident anesthesiologist, Dr. Morris Matthews, began to assist Dr. Clark's breathing. First, the doctors wanted to paralyze Dr. Clark's muscles so it would be easier to insert a breathing tube into his windpipe. Such intubation is standard in major surgery and its main purposes are to prevent stomach contents from being aspirated into the lungs as well as to help the patient breathe. Again, many of the drugs commonly used for that purpose also can affect the heart in ways that might have jeopardized Dr. Clark's life. Dr. Pace chose a drug called metocurine that he believed would have the least chance of lowering Dr. Clark's already weak blood pressure and inducing the potentially fatal heart rhythm abnormalities. Metocurine is a derivative of curare, the deadly poison found in South America. ''It worked,'' Dr. Pace said. At 11:27 P.M., the surgeons cut the skin on the front of the chest, making a vertical incision from the sternum at the top of the rib cage to the xiphisternum at the bottom. They used a device to spread the two sides of the rib cage apart, exposing Dr. Clark's huge heart. It quivered, rather than beat with strong contractions. The surgeons prepared to connect Dr. Clark to the heart by-pass machine. By midnight, it was in place. Music Tape Changed By then many of the critical points in Dr. Pace's care were over, and the anesthesiologist said he was no longer nervous. Music was playing in the operating room. Dr. Pace, who sings in the Utah Chorale, selected a new cartridge, Ravel's Bolero. Meanwhile, Dr. DeVries and his assistant, Dr. Lyle Joyce, started to cut out the lower two-thirds of Dr. Clark's diseased heart. At 12:07, the bottom two chambers of the heart, the left and right ventricles, were removed. When the damaged heart was held up for everyone to see, ''It was a bizarre sight,'' Dr. Pace said. But it was a sight familiar to Dr. Anderson, who had worked in the human-heart transplant program at Stanford Medical Center. 'No Going Back' Nevertheless, Dr. Anderson said, ''It was a dramatic moment. There was no going back.'' ''From there on we were going on faith,'' he said. Faith that the artificial heart, called the Jarvik 7, for Robert K. Jarvik, who designed it. would work. Dr. DeVries passed the discarded heart to Dr. Jeffrey Anderson and Dr. Fred Anderson, and began to attach the artificial one. Dr. Peterson, the univesity's vice president for health affairs, described it as ''a soft overripe zuchini squash.'' While the surgeons went on, Dr. Jeffrey Anderson went out of the operating room to deliver the heart to the pathologist on duty. He carried it in a surgical tray that was draped in a blue towel. By 2:02 A.M., the second half of the artificial heart was attached and at 2:20 A.M. the doctors started the device. Another Crisis Now another crisis: the new heart was not pumping blood out of the left ventricle. The surgeons fussed with the device manually, opening the ventricle three times. ''We got worried,'' Dr. Peterson said. The reason was that each time the ventricle was opened a few bubbles of air could have entered Dr. Clark's circulatory system, and he might have suffered a stroke. There was no way the doctors could tell, however, until the anesthesia wore off. At 4:09 A.M. the artificial heart was working as it should. The heart by-pass machine was stopped after a long run, more than four hours. ''Obviously, things were much more relaxed then,'' Dr. Pace said. Complications Arise The surgeons patiently fixed the tears that had been made in the remaining natural heart tissue when they were repairing the artificial heart. There were other problems to be corrected. For one, Dr. Clark developed a condition called hemoglobinuria that Dr. Pace attributed to the destruction of a large number of red cells while he was on the by-pass machine. For another, he developed intense spasm of the tubes in the lung called the bronchi. Dr. Pace injected a drug called aminophyline to help his breathing. The last stitch to close Dr. Clark's chest was made at 6:35 A.M. Wriggles Fingers and Toes About 7 A.M., Dr. Clark was in the specially equipped room in the intensive care unit. About 9:30 A.M. Dr. Clark opened his eyes. Shortly thereafter he wriggled his toes and moved his arms and legs on command. The doctors knew he did not suffer a stroke. Dr. Pace spoke with Dr. Clark's wife, Una Loy, 61, and warned her that her husband, like other patients returning from heart surgery, would look strange. His hands and face would be even puffier than they were before surgery. Nevertheless, Mrs. Clark ''was shocked'' when she first saw her husband after the artificial heart was implanted, according to Linda Gianelli, one of Dr. Clark's nurses. Once Dr. Clark was in the intensive care unit, there were many unknowns because no one had done the operation before and no one had reversed chronic congestive heart failure. The doctors wondered if the remaining portions of the patient's cardiovascular system would respond appropriately to the artificial heart. Blood Pressure Normal The doctors measured the amount of urine Dr. Clark's kidneys produced each minute. He began diuresing, excreting the fluid that had made his feet and abdomen swell. His skin turned a healthy pink, rather than the sickly blue that had signified a severe lack of oxygen before surgery. His blood pressure held in the normal range, 124 over 60. None of the complications that the doctors were looking for had occurred. There was no bleeding. But for the myriad complications Dr. Clark still faces in the days and weeks ahead, there is one that he does not share with other patients who have had open-heart surgery. Postoperatively, many such patients often develop heart rhythm abnormalities of the type Dr. Clark suffered just before his operation. But Dr. Clark cannot develop any rhythm abnormalities. The artificial heart is his only beat and rhythm. The doctors adjust the rate. At last report, it was 90. The artificial heart is not audible to others without a stethoscope, according to Mrs. Gianelli. But she and others hear it as they check the quality of his breath sounds through a stethoscope. Little Rest for Patient Dr. Clark has two nurses around the clock. Some have stayed on because of a snow storm that occurred while the surgery was in progress. The staff wears surgical gowns mainly as a constant reminder of the dangers of infection to the patient. ''We stress good hand washing techniques,'' Mrs. Gianelli said. The nurses remind Dr. Clark to move his legs to prevent potentially life-threatening phlebitis and blood clots from forming. Dr. Clark breathes into a machine called a spirometer to exercise his lungs to help prevent pneumonia and the collapse of the air sacs. Dr. Clark has not watched television for any extended period of time. From time to time he strokes his forehead with his fingers. Doctors come and go to examine him, take blood samples and check the equipment. There is so much going on that Mrs. Gianelli said it was hard for him to get rest. His wife, sometimes accompanied by a daughter and son-in-law, visits for 20 minutes four times each day, according to hospital rules. Mrs. Gianelli summed up the consensus of why Dr. Clark has done so well, in addition to the extraordinary medical expertise and technology that has been made available to him. It is, she said, ''his will to live.''

1014-> U.S. ENVOY WARNS SALVADOR
Ambassador Deane R. Hinton warned today that United States aid to El Salvador could be halted unless the Government checks rightist ''thugs'' accused of murdering thousands of civilians. ''You don't have to kill people in the night,'' Mr. Hinton told businessmen at a Chamber of Commerce luncheon. ''You don't have to decapitate people'' to defeat the leftist rebels fighting a three-year civil war, he said. The speech, one of Mr. Hinton's strongest statements against rightist violence, came a day after Undersecretary of Defense Fred C. Ikle ended a 24-hour visit to El Salvador. The United States Embassy had denied reports that Mr. Ikle was sent to warn rightist leaders that continued civilian deaths could jeopardize American aid. ''The Mafia must be stopped,'' Mr. Hinton said. ''The gorillas of this Mafia, every bit as much as the guerrillas in Morazan and Chalatenango, are destroying El Salvador. If not, the United States, in spite of our commitment to the struggle against Communism, could be forced to deny assistance to El Salvador.'' The El Salvador Human Rights Commission says 38,000 people have been killed in the civil war, 80 percent of them civilians caught in crossfire or slain by rightist death squads that have been linked to the security forces. Congress must approve any United States aid to El Salvador, which totals $320 million in economic and military assistance this year. So far Congress has given its approval, but only on condition that the human rights record improves.

1016-> STALKING THE COMMON COLD
Unless one has a health problem that will be aggravated by a cold, there are certain benefits that a runny nose and a scratchy throat provide. When I get a cold, I cancel or postpone all business and personal appointments. I call in sick at work, and then relax. I don't have to get dressed. I catch up on all the magazines and books that have piled up. I check out daytime television. No one asks me to do anything constructive. I'm on sort of a ''vacation'' from the usual routine. God bless the common cold! JOHN SCOTT FONES Scarsdale, N.Y.

1017-> ABOUT BOOKS AND AUTHORS
A Love for Travel WHEN Jorge Luis Borges first spoke at the Center for Inter-American Relations in New York, shortly after its opening in 1967, his address was on ''The Poet in Argentina.'' Since then, Mr. Borges, who has spent most of his life in his native Buenos Aires, has been back several times. He was there again earlier this month when some 60 friends and admirers turned out for a dinner in his honor. Among those on hand were John Macrae 3d of E.P. Dutton, his American publisher; translators Gregory Rabassa and W.S. Merwin; biographer Frank MacShane; writers Elizabeth Hardwick and Jerome Charyn; Isaac Goldemberg, a Peruvian novelist, and Luisa Valenzuela, an Argentinian novelist. The 83-year-old Mr. Borges has been blind for almost 30 years, and time has taken its toll. But that did not keep him from agreeing to a full round of activities, including the James Lecture at the New York Institute for the Humanities at New York University. Said Maria Kodama, Borges's traveling companion and secretary, ''Whenever he knows he's going to go on a trip he gets very excited and says, 'Now I can see this place or that place.' The years have not diminished his love for travel.'' Susan Sontag paid tribute to the honored guest, saying, ''There is no writer living today who matters more to other writers than Borges. Many people would say he is the greatest living writer. ... Very few writers of today have not learned from him or imitated him.'' Supply-Side Publishing SOME authors toss out original manuscripts, others donate them to libraries, while still others save the pages to write on the unused side. But a growing number of original manuscripts, it seems, are being published in limited editions. William Buckley Jr. arranged for a special edition of his recent book, ''Atlantic High,'' each leather-bound, boxed copy of which contains one page of the original manuscript in a plastic sleeve. Since Mr. Buckley didn't include pages that contained only a few words, or pages that were retyped before he submitted them to the publisher, the special edition is only 240 copies. But each manuscript page contains changes and revisions in Mr. Buckley's distinctive red pen. Unlike Doubleday's regular trade edition, which costs $22.50, each number of the special edition sells for $300. The proceeds are earmarked for National Review, Mr. Buckley's staunchly conservative magazine which has a perennially liberal deficit. A Dangerous Business WHEN the story was first brought to our attention, we thought it merely an anecdote. But so many editors and publishers continue to refer to the item from The Bookseller, the British trade journal, that we can only say, here goes: Alan Hill, chairman of Heinemann Educational Books of Nigeria, was driving between Lagos and Ibadan several months ago to attend the company's annual meeting. With him was Heinemann's deputy managing director and the driver. Darkness had fallen when they found themselves on a one-lane road, across which a parked van blocked four or five cars waiting in a queue. Only then did the Heinemann people realize the reason for the delay: Armed robbers were dragging people from their cars and slashing them with cutlasses. The driver tried to put the Heinemann car in reverse, but by then another van blocked the lane behind them. Since the Heinemann car had four-wheel drive, the driver roared off the road, making a violent U-turn and a high-speed escape. Later the trio met a carload of heavily armed police with whom they returned to the scene of the ambush, where they found two bodies. A mile or two farther down the road they encountered the survivors, some wounded, all stripped of their belongings. ''You were lucky,'' one of them said to the Heinemann trio. Whereupon Mr. Hill, speaking from long experience, replied, ''There's no such thing as luck in publishing.''

1018-> HOW BUSINESS READS THE VOTE
Many businessmen and private economists yesterday greeted results of Tuesday's off-year elections as an opportunity for the President and Congress to make necessary midcourse economic corrections. And the stock market, in a record-shattering session, added its own endorsement of the election returns. Despite Democratic gains in Congress and in state capitols across the country, businessmen said they did not interpret the results as a repudiation of the Reagan economic program, which aims at stimulating the economy by reducing business and personal taxes, encouraging private investment and following a tight monetary policy. But many said they expected the White House and Congress to take a more realistic approach when debate over the 1984 fiscal budget begins in earnest next winter. 'I Don't See a Revolt' ''I don't see the results as a revolt against the President or as a revolt against his inflation policy,'' said Philip Caldwell, chairman and chief executive officer of the Ford Motor Company. ''But I do believe the electorate wants a greater degree of pragmatism between the Administration and Congress.'' The election result ''seems to be acceptance of the stay-on-thecourse philosophy that Reagan has used as his catch phrase,'' said Frederick Jaicks, chairman of the Inland Steel Corporation. Notwithstanding the executives' optimism about a possible change in fiscal policy, most doubted that the election outcome would have any short-term effect on their own companies' prospects. ''Our world is a little brighter, mostly because of the gubernatorial race,'' said George M. Keller, chairman of the Standard Oil Company of California. ''But for the oil industry in general, the election produced no obvious changes. The whole world is still in a very deep recession.'' George Deukmejian, a conservative Republican, won the governorship in California. The stock market, whose movements often presage economic turning points, responded joyously to the election results. In a historic session, the Dow Jones industrial average surged a record 43.41 points yesterday, to 1,065.49, also a record. Effect of Interest Rates In the last three months, the market's recovery has been fueled by a sharp decline in interest rates. Further drops in rates in the short term are likely, the executives said, ''Rates are on the way down, election results or no,'' said Dexter F. Baker, president of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. ''The economy and the Fed are forcing them down.'' Jerry J. Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers, agreed, saying, ''This election produced a sufficiently moderate change so that economic factors and not uncertainty will continue to dominate the credit markets,'' Much of the executives' reaction seemed almost a sigh of relief. With unemployment at a 40-year high and the economy still in recession, many businessmen said they had feared an even sharper electoral swing that would have put the President and Congress at loggerheads, resulting in legislative paralysis. ''If the President had lost 40 to 50 seats in the House, that would have been a clear message,'' said James H. Evans, chairman of the Union Pacific Corporation. ''That didn't happen.'' Others said Tuesday's outcome represented an appeal from voters to shift away from ideology and toward pragmatism. ''This was not a vote against Reagan as a person or what he wants accomplished,'' said John Winthrop Wright, president of Wright Investor Services, a Connecticut investment company. ''But it was a vote against the kind of advice he was receiving. This marks an end to monetarism as a religion.'' But other executives read the returns much differently. 'Put the Country Back to Work' ''The vote was a clear indication that the populace wants to put the country back to work,'' said Eli Broad, chairman of Kaufman & Broad Inc., one of the nation's leading housing companies. ''Inflation is yesterday's issue. I think the housing industry will be able to get more favorable legislation than it would have before the election.'' Labor leaders were similarly upbeat, contending that even if changes in Mr. Reagan's economic program did not materialize, the conservative momentum born in the 1980 Presidential election had been checked. ''The Democrats picked up enough seats to effectively break the ideological hold Reagan held on many issues,'' said Donald Stillman, a spokesman for the United Automobile Workers union. Leo Lynch, international vice president of human affairs for the United Steel Workers of America, predicted that Congress would ''eventually rebuke the Reagan program.'' ''From this election, we're going to get more Congressmen who are sensitive to the needs of the unemployed,'' he said. Some businessmen think the next Congress will be more inclined toward fiscal stimulus. But the results, they say, would not necessarily be positive. The election outcome ''could mean a reduced effort to fight inflation, less concern about the Federal budget deficit and more of an effort to prime the pump to create jobs,'' said Charles F. Baird, chairman of Inco Ltd., the big nickel producer. ''In the short term, this would be good for business.'' Alan C. Lerner, senior vice president and economist of the Bankers Trust Company, noted, ''These results seem to indicate that the public favors greater Government spending, and that could lead to bigger budget deficits.'' The promising interest rate outlook could well turn sour next year, Mr. Jasinowski said, particularly if compromise on the 1984 budget is not forthcoming. ''People are willing to give the Administration more time, but the window of opportunity is only about six months,'' he said. ''If progress on the deficit is made in that period, then we will be insured of a healthy economy in 1984. But if that doesn't happen, there will be a lot of agitation in financial markets.''

1019-> CRAFTS; A GUIDE TO ITEMS FOR THE HOLIDAYS
THIS year, at holiday shows in craft galleries and shops around the state, strains of lighthearted humor - like a porcelain hippopotamus sunbathing with a pina colada - frequently blend with sophisticated collectibles and innovative useful objects. A wide assortment is available, at prices ranging from $2 for a handmade yo-yo to $10,000 for a desk in an exotic wood. Many shops have extended their hours for the season. However, shoppers are advised to check with each establishment beforehand. A sampling of holiday offerings around the state follows. BERGEN COUNTY At America House Gallery, 24 Washington Avenue, Tenafly, the focus is on diversity and excellence. A wide selection of porcelain includes Jan Eckhardt Butler's naively whimsical animals, Joyce Porcelli's lively and colorful vessels and Elaine Bolz's tea set with a chicken-shaped teapot. Other ceramics include Yoshiro Ikeda's abstract forms with textured matte surfaces. Two approaches to sculptural basketry are shown in Jane Sauer's intimately scaled linen forms and Sheila Benedis's works in natural willow. There also are block puzzles for adults, a generous selection of glass, Michael Elkins's nested burl boxes and jewelry at various prices, such as Vita Jaspan's silver pendant with a detachable bead necklace, at $325, and Robert Davis's silver and onyx tiepin, at $56. Craftworks, 12 North Van Brunt Street, Englewood, offers functional ceramics that include an assortment of Barbara Schaff's elegantly proportioned items. These start at $15 for a butter melter. Also of interest are Imelda Pesch's Donegal knit sweaters, Lynn Turner's pastel porcelain perfume bottles cast from vegetable forms, canvas carpets painted to order, potpourri containers in beveled glass and clay and handcrafted brooms. The Kornbluth Gallery, 7-21 Fair Lawn Avenue, Fair Lawn, has built its annual ''Craft Experience'' around wood furniture, including an S-shaped desk and seat by Michael Coffey, a glass-topped dining table by Howard Werner and a coffee table with a slit by Benjamin Mack. Textiles include stitched and appliqued landscapes by Madge Huntington, quilts by Joy Saville and Elizabeth Gurrier and tapestries by Mary Lynn O'Shea. Outstanding among the ceramics are Chris Richard's tall, rounded vessels and smaller forms with exuberant handles, starting at $100. Besides decanters, paperweights, goblets and perfume bottles by glass blowers, there are Peter Temple's prismatic sculptures. Among the unusual items and jewelry are Carrie Adell's cast-silver thimbles - a special hollow accommodates long fingernails - for $40. ESSEX COUNTY Dexterity, 26 Church Street, Montclair, provides an imaginative array of dolls and wooden toys, including three different kinds of trains with circus cars. This shop houses a mix of American crafts - jewelry, glass, leather and woven shawls - and ''country'' items. Limited-edition dolls, all with sensitive features, include little girls with long hair and oldfashioned clothes, soft, life-sized infants dressed in antique christening clothes (these are $200) and old men and children with faces of steamed felt. For collectors of miniatures there are Gail Ann Wilson's trio of bears -none more than two inches tall - on a bench. Among a wide assortment of wheeled toys that can be ridden, pulled or pushed are, for $40, a famous whirligig designed for the Albright-Knox Gallery in Buffalo. Doubletree, 76 Church Street, Montclair, is a cooperative gallery showing the works of six guest craftsmen in addition to those by members. The most predominant piece is Andrew Willner's oak coffee table topped with a volcano. There also are moderately priced ceramics, blown-glass objects, enamel wares and silver jewelry. A good-looking square casserole by Carole Wong Chesek is $48. Opening today at the new Sheila Nussbaum Gallery, 358 Millburn Avenue, Millburn, is a ''Premier Showcase'' featuring Sally Bowen Prange's porcelain ''edgescape'' vessels with both translucent and ''volcanic'' surfaces, jewelry by Marsha Zion, an award-winning goldsmith, and acrylic ''mapstracts'' by Bruce Rigby. Also new in the gallery are faceted ceramic containers with patterned surfaces by David Nelson (his smallest piece is $40), handpainted silk panels by Karen Moss and Robert Dame's glass forms with ''latticino'' bands. Jewelry includes rings and pendants by C. James Meyers, whose geometric designs are in different tones of gold. The Towne Gallery, 625 Eagle Rock Avenue, West Orange, is small but well-stocked with collectibles. Artists spotlighted include Earl Pardon, whose skills in fabrication, cloissone and inlay are represented, sometimes all in a single piece. For example, a silver ring with a band of ebony, ivory and jade is $150; prices go up from there. Other jewelry includes champleve enamel pendants with figurative imagery by Walter Belizario and hand-blown glass bead necklaces by Dudley and Betsy Giberson. Among the many glass objects are Ron Corrie's opaque vessels and Bill Slade's abstract forms with web-like interiors. Featured in ceramics are Christine Zimmerman's earthenware plaques. Practical items include a brass wire ''bun cap'' (for hair) for $36 and, for $24, a hexagonal pan indicating where to cut a pie. UNION COUNTY The Beautiful Things Factory, 183 East Second Street, Scotch Plains, has an assortment of functional ceramics, including wares by Tom Reece, Rinny Staber's witty adaptations of early American crockery - a cannister with a spoon is $24 - and bowls by Barbara Tiso for around $50. Paula and Henri Leighton, the proprietors, who sell their silver jewelry here, challenge refined sensibilities with the chaotic coexistence of such things as fire-breathing plastic monsters and objects finely blown in glass, and by hanging shawls by prominent craftsmen on a rack with inexpensive imports. However, for those who can leave their scruples at the door, there are some good things to be discovered. This, by the way, is the only shop where Josh Simpson's hand-blown goblets can be bought at discount. MONMOUTH COUNTY Contrasts, 49 Broad Street, Red Bank, has a wide assortment of items under $500, with most under $100. In clay, there are decorative vessels by Nancee Meeker and Nina Gelardi, as well as casseroles, steamers, teapots and bird houses by other artists. Mugs begin at $5; one, in porcelain by Sally Silberberg, is $14. There are ceramic menorahs, a cribbage board in laminated wood of different colors, hand-blown glass piggy banks and a selection of woven wearables and pillows. A carefully selected group of inexpensive items is designed to encourage children to patronize this shop. OCEAN COUNTY Limited Editions, which has moved from Harvey Cedars to 2312 Long Beach Boulevard, Surf City, is open Thursdays through Sundays in December. Specializing in functional ceramics, it carries many innovative items, such as storage sets for onions and garlic that abolish odors and inhibit sprouting. There also are casseroles, honey pots and berry bowls by Lorraine Cilluffo, the owner. Inexpensive wood tools include ''spurtles,'' which stir batter, prop up windows or crack lobster claws. Carved shore birds include stylized contemporary designs, as well as more-traditional varieties. Handmade ornaments include, for $15, gold-plated twisting ones by Barbara Stanger. CAMDEN COUNTY At By Hand, 142 Kings Highway, Haddonfield, ''scarves are big,'' with a large selection of sizes in hand-painted silk. Other wearables include shawls, capes, wrapped skirts and leather belts. Among the functional pottery items are ''chip and dip'' sets and casseroles - these can go into microwave ovens - as well as shaving mugs and weed pots (with weeds). A leather elephant pillow is designed for people of all ages. There also are life-size ceramic cats dressed as cowboys. Jewelry includes ear cuffs and belt buckles, as well as earrings, pins and pendants. There are ocarinas and finger pianos, hand-blown paperweights and other glass objects. HUNTERDON COUNTY The Hunterdon Art Center, Center Street, Clinton, is featuring, in addition to its shop that sells ceramics, glass, wood and textiles throughout the year, a gallery show of ''toys for big and little people.'' At prices ranging from $10 to $100, there are both one-of-a-kind pieces and limited editions of manufactured and handmade toys. They include ''Amelia Bearhart,'' a teddy bear in an aviator's suit, as well as dolls and Victorian apparel for adults, stuffed cloth dolls for children and soft-sculpture pull toys (for example, a nesting chicken on wheels). There also are handmade yo-yo's, plus autos, trains and puzzles. Purchased items can be taken from the show. SUSSEX COUNTY Holiday items at the Peters Valley Gallery and Store, Layton (near Stokes State Forest) include handmade brass, steel and copper bells in many shapes and sizes priced from $8 to $40. Functional objects include porcelain tea sets and bowls, forged fireplace accessories, cutting boards, trivets, recipe boxes, hand puppets, whistles and kazoos. Jewelry includes, for about $25, earrings of sterling and brass. Among the higher-priced pieces are textiles by Sandra Ward, a silver whisky cup by Robert Davis and Ken Fisher's walnut and cherry wine cabinet. This shop is open daily until Christmas. The annual Holiday Craft Market sponsored by the State Council on the Arts will be held Thursday and Friday afternoons (noon to 5 P.M.) at the Masonic Temple, South Willow Street, Trenton. The show was professionally juried under the auspices of the council. Approximately 40 New Jersey artists will be represented by functional and decorative works in clay, handmade dolls, ceramic tiles, woven and sewn wearables, objects in stained and hand-blown glass. jewelry and wood furniture, including a portable rocker for the beach. Events Calendar Tomorrow through Dec. 22 -''Crafts - Emerging Artists,'' at the Robeson Center Gallery, Rutgers University, 350 High Street, Newark. Works by 10 award-winning young artists. Hours: Monday through Friday, 11:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. Opening reception and presentation of awards: Tomorrow, 5 to 7 P.M.

1020-> L.I. Schoolgirl Wins Title
Chris Curtin of Bellmore, L.I., and Eric Reynolds of Somis, Calif., were winners today in the Kinney national cross-country championships for high school students. Miss Curtin, a 16-year-old junior at Mepham High, was timed in 16 minutes 58.6 seconds over a flat, grass-and-dirt 5,000-meter course. She won the girls' race by 15 yards from Michelle Rowen, a senior at Washington Township in Turnersville, N.J., who ran 17:02.3. The third-place finisher was Cory Schubert, northern California's champion from San Jose. This was the third year that Miss Curtin had qualified for the national event. But she had to withdraw twice because of illness or injury. ''I felt strong until the last 100 yards,'' she said. ''I really didn't feel as bad as some people said I looked.'' The weather was extremely humid. In the boys' race, Reynolds made a decisive move just before the two-mile mark. The senior from Camarillo High, who was third last year, won by more than 100 yards in 14:35.7. Second was Mike Connelly of Green Lane, Pa., in 14:49.5.

1021-> FAMILY TRIPS
To the Editor: When I read William Geist's article, I thought I would pick up some helpful tips on traveling with children. Instead, I was assaulted with the most sickening attitude toward children I ever encountered. am the mother of three children, ages 5 months to 3 1/2 years, so I am well aware of the inconvenience of travel. It didn't take me long to learn that I had to readjust my vacation style to fit the needs of everyone, including the children, who are not second-class citizens in our home, as they seem to be in the Geist home. Mr. Geist has a legitimate complaint against the inns that treated him and his family so shabbily. However, he should have directed his anger and frustration at the inn's proprietors, not at his children. As for the punishment of parenthood, Mr. Geist deserves all he gets. CLAIRE MARIE MCMANUS Maplewood, N.J.

1022-> RUBIK'S CUBE: A CRAZE ENDS
It was just two years ago that Rubik's Cube, the maddening, Mondrian-colored brainchild of a Hungarian architecture teacher, hit the American market in force. By last June, the Ideal Toy Company had sold 30 million cubes worldwide for $5 to $10 each; imitators had unleashed millions more under names like Magic Puzzler and Le Cube. By any name, one thing was certain: The Cube had become a national obsession. But the craze has died. Street corner merchants hawk ''E.T.'' paraphernalia now, and electronic video games have taken over toy store shelves. Even Rubik's most enthusiastic proponents admit the cube has become passe. ''It's obvious that the cube volume itself is not what it was last year,'' said Stewart Sims, senior vice president of merchandising for Ideal, now part of CBS Inc.'s Gabriel Industries division. ''The cube is still selling, but it was a phenomenon last year.'' Three Billion Combinations The phenomenon of old is a puzzle devised in 1974 by Erno Rubik for a class he taught at the Budapest Academy of Applied Arts. Originally designed to illustrate algebraic group theory, its commercial appeal apparently was an afterthought. Twenty-six brightly colored cubes rotate on axes of the larger structure, composing, if and when arranged correctly, a cube with each face a different solid color. By one calculation, there are more than three billion possible combinations. Ideal won't release sales figures for Rubik, but the trend clearly is downward. At New York's F.A.O. Schwarz, Rubik Cube sales peaked late last winter, according to a senior buyer, Ian McDermott. ''We haven't bought any since the beginning of the year, in the belief that it wouldn't prove a continuing best seller,'' Mr. McDermott said. ''It hasn't. In fact, it's somewhat of a liability.'' At the Toys 'R' Us chain, the cube has been equally lackluster. ''It's an O.K. item - not as hot as last year,'' said Charles Lazarus, the company's chairman. ''It's like the rest of the business. One year it's Rubik's Cube and Pac-Man, the next it's Smurf and video. It's a fashion business, no doubt about it.'' Indeed, almost everyone, Ideal included, attributes the cube's decline to the vagaries of the toy-buying public. Stores say that electronic video games and spin-offs from arcade games are the hottest items now, with dolls and other merchandise derived from the movie ''E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial'' a close second. Rubik and his many offspring puzzles - among them Rubik's Race and Rubik's Revenge - have lost the public's interest. ''It was a fad,'' said James Nourse. ''If it hadn't been for the fad, you might just have read about it in a paper occasionally and that would be it, but this really caught.'' Mr. Nourse ought to know. His book, ''The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube,'' has sold more than seven million copies at $1.95 each for Bantam Books, its publisher. Mr. Nourse, a research associate in the Stanford University chemistry department, went on to write ''The Simple Solution to Cubic Puzzles,'' which Bantam says has sold about a million copies. Interest Is 'Almost Zero' For Mr. Nourse, the books brought unexpected royalties and attention. ''But all the television and news publicity ended in January,'' he said. ''Now, the interest as evidenced by the number of calls I've got is almost zero.'' ''The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube'' was the best-selling title ''by far'' of 1981 and one of the biggest ever for Bantam, according to Stuart Applebaum, vice president and director of publicity. Now the hottest books espouse weight loss, he said. The cube books ''still get a few thousand copies selling per month nationally,'' he added. ''But the great boom is over.'' Does life go on for a has-been fad? Most industry analysts think so. Like Monopoly and the Frisbee, they say, Rubik's Cube will likely become an industry standard, bringing steady if unspectacular sales for years. ''It's simple, its usable, and there will always be many youngsters who haven't seen it yet,'' said Douglas Thomson, president of the Toy Wholesalers of America, a New York-based trade group. ''It's like dominoes - they go on forever, but you don't see F.A.O. Schwarz selling them.'' Ideal is equally optimistic. ''It's like many toys that will peak in a year or two and then settle down to a staple item - it's not uncommon in the toy business,'' said Alfred Nordstrom, vice president and assistant to the president of Gabriel Industries. ''We'll probably never get back to the levels of 1981.'' In the meantime, Ideal will introduce a new line of Rubik strategy puzzles and games next year. Mr. Rubik himself is back at the drawing board, although still on sabbatical from his old job at the Budapest Academy to promote his creation, according to Ideal. (His after-tax income from cube royalties reportedly exceeds $30,000 a month.) Ideal may have much to gain if the new Rubic products catch on. The cube accounted for about 25 percent of the company's sales in 1981, which rose to $216.8 million, from $141.4 million the year before; in the two years that Ideal sold Rubik before its acquisition by CBS last April, the price of its stock tripled.

1023-> THE WORLD A Little Less Western Disarray After Shultz Tour
All in all, it was not a bad two-week's work. Some rough spots in the United States's relations with its Western European allies seemed smoother after Secretary of State George P. Shultz returned home yesterday from a visit to seven European capitals. In London, his last stop, Mr. Shultz emphasized allied agreement on ''realistic'' ways of dealing with the new Soviet leadership. To the Europeans, Mr. Shultz's conciliatory manner brought relief from the tension that Washington's pressure tactics had created before he came on the scene in July. Paris and Madrid were among the most difficult stops. In the French capital, where his visit last week was preceded by the usual prickly statements stressing France's independence, an agreement to study ways of coordinating allied trade policy toward the Soviet Union was reached. This did not commit either side to very much but it was an improvement on the irritation created by Washington's sanctions against French and other foreign affiliates of American companies helping Moscow build a pipeline for the export of natural gas to Western Europe. One study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will concern alternate energy sources for Europe, the United States and Japan that would lessen the need for Soviet gas. Foreign Minister Claude Cheysson nodded as ''my friend George'' read off a six-point agreement but a French spokesman later warned that France would not accept some new policy group that might limit its freedom of action. Mr. Shultz said he had assured the French that the United States did not favor such a course either. In Madrid, where a new Socialist Government is less than enthusiastic about membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - or at least its integration in the military command - Mr. Shultz tried hard to be a model guest. Avoiding the appearance of arm twisting, he said he had come as ''a friend'' and was rewarded by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez with assurances that Spain would remain ''a loyal ally.'' The agreement on American base rights in Spain, renewed only last summer, may still need more discussion although Mr. Shultz expressed confidence that the Spanish Parliament would ratify it in the end.

1029-> Mailbox; Society's Right
To the Sports Editor: Stanley Cohen asks: ''Who has the right to tell a man that he must surrender his trade?'' When his trade allows him to beat another man to death, the answer is simple: A society with a conscience - and the backing of law - has the duty and the right to give a human being the same protection afforded chickens. Mr. Cohen's plea for the livelihood of the boxer shades the reality that while the few collect million-dollar paychecks, the majority sacrifice their brains and bodies for paltry sums that are long gone if, and when, the next one arrives.

1030-> DINING OUT; CONTINENTAL FARE, WITH CHANGES
WHEN Frederick's first opened in Melville a little over three years ago, it offered Continental food that was often better than average and served in a comfortable, attractive, contemporary setting. While success may not have spoiled Frederick's, it does not seem to have improved it, either. The capacity of the place looks about double now, with tables crammed close to one another in the main dining room as well as the bar area. And when they are filled, which is frequently the case, the noise level in both rooms detracts from the pleasure of dining. The main dining room is also dimly lighted so that the combined effect of noise, crowding and darkness make it resemble a supper club with the show about to begin, rather than a serious restaurant. Only upstairs, where another small dining area has been opened, is there more light and serenity. The menu is still Continental and the preparations run the gamut from astonishingly fine to disappointing, with most of the dishes falling somewhere in between these extremes. But given the change of setting, Frederick's now receives a less enthusiastic recommendation than before. A list of blackboard specials is almost equal in length to the limited printed menu. In addition to considerately providing the price of each dish and avoiding the need for memorizing the captain's recitation, the blackboard offers what proved to be the more commendable choices. The mussels in curry sauce, for example, were outstanding, with clean, fresh mussels steamed and served in a smooth golden broth unmistakably but judiciously seasoned with curry. The fillet of smoked trout was moist and rich and served with a mild apple-onionhorseradish cream sauce. A dark, ruddy-colored lobster bisque was quite flavorful. Only the baked clams, consisting of littleneck shells filled with a pasty mixture studded with tough bits of clam, were a disappointment from the blackboard list. The regular menu features sweetbreads in mustard crumbs, an unusual appetizer that might please people who do not like sweetbreads. The sweetbreads were sliced thin and fried in a tangy mustard-seasoned breading, a treatment that succeeded in masking both the characteristically delicate flavor and texture of the sweetbreads. Still, the dish was appealing. The onion soup and the snails in a mild garlic butter were both decent. An appetizer of pasta is invariably fettuccine Alfredo, overcooked and submerged in cream sauce. Caesar salad is well seasoned but could have used less dressing. The house salad is fairly banal. The restaurant still offers a dish of raw vegetables with dip to nibble before the food is served. A thick portion of fresh salmon, broiled to a turn and served with an excellent bearnaise sauce, a special one evening, was a highlight. Sauteed chicken in a pale Champagne sauce, while visually somewhat drab-looking, was quite delectable. A more complicated affair called veal tessino consisting of veal scaloppine with bacon, tomato and Fontina cheese was another of the satisfying daily specials. On the other hand, the rack of lamb for one arrived overcooked, only to be replaced in about five minutes by another serving that was properly cooked but bore a fairly strong musty flavor that is not typical of young lamb. Filet mignon with bearnaise sauce was surprisingly sinewy. A suggestion of Parmesan flavor could be detected in the breading on the veal and lemon Parmesan, but it needed more lemon and a grinding of pepper. Duck with peaches and chestnuts turned out to be decent duck with a canned peach topped with chestnut puree on the plate. An orange sauce that belonged on an English muffin was fortunately served on the side. Calves' liver with apples, onions and bacon, ordered medium rare, was thoroughly satisfactory. Desserts include a chocolate mousse cake in which thin layers of cake tasted dry and burned. Decent caramel custard, cheesecake and chocolate mousse were better choices. The raspberry cloud combined excessively sweet raspberry mousse and sherbet. The wine list is quite limited, with a choice of whites including a fine Pouilly Fume for $15.50, far superior to the reds. Only the Joseph Drouhin Beaujolais-Villages 1981 for $12 offered satisfying sipping in a moderately priced red wine. The Robert Mondavi cabernet sauvignon 1979 for $18.50 is well made, fairly big and still somewhat tannic. Given an opportunity to air in the glass, it is enjoyable. A three-course dinner with wine is likely to average $30 a person, including tax and tip. *Frederick's 1117 Walt Whitman Road, Melville. 673-8550.

1031-> LAUTENBERG, IN COLORADO, IS SWORN IN AS A SENATOR
Frank R. Lautenberg was sworn in as a United States Senator from New Jersey this afternoon in the living room of his vacation home here. Surrounded by his wife, Lois, and three of his four children, Mr. Lautenberg stood before a stone fireplace and took the oath of office administered by Judge Zita L. Weinsheink of Federal District Court in Denver. Also present were Senator John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, Senator Rudy Boschwitz, Republican of Minnesota, who appeared in a stovepipe hat, and about 30 other guests. After the brief ceremony a small, informal reception was held in the apartment in a building nestled at the base of the surrounding mountains. Mr. Lautenberg, a 58-year-old millionaire business executive, defeated Representative Millicent Fenwick, a Republican, in the Nov. 2 election in his first race for elective office. Interim Senator Resigns His swearing-in followed the resignation today of Senator Nicholas F. Brady, a Republican who was appointed by Governor Kean in April to fill the unexpired term of Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr. Mr. Williams resigned earlier this year as the Senate was preparing to vote on whether to expel him for his role in Abscam. Mr. Brady had said that he would resign upon the election of his successor, but stayed on past the election so he could represent New Jersey during the recently ended session of Congress, according to a spokesman for Governor Kean. Mr. Lautenberg was formally appointed Senator today by Governor Kean. ''Actually the oath is a formality by virtue of the designation of the Governor,'' said the new Senator, who took the oath wearing a blue-gray suit and a blue club tie. ''I am fully and completely a United States Senator today.'' In explaining why he chose to be sworn in here, Mr. Lautenberg said that he was on a planned vacation in Colorado when Senator Brady resigned, and that it was the first vacation he had taken since the campaign ended. He added that he hoped the people of New Jersey would not be displeased with his decision. 'A Needed Break' ''I hope that they will understand that after so much hard work and arduous days of constant labor and no weekends, this is a needed break,'' he said as he returned from a day of skiing. ''I wish that it had been in New Jersey, but the time off was necessary.'' His swearing-in will permit Mr. Lautenberg to complete the remaining days of his predecessor's term. But he will not gain any advantage over other freshman senators in committee assignments because the assignments already have been determined. Mr. Lautenberg will be sworn in again when the 98th Congress convenes next Monday. By choosing to be sworn in before the start of the new Congress, however, Mr. Lautenberg said that he will be able to acquire some of the remaining budget of Senator Brady's office. Mr. Lautenberg is a founder and the former chairman of Automatic Data Processing Corporation, one of the largest computer service companies in the country, with 15,000 employees. He said that his resignation as chairman became effective today. ''There's an emotional thing about being Senator,'' said Mr. Lautenberg. Then, gesturing towards the snow-covered slopes dotted with skiers, he added, ''They don't know I'm a senator, but I know and my family knows.''

1032-> THE POET WHO FOUND HER OWN WAY
ZAMI: A NEW SPELLING OF MY NAME By Audre Lorde. 256 pp. Watertown, Mass.: Persephone Press. Paper. $7.95. CHOSEN POEMS OLD AND NEW By Audre Lorde. 115 pp. New York: W. W. Norton & Co. Cloth, $12.95. Paper. $5.95. CARRIACOU is an actual West Indian island as well as the isle of Audre Lorde's imagination; Zami is ''a Carriacou name for women who work together as friends and lovers.'' And while the publisher's claim that in ''Zami'' Miss Lorde ''creates a new form, biomythography, combining elements of history, biography and myth,'' is a bit pretentious, the book is, actually, an excellent and evocative autobio-graphy. Indeed, among the elements that make the book so good are its personal honesty and lack of pretentiousness, characteristics that shine through the writing, bespeaking the evolution of a strong and remarkable character. The reader quickly grows to love the sturdy little black girl - daughter of parents immigrated to New York from Grenada before she was born - who is tongue-tied, unable to see without her glasses; who forces herself to stay awake half an hour after her parentally-imposed bedtime in order to listen to the stories nightly serialized by her two older sisters; who, in her loneliness, dreams of having a ''little female person'' all her own; yet who yearns for the magical moments of privacy disallowed by a stern mother who, considering solitude a social perversion, insists that Audre's bedroom door remain open except when she is studying, constantly studying. With her, we experience the pain of her gradual recognition of racism (something from which her powerful mother seeks for years to protect her); the suicide of a teen-age best friend for whom she has been able to do nothing. With her, we leave the rigid confines of home - a Washington Heights apartment - at 17 to become marginally self-supporting; to endure (at times) hunger, an abortion and Christmas alone. We share her growing awareness of her attraction toward her own sex; her first affairs with women; a longed-for trip alone to Mexico at 19-feeling-like-35, on one of those journeys that serve as routes for psychic discovery; and life as a ''gay-girl'' in the Greenwich Village of the 50's. We live with her through her first primary love relationship and its excruciating conclusion; and, finally, an affair with a black Southern woman - Afrekete - whose sensuality and independence equal her own; it is a relationship that becomes metaphor for her conciliation with her own reality, and with the world. Throughout, her experiences are painted with exquisite imagery. Indeed, her West Indian heritage shows through most clearly in her use of word pictures that are sensual, steamy, at times near-tropical, evoking the colors, smells - repeatedly, the smells - shapes, textures that are her life. Her attention to detail is exacting whether she's describing a supper of hot tamales and cold milk in Mexico City or an evening of bar-hopping in the West Village of two decades ago. Her use of language is often imaginative but uncontrived, as in her description of her first lover, Ginger, as having ''high putchy cheeks'' or her reference, in one of the many meals deliciously detailed in the book, to ''chopped onions quailed in margarine.'' Yet Miss Lorde is at her best when her images become - as they often do - metaphors for states of being: A torn stocking caught in the wind on the side of a tenement building becomes symbol of her terror when, as a small child, she hangs by one hand from the window of her apartment, only to be saved by her mother's timely return home. Or the day she has begun her first menstrual period: Left alone by her usually ever-present mother in the kitchen, she crushes with mortar and pestle the garlic, onions and celery leaves that will season the meat for dinner; as she pounds - and pounds and pounds - she becomes carried away, the scents from the ground herbs mixing with her own. And her membership at Hunter High School in what she calls The Branded, The Lunatic Fringe, is really her wider membership in that part of the population made up of artists, blacks, women and homosexuals. Despite her obvious poet's ease with symbol, metaphor, image, her references to herself as poet - a vocation held since childhood -are unemphatic: ''... sometimes there was food cooked, sometimes there was not. Sometimes there was a poem, and sometimes there was not. And always, on weekends, there were the bars,'' she writes, describing life with her lover Muriel. And while her downplaying of her commitment to poetry may be partly an attempt to avoid widening the distance between the reader and herself, there is the sense, in ''Chosen Poems'' as in ''Zami,'' of a writer who has other, more pressing concerns - such as cooking a meal, making a living, or simply living out the life style that for many homosexuals is an avocation in itself. It is as though the life on the streets was so rich that it left little time for meticulous literary stitching up in some West Village or Staten Island tower (Miss Lorde now lives, according to the cover of ''Chosen Poems,'' on Staten Island, teaches at Hunter College in New York City); she is distant from Sylvia Plath or Anne Sexton who, out of isolation, even alienation, made language scream; or Cynthia McDonald and Marilyn Hacker, with their intricate linguistic embroideries. This imperative immediacy sometimes gives Miss Lorde's poems an undeveloped, abstract air, leaving one wishing for the exacting detail of her prose, the evocation of the undeniable, concrete world made fully tangible in ''Zami.'' At the same time, Miss Lorde's poems are refreshingly removed from the pale frozen works of many poets, who appear immobilized by the image of themselves as poet. Instead, she is a poet of her time, her place, her people, and unlike poets whose works fall apart when fused by conviction, she is at her best in her most political pieces: I inherited Jackson, Mississip- pi. For my majority it gave me Emmett Till his 15 years puffed out like bruises on plump boy-cheeks his only Mississippi summer whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie as a white girl passed him in the street and he was baptized my son for- ever in the midnight waters of the Pearl. So she writes in ''Afterimages,'' a poem in which her empathy extends finally even to the white woman who has caused Emmett Till's terrible death. In the more recent poems in this volume, which draws from works written over 30 years, she employs increasing imagistic skills; yet even some of the earlier poems - such as ''Martha,'' a long piece about a woman hospitalized and fighting for her life -are strong enough to give a reader the kind of gut-level jolt Emily Dickinson deemed the most reliable judgment of a poem. To read both these volumes is to feel, at least for a few hours, that one has lived, not merely intellectualized, Audre Lorde's life. Throughout each, one is aware of the author's growth toward an unusual autonomy. For readers who begin with ''Zami,'' ''Chosen Poems'' will serve as recognizable markers for that journey and since the autobiography concludes in 1960, an extension into present-tense awareness. Her works will be important to those truly interested in growing up sensitive, intelligent and aware in the second half of the twentieth century in America.

1033-> FOREIGN AFFAIRS; A Police Mentality
The French Communist Party has launched a remarkable campaign that would simply be ludicrous if it didn't seem so revealing about the new Soviet leadership. With a major broadside against state-owned radio and TV for what it called ''hateful habits threatening freedom and peace,'' the party has called on ''all Frenchmen and Frenchwomen to demand freedom of information.'' Translated from the Communese, this is a demand to shut off certain damaging reports about the Soviet Union and the K.G.B., and to oblige presentation of Moscow's version of events. It is so unprecedented, and the timing is so politically disadvantageous for the French Communists, that it must be concluded they are acting on the explicit request of the Kremlin. And that indicates that the new Soviet leader, Yuri Andropov, has been sharply stung by reports about ''the Bulgarian connection'' in the attempted assassination of the Pope and the drug traffic in Italy. To buttress the point, the Soviet Ambassador, Stepan Chervonenko, sent a letter to all the French news media insisting on ''fair'' treatment of his country and accusing them of swallowing ''disinformation spread by the immoral action of intelligence services.'' Mr. Chervonenko, about to leave after nearly a decade in Paris, headed an embassy before - in Prague during and after the l968 Soviet invasion, which was ostensibly in response to a ''request for fraternal help'' from Czech officials no one ever identified. What if an American ambassador dared to insult French journalists with a round-robin like his? asked the conservative Le Quotidien de Paris. There would, of course, be an explosion of outrage, which hasn't happened in Mr. Chervonenko's case because that might be denounced as another example of anti-Sovietism, the paper said. The French Communist Party is junior coalition partner in President Francois Mitterrand's Government and, until now, has been careful to avoid attacks that might put its share of power in question. Nationwide municipal elections are set in March. While they won't affect the Government directly, they are considered a crucial test of its popularity. The pro-Soviet, anti-media campaign definitely won't help win votes. Clearly, Mr. Andropov's sensitivity to the Western press just when he's broaching his new disarmament proposals has overridden such local considerations for the French Communists. He already offended the rest of the French by ostentatiously giving a private reception to the French Communist leader, Georges Marchais, and ignoring Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, the official French representative at the funeral of Leonid Brezhnev. In its latest statement, the French party's paper, L'Humanite, pompously disclaimed any desire ''to touch the freedom'' of print journalism or private radio. But it said state-owned TV and radio were different. They are ''public services'' with the same kind of obligation as the post office, railways, schools and hospitals to meet public needs. This isn't being done, ''and that's serious, serious for democracy,'' the statement said. ''When you only hear one bell struck, you can't distinguish truth from falsehood. When you're only given one opinion, always the same, it's your independence of mind, your chance to judge for yourself that's threatened.'' Those words, from one of the few Western Communist parties that supports the military regime in Poland, were not offered as parody, hard as that is to believe - nor, of course, as advice to Pravda. They were offered as arguments against further reports in France about the K.G.B. and the Pope, about the possible use of slave labor on the Soviet gas pipeline, and in favor of praise for Mr. Andropov's missile proposal, which the French Government has rejected. All this goes so far, even for the cynical French, that it offers some insights into the new Kremlin approach. It parallels Mr. Andropov's public rebuke to Tass for not putting enough vigor into Soviet propaganda. The former K.G.B. boss obviously puts a high value on discipline and closing Communist ranks. Moscow's overtures to China and the flicker of a gesture toward Albania should be seen in this light, not so much a readiness for concessions but a tough new search for order among Communists even as the Kremlin probes for ways to hone arguments between the U.S. and its allies. The flurry of speculation about his ''liberalizing tendencies,'' supposedly based on his indulgence for Hungary's reform experiments, is contradicted by this ham-handed campaign in France. And even Hungary has had to tighten reins. It is significant that Lazlo Rajk's Tuesday night bookstore in Budapest has been broken up. Mr. Rajk is the son of the Hungarian Communist leader killed after a Stalinist show trial. For two years he has opened his apartment every Tuesday night to visitors who came to buy typed copies of literature censored for official publication. It was widely known and tolerated, one of those Budapest quirks. Now the police have raided the place on two successive Tuesdays along with other homes, confiscated material and detained Mr. Rajk and others. This is regression for Hungary, which had both less dissidence and less harassment than other Communist capitals. Maybe there is more than one facet to Mr. Andropov's character. But these clues show that he didn't leave a police mentality behind when he moved from the K.G.B. to the Kremlin.

1034-> News Summary; SUNDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1982
International Arab recognition of Israel will come only after Israel removes its forces from the territory it has occupied since the 1967 war, King Hassan II of Morocco said at a news conference in Washington. A day after he and a six-nation Arab League delegation discussed differing Arab and American peace plans with President Reagan, the King said the Middle East dispute had entered ''a new phase, not the conflict of war but of law and of rights.'' (Page 1, Column 6.) A British spy for Moscow was responsible for one of the longest and potentially most damaging Soviet penetrations of Western intelligence since World War II, British intelligence officials have told American officials. American intelligence officials say that the accused man, Geoffrey Arthur Prime, supplied Moscow with a stream of highly sensitive information about American and British interception of Soviet communications while he was employed as a Russian translator at Britain's main electronic intelligence center at Cheltenham from 1968 to 1977. (1:1.) A general strike in Poland next spring is the aim of leaders of the now-outlawed Solidarity union. (1:5.) National In radio talks on the economy President Reagan and the Speaker of the House, Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., exchanged accusations as the fall campaign viewed by both sides as leading to a referendum on the Reagan economic policies was entering its final week. (1:2.) Law-enforcement officers blockaded a small Arizona town yesterday in a confrontation with what they described as about 100 members of a faith-healing group who where armed with lead pipes, clubs, tire irons and guns. Two members of the group were killed, and as many as nine other persons, including seven deputy sheriffs, were wounded in a fight and gun battle in Miracle Valley, a town 60 miles southeast of Tucson, the authorities said. (1:5-6.) Military spending has increased while the numbers of planes, ships, tanks guns and most nonnuclear weapons in the nation's arsenal have declined. In the last 30 years the United States has spent $2,300 billion on the military. The Reagan Administration plans to spend $1,500 billion more in the next five years on the Defense Department budget. The plan envisions only relatively modest increases in weapons. Some critics doubt that even those goals will be achieved because weapon costs have historically tended to outpace increases in military spending. (1:3.) Cocaine trafficking is luring more and more middle-class and upperincome Americans, and relatively few of them are being caught, according to law enforcement officials. They say the trade is so lucrative, the chances of being caught are so small and the use of the drug has become so acceptable in some segments of American society that it is increasingly attracting dealers from middle-class professional and business life. (1:4.) One of the world's tallest buildings is planned in Houston. Its sponsors are John T. Cater, chairman of one of Houston's largest bank holding companies, and the Century Development Corporation. They plan an 82-story building that will dominate Houston's skyline and give the city immediate identification. (20:1.) Metropolitan Hunger is growing in New York City, according to voluntary agencies and community groups. They report increases in the number of people who say that they have no money for food. (1:1.) New Yorkers will vote Nov. 2 on a referendum to create a municipal utility that would buy and distribute hydroelectric power to city residents at a slight saving. The utility would offer residents an average saving of $1.65 a month, said Robert M. Herzog, director of the city's Energy Office. (32:5.)

1035-> BOBBIE A. BROMBERG WED TO THOMAS FRANK PEPITONE
Bobbie Ann Bromberg, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Bertram E. Bromberg of Glen Head, L.I., was married yesterday to Thomas Frank Pepitone, son of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas P. Pepitone of Sands Point, L.I. The ceremony was performed at the Interfaith Chapel of C. W. Post College in Greenvale, L.I., where the Rev. Philip Eichner, a Roman Catholic priest, and Cantor Raymond Smolover officiated. The bride, a physical education teacher at the Levittown (L.I.) Memorial High School, was graduated from Friends Academy in Locust Valley, L.I., and Skidmore College. Her father is attending surgeon in charge of plastic surgery at the North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I., who formerly was director of the division of plastic surgery at the Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. The bridegroom, president of Pepitone Industries, a real estate development company in Garden City, L.I., founded and owned by his father, attended the University of Fort Lauderdale in Florida.

1036-> Challenging Condos
In the Hamptons The recent article ''Condos vs. Water'' spoke with accurancy of the ''new militancy'' among an increasing number of property owners in the Hamptons. However, instead of the figure quoted - 700 names of Southampton Town residents on petitions opposing the massive proposed development, Red Creek Ridge, in a pine barrens-watershed area - the number of signatures is actually 4,400. Considering that the entire population of Hampton Bays is only something over 8,000, our achievement borders on the miraculous. It is certainly ample proof that times are changing. The good old days no longer exist -when developers' rights to seek maximum financial gain from their property, regardless of environmental constraints, were considered sacrosanct. These signatures, collected over a six-week period, represent a wide cross section of people throughout the entire community, indicating a growing public awareness of the need to challenge development that threatens the fragile ecological balance of the land. Our coalition, Save Good Ground Water, demonstrates the effectiveness of local action by an energetic grass-roots group combined with cooperation and strong support from regional environmental organizations. We intend to continue our efforts to alert the public to the urgent need for protecting our precious reservoir of ground water. An open-space law, passed unanimously by the Southampton Town Board, and the interim upzoning of pine barrens-watershed areas proposed by our Town Supervisor, Martin Lang, have received the enthusiastic support of our group. We are encouraged and gratified by the positive attitude of our town officials toward these serious environmental concerns. It is not easy to do battle against land developers and their millions. But we are confident that, with perseverance, we can significantly influence the course of events in this community that we hold dear. LYNN BUCK, Co-President Save Good Ground Water, Hampton Bays

1037-> BABIES BORN TO SINGLE WOMEN IN 1980 ESTABLISHED A RECORD
Out-of-wedlock births rose by 11.4 percent in 1980 to a new record, according to the Federal Government, which said the main reason was the ''rise in the rate for unmarried white women.'' Part of the increase was a result of a change in the calculation method. The total number of births rose slightly and the overall fertility rate increased to the highest rate in 17 years, according to the report from the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. The data showed that there were 665,747 births to unmarried women, accounting for 18.4 percent of all 3,612,258 births in 1980. The study found that the rate of childbearing among unmarried women climbed to a high of 29.4 births for each 1,000 unmarried women of childbearing age, which the center gave as 15 to 44 years old. In 1979 the rate was 27.2 for each 1,000. Center Gives the Reasons ''The overall increase in the rate of childbearing among unmarried women was due solely to the substantial rise in the rate for unmarried white women, for whom the rate was 17.6 in 1980,'' the study said. ''This was 18.1 percent higher than the revised 1979 rate of 14.9.'' Out-of-wedlock births for black women declined slightly, from 83 for each 1,000 in 1979 to 82.9 for each 1,000. But the center said caution should be used in interpreting the data, pointing out that it had made a significant change in the way it compiled statistics on births to unmarried women. It attributed nearly one-third of the 11.4 percent increase in births to unmarried women to the change in the methodolgy. Figures for years before 1980, which had been estimated, were revised to reflect the census that year. The center said that the 11.4 percent increase in out-of-wedlock births was about one-third higher than it would have been using methods of noncensus years. The rate of births to unmarried women rose for all age groups under 30 from 1979 to 1980. It was highest for women 20 to 24, at 40.9 births for each 1,000 women of childbearing age, according to the report. The total number of births in 1980 was 3 percent more than for 1979. The birth rate was 15.9 births for 1,000 people, an increase of 2 percent over 1979. And the fertility rate was 68.4 births for each 1,000 women of childbearing age, which was also 2 percent higher than for the previous year. Data on Fertility Rate The fertility rate for white women increased 2.1 percent to 64.7 births for each 1,000 women of childbearing age, the highest rate since 1973. The fertility rate for black women declined by two-tenths of 1 percent to 88.1 for each 1,000 women. The birth rate for women 30 to 34 years old rose 2.7 percent in 1980, more than for any other age group, continuing a pattern set in recent years, the study said. At the same time, the smallest increase in birth rates, less than 1 percent, occurred among girls 15 to 17. The birth rate for teen-agers under 15 declined by 8.3 percent. Tentative data for 1981 show an increase of about 1 percent in the number of births over 1980 and a decline of about 1 percent in the fertility rate.

1039-> SCOUTING; Mets' Strawberry Slugging Away
Darryl Strawberry is doing so well in Venezuela that the Mets may be compelled to put him in right field soon after the start of the 1983 season. Frank Cashen, the club's general manager, would prefer not to promote Strawberry before his time, but he may be too good to resist. In seven games with the La Guiara team, Strawberry has hit four home runs, two of them game-winners. He has batted with the same gusto that made him the most valuable player in the Class AA Texas League this past season. ''The fans here think he is the most exciting player to come along in some time,'' says Pedro Padrone, owner of the La Guiara club. ''They love him.'' The Mets see Strawberry as the heir apparent to Ellis Valentine. The incumbent outfielder is expected to remain a Met only if no other club is willing to give him a three- or four-year contract at a salary surpassing his current $500,000 a year in the free agent draft on Nov. 13. By Cashen's timetable, Strawberry should be ready for 1984, but the departure of Valentine and some additional homer-hitting by the prize prospect in Venezuela could move the clock ahead.

1040-> NEWMAN IS PICKING UP SPEED
Fifteen years ago, Mario Andretti drove a Can Am car with Paul Newman's name emblazoned on its nose. No matter how hard Andretti worked, he could not get the car to go fast. Finally, he stepped out of the car, turned to the car's owner and said, ''I'll paint my name on the car - let Newman drive it.'' Today, Newman will attempt to win his third amateur driving title at the Champion Spark Plug Road Racing Classic in Braselton, Ga. Then next year, Andretti will race at Indy in a car owned by Newman. Newman is a racing veteran now. His interest was fanned when he portrayed a racer in the 1968 movie ''Winning,'' but it was another four years before he started racing off camera. ''I'm a slow starter,'' said Newman, comparing the beginning of his racing activities with the start of his acting career. ''I got a masters degree at Yale, and then I spent several years doing summer stock. I still didn't know what I was doing.'' It was 1972 when Newman found the time to begin racing. He started at the bottom, driving a sedan in Sports Car Club of America regional races, but in 1976 he won his first national amateur championship. The next year he began driving for Bob Sharp, a former racing champion who owns a Datsun dealership near Newman's home in Connecticut. Driving Sharp's Datsun 280ZX, Newman won his second title at the Road Atlanta runoffs in 1979, and the following year the team made several appearances with its Datsun in the International Motor Sports Association's professional Camel series. Desire and Dedication ''He has a burning desire to be the best at everything he does,'' Sharp said of Newman recently. ''He started out with that desire and followed it up with intense study. He's very analytical about his racing, and the same power of concentration that he has developed in his acting career serves him well in racing.'' Tire-testing is an arduous, dangerous and sometimes boring task, but only the best drivers are asked to test tires by Goodyear, the chief producer of racing rubber in this country. In a blind procedure, different sets of tires are shuffled on and off a race car during a test session. After each change the driver is asked to evaluate the tires. Three years ago Newman was invited to a track in Ohio to test Sedan tires, and Reed Kryder, the engineer in charge of the test, came away from the session sharing Sharp's appreciation for Newman's analytical skills. ''Newman was frustrated because he thought he wasn't giving us good enough information,'' Kryder said. For the 1981 season, Sharp's crew built Newman a 900 horsepower racer with a reproduction of a Datsun body for the Camel series. Unfortunately, the car rolled out of the shop overweight, and it was never fully competitive. ''But the year wasn't really so discouraging,'' said Newman. ''For all its unwieldiness, the car was still fun to drive and it was still a learning process for me.'' This year has been more satisfying though. Sharp modified a straight Datsun turbo for the S.C.C.A.'s amateur series, then Newman returned to the winner's circle often enough to qualify for today's championship race. Can Compete With the Best And Newman's performance in his only appearance in the club's professional Trans-Am series erased any doubts that he could compete against the best professional road racers in the country. Unlike LeMans, where Newman once finished second, or other longdistance races, the 100-mile Trans-Am sprint races require raw speed rather than endurance. On a slick, damp track at Brainerd, Minn., Newman drove to an easy victory over a field full of professional racers. Newman is paid by Sharp to drive his Datsun, but he spends that money and more to run his own team, which will campaign an Indy car for Andretti, the former world driving champion. Newman organized the team so that he could stay involved with racing after he retired from driving. But at the age of 57 he still isn't ready to hang up his helmet. ''I always thought that when I had a bad season I would get sick of it and just quit,'' he said. ''But you don't want to go out a loser. And when you're doing well, you sure don't want to stop.''

1043-> DR. CLARK'S SLOW PROGRESS CONTINUES
On the 26th day that an artifical heart kept Dr. Barney B. Clark alive, his doctors reported today that there was continued slow progress toward his recovery. Noting that they believed it would take weeks for Dr. Clark to make further significant improvement, the doctors said they no longer saw the need for daily news conferences. Instead, Dr. Chase N. Peterson, the University of Utah vice president for health sciences, said condition bulletins would be issued. Moreover, members of Dr. Clark's family told hospital administrators that they wished ''to be relieved from media contact'' and to withdraw from the limelight that has accompanied his progress since the artificial heart was implanted Dec. 2. Dr. Peterson characterized Dr. Clark's recovery as ''progressing slowly but satisfactorily'' and added that the doctors did not anticipate that ''matters will change significantly'' on a day-to-day basis. Because Dr. Clark is still confused, the family did not want any interviews or television coverage, Dr. Peterson said. He added that Dr. Clark's family ''knows him to be a man of dignity'' and they said they knew he did not want to be shown in less than the best light. Dr. Clark, a 61-year-old retired dentist, is the first recipient of a permanent artificial heart. Because the case is ''a world event of significant proportions,'' Dr. Peterson said he expected that Dr. Clark would eventually speak about the operation. Asked when that would be, Dr. Peterson replied with another question: ''Would you like your state of health widely distributed before you are fully back to your own self?'' Dr. Peterson said it would be weeks before Dr. Clark could go home but could not give any estimate of the specific date. He will need to regain enough strength to take care of his needs, and he has not yet reached that point. Dr. Clark, who has taken only minimal shuffling steps in the intensive care unit, ''is still a very weak man,'' Dr. Peterson said.

1046-> Role for Ex-Player As a Go-Between
In 1968, when Paul Martha was playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers, National Football League management and players were involved in a serious labor dispute over pension money. ''I have a fear,'' said Martha at the time, ''that someday my boy and I will be watching a pro football game on television, and after the first quarter one of the teams will walk off the field because of a working grievance against management.'' This year, all the teams walked off the field after the second game of the season. Now, eight weeks later, Paul Martha has emerged as the go-between who helped the union and the owners reach an agreement to settle the strike. Martha is a 39-year-old Pittsburgh lawyer. He is vice president and general counsel of the San Francisco 49ers of the N.F.L., the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League and the Pittsburgh Spirit of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He is also vice president of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, where the Penguins and Spirit play. The arena and those teams are owned by Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. and Jr. of Youngstown, Ohio. Gained Garvey's Respect Because Martha is a member of management, he would seem an unlikely prospect to be a key figure in the the pro football negotiations. However, when Ed Garvey started to organize professional soccer players several years ago, several players hired Martha to advise them. Garvey, who is also executive director of the N.F.L. Players Association, is said to have high respect for Martha and the way Martha dealt with him. Before Martha became associated with the 49ers, he also served as an arbitrator for noninjury grievances involving N.F.L. clubs and players. Coincidentally, one of the present arbitrators for such grievances is Sam Kagel, the San Francisco lawyer who until 11 days ago had been mediating the current pro football dispute. Martha, in his role with the 49ers, has followed these negotiations closely. Last Saturday, at the prompting of Dan Rooney, the president of the Steelers, Martha became involved in the negotiations. According to a management source who requested anonymity: ''Dan thought it would be easier working through an intermediary.'' The younger DeBartolo confirmed that Rooney had requested Martha. ''Dan called me last Saturday,'' said DeBartolo, ''and asked me if Martha could go to New York. He didn't say why, but I knew what he was thinking.'' All-American at Pitt Carroll (Beano) Cook was sports information director at the University of Pittsburgh when Martha was an all-America halfback there. Cook, as vice president for public relations of the Pittsburgh Civic Arena Corporation, is now Martha's associate. ''He's very bright,'' said Cook. ''He relates well to people. He's well-rounded. He has absolutely no ego problem. He has a lot of common sense. He listens to people, and he isn't the type of guy who has all the answers. He's fair. He believes people in unions aren't necessarily bad guys.'' Joe Gordon, the public-relations director of the Steelers, took that job in 1969, Martha's last year with the team. ''The thing I'll always remember about him,'' said Gordon, ''was his curiosity and his hunger for knowledge. We played the Giants in Yankee Stadium that year. I had spent the last five years in hockey, and on the bus ride from the airport to our hotel in New Jersey he asked me everything I knew about hockey. Now he is a hockey executive.'' John Paul Martha grew up in Wilkinsburg, Pa., a working-class suburb of Pittsburgh. He was a football and baseball star at Shadyside Academy, a prep school in Fox Chapel, Pa., that he attended on an athletic scholarship. Steelers' No.1 Draft Choice At the University of Pittsburgh, he was second-string quarterback in 1961 and a starting halfback in 1962 and 1963. The Steelers made him their No.1 draft choice in 1964, and he played six years for them and one year for the Denver Broncos. He started his pro career as a wide receiver and finished as a defensive back. Terry Hanratty, a former teammate with the Steelers, remembers when Martha played for the Broncos. ''We were friends,'' said Hanratty, now an institutional trader for Oppenheimer and Company in New York. ''We were on their 2-yard line, and I was supposed to run a dive. I thought I should fake and run around end, sucking Paul in. He didn't bite, and I went down so hard that I spent that night in the hospital in traction. ''When he landed on me, I said, 'Paul, you broke my neck.' He really didn't, but you could see his concern. I said, 'You let the running backs run over you. Why not me?' I think I'm the only person in the N.F.L. he ever hurt.'' Law Degree From Duquesne During his playing career, Martha spent the offseasons at Duquesne Law School and became a lawyer. He married Bobbie Gott, whose father, Edwin H. Gott, was chairman of United States Steel. Martha had just finished law school when his father-in-law reached the mandatory retirement age of 65, and they went into the steelfabricating business in Youngstown, Ohio. Martha later joined a Pittsburgh law firm. He met the younger DeBartolo in 1975 or 1976 and soon became affiliated with the DeBartolo sports operations.

1047-> SUICIDE WAS IN THE SCRIPT
THE LIFE OF JOHN BERRYMAN By John Haffenden. 451 pp. Boston: Routledge & Kegan Paul. $22.50. ON Jan. 7, 1972, the poet John Berryman committed suicide by jumping off the Washington Avenue Bridge between St. Paul and Minneapolis. It was the second time that week he had resolved to kill himself . On Jan. 5 he left a note for his wife, Kate - ''I am a nuisance'' - and went off to do the deed. But he came back and wrote a poem about the episode, beginning, ''I didn't. And I didn't,'' and ending, after a dismal account of his life and job, ''Kitticat, they can't fire me.'' Berryman was born Oct. 25, 1914, in McAlester, Okla. His father, John Allyn Smith, was a shadowy figure, working betimes as a game warden, a banker or whatever, until he turned shadow into dire substance in 1926 by killing himself. ''I spit upon this dreadful banker's grave / who shot his heart out in a Florida dawn,'' Berryman wrote many years and torments later. A few weeks after Smith's death, his widow, Martha, married John Angus McAlpin Berryman; her sons, John and Robert, took their stepfather's name. The poet's mother did not go in for shadows; she was all substance from the start. John remained, for the rest of his perturbed life, a mother's boy. John Haffenden's splendidly just and well-tempered biography plays fair by Berryman's mother and is patient even with her meddlesomeness. She relentlessly interfered in her son's life, haranguing him in the diverse tones of mother, father and - you would almost think - lover. Berryman remained dependent on her and hated his dependence. It may be the case, though Mr. Haffenden leaves the reader free to make it or not, that Berryman's obsessive womanizing was his way of getting rid of his mother or punishing her for being so much to him. His stepfather was another shadow but kind enough and materially helpful. Indeed, Berryman was lucky in his friends. At Columbia Mark Van Doren went miles out of his way to rescue him. Delmore Schwartz was crucial to him: Being geniuses together answered one of Berryman's many needs. But the good company of friends is impressive: R.P. Blackmur, Saul Bellow, Allen Tate (though Berryman came to distrust and resent him), Randall Jarrell (though he was severe in an early review), Robert Giroux (who fostered and published Berryman) and Robert Lowell (the only poet Berryman acknowledged as his peer). Mr. Haffenden quotes several of Lowell's letters to Berryman, and they are noble things, extraordinarily warmhearted when warmth and heart were the only blessings Berryman could receive. Lowell too reviewed Berryman severely, but in public one is on oath; in private there are other considerations. As for women, Berryman was fortunate in his wives and often, according to Mr. Haffenden's book, in his lovers. He had a weakness for falling in love, but he was so tempestuously attractive that the women he desired came to him, it appears, almost before they were sent for. Besides, the poetry scene was more hectic then. Those, more than now, were the years of readings, presences, images, performances. To have seen a Ginsberg plain, a Ferlinghetti high, a Lowell careworn was to be young and easy, even though the public times were monstrous. Berryman was never, or never for long, in Mr. Ferlinghetti's league for big occasions, but he was an unforgettable presence, bearded, shortsighted, offering his audiences the marks of his suffering and a little knowledge of it. Mr. Haffenden's biography is an appalling story of love and drink. Some people maintain that Berryman was a good drinker, that drink, like Guinness, according to the Guinnesses, was good for him, especially for his eloquence and cordiality. I doubt it. I had only one evening with him, in his house in Dublin, where he came to spend a year for the worst possible reason, to confront Yeats - ''I have moved to Dublin to have it out with you, / majestic Shade.'' In the event, he met many unmajestic characters, Dublin drinkers, the most dangerous kind. The evening, night and early hours of the morning I spent with him were a mess, exorbitant in every remembered respect, the brew too rich for me, every opinion delivered as if it were Custer's last stand. Too much of everything: drink, noise, waste of spirit. A few years after Berryman's death, Lowell wrote a mediocre poem in which he mused:''Yet really we had the same life, / the generic one / our generation offered.'' There is indeed something to be explained, the extravagantly untidy lives of Lowell, Berryman, Jarrell, Schwartz and many more in their generation. But Lowell's poem turns several contingencies, choices and chances into a mythology and removes from poets the responsibility - not, however, the blame; there is no question of that - other people have to take. These several poets did not have the same life; only an ennobling mythology makes them seem to have had a life in common. It is certainly true that for a man of Berryman's precarious constitution, the times were wrong. Heroes were required, because the continuous possibility of heroism had to be maintained in the face of a public world in nearly every respect corrupt. What ''our generation'' offered to poets was the heroic role and the fame that attended it. Poets could assume the role, accept the offer, because they worked in language, a spiritual medium free, at least in principle, from the sordidness nearly inevitable in political office and the direct exercise of power. Poetry had its own power, but it was occult, magical; it spoke an ancient tongue, true in the long run and, even in the short, truer than anything audible on Capitol Hill. Even if a poet ''failed,'' his failure could readily be construed as a constituent of tragedy, the most exalted and exalting artistic form, according to the Western assessment of art. Berryman was impatient to assume the heroic burden, as if to represent his time by being defeated in the end. He wanted of the tragic form only its suffering, not the acts and responsibilities which cause the suffering and in the end, if the form is sound, transfigure it. Pathos was his most opulent emotion. Like many another hero of a bourgeois time, he couldn't find a world fit for his consciousness to live in. He was often magnanimous, but in his dog days he gave in to petty sentiments: envy, the bourgeois passion; rage if a rival poet were praised; obsession with ''the thriving gangs.'' Long before the end he wanted to die. Always more than half in love with easeful death, he fondled its images. If a poem could be turned toward sleep and death, he turned it; as, in a superb essay on Shakespeare, he has Prospero in ''The Tempest'' longing for his little life to be rounded, rounded off, with sleep, the great globe at last (thank God) dissolved. Mr. Haffenden doesn't, perhaps can't, make up his mind about Berryman's grieving - his grieving, for instance, when Dylan Thomas died, a wail so deep and resounding that you would think Thomas must have been to Berryman what he was not, his closest, most needed, most loved friend. It is easy to be ill mannered on this theme. Didn't Milton write ''Lycidas'' when Edward King, hardly next of kin, died? But Mr. Haffenden sometimes thinks Berryman's grief literary in a compromising sense and is not quite willing to regard it as justified on every occasion by the representative or generic brunt of the death. In any case, every death for which Berryman grieved - ''The high ones die, die. They die. You look up and who's there?'' - was a rehearsal for his own. SUICIDE was already in the script. Even with this biography at hand, it is still not clear to me whether John Allyn Smith's suicide was the monstrous catastrophe to his 12-year-old son that it became in Berryman's poetry. Even in the poetry Berryman veered. Sometimes his words are all loss - ''I join my father / who dared so long agone leave me'' - sometimes spitting rage. In one of the ''Dream Songs'' the father ''did what was needed,'' though Berryman confesses bewilderment, mainly - ''I cannot read that wretched mind, so strong / & so undone'' - and puts himself through the motions of forgiveness. But in the last years he seems to have felt that the script of suicide was inescapable. His father willed him a tragedy to play: It might be postponed from one diversion to the next, but finally it would have to be enacted, even if it meant that the hero was heroic only or chiefly in his victimhood. Mr. Haffendon's book shows that the relation between Berryman's poetry and the events that provoked it was peculiarly close. The poet went far out of his way to confound the relation, by inventing characters or named shades - Huffy Henry, Mr. Bones - and by giving them minstrel-show voices in preference to his own. But taking on someone else's voice was always Berryman's way of claiming that, deep down, he had one of his own - like Hamlet, who, according to William Empson, kept his secret by telling everybody he had one. In the early poems the conspirator in Berryman's ventriloquism was Yeats. In some of the poems of ''The Dispossessed'' and throughout ''Homage to Mistress Bradstreet,'' it was Hopkins. Even in the ''77 Dream Songs,'' a demented buffoonery sanctioned by the title of the book, Hopkins is still audible in a demotic form. But something in Berryman insured that he would talk straight only by talking out of the side of his mouth: He sounds most completely himself when he takes the risk of sounding like someone else. The ''Selected Poems 1938-1968,'' a selection Berryman made a few months before his death, is as much of the poetry as time will probably retain. It has ''Bradstreet'' and the best of the ''Dream Songs,'' with enough of ''The Dispossessed,'' and ''Canto Amor'' too, which I find staying in my head as two lines: ''the flowing ceremony of trouble and light, / all Loves becoming, none to flag upon.'' But I would want to add, making up an ideal ''Portable Berryman'' or ''Berryman Reader,'' three stories, ''The Imaginary Jew,'' ''Wash Far Away'' and ''The Lovers,'' along with the essays on Shakespeare, Hardy and Eliot's ''Prufrock,'' and I would end with the interpretation of Lowell's ''Skunk Hour.'' THE poetry of Berryman's last years was a mess. He seemed to think that all he had to do to write a poem was to transcribe minor contingencies, report his daily doings as if he were taking dictation from the weather. Many of the poems Mr. Haffenden quotes as evidence of those years are already dead to themselves, sullen in every purported gesture. It was as if the lurid determinism that Berryman fulfilled in suicide made him kill the language before he killed himself. T.S. Eliot once remarked that ''the really fine rhetoric of Shakespeare occurs in situations where a character in the play sees himself in a dramatic light.'' The remark would have to be modified to take account of situations like Berryman's, in which a character is congealed in the sense of himself as victim, ''a huddle of need'' and nothing more. The rhetoric, as in Berryman's ''Love & Fame,'' is numbed. Given a few years, it will be easier than it is now to read Berryman's work in a disinterested spirit. John Haffenden's book lights up the subject, but the light is necessarily lurid: such waste, such despondency, such madness. Berryman was clearly a genuine poet - a minor one by any serious standards and more limited than he seemed a few crazed years ago, but still the real thing. The mythology of his generation has waned; for this relief much thanks. One of the many merits of Mr. Haffenden's book is that it tells a story, not a legend.

1048-> AROUND THE NATION; Two Postal Clerks Told To Pay Burglary Loss
Two postal clerks have been told to pay the Postal Service more than $7,000 to make up for what was lost in a burglary of the Bullhead City Post Office. Postmaster Theresa Hall, who ordered the reimbursement, said the two men were being held liable for the loss because they left their inventory of stamps and a small amount of cash in locked drawers at the counter. She said this should have been locked in a central safe, which was untouched in the burglary on Monday. Bill Wodrich, a 17-year Postal Service employee, has been ordered to pay $2,145.76. Larry McPherson, a 14-year employee, has been ordered to pay slightly more than $5,100. They have been given until the end of the month. ''I just about died,'' Mr. Wodrich said Friday. ''I couldn't believe they would do that. In all my years with the post office, I never heard of anything like this.'' Mr. McPherson said, ''I don't feel it's right when anybody with a can opener can get into this post office.''

The Associated Dry Goods Corporation said that its Caldor discount store subsidiary would take over the five Stewart & Company stores in Maryland, starting next spring. Associated operates both Caldor and Stewart, as well as other store groups around the country. The Stewart stores, all in the suburbs, will discontinue business in March and be converted into typical Caldor stores. The Stewart stores accounted for about $45 million in sales last year.

1050-> BELL GOES TO HIGH COURT
Judge Harold H. Greene, who has charge of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company antitrust case here, agreed today to send 22 appeals of his ruling directly to the Supreme Court, thus speeding up the timetable for reorganizing the phone company. The Justice Department had requested the shortened procedure yesterday in an application that endorsed a similar request from A.T.& T. and several state governments. A department official said the judge's order was the first invocation of a law that allows for direct referral of appeals to the Supreme Court. Without this procedure, the challenges to Judge Greene's ruling would have to be considered in a number of jurisdictions before the issues raised would finally be resolved, the judge said. Judge Greene signed a judgment Aug. 24 accepting a modified agreement between the Justice Department and A.T.& T. under which A.T.& T. will divest its 22 wholly owned telephone companies, with the divestiture to be accomplished by Feb. 24, 1984. The customary appeals procedure could have gone beyond that date, the judge said. Several Challenges Filed A number of states and agencies filed challenges to details in the agreement, and some states threatened to file for injunctions in local Federal courts to block certain terms of the agreement, such as changes in the regulatory powers of state regulatory bodies. Judge Greene, in his order, said expedited procedure was necessary in part because ''the ability of A.T.& T. and its various components to continue to market bond issues will inevitably be affectd both by uncertainty and delay.''

1051-> Charge at Houston Industries Possible
Houston Industries, an electric utility holding company, said it might have to take a ''substantial charge'' against 1982 earnings. The company said that the Public Utility Commission of Texas had granted it a $182.6 million rate increase on Dec. 6, but had disallowed the recovery of about $166 million of costs incurred for the Allen Creek nuclear generating project, which was canceled in August. The utility had asked to recover the full $362 million it had spent or accrued on the project, but the agency allowed it to recover only about $195 million, the company said.

1052-> Judge's Sentence of a Texan Includes a Course in English
A United States citizen who attended Texas schools but had to use an interpreter in court has been ordered by a judge to take an English course. David Sanchez, 19 years old, explained through his bilingual attorney that he had gone to the public schools in Brownsville but he was unable to converse in English. He speaks Spanish. He pleaded guilty to attempted burglary. State District Judge Ted Poe sentenced him Tuesday to three years' probation and a $500 fine and ordered as a condition of probation that he attend night classes in English. The judge said Mr. Sanchez would be in violation of the probation terms if he had not learned to speak some English in six months.

1053-> ISRAELIS VIEW SYRIAN FORCES WITH CONCERN; Military Analysis
In the eyes of Israeli military leaders, Syria remains the best equipped and most dangerous potential foe despite its setbacks in last summer's fighting in Lebanon. Such a judgment is made by these officers as part of their continued watch over present and potential threats to the security of Israel, which, they say, cannot afford even one defeat. They express concern over what they describe as the flood of United States and Soviet weapons moving into the armories of present and potential foes. They express concern as well over the stability of Egypt as a result of the assassination last year of President Anwar el-Sadat, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. If a strongly anti-Israeli Government was to come to power in Cairo, one Israeli officer said, Israel would have to ''think seriously about a potential enemy on our Western flank.'' The Syrian high command, the Israeli sources note, has responded to last summer's reverses by expanding and modernizing its army and air force. Syria's order of battle last June included two armored and five infantry divisions. Since then it has been raised to six armored divisions and two mechanized infantry divisions capable of fielding 3,800 to 4,000 tanks, including at least 1,000 T-72's, the Soviet Union's most advanced tank. Influx of Western Equipment Israeli sources stressed that modernization had meant an influx of Western equipment including laser rangefinders and thermo sights for tanks and HOT missiles for French-made Gazelle helicopters. Israeli's destruction last summer of Syrian surface-to-air missiles has forced a major review of Syria's Soviet-made antiaircraft defenses. Senior Soviet officers of the Air Defense Force have visited Syria repeatedly. There are rumors that the new Soviet antiaircraft missile system SS-11 is to be installed in Syria to meet the threat posed by Israeli fighters and bombers. Israeli and other intelligence services report that as a result of Israeli successes against Soviet-made antiaircraft missiles, the Russians may have to revise their surface-to-air missile defenses in East Germany and Eastern Europe generally. Although in the past Israeli military sources emphasized their qualitative edge over the Arabs, that emphasis is not as evident today. The Syrians, one Israeli said, are holding onto the reserves now in the army and air force and training them in the use of advanced weapons. Speaking of the Egyptians, the Israeli sources said that Egypt's armed forces would be better armed in a few years and would employ more realistic military doctrine than the ones that crashed across the Suez Canal in the 1973 war. Egypt, these sources said, has not reduced its army of 10 divisions and has shown no signs of wanting to do so. Egypt Replacing Weapons Egypt has contracted with companies in the United States and Western Europe for replacements of obsolete weapons systems provided by the Soviet Union. Israeli sources said the Egyptian Air Force today of about 440 combat aircraft was more capable than that of 1973, largely because of new aircraft and an improvement in maintenance. The informants said that Egypt was now receiving American F-16 fighters and would try to get F-15 fighters. It was also said to have 190 American M-60A3 tanks and 750 American armored personnel carriers on order. In addition, Egypt is acquiring both the American TOW and the French HOT anti-tank missiles. To many Israeli officers, the most significant change in Egypt's military posture has been the adoption by the new generation of Egyptian officers of American military doctrine. This means, they said, that Egypt has discarded the highly centralized system of command taught by the Soviet Union and in the future would allow battalion and brigade commanders greater initiative in the field. The variety of Israel's military problems is underlined by a mounting concern over Jordan's military modernization. American and other Western arms transfers are enabling the Jordanians to pose a greater threat in the future, the Israelis asserted.

1054-> John H. Beard Is Dead at 59; Director of Fountain House
John H. Beard, executive director of Fountain House Inc., which emphasizes community-based rehabilitation of the mentally ill, died Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He was 59 years old and a resident of Montclair, N.J. Mr. Beard became executive director of Fountain House, at 425 West 47th Street, in 1955. It became a national model, and in the last six years 131 mental health facilities have initiated similar programs. Mr. Beard received various awards for his work in mental health. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Wayne State University. He is survived by his wife, Margaret; a son, Jonathan, of Montclair; a daughter, Margaret Eddy of Tamarack, Fla.; a brother, George, of San Luis Rey, Calif., and two sisters, Mary Dowlding of Menomonee Falls, Wis., and Helen Earle of New Baltimore, Mich.

1055-> 2 ELECTION WINNERS MOVE TO SUE LOSERS
TWO victorious Long Island legislators, in an unusual move, are planning to take their election opponents to court in libel and slander suits as a result of election charges and allegations that the unsuccessful opponents used. State Senator Carol Berman of Lawrence has already filed suit against Assemblyman Dean G. Skelos, and Assemblyman Paul E. Harenberg of Bayport has retained a lawyer in a step toward suing Virginia Allen. Those filing the suits are Democrats; their opponents are Republicans. A third Democrat, but an election loser, Smithtown Supervisor Patrick R. Vecchio, is also considering a suit against his opponent, State Senator James J. Lack of East Northport. The suits are unusual since normally the charges and countercharges of a campaign are forgotten once the election is over. Election winners in particular are more likely to forgive and forget. The suits are also significant. They spotlight the subterranean, less visible part of campaigns - mailings and street fliers that are often distributed at the last minute when candidates or the news media have little time to react before the election. They also point up the conflict between, on the one hand, the First Amendment right of free speech even to the point of exaggeration and distortion and, on the other hand, candidates' rights to their reputations and voters' rights to accurate information as the basis for their decisions at the polls. Senator Berman, who filed her $6 million suit in Nassau Supreme Court, singled out a Skelos charge that she was the only senator to vote against a bill requiring insurance policies to be written in plain English rather than in legalistic language. The Skelos brochure, which also described Mrs. Berman as ''the Bella Abzug of Nassau County,'' noted that Mrs. Berman's husband is in the insurance business. Mrs. Berman said that the bill was actually a measure that would have given insurance companies another year to comply with the plain-language provisions of a 1980 bill and that she voted against the extension and thus against the insurance industry position. She said that the Skelos brochure had also used a cartoon of her driving a school bus and said she favored regionalization of schools that ''would mean drawing school district lines across county lines into Queens County and requiring busing of school children between schools in the regional district.'' Mrs. Berman said that as a state senator who represented a Queens-Nassau district until this election, she had repeatedly told black audiences in the Queens part of the district that she opposed busing across county lines to promote integration. She said she had protested to the State Board of Elections about the Skelos literature but had been told that the board could do nothing. ''In effect, you can say anything you darn please under the First Amendment,'' she said. Neither Mr. Skelos's legislative or law office returned calls seeking his comment. Mr. Harenberg also cited the First Amendment in describing the difficulty of drawing constitutional legislation that would ban or limit scurrilous and distorted literature. Another problem, he said, is finding a nonpartisan judge of what constitutes a distortion. The State Board of Elections is bipartisan, split between two Democrats and two Republicans. This division often insures no action in election cases. Mr. Harenberg has retained Paul Gianelli, the former chief assistant district attorney in Suffolk, in his anticipated suit against Mrs. Allen, who took a leave from the Suffolk Consumer Affairs Department to challenge the Democrat. Mr. Harenberg is making an issue of charges Mrs. Allen made in a brochure that he favored the legalization of marijuana and prostitution. The Democratic legislator said he favored decriminalization as distinguished, he said, from legalization of prostitution and possession of small amounts of marijuana. He said that under decriminalization, both would be less serious offenses subject to fines. But there would be no criminal record attached. Mr. Harenberg said he intended ''to put the Islip Republican Party on notice that I will not put up with this last-minute literature.'' Mrs. Allen was supported by the Islip Republican organization. Mr. Harenberg said that such charges, which he acknowledged are ''not confined to one party,'' not only reflected on a candidate but also confused potential voters, made them even more cynical about politics and politicians and discouraged other would-be candidates. He said he had considered making an issue of Mrs. Allen's failure to pass a Civil Service test for her position in the Consumer Affairs Department but decided against it. ''I was told to be very genteel and not attack a woman,'' he said. Mrs. Allen, who is still with the Consumer Affairs Department, declined to comment. The Smithtown Supervisor, Mr. Vecchio, whose integrity was questioned by Mr. Lack in a last-minute mailing in their hotly contested State Senate election, asked, ''Why should someone sully my reputation because I'm in politics?'' ''What drives a man to sell his integrity just for political advancement?'' was the headline on the Lack flier that accused Mr. Vecchio of accepting contributions from ''convicted mobster Tony Scotto, who is now in jail'' and from ''ex-Congressman Fred Richmond, a corrupt politician.'' Actually, Mr. Vecchio said he received contributions not this year but in 1977 from Mr. Richmond, who was then a Congressman with no legal troubles, and from the International Longshoremen's Association, also in 1977, rather than from Mr. Scotto, who was president of an I.L.A. local then. Mr. Lack said that his last-minute mailing was not an effort to head off possible defeat, but retaliation against what he said were distortions of his record by Mr. Vecchio and a Vecchio charge that Mr. Lack had accepted contributions from garbage carters and had then remained silent when the carters refused to collect garbage in Smithtown unless they received higher fees. ''Since when does a state senator have anything to do with garbage strikes?'' Mr. Lack asked. He also complained that the Vecchio campaign had used a letter on St. John's University stationery from Lou Carnesecca, the basketball coach, endorsing Mr. Vecchio and sent to St. John's alumni in the district. Among them was Mr. Lack's wife. Mr. Lack is chairman of the Senate Elections Committee, which would handle any legislation designed to put a crimp on distorted and scurrilous literature. Legislation has often been proposed to monitor campaign literature, but it invariably runs up against consitutional objections. Mr. Vecchio said he had consulted Joel Ziegler, a Smithtown lawyer, on the possibility of a suit against Senator Lack. POLITICS

1056-> 2 A.M. BAR CLOSINGS WEIGHED FOR COUNTY
WHITE PLAINS VILLAGE efforts to control late-night rowdyism closing bars earlier have reached the county level and may force public hearings on the issue. The Board of Legislators endorsed last week a call for a 2 A.M. countywide closing time for bars, thus joining the villages of Larchmont and Pelham Manor as well as a group of local officials. Bars with state licenses now may stay open until 4 A.M. in the county. Without debate, the Board referred to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, a state agency in White Plains, a one-paragraph resolution introduced by Legislator Ronald C. Tocci, Democrat of New Rochelle. The resolution urges the agency to adopt ''a mandatory 2 A.M. closing of all establishments involved in the sale of alcoholic beverages.'' The control board, a bipartisan two-member panel appointed by the Governor, is empowered to roll back, but not extend, the statemandated 4 A.M. closing time in the county, if both members agree. One member, James J. Noletti of Mamaroneck, said last week that an earlier closing time was ''something that should be looked into.'' ''We ought to have public hearings and hear all sides,'' said Mr. Noletti, a lawyer whose name had been proposed to Governor Carey by Anthony J. Colavita, the county's Republican Party leader. ''I would not be opposed to earlier hours on weekday nights,'' said Mr. Noletti, who once tended bar in Larchmont while attending law school at Fordham University. The Democratic member is Thomas G. McSpedon of Yonkers, who is executive manager of the Westchester-Fairfield Chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association. Nominated by County Executive Alfred B. DelBello, Mr. McSpedon said of possible hearings, ''You like to be responsive to what the community needs.'' Mr. McSpedon sounded the theme of several legislators and officials when he said, ''I'd like to hear from the owners of these places'' as well as from police officers who have had to deal with disturbances by raucous youths leaving bars in the early morning hours. ''Their statistics on street accidents would be very interesting,'' Mr. McSpedon said of the police. Opposition came quickly from the Westchester County Restaurant and Tavern Owners Association, whose president said it represented 250 members ''from the corner spot to the Rye Town Hilton.'' The official, Jim Mannion, who owns a tavern in Yonkers, said his organization ''would like the closing in Westchester left as it is.'' He said that patronage in the hours from 2 A.M. to 4 produced between 50 and 60 percent of his bar's gross revenue each week. Mr. Tocci said in an interview that the police in his city, New Rochelle, found it ''impossible to put the city to found it ''impossible to put the city to ranguing people.'' There are 93 bars in New Rochelle, Mr. Tocci said, and a stretch of North Avenue from Iona College to New Rochelle High School has become a focus in recent years of complaints from residents, who say they are awakened by noise from drinkers as they leave bars to find their cars, parked on side streets. Mr. Tocci said he had heard similar complaints from residents in Pleasantville, the site of Pace University. Mr. Tocci said, ''It's all really involved with young people.'' On Saturday, the legal age for drinkers in the state rose from 18 to 19. The executive officer of the control board, Joseph N. Penn, said he thought the impact of the higher age limit would be ''minimal.'' Another legislator, Andrew A. Albanese, who has owned an Italian restaurant and bar in Eastchester for 32 years and closes it at 1 A.M., proposed a compromise. ''I think the industry could live with a 3 A.M. close and not feel the financial impact of a 2 A.M. close,'' he said in an interview. Mr. Albanese and Mr. Mannion said in separate interviews that policemen, hospital workers and others who work late shifts would be adversely affected by a rollback in the closing hour. A debate has arisen among those who advocate a single countywide closing hour that would apply to all licensed establishments and those who favor a local option that would enable communities to set their own times. Opponents of local option feel that staggered hours would encourage ''bar hopping'' by young people who would drive in cars from a community that had early closing hours to a nearby one with a later closing time. State law gives the option only to counties. Village or town authority to set closing times would require approval of the State Legislature. Closing time for package liquor stores in Westchester is 9 P.M., set by the control board. Larchmont's Village Board passed a resolution urging both a 2 A.M. closing countywide and local option for bars. Larchmont's Mayor, Martin S. Quigley, an early proponent of earlier closings, said, ''We'd prefer county action or a state rollback to some reasonable hour like 2 A.M.,'' but that if such action does not materialize, Larchmont wants authority to set its own hour. Mayor Quigley will present the issue to state legislators on Thursday at a dinner meeting in his village of the Westchester County Village Officials Association. Last month, the association unanimously passed a resolution urging both local option and a 2 A.M. closing. A state law allowing local option with the approval of the State Liquor Authority has been drafted, according to Assemblyman John R. Branca of Mount Vernon, who sponsored it with State Senator John D. Calandra of the Bronx. Expressing some reservations about it last week, Mr. Branca said that before any law goes into effect, public hearings on the question should hear the views of police officers, tavern owners and patrons.

1057-> Better Judging Is A.K.C. Goal
For the first time since it introduced the provisional judging system in 1970, the American Kennel Club is taking a major step to improve judging of dog shows. Last week, the board of directors issued the following statement: ''The board recognizes recurring complaints that some persons approved to judge may lack sufficient training and experience. Fundamental to an improvement in the quality of judging is a greater emphasis on education and evaluation.'' So the A.K.C. has initiated a three-part program that will combine its guidance and resources with the expert knowledge of the various breed clubs. In the first phase, the breed clubs and the A.K.C. will develop seminars for potential judges. More training-match shows, in which no championship points are awarded, will be held so the arbiter who is applying to judge new breeds has an opportunity to judge dogs in a learning environment. An Observer System An observer procedure also is to be instituted at A.K.C. shows. Under this system an observer is required to be approved by the show chairman, wear an A.K.C. badge, receive the judge's permission to observe in his or her ring and possibly examine the dogs. However, the observer cannot disrupt or delay the judging and is not to be in the ring for more than two hours. The second part is directed toward the improved evaluation of applicants for new or additional breeds. To accomplish this, each candidate will have to attend at least one seminar and one training match in the breed for which he or she is applying. The candidate also must attend and report on at least one specialty show in the breed being applied for. There also will be tests on structure, gait and standards developed by the A.K.C. and the breed clubs. For each breed, an applicant is to be interviewed by a panel that includes at least one A.K.C. representative and one breed club member. The candidates' eye examination report for vision and color perception also must be presented. In the final part, the national breed clubs will be invited to assist the A.K.C. in developing a list of members to evaluate the judging of their breed. More Severe Testing It is hoped that the evaluation procedure will enable the A.K.C. board of directors to monitor the quality of judging. An arbiter may be required to submit to a re-evaluation of his or her ability to judge a breed. If it is deemed necessary, the board will withdraw a judge's license for a breed. Under the present system, an applicant must have compiled a record of exhibiting at dog shows for at least eight years, have owned several dogs of the breed applied for, stewarded at a minimum of five shows and judged at least six matches. A comprehensive written test must be passed and an interview held with an A.K.C. official. If approval is granted, the applicant becomes a provisional and must complete a minimum of three judging assignments. ''The new procedure will not replace the provisional system but will augment it,'' said William Schmick, A.K.C. vice president of show operations.

1058-> Bridge: Big Prizes in Fall Nationals Fail to Draw Many Experts
Bridge experts are a suspicious lot, and most would rebuff a stranger who offered to sell them a gold brick for a modest price. They would feel foolish, however, if the offer turned out to be genuine. That seems to be the situation this month: While some of the most attractive cash prizes ever offered are available, there are few takers. During the Fall Nationals, beginning Nov. 19 in Minneapolis, a total of $25,000 will be shared among an expert field playing about 30 deals spread over three mornings. The winning pair, out of an entry that so far amounts to a mere 30 pairs, will collect $10,000. Each player must have more than 1,000 master points, pay an entry fee of $100 and be resident in the Marquette Hotel, which is furnishing most of the prize money. Slam Is a Borderline Case A similar event, with slightly lower entry fees and smaller prizes, will exclude partnerships that consist of two established experts. More information can be obtained from the organizers: Association of Professional Bridge Players, P.O. Box 7104 Berkeley Calif. 94707. Telephone, (415) 526-7148. The chief executive officer of the association is Ron Feldman, a Californian expert who recently found himself playing a borderline slam contract on the diagramed deal. He landed in six diamonds after East had overcalled in hearts and West had raised. The opening lead of the spade king was won by the ace, and Feldman cashed the club ace. He ruffed a club, bringing down the king, and could now have made an easy overtrick by drawing trumps. However, South had reason to believe that East held at most a singleton diamond. That player had surely begun with three clubs and was likely to have a six-card heart suit for his overcall. He had played the spade two, ruling out a doubleton, and he could hardly have a singleton since West had not bid the suit. If East held a small singleton trump, the only chance was an error by West. So Feldman decided, wrongly as it turned out, to lead to the diamond ace, play the club queen and continue clubs whenever possible. If West failed to ruff, dummy's spades could be discarded. This plan was due to fail, but East came to the rescue: When a trump was led from dummy, he played the queen. South happily took the rest of the tricks, astonished to find that the trumps were evenly divided. ''It did not matter what I played,'' remarked East complacently in the post-mortem. ''My queen was going to fall anyway.''

1059-> MEDIATOR RECESSES TALKS IN N.F.L.
The latest round of the National Football League labor negotiations ended today, and not unexpectedly. Sam Kagel, the 73-year-old private mediator who joined the talks 12 days ago, recessed them, suggesting that the parties ''re-examine and reassess'' their positions on the issues perpetuating a strike now 33 days old. Where and when negotiations will resume was not decided. Nor was it decided that Mr. Kagel would be involved in them, although he said, ''I will be subject to call by the parties.'' But it was made clear by Jack Donlan, the executive director of the N.F.L. Management Council, that ''it makes no sense'' to him or his negotiating committee to return to bargaining if the players association continues its present position. The season, meanwhile, remains in jeopardy. This is the fifth weekend in which there will be no games, and the league is expected to announce soon that no games can be played next weekend. Only two weekends, league officials have said, can be made up. The recess in negotiations was announced this morning by Mr. Kagel, who said that after the parties agreed on ''a number of important noneconomic issues'' in the early days of his involvement, they could not agree on the ''extremely complex'' economic issues, including the framework for wage distribution, which is judged by both sides to be the most complex issue of all. In that sense, the parties are no closer to a new collective bagaining agreement than they were Feb.16, when negotiations began. The ''gulf,'' as Donlan called it, remains conceptual in nature. The union is still demanding that players' salaries be paid from a central fund tied to a wage scale. The owners are still demanding that players be paid through individual contract negotiations. Donlan even suggested that Mr. Kagel ''on any number of occasions'' told union leaders that the central fund was ''nonsense.'' In response, Gene Upshaw, the union president, said: ''Jack Donlan is a liar. The mediator never said our wage compensation package was nonsense.'' As they have before, Donlan and Ed Garvey, the executive director of the players association, blamed each other for the differences that remain. ''These two weeks have given Ed Garvey a chance to write a textbook on how not to bargain,'' Donlan said. Said Garvey: ''Not one dollar has moved across the table. We're willing to negotiate dollar amounts, but they're still refusing to bargain collectively with this union.'' Both Donlan and Garvey said that pressures will dictate which side flinches - pressures from owners of the 28 clubs upon Donlan, according to Garvey; pressures from the union membership upon Garvey, according to Donlan. Garvey will get another reading of his players, beginning at 2 P.M. Sunday when the 28 team representatives to the union, and possibly other players, are scheduled to meet in Washington. Garvey said that the gathering of the team representatives, the first such meeting since Aug. 31, will give the union's executive committee a chance to discuss progress in negotiations under Mr. Kagel and prospects for the future, in light of an increasing number of reports that some players around the league would be willing to report to camps, even while negotiations continued. ''It won't be difficult holding our people together,'' Upshaw said. ''They have been solid and unified over this. There's no way the players are going back to play football under the present system. That's the reason we're on strike.'' Management Unit to Meet The Management Council executive committee, the six men who formulate the league's bargaining position, will meet ''probably Monday,'' Chuck Sullivan, the committee chairman, said today from New York. Sullivan also said that it is unrealistic for the union to assume that the regular season would include all 16 games, that the date of the Super Bowl XVII would be moved from Jan. 30 and that the players, upon returning to work, would be refunded all their lost pay - three assertions Garvey made here this morning. Garvey said that the number of games played is a subject of negotiation, not an arbitrary decision by Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Garvey also said that Sargent Karch, an attorney for the Management Council, ''suggested'' that the Super Bowl could be pushed back to accommodate rescheduling of lost regular-season games (''He absolutely did not,'' Donlan said). Garvey also said that the recent announcement by William A. Lubbers, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, that he would file a complaint charging the league with unfair labor practices means that players are entitled to back pay. In fact, for striking workers to get back wages lost during a strike that is ultimately determined to be over unfair labor practices, the workers would have to make an ''unconditional offer'' to return to work, prove that jobs are available, then not be given those jobs. In that case, the workers would be entitled to their jobs and back pay. The final determination of whether the strike is over economics, in which case workers would not be entitled to back pay and jobs, or whether it's over unfair labor practices could take years. Garvey said that he would contact Donlan sometime Sunday to discuss resumption of the talks. ''Maybe I'm overly optimistic,'' Garvey said, ''But my guess is we could start bargaining as early as Sunday night.''

1060-> DENVER PAPERS WAGE BUSINESS BATTLE
After a couple of noisy opening shots that hinted of ferocious things to come, Denver's newspaper battle has settled into trench warfare that is being decided not so much by legions of reporters and editors as by the troops from circulation and advertising. The struggle is between the city's two dailies, The Denver Post and The Rocky Mountain News, and it is no less deadly for the fact that it is largely waged out of public sight. The rivalry is an anomaly, because most American newspaper readers have long since been taken captive by either a single daily or two newspapers in a community operating their businesses jointly. Here the prize is rich: the hearts, minds and advertising dollars of what has been, and may be again, a boom town. The action began last year after the Times-Mirror Company, the proprietor of The Los Angeles Times and of Newsday, on Long Island, bought The Post from its local owners. Times-Mirror said it was going to reclaim The Post's old Rocky Mountain empire that The News has been slowly annexing since the early 1970's. News Successful in Daily Battle The News, owned by the Scripps-Howard chain, said it was not about to surrender. So far, it appears to have gained the high ground. It overtook The Post in daily circulation two years ago and is catching up on Sunday. In statements required under Postal Service rules, average daily sales were reported as 316,574 for The News and 254,000 for The Post. For the last Sunday of September, The News said it sold nearly 362,000 copies, as against 364,000 reported by The Post. There was an expectation that the fight would be carried out in the news columns. Editors were imported. Reporters and photographers were hired, sometimes from the other paper's staff, sometimes at high salaries. Market surveys were taken. The Post was redesigned. But the plan to bombard readers with hard-hitting exposes, brilliant analyses and scintillating writing has not materialized. ''If there is a newspaper war, it's not being played out on the pages of the newspapers,'' said Gov. Richard D. Lamm. He said he would surely have noticed, because such a fight creates ''a tumultuous situation'' for a politician. Effects of the Competition ''In terms of a war, what we have here is a town with two morning newspapers that both raised their price,'' said Robert A. Burns, a former reporter and editor for The News and now a utility's public relations official. Mr. Burns, Governor Lamm and others say The Post has changed under its new owners and is tackling such complex issues as the effect of growth on the region. Mentioned in particular was a series of articles on energy that reported, among other things, that oil companies may have been underpaying the royalties they owed the state. The News, on the other hand, gets points for the completeness of its local coverage, given credit for much of its circulation growth in the last decade. The Post's ''big story'' so far has been an examination of police practices. The paper made particular reference to moonlighting and even more particular reference to officers who supplemented their income by serving as bodyguards to Michael B. Howard, who had been the editor of The News from the early 1970's. Mr. Howard was also addicted to cocaine, and The Post has been exploring the question of how much his police escorts knew about that addiction and whether they procured drugs for him. Police Angle Is Cited Post editors say the story sheds light on police activities. But occasionally they lose sight of the police angle, as in a front-page article earlier this month that devoted 3,000 words to the discovery of five of Mr. Howard's checks for drugs, none routed through police connections. The News has also been covering the Howard story. Its editor, Ralph Looney, said his newspaper broke the story about the relationship between Mr. Howard and his police escort. ''The questions about the integrity of the police are legitimate,'' he said. The war has made a measurable difference in one area of coverage, City Hall. Until Mr. Howard began stirring the pot, both newspapers treated local government as run by people of impeccable virtue. Further, some Post editors felt hamstrung by the fact that the newspaper's profits were pledged to a city-owned performing arts center, under an arcane agreement that allowed the previous owners to run the newspaper through trusts instead of selling it. Now both dailies are actively examining municipal matters and raising questions about such things as the airport parking franchise and development plans. A Struggle on the Business Side But the fiercest competition is on the business side. The Post took direct aim at The News this summer by switching from afternoon to morning publication. That has involved such seemingly trivial problems as vying for schoolchildren willing to get up at 5 A.M. to make deliveries. Lee J. Guittar, The Post's publisher, said it was ''miraculous'' that The Post had picked up ''a few thousand'' readers in its switch to a morning edition, a move that has often hurt sales temporarily for other papers. News advertising linage is up, but Mr. Guittar attributed that to The News's change from a six-column to a seven-column format. He credited The News with about 52 percent of the total advertising dollar. The business manager of The News, William W. Fletcher, accepted that figure, while noting that The Post also increased its measured linage by switching to a nine-column format, before The News made its change. The Post was losing money when Times-Mirror bought it. Mr. Guittar said it was making a profit, although a smaller one this year than last. Industry analysts say that most cities will only support one newspaper, but the Denver area is continuing to grow, and that could make it possible for both to stay in business. Neither side is gambling on that, however. Said Mr. Fletcher, ''I'm not going to sit back and wait to find out.''

1061-> CHINESE EXPERTS TELL OF GAINS IN MEDICINE FOR REHABILITATION
China is embarked on an ambitious effort to wed modern rehabilitation medicine with traditional practices. Typical of the marriage is the use of laser beams instead of needles for acupuncture. The program was described last week by the leader of a group of Chinese medical specialists who are in this country to study American rehabilitation methods. The leader, Dr. Chen Zhongwu, who is responsible for rehabilitation medicine in China's Ministry of Health, outlined steps taken in recent months to train specialists in that field as well as to provide treatment. Sanatoriums are being modified to serve as rehabilitation centers, Dr. Chen said, and courses in rehabilitation medicine are being introduced at medical schools. While China is far behind the United States in many aspects of rehabilitation technology, he said, it has a long tradition of success in physical therapy, based on such exercise routines as Tai Chi, or shadow boxing, the ''Eight Fine Exercises,'' and Chi Kung, which resembles yoga. Traditions and Lasers Dr. Chen told how traditional Chinese medicine was being applied, as in the use of lasers or beams of ultraviolet for acupuncture. The latter, he said, can often relieve paralysis or chronic pain. Though Chinese medicine has turned to the United States for help in improving treatment of the disabled, this country also stands to gain from study of developments in China, according to two hosts of the visitors. ''We have many things we can learn from them,'' Dr. Howard A. Rusk asserted. ''It's a two-way street.'' His view was echoed by Dr. Mathew Lee, professor of clinical rehabilitation medicine at the Institute of Rehabilitation, 400 East 34th Street. The institute was founded by Dr. Rusk, who played a leading role in making rehabilitation a full medical specialty. Struggling Back From a Stroke Dr. Lee, a graduate of Johns Hopkins University who is fluent in Cantonese and has made three trips to China, told of a victim of a stroke. Until the patient recovered, he wrote all his Chinese characters upside down, displaying what appeared to be a previously unrecognized form of temporary brain damage. ''We can learn much'' from collaboration, Dr. Lee said in an interview. He said he was particularly impressed by integration of the elderly into Chinese communal life. ''They make wonderful baby sitters for their grandchildren,'' he said. Further, although there are many blind people in China, Dr. Lee said he saw no guide dogs. But the Chinese are so solicitous toward the blind, he added, that their mobility seems comparable to that of people with dogs. Treating the Whole Man Dr. Rusk said that on his trip to China earlier this year he was delighted to find the Chinese approach to rehabilitation much like his own. ''You have to treat the whole man,'' he said, referring to the practice of attention to the emotional as well as the physical problems of the patient. Dr. Rusk went to China as the leader of a delegation from the World Rehabilitation Fund, of which he is chairman. The Chinese are publishing a translation of a book by Dr. Rusk on rehabilitation. The fund, which has provided support for programs in 149 countries, is the main host to the Chinese specialists.

1062-> CRIME ISSUE CITED AS FACTOR IN STRONG LEHRMAN SHOWING
Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, in winning election as the 52d Governor of New York, was aided by unemployment and the other economic issues that helped many Democrats Tuesday, politicians and consultants on both sides agreed yesterday. But, what loomed as a substantial victory was reduced, they said, by the re-emergence of the crime issue in the final week of the campaign and by an unprecedented barrage of television advertising and mailings by his millionaire opponent, Lewis E. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative candidate. Following the electoral pattern of Governor Carey, Mr. Cuomo, the Democrat-Liberal, rolled up usual Democratic majorities in New York City and ran nearly even in the normally Republican suburbs, which countered Mr. Lehrman's strong run upstate. ''Mario is the populist who appeals to the traditional coalition of liberals, labor and minorities but adds to that his appeal to Italian Americans and other Catholics who have tended to move toward the Republican Party, '' said Raymond B. Harding, the Liberal Party leader and a top Cuomo adviser. Voters 'Zeroed In' ''The crime issue kept on creeping up,'' said Stanley Friedman, the Democratic leader of the Bronx, where crime is an acute problem. ''The voters finally zeroed in on the death penalty and crime,'' said State Senator Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Nassau County. ''Crime has to have cut very heavily,'' said another Republican, Senator Roy M. Goodman, who is the Manhattan Republican chairman. The 50-year-old Mr. Cuomo, who won by 165,000 votes, will be the first Italian American Governor of the state and the first from Queens. His Lieutenant Governor, County Executive Alfred B. DelBello of Westchester, is also an Italian American. There were also significant developments in the election, which for the most part confirmed the present party division in both the executive and legislative branches of state government. They were these: - Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Attorney General Robert Abrams achieved sweeping victories in all areas of the state, with 65 percent of the vote and pluralities of about 1.4 million votes each. They ran far ahead of Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Abrams won all but six of the 62 counties, Mr. Moynihan all but 16. - Mr. DelBello apparently strengthened the showing of Mr. Cuomo, who won normally Republican Westchester County - something Governor Carey could not do even when he won the state by 808,936 votes in 1974. - State Comptroller Edward V. Regan polled 57 percent of the vote and won all but four New York City boroughs for a total plurality of about 825,000. He remains the only Republican elected state official. - Assemblywoman Florence M. Sullivan, the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life candidate for Senator, and Frances A. Sclafani, the Republican candidate for Attorney General, were the victims of the Moynihan and Abrams landslides. Both were hurt by serious fundraising problems and a lack of statewide recognition. The Liberal Party, which had endorsed Mr. Cuomo, moved back into fourth place on the ballot, a position that is determined by its balloting in the gubernatorial election. But, it polled only half the votes of the Conservative Party, which had supported Mr. Lehrman. The Liberals also achieved a local victory when three Democrats and two Liberals were elected to the State Supreme Court in Manhattan on the Liberal line. Democrats had no line because of a problems with their election filings. Mr. Cuomo won all boroughs of New York City and and two other counties, Westchester and Albany. He just lost normally Democratic Erie County, where there is a 12.5 percent unemployment rate. While Mr. Cuomo ran well in the city, he trailed far behind Mr. Moynihan and Mr. Abrams. They won liberal West Side districts by up to a 9-to-1 margin, while Mr. Cuomo won by at best 5 to 1. In Jewish districts in Brooklyn, Bronx and Queens, they won by up to 5 to 1, compared with Mr. Cuomo's 2 to 1 margins; and even in Italian districts, they won by 3 to 1, compared with Mr. Cuomo's 2 to 1. Low Turnout for Minorities Black and Hispanic districts rolled up overwhelming pluralities as high as 10 to 1 for all three Democrats, but the turnout in those districts was very low, often from one-half to one-sixth of the vote in white districts. The Right To Life candidate for Governor, Robert Bohner, polled barely 50,000 votes to keep his party as an official state party. Four years ago, the anti-abortion movement had qualified as a party and outpolled the Liberals by winning 130,000 votes. Mr. Lehrman who was supported by a Right to Life Political Action Committee dug into Mr. Bohner's totals. Two other of the Right to Life Party's statewide candidates ran considerably ahead of the top of their ticket. The turnout was not as heavy as had been predicted. At just over five million, it was slightly higher than the last gubernatorial election in 1978 and nearly 500,000 lower than 1974. Low turnout in minority districts in the city, which went overwhelmingly for Mr. Cuomo, was another factor in the closeness of the race. Mr. Lehrman's strong showing was seen as likely to reinforce his efforts to remain active in the New York G.O.P. It also tends to reinforce the conservative tilt of the Republican Party. ''It was in a sense a victory for the right wing,'' said Richard C. Wade, a historian. Timothy Russert, who managed Senator Moynihan's landslide victory, was one of several politicians who mentioned the impact of a blizzard of at least eight million pieces of Lehrman literature that blanketed the state in the last two weeks. ''I firmly believe that direct mail had an enormous impact,'' he said. The huge Lehrman radio and television effort of at least $850,000 in the last week was cited by Mr. Cuomo's media adviser, Harvey Cohen. ''I've never seen a barrage like that; they were buying up everything in sight,'' Mr. Cohen said. Several politicians noted that this was the first New York campaign in which mailings came close to rivaling television commercials, at least in the final days of the campaign. Forced to make a choice, most candidates opt for television, but the wealthy Mr. Lehrman could do both.

1063-> A TREND TO MORE SERIOUS PRESCHOOL SUBJECTS; BY SUE MITTENTHAL
Sue Mittenthal frequently writes on issues that affect children. AT first glance the kindergarten room in the New York City private school appears unremarkable: the customary building blocks, a colorful spectrum of clays and paints, collections of autumn leaves and racks of books for story hour. But closer inspection reveals an array of materials traditionally alien to a class for 4- and 5-yearolds: sets of alphabet letters for group phonics lessons, lined notebooks for writing practice, picture cards and charts displaying words and sentences, and mathematical games to teach the principles of the number system. While a wide variety of preschool programs still exists, the 1980's may see more and more kindergartners poring over readers, workbooks and ditto sheets. Pressure to cover academic subjects so early, most kindergarten teachers agree, is coming from anxious parents. Parental insistence on pre-first-grade reading programs may stem in part from general mistrust of educational institutions. ''The schools are always being criticized in the press for the low scores and the failures and the illiteracy,'' said Dolores Durkin, professor of elementary and early-childhood education at the University of Illinois. ''Naturally, parents get concerned.'' And they are ambitious for their children. Said Janet F. Brown, director of publications at the National Association for the Education of Young Children, a professional organization of preschool teachers based in Washington: ''I think there's a lot of pressure to get into the 'right' schools and the 'right' colleges to earn the 'right' salaries later on.'' The stress on early reading has filtered down from the private to the public schools. ''Private schools want to sell their programs so they say, 'Send your child to my school and we'll give him more enrichment,' '' explained Penny Denton, a kindergarten teacher at Public School 205 in Queens. ''Then one parent says to another, 'My child is going to a private school, and lo and behold, he's starting to read.' The next thing you know, the parents of public-school children are telling the supervisors, 'This is what we want too.' And the public schools, feeling a responsibility to show the public that they are good, sometimes do things to please the parents that they aren't quite sure they would do otherwise.'' While some teachers support this shift in kindergarten curriculum, many fear that the urgency with which it is being carried out may not be in the best interests of their charges. ''Kindergarten isn't fun anymore,'' said a Westchester public-school teacher who requested anonymity. ''We have to put in so many minutes per week on math, reading, science, social studies, nutrition and human relations. When you figured it all out, the fun things - like art activities, role playing, relaxing and talking as a group - had to go out the window. And I don't think the kids came out at the end of the year any better than they would have if these subjects had been introduced in a more relaxed way.'' Mrs. Denton has managed a compromise by keeping readers and workbooks out of her classroom and by substituting individual instruction for formal reading and mathematics lessons. ''Most of us have found that kindergarten children, if they're going to do letters and sounds, really prefer to do it as a game,'' she said. ''The minute you put them into a formal situation, it becomes very threatening, competitive and frightening. We know it can make children very unhappy. It's no longer a kindergarten program plus some reading; it becomes an early first grade with the absence of all the important aspects of kindergarten. That's the danger.'' Another concern, according to the private-school teacher whose classroom was described at the outset, is backlash: Children who are pushed too soon may turn against reading. She recalled a mother who, during a visit before the school year, ''frantically demanded that I reassure her that her 5-year-old daughter would learn to read in my class.'' She believes that it is no coincidence that the girl, whom she described as bright and creative, is now resistant to words. ''I had each child make their own book, where they drew the pictures and dictated the words to me,'' the teacher related. ''She was the only one in the class who refused to have words in her book. Under these circumstances I felt pressured to coax her for several days in a row. Finally, as a concession to me, she said, 'All right.' But there was no creativity involved. It was all labels and lists.'' The possibility of backlash is a real one, cautioned Professor Durkin, who has been studying preschool readers for 24 years. ''If a child isn't interested in reading and you persist in instructing him,'' she explained, ''he's going to develop negative attitudes toward reading in particular and school in general, and there's nothing more difficult to eradicate.'' If approached correctly, a preschool reading program can be successful. In studies conducted in 1958 and 1961, Professor Durkin followed groups of children in California and New York who had learned to read at home before entering school. She found that even several years later the groups in each study remained ahead of their peers when it came to reading. But, she stressed, their parents did not act like teachers. ''First, in all of these homes one or both parents were avid readers, so the child had a model,'' she said. ''Second, all the children were read to from a very early age and it was done in an enjoyable way - not as a school-like activity. And third, in all of these families there was a lot of parent-child conversation. The children were eased into reading.'' Similarly, she believes, kindergarten teachers can introduce reading and spelling in ways that are fun. She insisted on two requisites: that they use a variety of teaching methods, since different children will respond to different approaches, and that they work with small groups. She added: ''And they must remember that kindergarten should never be viewed as a place where everybody learns to read, because not all 5-year-olds are ready.'' Educators agree that most children will learn to read without pressure when the time is right, and they wish parents understood that. ''The hysteria over preschool reading is so excessive,'' said the New York City private-school teacher. ''Things simmer and cook and they do fall into place, the same way a child learns to walk and speak. It's a matter of having faith in what's natural.''

1066-> DEFENSE THAWARTS CARDS
''If you had told me before the game that we'd get 15 hits,'' Darrell Porter said after the game, ''then I'd have told you that we were going to win.'' But the St. Louis Cardinals didn't win today. One day after they lost to the Milwaukee Brewers' bats, they lost to the Brewers' gloves, and suddenly found themselves one game from losing the World Series. ''They made one great play after another, that's why our 15 hits didn't win,'' Porter said. ''In the dugout, nobody was saying a heck of a lot, except: 'Dang, they did it again.' ''And when they were hitting, every time we made a mistake to the plate, the Brewers took advantage of it. That's the kind of hitters they are, too. You better not make too many mistakes. They'll be hacking and slashing at you.'' Only 4 of 18 Runners Score In a little more than 24 hours, the World Series had turned hostile to the Cardinals. They were leading by 5-1 in the seventh inning Saturday, needing only eight outs to take a lead of three games to one. But the Brewers exploded with six runs in the seventh and beat them, 7-5. Then the Cardinals put 18 men on base today but only four scored, and they lost again, 6-4. ''You read all about their hitting,'' said Keith Hernandez, ''but they played great defense today. That's why they're here. They're a bunch of gamers. Now they've got us against the wall. We just have to win, or we pack up and go home for the winter.'' Hernandez symbolized the long and short of it for the Cardinals. He is a former batting champion who went 0 for 15 in the first four games. Then he reached base five times today on three hits, a walk and a fielder's choice. But he scored only once. The Cardinals hit in eight of the nine innings and got somebody on base in all nine. They even got 14 hits off Mike Caldwell, who had dazzled them with a three-hit shutout in the opening game. But with all that traffic, they were stopped repeatedly by diving, tumbling, throwing men with gloves. The Clutch Defensive Plays Hernandez knows a good play when he sees it. For four consecutive years, he has been voted the Gold Glove as the premier defensive first baseman in the National League. With admiration and regret, he ticked off the clutch plays turned by the Brewers on this cold and windy day: In the first inning, Lonnie Smith stole second base, but was thrown out trying to steal third. In the third, Ozzie Smith banked a line drive off Caldwell's glove, but Jim Gantner snapped up the ball and threw him out. In the fourth, with two men on base, Paul Molitor grabbed Ozzie Smith's slam near third base and started a double play. In the fifth, Lonnie Smith led off with a line drive to right field, but Charlie Moore made a diving one-handed catch. In the seventh, Porter smashed one wide of first base, but Cecil Cooper made a sprawling stop and threw him out from the full sitting position. He got superior help from Caldwell, who sprinted over to cover the bag. And in the ninth, Lonnie Smith opened with a teasing grounder to the left side, but Molitor grabbed it on the run, turned a full circle on the grass and gunned him down at first. ''That defense doesn't surprise me one bit,'' said Whitey Herzog, manager of the Cardinals, who saw the Brewers frequently when he was managing in the American League for seven years. ''I know this team. I've seen their infield before. They made four or five important plays that kept us from getting anything going.'' Nothing Was Artificial Herzog was asked if the Brewers could have made such exceptional plays on the fast artificial turf in St. Louis, and replied: ''We weren't playing on turf, so we can't cry about that.'' He was asked if the Brewers had been unusually inspired by their roaring partisans in the crowd of 56,562, and he replied: ''The fans didn't get any hits off us.'' But the Brewers got plenty of hits by themselves. Six of their players ended the day batting over .300 for the Series. And Robin Yount got four hits in four times at bat for a total of 11 in 21 times at bat in the Series, putting him at .524. They even jolted Bruce Sutter with three hits and two runs in the eighth inning, after Herzog had called on his bullpen ace to contain the Brewers. Lead Widened Against Sutter That didn't work, either. The Brewers, leading by 4-2 at the time, promptly fattened their lead to 6-2 off Sutter's split-fingered fastball. And that was enough to compensate for the two runs scored by the Cardinals in the top of the ninth. ''Sutter's just a human being,'' Herzog said. ''He's not going to get them out every time. I wanted him to keep us close. But he gave up two runs, so what can you say?'' ''I made some good pitches and I made some bad pitches,'' Sutter said. ''More bad ones. I threw my best pitch, but the ball didn't move all the time. And they hit me. There's nothing I can do about it. I was trying to hold them, which I didn't.'' Bob Forsch, who pitched the first seven innings and lost for the second time in the Series, summed it up for the Cardinals: ''We had our opportunities.'' ''We could have hung our heads and died out there,'' Forsch added. ''But we got two runs in the ninth. We don't die. We're going home, and we've won two games in a row a lot of times this year.'' Herzog said that the two cosnecutive losses would not change his pitching rotation. John Stuper will start the sixth game Tuesday night and Joaquin Andujar, bruised knee and all, would start the seventh Wednesday night. ''If we're fortunate enough,'' he said, ''to go to the seventh game.''

1067-> NETS HOLD OFF WARRIORS; KNICKS BEATEN
The Knicks, the lowest-scoring team in the National Basketball Association, failed to match their season average of 94 points last night in losing to the Indiana Pacers, 94-90, at Madison Square Garden. They scored only 39 points in the second half, a performance that drew boos from a crowd of 7,845. After building an 11-point advantage midway in the third quarter, the Knicks were outscored, 15-4. With the score 72-72, they made only three field goals in 9 minutes 45 seconds as the Pacers took command and sent them to their third straight defeat and 10th in 13 games. ''Anytime you're out on the break 40 times and only score 18 points, that's a major disappointment,'' said Coach Hubie Brown. ''Two things that really hurt us, were, No.1, our horrendous shot selection, and No.2, the turnovers on the open floor.'' The Knicks started as if all their offensive problems were behind them. In making their first five shots, they jumped to a 16-4 advantage, forcing Jack McKinney, the Pacer coach, to call two timeouts. But although the Knicks enjoyed several double-figure leads, their attack started to show signs of wear and tear by halftime. The collapse began after they took a 68-57 lead with 5:35 remaining in the third period. Then George Johnson, the former St. John's star, led a 15-2 burst that gave the Pacers a 72-70 lead, their first of the game. Two free throws by Ed Sherod tied the score, 74-74, at the end of the period. The Knicks stayed even to 80-80, but then Indiana scored 7 points in a row, and the Knicks never caught up. Johnson had a total of 21 points, getting 15 of them, plus seven rebounds, in the third quarter. ''Some of the things I do show up in the box score and some don't,'' he said afterward. ''We needed points in the third period and I went out to get them. The talent is so good in the N.B.A. that they can take the easy baskets away from you, but they can't stop you when you are in your rhythm, and at that point I was in my rhythm.'' The Knicks had 12 turnovers in the first half and eight in the third quarter. Some were forced by a Pacer defense that went from bad to good. ''We haven't been playing much defense,'' said McKinney, ''especially in our last game against Milwaukee. They just blitzed us. The way we played defense the first three minutes tonight, it looked like an automatic layup drill. I called the timeouts and asked what the heck was going on. I thought it was important to do that before the game got out of hand.'' The Pacer defense, pressuring the outside shooters, bothered the Knicks in much the same way New York's presses and traps bothered Indiana in the first half. ''They were driving us bats,'' said Billy Knight, who also scored 21 points for Indiana. ''They were doing it at the craziest times. They are a great defensive team, and if they ever coordinate it with their offense, they're going to be tough to beat.'' Offensively this season, the Knicks have scored 100 or more points in only four of their 13 games, 10 of them defeats. Defensively, they have held opponents under 100 points in eight games. The Knicks were able to get within 91-90 with 13 seconds to play last night. But Sherod was forced to foul Jerry Sichting, and the Pacer guard hit the two free throws. During the timeout with 11 seconds remaining, Brown sent Trent Tucker, the Knicks' first-round draft choice, into the game, and he attempted a 3-point basket. The shot was deflected and fell short. But the plan was not to take the 3-point shot, but for the Knicks to try for another quick basket inside and then work their trap or foul again. ''We had 27 turnovers and that's a lot,'' said Paul Westphal, who finished with 18 points, 1 less than Bernard King. ''When you lose to Boston and Milwaukee, you say you're not over the hump yet. But tonight was a game we should have won and needed to win.''

BAD BLOOD. A Family Murder in Marin County. By Richard M. Levine. 330 pages. Random House. $14.95. WE begin just after the climax. A moment or so after Jim and Naomi Olive have been murdered in a bedroom of their suburban ranch house by their 16-year-old daughter, Marlene, or her 20-year-old boyfriend, Chuck Riley, or by the two of them together, Richard M. Levine's true-crime narrative commences to flow. With the eye for detail and the sense of action of a practiced storyteller, Mr. Levine zooms in on Chuck and Marlene as they desperately try to clean up all the blood they have spilled on a summer Saturday morning in 1975, at 353 Hibiscus Way, Terra Linda, Marin County, California. For one sample of the details out of which this reconstruction of the ''Barbecue Murders'' - as this case came to be known - is pieced together: ''An oil painting of Marlene as a child that hung directly above'' Naomi Olive's bed was ''spotted with blood.'' From a brief history of this painting and the photograph from which it was copied, we learn something of Marlene's doll-like childhood and the Olives's pampering view of it. As the full-grown Marlene studies the blood-spattered painting ''with a look of great annoyance,'' we see how she has grown and coarsened both in looks and behavior. ''Curse that bitch!'' she says aloud. ''Getting her blood all over my picture.'' To say the very least, we want to know more about these people. Unfortunately, a graph line drawn to represent the intensity of the drama from this point on would slope gently down or, at very best, be flat. Despite the richness of its detail and the remarkable intimacy with which we get to know its characters, two basic problems remain in the telling of ''Bad Blood: A Family Murder in Marin County.'' For one thing, what happened to the Olive family is finally not representative of what went wrong with middle-class life in the American suburbs in the 1970's. Mr. Levine may have intended ''specificity'' to ''imply a larger picture, in the way that a faithful rendering of the giant's toes would indicate his stature.'' But it is difficult to see what is so ''quintessentially American'' about a mentally derailed mother living in alcoholic isolation, a failed Babbit of a father out of touch with his feelings or his sense of competence, and an adopted daughter being driven mad both by her mother's infantile jealousy and her father's unconscious seductiveness. It may well be that the rootlessness of California suburban life served to expose and aggravate the Olive family's problems. But what really went wrong in this case does not seem representative of an era's generational conflict or a class's downward mobility. To the degree that the Olives were ''a nuclear family set for explosion,'' they might have exploded eventually under any cultural circumstances. Even as a psychological close-up, something is missing in this portrait. It is simply incomprehensible where Chuck Riley would have found the rage to kill Naomi Olive in the manner he is supposed to have done. Sure, he was exhausted, strung out on a veritable pharmacopia of drugs, and psychologically in thrall to his bewitching girlfriend's murderous fantasies. But to bury a hammer in a woman's skull demands a depth and a kind of rage that simply is not evident in Chuck's rather detailed psychological profile. Of course, the author never really searches for a source of that rage, such as something in the background of Chuck Riley's upbringing. And the reason for this omission may well be the author's belief that Chuck did not bludgeon Marlene's mother with the hammer, but rather that Marlene herself, who certainly possessed the necessary rage, struck the blow. Certainly Mr. Levine presents a powerful case against Chuck's having murdered Naomi, mainly by giving strong credence to what Chuck revealed while under states of hypnosis induced by some of this still-dubious profession's most competent practitioners. But the jury in his trial didn't believe him. And Mr. Levine doesn't express particular dissatisfaction with that jury's verdict. So ''Bad Blood'' is evidently not meant to dramatize a miscarriage of justice. That the book is neither outraged at injustice nor indicative of some giant's stature leaves the reader at a loss for a sense of ultimate direction. One wanders aimlessly as the author paints in the remaining details of his story. These continue to be impressive in their richness and variety. But their focus seems to lie outside of the borders of his canvas.

1070-> ALASKA WILDS CALL GOVERNOR AS HE RETIRES
When Barbara Carey of Florida's Dade County suggested recently that Alaska pay the cost of a new Orange Bowl in Miami, she got a reply from Gov. Jay S. Hammond of Alaska. '' 'We know you Alaskans are rolling in wealth' is a statement heard often these days - from those with a plan for ripping us off to further some cause or pet craze,'' Governor Hammond said. He also wrote the woman a tortured rhyme in which he explained that Alaska, despite its oil wealth, had pressing needs of its own and that it did not have the money to build Dade County a new stadium. The 60-year-old Governor has penned scores of poems in his eight years in office, poking fun at lawmakers, noting birthdays and responding to critics. The former bush pilot, trapper, wolf hunter, commercial fisherman and hunting guide retires Monday, barred by law from serving a third term, Appears Ready to Retire That seems to be fine with Governor Hammond, who describes himself as a ''bush rat more at home with my gum boots in bilge water'' than in the state capital. The Republican will be succeeded by a Democrat, Bill Sheffield, a millionaire who owns a hotel chain in Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Govenor Hammond says he and his wife, Bella, will retire to their homestead in the remote Lake Clark area northeast of Bristol Bay to ''repair the tattered remnants'' of his bush flying service. After 34 years in government, as a mayor, legislator and Governor, Mr. Hammond concedes: ''I guess there's no escaping the fact that I've spent most of my life as a bureaucrat. I certainly had no aspirations to join up with those rascals.'' Influenced by a Texas friend's tales of Alaska, Governor Hammond, who was reared in Vermont, bought a 1929-vintage Loening Keystone amphibious plane and flew to Alaska in 1946. ''I really wasn't some wild-eyed kid seeking my fortune as so many are who come up here,'' he recalls. Lifts Weights as Therapy The former Marine fighter pilot, who lifts weights regularly as therapy for a back injury suffered in a crash landing in World War II, has the physique of a weight lifter. His voice, compared to an ''untamed, rushing Alaskan river'' by one former state lawmaker, fills a room. When he became Governor in 1974, construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was just beginning. The giant state's sparse population was swelling with newcomers and it was confronted with enormous service needs as it waited for a wave of oil wealth. ''We were not rich then,'' the Governor said. ''We had the resources, but we didn't have the money.'' Business interests and environmentalists were locked in debate over how to develop the state's riches: petroleum, fish, timber and minerals. Governor Hammond believes he succeeded in balancing those interests, a contention that is not shared by some on either side of the issue. ''I attempted to screen healthy growth from unhealthy growth,'' he said. ''I was in the middle. I had more empathy with the environmentalists, but knew there would be decisions they would be affronted by.'' Governor Hammond leaves a bureaucracy that has grown along with oil revenue. The state operating budget alone rose in his tenure by 18.4 percent annually. He concedes that government growth is out of control, but he is proud of his leadership role for a spending limit approved by voters in November. Popular With Voters Many, including the long-time State Senator Bill Ray, say that Governor Hammond was ''a man of vision.'' But they assert he often paid scant attention to day-to-day government, allowing it to grow, sometimes without direction. He still enjoys considerable popularity among voters, 40 percent of whom rated his performance as ''good'' in a recent poll. Mr. Hammond, who is Alaska's fourth Governor since statehood came in 1959, says he wants to be remembered for championing the creation of legislation that sets aside at least 25 percent of the state's resource wealth. The Alaska Permanent Fund, established in 1977, currently contains about $3.5 billion to help pay Alaska's way when petroleum wealth is depleted. Some of that money was used this year to give residents $1,000 checks. The $400 million program is under attack by many as wasteful, but Governor Hammond defends it as a way to share the wealth rather than use it to fuel more bureaucracy.

1071-> ART DEALER CONVICTED OF TAMPERING IN ROTHKO SUIT
Frank Lloyd, the owner of the Marlborough Gallery and one of the world's best known art dealers, was convicted yesterday on charges of tampering with evidence in connection with a lawsuit against him, his gallery and the executors of the estate of Mark Rothko, the painter. Mr. Lloyd, a 71-year-old British citizen, was convicted by a jury of three men and nine women in State Supreme Court in Manhattan after deliberations of 13 hours over two days. Mr. Lloyd's attorney, Irving S. Younger, said he planned to appeal the verdict. Mr. Lloyd was indicted in 1977 on a charge that he altered a gallery stock book containing the buying and selling prices of Mr. Rothko's works. The conviction of Mr. Lloyd concluded the last trial in the long and complex litigation involving the estate of Mr. Rothko, an abstract expressionist who saw the world outside his studio, on East 69th Street, as materialistic and corrupt. As a result he hoarded his paintings. At the time of his suicide on Feb. 25, 1970, Mr. Rothko, who was 67 years old, retained possession of 798 of his works. The legal proceedings involving Mr. Lloyd, which were closely watched by art dealers and collectors and which became one of the most complex in the history of modern art, began nearly 11 years ago, less than two years after the artist's death. Lawsuit Charged Conspiracy On Nov. 23, 1971, a suit was filed on behalf of Mr. Rothko's daughter, Kate, accusing Mr. Lloyd and the executors of Mr. Rothko's estate of conspiracy and a conflict of interest in selling and consigning 798 of the painter's works. Mr. Lloyd, the suit said, obtained the paintings for much less than their true value and under terms that were highly disadvantageous to the estate. The suit, which was joined by the guardian of Kate's brother, Christopher, sought to cancel a contract by which the gallery had obtained 100 paintings for $1.8 million payable in 12 years without interest, and a consignment of 698 other works for 12 years at a commission of 40 percent to 50 percent. The executors - Bernard J. Reis, an accountant and former officer of the gallery; Theodore Stamos, a painter and a client of the gallery, and Morton Levine, a professor of anthropology -had been close friends of Mr. Rothko. During the trial of the lawsuit, a lawyer for Miss Rothko showed conflicting entries on invoices and in the Manhattan gallery's stock book, shipping orders and foreign-bank credits. Mr. Lloyd contended the conflicting entries were typographical errors. Contract Canceled by Court After an eight-month trial, Surrogate Millard L. Midonick of Manhattan ruled in 1975 that the executors had acted with conflict of interest or negligently and imposed damages and fines totaling $9,252,000 against the executors, Mr. Lloyd and his gallery. The surrogate also canceled the contract and directed the gallery to return to the estate any unsold paintings that Mr. Lloyd could retrieve. The New York State Court of Appeals, calling the conduct of the executors ''manifestly wrongful and indeed shocking,'' unanimously upheld the lower-court decision in 1977. Later that year, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan announced that a grand jury had returned an indictment against Mr. Lloyd for tampering with evidence presented during the trial. He was charged with altering the stock book in which the gallery recorded the history, including the buying and selling price of each of the paintings in its inventory. But Mr. Lloyd, who has a house in the Bahamas and who was outside the country when the indictment was announced, did not return to the United States for four years. He surrendered to the New York County District Attorney last Jan. 11. Judge Herbert I. Altman set sentencing for Jan. 6 and said he would also announce his decision on three defense motions that, if granted, would overturn the verdict at that time. Mr. Lloyd, who could be sentenced to four years in prison on each of the three counts in the indictment, remained free on a $1 million personal-recognizance bond.

1073-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Patera Trial Starts
A member of the Washington State Patrol has testified in Mercer Island (Wash.) District Court that Jack Patera, head coach of the Seattle Seahawks at the time, was ''obviously impaired and unfit to drive a motor vehicle safely on the highway'' when he was stopped near his home in the early morning hours of Sunday, Sept. 12. Trooper John Bruun, testifying on the second day of Patera's trial on charges of driving while intoxicated, said he observed Patera's Buick running over lane dividers while weaving and moving erratically. He said that when Patera emerged from the car, the trooper smelled ''a strong odor of intoxicants'' on the coach. Patera, who was dismissed by the Seahawks Oct. 13, has pleaded not guilty and is expected to testify. Sept. 12 was the opening day of the regular season.

1075-> PRISON FOOD: NOT FANCY, BUT -
TRENTON EVEN though the meals are similar to those consumed by many average American families, the food in some of New Jersey's prisons and jails is prepared differently. For inmates in the state's correctional facilities, a typical breakfast menu consists of cereal, toast, jam, jelly, doughnuts, coffee and fruit. Lunch may be spaghetti with meatballs, salad with dressing, bread or rolls, brownies and milk. And the dinner menu may show meat loaf with mushroom gravy, Spanish rice, buttered collard greens, bread and butter, jelly and milk. ''People tend to think that the foods served are grotesque,'' said Gerald J. Girard, food superintendent for the state's correctional facilities, ''but they are just as good and nutritious as those that many American families eat.'' In four prisons and jails - the Mercer County Jail and the State Prison in Trenton, the Youth Correctional Institution in Annandale and the Correctional Institution for Women in Clinton - meals are prepared ''regethermically,'' a cook-chill system. Under that system, food for a seven-day week is cooked within a 40-hour, five-day week. What is not used immediately is blast-chilled to approximately 45 degrees in an insulated 250-cubic-foot steel cabinet. After blast-chilling, the food is deposited in a food bank, where it is kept at 36 degrees, usually no longer than four days, although it can stay as long as seven. It is withdrawn about 90 minutes before serving, and is reheated to the proper eating temperature in an infrared oven, a process that takes about 20 to 30 minutes. The central kitchen on the basement level of the Mercer County Jail is typical of where the regethermic system is used. It is the only central kitchen for the state's correctional facilities. Utensils, pots, pans and sinks are all oversized, trays are stacked in overhead racks and spoons and colanders hang from the ceiling. There are two regethermic ovens, each with a capacity for 16 fullsized pans (each pan holds enough food for 20 people). A chiller, which stands across from the ovens, can accommodate 10 full pans. And the food bank, about 10 feet behind the chiller, can hold about 55 racks, or 2,000 pans. Those correctional facilities that rely on the Mercer County Jail's central kitchen - for example, Annandale may run out of beef stew - get their supply via insulated regethermic carts that are transported in trucks. The carts can keep food at eating temperature for three hours, regardless of the outside temperature. Jails and prisons can order as much as four days' food, which they store and rethermalize in smaller regethermic appliances. These are about half the size of those in the central kitchen. ''A regethermic kitchen is ideal when you have a mass feeding process,'' said Dan Abramovitz, president of Integrated Systems International Inc. of Philadelphia, which manufactures the kitchen equipment. ''You can gauge the amount of food you need and withdraw that for consumption. Nothing is wasted.'' Mr. Abramovitz said that blast-chilling conserved the nutritional value of foods. Regethermic food preparation was begun in European hospitals about 17 years ago, Mr. Abramovitz said, adding that it was fairly new in this country and was catching on gradually in hospitals. New Jersey correctional institutions, he said, are the first nonhospital facilities in the country to have adopted the concept. ''Our kitchen made the transition to regethermic early last January,'' said Robert Purnetti, budget director for the Mercer County Jail. ''Since that time, we have saved money because our stocks are now purchased in mass quantity.'' The initial cost of installing the kitchen and its support equipment was about $178,500, he said. Mr. Girard, who shares Mr. Purnetti's views, said that mass purchasing, in addition to simplifying the buying of food, also lessened inventory work. ''Because we can gauge our consumption needs, we are able to determine what we will need ahead of time,'' he said. The regethermic kitchen, Mr. Girard said, permitted a reduction of 72 man-hours a week in the kitchen. ''Before, a seven-day week in the kitchen would consist of 112 hours,'' he said. ''There would be two shifts -one from 5 A.M. to 6 P.M. and the other from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. Now, with a five-day week, we only need eight hours per day to prepare meals.'' Kitchen workers include both inmates and civilians. Even with a regethermic kitchen, some foods, such as dietary meals, gravy and bread, must be prepared just before mealtime. Mr. Girard foresees a growth in the use of regethermic preparation in other institutions that feed large numbers. ''The presence of a regethermic kitchen has allowed us to cut our expenses by about 15 percent,'' he said. ''Besides that, we are able to produce more in a shorter period of time without diluting the quality or taste of foods. ''Inmates and staff members who eat from the regethermic kitchen have not complained about the food. And I myself do not detect any difference in taste between meals prepared through the regethermic system or through a conventional system.'' ''We have occasional complaints about the menu,'' he added. ''It's a part of human nature.''

1076-> JERSEY REVIEWING ITS COMMUTER TAX
The New Jersey Supreme Court is reviewing a tax on New Yorkers commuting to work in New Jersey, who contributed $82.9 million to the state's coffers last year. The court heard oral arguments this week in the case pressed by three of the approximately 100,000 commuters who travel against the flow of New Jersey's normal rush-hour traffic. The three commuters contend that the 21-year-old tax is illegal because it is levied on New York residents and no one else. New Jersey and Pennsylvania have cross-taxing agreements that are not being disputed. ''This case is about discrimination, and because of the Constitution, it must be justified,'' Max Gitter, the commuters' lawyer, said in arguments before the seven-member court. The justices did not set a date for issuing their decision. Legality of Tax Defended G. Michael Cole, an assistant attorney general, said the emergency transportation tax was legal because New Jersey has a right to make New Yorkers pay for the benefits they get from New Jersey's roads, buses and trains. Eliminating the tax would cost the state from $40 million to $45 million a year, he said. Mr. Gitter countered that New York residents contribute ''more through the gasoline tax than the amount of benefits they get.'' ''It is undisputed,'' he said, ''that New York residents pay far more in this tax than the burden on the transportation system.'' How Tax Works Under the tax law, New Yorkers pay to New Jersey an amount equal to what would be their New York State income tax, which they do not pay because they work in New Jersey. Of that money, New Jersey puts the amount equal to what would be the New Jersey state income tax into a program offering property tax rebates. The rest is earmarked for transportation funds. ''We want the statute declared unconstitutional,'' Mr. Gitter said on behalf of his clients, John Salorio of Port Washington, Robert Coe of White Plains and John McGarr of Rye. But Mr. Cole said that ''the ultimate issue is whether New Jersey has made an effort to fairly allocate the cost of government.'' 'Charging Them for Use' ''Courts have held that equal benefits are not the measure,'' he said, rebutting an argument that New Jersey residents receive more benefits from New Yorkers' money than commuters making the reverse trip do. Noting that the transportation system ''was largely in place'' before the tax was imposed, he said: ''New Jersey paid for it. What we're charging them for is use and maintenance.'' The case reached the State Supreme Court in 1980 and was sent to a lower court for hearings on the constitutionality issue. In October 1981, a Superior Court judge, James J. Petrella, ruled that the New York residents must continue paying the levy because the tax burden ''is substantially commensurate with the benefits they derive from New Jersey's transportation facilities.''

1077-> NEW YORK; ERA OF THE NEW SADISM; What with the Tylenol-cyanide madness and the spiking of Halloween candy with common pins, I got to thinking about why this rise in sadism was taking place.
I know sadism isn't as important as, say, the DeLorean scandal, but the Feds have already cracked that case, and I wanted to be the first to unravel the cause of this new social disease. Is it the unemployment rate - too many people with too much time on their hands who had taken to passing their days dipping lollipops in strychnine or stuffing peanut butter cups with broken glass? I had to rule that out because the polls show that the jobless are buying liver and lima beans and can't afford peanut butter cups. Could it be the Russians? No, I reasoned, all their poison gas is tied up in Afghanistan. The breakdown in the nuclear family? Maybe, but there are just so many evils you can blame on that. I gave it two whole hours of analysis before the light went on. It's politics. That's what it is. Combined with the anti-kid revolution. People won't admit it publicly, but a lot of them are just plain sore at kids for having a good time while the grown-ups are getting headaches trying to decide what to do with their all-saver's certificates. First the politics. Remember the Era of Good Feeling, from your American history class? That was the name we gave to the Presidency of James Monroe (1817-1825). Those were the real, good old days. The country was prospering because industries were expanding and the West was being settled. But mostly the good feeling came from the fact that something called the Federalist Party had disappeared after the election of 1816 and nearly everyone belonged to the Democratic-Republican Party. True love. We were together then. One country, one party. Halloween was a fun time. They didn't even have Baby Ruth candy bars to stick razor-blade bits into. I'm not yet prepared to advo-cate a return to the oneparty system, but if this mad-bomber sadism gets any worse, we're going to have to do something. If we had some of the Monroe spirit now, Millicent Fenwick and Frank Lautenberg would be going to Halloween parties together, and Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill would be selling apples in comradely fashion on the same street corner. In only 160 years, the Era of Good Feeling has degenerated into the Era of Mean Spirit. Just the other day, Mario Cuomo called Lewis Lehrman a dispenser of ''snake oil.'' Fortunately, snake oil has always been an accepted staple in our political diet, so Mr. Lehrman couldn't sue. Instead he sat down and thought a while and came up with the worst thing he could say about Mr. Cuomo - he said Mr. Cuomo was the ''candidate of some of the most radical left-wing elements'' of the Democratic party. Mr. Lehrman said he was talking in particular about Bella Abzug, whose revolutionary suggestion that women should be given a fair role in our society has so frightened some politicians that they now scare their children to sleep on Halloween night with tales of Abzug rather than Lugosi. But beyond politics, I also think the current nastiness has a lot to do with basic dislike of children. I don't go as far back as the Monroe era, but as recently as the 1940's, adults were still very nice to kids on Halloween night in my town. We even did some things, in our high spirits, that qualified as vandalism - and nonetheless they didn't put curare in our candy corn. We set fire to the tall, dry grass in empty fields (just like the mystic Druids who started Halloween by practicing pyromania on hilltops to frighten away evil spirits) - and when the firemen came, we played hero and helped them stamp out the blaze while joining in their curses of the vanished rowdies who had set it. We pulled down drying laundry from backyard clotheslines and sometimes we cut the clothesline ropes. One Halloween we had just cut a clothesline at a large home when the unsuspecting residents, hearing our noise and thinking we were just a trick-or-treating crowd, opened the front door and called us inside for tollhouse cookies and milk. Guilt overtook us on the second cookie and we confessed. They took it well. We got a lecture, but neither the police nor even our parents were called. The death penalty for cold-blooded clothesline-cutting was not an issue in political campaigns in those days. It all sounds quite foolish now. Yet, in our unexplored subconscious, maybe we were striking out at a dominating adult world. Could it be that this behavior stirred bad blood, that it has festered over the years and that adults are getting their revenge now? I'd hate to think that my friends and I might have contributed in any way to the Era of New Sadism. It's a heavy thought. But I have one comfort. We may have cut clotheslines, but we didn't sell any snake oil. In our town back then, we believed in Democratic-Republicanism.

1078-> Rumanian Economy Lagging Behind Goals of 5-Year Plan
President Nicolae Ceausescu told a Communist Party conference this week that Rumania's economy was growing too slowly to meet the goals of the five-year plan established in 1980. He said the worldwide recession was the cause of Rumania's slow recovery from its economic problems. But Mr. Ceausescu offered the delegates good news about the country's $10 billion foreign debt. He said it would be ''fully liquidated'' by 1990 as a result of an austerity policy sharply curbing imports and increasing exports.

1079-> American Jews and Israel
Mark Helprin's article, ''American Jews and Israel: Seizing a New Opportunity'' (Nov. 7), is flawed by a false premise - that American Jews are offered ''no choice except blind loyalty (to the Begin Government), hostile dissent or silent abstention.'' This is so, he writes, because the middle ground ''has neither sufficient voice nor sufficient public representation.'' In fact, ''the great middle'' is neither uncharted nor silent. It is represented by the 36 national Jewish secular and religious institutions that make up the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. And it is expressed in the consensus held by the conference - a view that, I believe, also speaks for the many American Jews who are not affiliated with any Jewish organization. This consensus may be set forth as follows: Israel cannot return to its indefensible pre-1967 borders; the Palestine Liberation Organization is ruled out as a negotiating partner in the peace process because of its refusal to alter its national covenant, which calls for the liquidation of Israel, and its strategy of terror; Jerusalem must remain a united city under Israeli sovereignty; an independent Palestinian state would be a dagger poised at the heart of Israel. To be sure, there is no consensus on the future of the West Bank, as there is none in Israel. But whatever the final disposition of the territories, it is clear that American Jews believe in at least these minimum principles: Jews have a right to live anywhere in the world; the idea that Jews should be barred from living in Judea and Samaria (the ''West Bank'') is anathema; Israel's settlements in these territories are neither illegal nor in violation of the Camp David peace process; Israel's security depends in large part on a ring of civilian and military outposts in the West Bank to protect the country's narrow waist. I believe these are the views of the overwhelming number of Israelis as well as American Jews. Mr. Helprin closes his article by calling on American Jews to support the Reagan plan on condition that ''the possibility of a real settlement exists and the Arabs are truly forthcoming.'' He insists further that ''the security arrangements concerning Judea and Samaria must be flawless'' and that ''Jerusalem is not expendable under any circumstances.'' But who is to determine whether ''the possibility of a real settlement'' really does exist? Who is to determine if the Arabs truly are ''forthcoming?'' And who will insist that ''Jerusalem is not expendable?'' Only the Government of Israel can makes these decisions, of course, and this brings us back to square one - before we ever get to Mr. Helprin's ambitious if naive plan for American Jews to speak of ''fundamentals'' (whatever they are) to Israel. Mr. Helprin commits the all-too-common error of concluding that democracy isn't working in Jewish life because he doesn't agree with its decisions. There is no basis (nor does he suggest any) for his suspicion that ''the probable positions of American Jews in regard to Israel are far more flexible, interesting and mercurial than those of the organizations that speak in their name.'' Meanwhile, all Jewish organizations will welcome his call for more Jews to become affiliated with the Jewish community. For that he has our appreciation and our thanks. JULIUS BERMAN, Chairman Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, New York City

1080-> HOW TO CATCH THE CARIBBEAN BEAT
The islands of the Caribbean and the Bahamas, those dots and dashes of land running from the coast of Florida to the coast of Venezuela, are bracing for their annual migration of travelers seeking warmth, ocean breezes and crystalline waters. Following is a review of the major islands, with information on sights to see, places to stay and restaurants in various price categories. There are large hotels with nightclubs and casinos, and there are small, quiet guesthouses tucked in the hills. Some restaurants have noted French chefs and tables that must be reserved days in advance. Others offer such local specialties as yams and goat meat, and have no phone. The listings reflect the recommendations of staff members of The New York Times, as well as of others who know the islands well. Unless otherwise specified, hotel rates are for two people in a room without meals; restaurant prices are for one person. Rates are for the peak season, which in most instances begins this week. Offseason rates, usually in effect from April through November, can be as much as 40 percent lower. Prices are given in U.S. dollars and are subject to change due to currency fluctuations or other factors. Although some of the islands are under a single governmental jurisdiction, most of them are more popularly known by their individual names and they will be found in alphabetical order in this compendium. For addresses and phone numbers of hotels and further information on the various islands, contact the tourist offices listed with entry. All phone numbers given are local ones; the area code for the Caribbean is 809. Marion Roach Anguilla ANGUILLA TOURIST INFORMATION OFFICE 25 WEST 39TH STREET, NEW YORK, N.

1082-> PRESIDENTIAL PARADOXES
A majority of voters in 1980 supported the proposition that the United States had to modernize its strategic and conventional forces if we were to avoid having to choose one day between conflict or capitulation. But something happened on the road to redemption. Perhaps it was all the loose talk of firing a nuclear shot across the Soviet bow, confining a nuclear war to European soil, preparing for and surviving a long nuclear conflict, or throwing a shovel full of dirt on an underground shelter for every household in America. Maybe it was a sense of betrayal that we experienced in discovering we had elected a President who was putting into practice the very things he promised as a candidate. Whatever the reason, it is clear that a new consensus evolved during 1982 that said significant defense cuts could and should be made. It was not that the world had become less dangerous, that the Soviet Union was not still butchering innocent people in Afghanistan, that Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was cutting the pressure of his water cannons in Poland, that the skies of Cambodia were not quite so yellow with poison, that the Middle East was any less volatile or Persian Gulf oil more secure. Rather, we concluded that President Reagan's military program was no longer affordable or desirable - that we must reduce our deficits and rebuild our domestic economy before our military capability, and should refuse to build systems that the Soviet Union would see as threatening and destablizing. By noting the radical shift in public opinion within a two-year time span, I do not seek to denigrate the perceptions or wishes of the electorate. Nor do I suggest that the defense budget should be sacrosanct or immune from a surgeon's knife. Defense cuts can be made, although they should not be so substantial as to move us immediately within field-goal range of a balanced budget. The shift in public opinion represents a political phenomenon more deeply rooted than fear or fickleness. It suggests that conservative Republican Presidents (moderates or liberals need not apply) may be able to open doors to China and secure support for arms control treaties yet be unable to sustain a significant or even stable growth in military spending. By contrast, liberal or moderate Democratic Presidents may be able to secure support for strategic and conventional modernization (few questioned the need for the MX, Stealth aircraft, Trident submarine, or a Rapid Deployment Force under Jimmy Carter) but will be less able to obtain ratification of arms control treaties. Ronald Reagan is viewed by many as being overly aggressive in word and deed - too likely to produce war rather than preserve peace. By contrast, if Jimmy Carter had proposed an MX ''dense pack'' or hardened silos reinforced by ballistic-missile defense, he would have stood a better chance of achieving Congressional approval. Mr. Carter was a self-proclaimed peace candidate who wanted to abolish nuclear weapons from the face of the earth. He was a religious man who prayed daily and publicly. Paradoxically, the perception of his weakness in the face of Soviet aggression would have provided the basis of bipartisan Congressional support for arms modernization. With Ronald Reagan, just the opposite appears to be the case - rearmament is seen by an increasing number of people as being unnecessary, unaffordable or dangerous. Shortly before the November elections, the Kremlin revealed that it would welcome a new Congress that would be more moderate in character. It would be logical to conclude that it would also welcome a change in the occupant of the White House in 1984. But Yuri V. Andropov may possess a subtler turn of mind. He may prefer President Reagan to run as a peace candidate in 1984 with a ratified arms control treaty in hand. In the long run, Mr. Andropov may see the wisdom of having a Republican President with a treaty and without an arms buildup rather than a Democratic President with an arms buildup but without an arms control treaty. --------------------------------------------------------------------- William S.

1083-> DEGAS 'DANCERS RESTING' SELLS FOR $1.3 MILLION, AUCTION TOP
Two 1870's paintings of dancers by Edgar Degas became the stars of last night's multi-million dollar art auction when they sold for $1.3 million and $1 million, the highest prices of the sale at Christie's. The bidding was a surprise because the auction house valued the Degas that brought the lesser price higher than the other. There were several disappointments, too, when three other paintings - two by Paul Cezanne and one by Paul Gauguin - which had been expected to bring $1 million or more each, sold in six figures. However, according to the auction house, at Park Avenue and 59th Street, the sale that totaled $11.1 million, including the 10 per cent buyer's fee, did extremely well - only 12 paintings out of the 79 offered did not find buyers. From the Same Estate Both paintings by Degas - ''Dancers Resting,'' an oil and gouache on paper laid down on canvas dating from 1874, and ''Dancers at the Bar,'' a late 1870's work of a pastel on paper laid down on board - were from the estate of Electra Webb Bostwick. She was the wife of Dunbar W. Bostwick, a sportsman, and inherited the works from her grandparents, the Henry O. Havemeyers, whose fortune was made in the late 19th century in sugar refining. It was ''Dancers Resting,'' which carried a lower presale estimate. But Abels Gallery, a Cologne dealer, bid the work to $1.2 million. The painting cost $1.3 million when a 10 percent buyer's fee is added. The other painting, which was bid to $950,000, sold to Acquavella Galleries, the New York dealers who will pay $1 million when the buyer's fee is included. New Records for Artists The evening saw several artists' records raised. Eugene Thaw, the New York dealer, purchased Alberto Giacommetti's ''Woman of Venice II'' a painted bronze from 1956, for $429,000, the highest price ever paid at public sale for a work by this artist. It was the the first of six bronzes of this subject and it easily exceeding the record of $360,000 set at both Christie's and Sotheby's in New York six months ago. Other new highs for artists were the $101,200 paid for Jacques Lipchitz's ''Man Sitting With His Guitar I,'' and the $15,400 paid for Fritz Wotruba's sculpture of a leaning figure. The Lipchitz and the Wotruba were from the estate of Elizabeth Meadows, widow of Algur H, Meadows, founder and chairman of General American Oil. And so was Cezanne's ''Mrs. Cezanne Wearing a Striped Dress,'' a pensive study from the early 1880's that sold for $575,000 to an American collector - far less than its presale estimate of around $1 million. Gauguin Brings $770,000 Another painting from the Meadows estate - Gauguin's ''The House of Songs,'' an oil-on-burlap landscape painted in 1892 on his first visit to Tahiti - sold for $770,000 to Sam Josefowitz, a collector formerly in the recording business, who makes his home in Lausanne, Switzerland. New York dealers were extremely busy throughout the sale. Leonard Hutton paid $220,000 for Alexej Von Jawlensky's ''Young Woman With Turban''; Pierre Levai of Marlborough purchased Marc Chagall's ''Orphee'' for $132,000 and Lyonel Feininger's ''Evening on the Shore''; Serge Sabarsky purchased Feininger's ''Gelmeroda III'' for $242,000; and Jacques Kaplan bought Marie Laurencin's ''Portrait of a Woman'' for $44,000. ''I think the encouraging thing is that high quality pictures sold at high prices,'' said David Bathhurst, Christie's president, after the sale. He pointed out that the ''middle range which has been depressed came back,'' and gave as examples paintiongs by Henri de Toulouse Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard, Odilon Redon and Edouard Vuillard Lot 1 which, he said, ''were not the greatest,'' and they sold at good prices.

1085-> 'OLD GIRL' NETWORK DRAWS 200 TO THE Y
WHITE PLAINS ''WOMEN need their version of an 'old boy' network,'' said Grace Wasserman, director of the Vistas for Women program, at a recent conference sponsored by her agency and the Y.W.C.A. of White Plains and Central Westchester. The yearly Contact Network Conference, designed to provide women with a way to make business connections, is part of a three-year-old program that includes monthly meetings, career counseling and life-planning programs. This year's conference, which was also supported by numerous professional women's organizations, drew 200 women to the Y.W.C.A. building here. Six workshops and an address by Gonnie McClung Siegel, a communications consultant from Bedford, focused on the theme ''Priorities'' -how to juggle the obligations of career and family. Participants praised in particular the workshop ''Career Development and the Biological Time Bomb,'' which was devoted to the decisions facing women contemplating motherhood. It was led by Dr. Robin Bell, assistant attending psychiatrist at Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan and collaborating psychoanalyst at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, Columbia University, and by Dr. Susan Williamson, an obstetrician who is medical director of the Women's Health Service in New Haven. ''The bottom line is that one would do best to have a baby when and if you're ready to do so,'' said Dr. Bell, who gave birth to her children at the ages of 31, 33 and 45. She outlined some of the possible problems associated with combining childbearing and career or with having children relatively late in life. ''You may experience guilt,'' she said of working mothers who have children when already well into a career. ''But really, you can feel guilty for not being with your child when that child is 1 or 21.'' Noting that husbands ''are taking more care of the children'' and that many employers allow flexible work schedules, she suggested that what might seem troublesome may in fact turn out not to be so distressing. Dr. Williamson, whose audience appeared delighted with her downto-earth manner, said there should be no set rules regarding childbearing. Women should remember, she said, that they are capable of bearing children until they stop ovulating: ''We're really just the hostess to the baby. It's really just a little parasite - it has a different blood type, different everything - it's like a transplant only it isn't rejected until nine months. We have to realize that we're nothing more than an incubator, and a little nourishment.'' She also stressed that because a woman can have a child at any time while she is still ovulating - perhaps into her mid-50's - the ''issues to decide'' revolve more around one's emotional and financial status than physical condition. ''From our point of view as obstetricians, we only worry a little about the older woman,'' she said. ''And that's not about pregnancy per se, but about other things, like high blood pressure and diabetes, which are associated with age.'' Another well-attended workshop was ''Super Woman,'' in which Gail Lehmann, a career consultant, addressed what she called the ''myth'' of the superwoman. ''This is someone who tries to be all things to all people,'' she said, ''until she burns out and is forced to reevaluate her expectations of her career and her personal life'' As part of that reevaluation, participants gathered in small groups and discussed the priority they had assigned to various activities in their lives - and which ones they might be able to dispense with. In a typical comment, Ellen Sirlin, who sells products used in advertising promotions, said: ''I find letting go, delegating, is difficult. I somehow want to be in control.'' Mrs. Siegel, the author of four books including the recent ''Sales: The Fast Track for Women,'' addressed what she called the ''critical issues of political, economic and social equality for women.'' ''Unfortunately,'' she said, ''many people today believe that a feminist is a loud, belligerent, unattractive unkept woman, clad in the uniform of revolt - faded blue jeans and torn sneakers - who dislikes children, hates men, practices radical politics and is a lingerie pyromaniac.'' Although, she said women were confronted with many ''difficult, hard-to-solve, emotional, agonizing choices,'' Mrs. Siegel sounded a more-optimistic note. She suggested that women have ''advanced the light years necessary to reach today's problems - just having the problems signifies immense progress.'' And, she said, ''As I look over the progress of the last 12 to 15 years, I find it impossible to be a pessimist, no matter what challenges confront us.'' Lynne Ames

1086-> WINNERS OF GAMBLE ON SMALL COMPUTER
Many of the 50,000 people here for Comdex, a major computer trade show, came seeking the riches, occasional celebrity and independence that the rapidly expanding personal computer business has provided for a few. And some of the companies here seem to have distinguished themselves: In the eyes of many dealers, devices displayed by new companies such as the Lotus Development Corporation, Software Arts Inc., Visicorp Inc., the Technical Analysis Corporation and the Compaq Computer Corporation appeared to stand out in the crowd of new products. Significantly, the items that were best received were designed specifically for users of the fast-selling personal computer introduced a year ago by the industry giant, the International Business Machines Corporation. Moreover, these new programs and computers continued the trend toward the simpler and less expensive fare that has increased sales of personal computers in the past three years. I.B.M. Sets the Pace The I.B.M. model appears to be setting technical and quality standards for the personal computer industry. An estimated 250,000 units have been sold, accounting for about 10 percent of all personal computers, with another 20,000 being shipped monthly. A matching rate of production for foreign markets is rumored to be set for Britain in mid-January. ''Because of its growth, I.B.M. has created a standard architecture'' for personal computer designs, said Rod Canion, the president of Compaq. His company, based in Houston, has introduced a portable, 28-pound computer, priced at $2,995, that can be used with programs and peripheral equipment designed for the stationary I.B.M. model. The I.B.M. unit costs about $800 more. ''Once that standard is established,'' Mr. Canion added, ''no one -not Digital Equipment, not Apple, not Hewlett Packard - is going to catch up to them.'' Technical Analysis, a small concern with headquarters in Atlanta, used similar reasoning when it developed a circuit board capable of linking the new I.B.M. personal computer with the large I.B.M. 3270 mainframe operated by many corporations. The effect will be to reduce the steps necessary to retrieve the wealth of data stored in the 3270's. Company's Sales Could Triple ''We think the availability of this product probably will accelerate sales of the I.B.M. personal computer,'' said Andrew S. Miyakawa, a senior engineer for Technical Analysis. The circuit board, priced at $1,195, could triple the company's sales in 1983, from the $5 million expected this year. Over all, the wares of 1,106 companies were spread across the floor of the vast Las Vegas Convention Center, up from 648 a year ago, when attendance was 23,000. Representatives of some companies said they were elated at the outcome, but many doubted that the profusion of new companies and products would continue. ''It can't continue,'' said Benjamin Rosen, an industry analyst. ''There are just too many products out there.'' Moreover, a paucity of capable dealers and distributors has, for the moment at least, tightened the marketing bottleneck separating manufacturers and potential customers, according to retailers. Retailing Problems ''Distribution is chaos,'' said Seymour Merrin, president of Computerworks Inc., a Westport, Conn., dealer. ''I can name the few quality distributors on one hand.'' Indeed, Japanese companies such as Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba and Nippon Electric have stumbled in personal computer sales in the United States because they relied on poorly informed distributors, said Jacob Honig, head of marketing at 47th St. Computer, a division of 47th St. Photo in Manhattan. ''A computer is not a tape recorder,'' he said. ''It requires support. It requires training. You cannot give a computer to a distributor and expect it to succeed. Those days are gone.'' Still, many manufacturers turn to former stereo and office equipment retailers and marketing executives, as well as dealers in unrelated businesses eager to cash in on the computer boom. The main failing of weak distributorships is that they try to sell hardware, instead of realizing that most people buy computers to use specific programs, according to Amy D. Wohl, president of Advanced Office Concepts Inc. Focus on Marketing Mindful of the problems, executives at Lotus Development and Software Arts, among others, have drafted their marketing plans with care. Lotus, for example, will sell its program to dealers either directly or through an exclusive distributor, Softsel Computer Products Inc., a fast-growing national distributor. The program, priced at $495, combines text editing, spreadsheet analysis (which permits a user to see several pages of text at once), retrieval of information from assorted data bases and graphics. It was designed initially for the I.B.M. personal computer. The company booked more than $1 million in retail orders at Comdex, with initial shipments still a month away. Software Arts is looking for distributors whose sales staff call directly on retailers, according to Bruce H. Rampe, director of marketing and sales. ''We may be manufacturers, but we think like retailers,'' he said. The company's newest program, which is priced at $299, aims to eliminate the more elaborate programming that has been needed when engineers, financial analysts, architects and even high school science students attempted to use a computer.

1088-> PENTAGON EXPECTS TOUGH TALKS ON BASES IN SPAIN
Defense Department officials predicted today that the United States could expect what one called ''long, hard bargaining'' with the new Socialist Government of Spain to retain American bases there. But the officials expected the United States to keep the bases even though they were cautious about military relations with a Spain led by Felipe Gonzalez. ''I don't think anyone is really worried about the long run,'' a senior Pentagon official said. In his election campaign, Mr. Gonzalez, whose party handily won the first leftist election victory in Spain in 40 years, declared that he would seek to renegotiate a bases agreement signed with the United States in July and would reconsider Spain's membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which it joined in May. The officials said the United States planned to stay at arm's length from Mr. Gonzalez until he settled into office so as not to ''overwhelm him,'' as one official put it, and to avoid arousing leftist opposition to good relations with Washington. U.S. Congratulates Gonzalez At the State Department, a spokesman issued a statement congratulating Mr. Gonzalez and saying the United States ''looks forward to working closely with Spain's next Government.'' The spokesman, John Hughes, said there was no need to renegotiate the bases agreement, which is still before the Spanish Parliament for ratification. In his campaign, Mr. Gonzalez said he wanted to renegotiate the five-year agreement under which the United States Air Force stations jet fighters at Torrejon and aerial tankers at Zaragoza and the Navy has a base at Rota. The issue of Gibraltar, which Britain has held since 1704, could catch the United States between two allies. Spanish Socialists, like Spanish conservatives, want Gibraltar back. The United States bases in Spain, where 8,500 Americans are stationed, were important primarily to the defense of Europe when they were acquired in the 1950's. More recently, however, they have become vital to American deployments to the Middle East. The bases are part of a complex the United States has been trying to assemble to give the Rapid Deployment Force and other forces several landing places as they fly from the United States to the Middle East.

1089-> DEMOCRATS SEEM HEADED FOR BIGGEST ASSEMBLY EDGE SINCE '48
The New York State Legislature will have at least 30 new names on the roll call next year and the smallest Republican representation in the Assembly in recent years. Democrats in the State Assembly claimed victory over 99 seats in the 150-seat house in Tuesday's voting, in which all the Democratic incumbents were re-elected and nine incumbent Republicans were defeated. Several races were won unofficially by small margins and could eventually change hands. If all the Democratic victories are confirmed, it would be the largest majority in the Assembly since 1948, when the Republicans had 107 assemblymen. In the State Senate, Democrats appeared to have won one additional seat, defeating a Republican incumbent in an extremely close race in Brooklyn. This gain was offset, however, by a Republican victory in a new 61st district added through reapportionment. The new Legislature, largely reshaped by reapportionment, will have three more black represenatives, including the first black from Nassau County, Barbara Patton, a 38-year-old lawyer. Aides in both parties said the elections were unlikely to change the balance of power that has developed over the years on major issues. Most major legislation has become law only after negotiations among the leaders of each house and the Governor. A key test for the new Governor will be his ability to work out compromises with the legislative leaders. Asked if Mr. Fink had spoken with the Democratic Governor-elect, Mario M. Cuomo, an aide said: ''They congratulated each other.'' The large Democratic sweep in the Assembly followed a redrawing of the legislative districts based on the 1980 census. ''We had quality candidates and a good campaign apparatus,'' Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink said yesterday morning. ''We won even in districts with Republican registrations.'' But Republicans in the Assembly complained that even traditionally Republican districts had been undermined by reapportionment. In the Senate, both the Republicans and Democrats had targeted seats held by each other's incumbents. Senator Christopher J. Mega, a Republican of Brooklyn, lost by 166 votes to Joseph G. Montalto, a 33-year-old assistant commissioner in New York City's Office of General Services. Kent Sanders, an aide to the Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson of Binghamton, said more than 1,000 paper ballots were still to be counted in the district, the 23d. He said Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for the Republican State Committee, would ''oversee'' the counting of the ballots. In another close Senate race, Senator Joseph R. Pisani, Republican of New Rochelle, led by about 3,000 votes -with some districts uncounted - over Suzanne R. Oppenheimer, the Mamaroneck Mayor. Joseph Poler, press secretary for the Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein, said a recount would be sought in the district. Based on the latest vote counts, 58 incumbents will return to the Senate, and aides in both parties expected few changes in the operation of the upper house. Senate Democrats said they were disappointed by their showing in districts they had targeted. They attributed that largely to the difficulty of defeatiing incumbents. In addition, they said they had expected a large showing by Mr. Cuomo, which would have helped Democrats in close races. Except in Mr. Montalto's race, they said they saw little evidence of Mr. Cuomo's ''coattails.'' Senators who won re-election despite intensive efforts by the opposing party included Senator James J. Lack, a Republican from East Northport, L.I.; Carol Berman, Democrat of Lawrence, L.I., and William T. Stachowski, a Democrat of Buffalo. In the Assembly, Democrats won or were leading in three upstate races by a few hundred votes, and the final outcome was in doubt. In Binghamton, Assemblyman James W. McCabe Sr., a Democrat, led Donald A. Clarey, an aide to Senator Anderson, by 101 votes. Paul F. Finnegan, a Democrat, defeated Assemblyman John G.A. O'Neil of Parishville by 120 votes. In Orange, Putnam and Rockland Counties, William J. Ryan, the Democrat, led Betty L. Basel by about 300 votes. In New York City, Democrats swept 59 of Assembly 60 seats and defeated four Republican incumbents. The only surviving Republican is Robert A. Straneire of Staten Island.

1090-> U.N. CHIEF CHALLENGES THE LEGALITY OF ASSEMBLY DRAFT ON PALESTINIANS
In an unusual move, Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar today challenged the legality and feasibility of a General Assembly draft resolution that calls on him to insure the protection of Palestinian refugees in Israeli-occupied territory. Mr. Perez de Cuellar's legal counsel, Erik Suy, told the Special Political Committee that the resolution ran counter to the provisions of the 1949 Geneva conventions, which say the ''responsibility for insuring human and other rights within such territories attaches to the occupying power.'' ''Any attempt by another authority,'' Mr. Suy said, ''or by an international organization, to assume part of that responsibility would seem to weaken or at least obscure this duty of the occupying power.'' Mr. Suy said that on many occasions, and as recently as 1981, the General Assembly had recognized the applicability of the Geneva conventions to Israeli-occupied territories. 'Difficult to See' He said it was ''difficult to see'' how Mr. Perez de Cuellar could insure the safety of the Palestinians ''without in effect exercising certain sovereign powers,'' including police powers, ''or else exerting authority and control over the occupying power itself.'' The resolution passed, 97 to 2, with 16 abstentions. The two negative votes came from the United States and Israel. Veteran United Nations diplomats could not recall a similar incident in which a Secretary General openly challenged the legal basis or the practicality of a United Nations draft resolution. In addition, the Secretary General sought to contain the broad scope of recent resolutions dealing with Palestinians by emphasizing the costs involved. A draft resolution that calls for the issuance of identification cards for ''all Palestinian refugees and their descendants'' irrespective of whether they receive help from the United Nations was singled out by the Secretary General for ''the extensive financial implications'' entailed in the distribution of such cards. He said rough initial estimates ''indicate that the costs involved could be in excess of $10 million.'' Despite the cost, the Special Political Committee passed the resolution by 83 to 16, with 16 abstentions.

1091-> REPUBLICAN LEADERS MOUNT EFFORT ON GAS TAX
Senate Republican leaders decided tonight to try to revive legislation to increase the gasoline tax, needed to support a program of highway repair and aid to mass transit. Republican leaders had bowed to a filibuster Thursday night and withdrawn the bill from floor consideration, to allow action on a stopgap spending measure to keep the Government running. They acknowledged then that the withdrawal had crippled the measure, perhaps fatally. Today's decision came after a three-hour meeting of the 54 Senate Republicans and the intercession of President Reagan and Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis. The plan was to bring the measure to the floor immediately after adoption of the interim appropriation measure. The leaders will bring the bill forward and immediately move to invoke cloture, which permits as much as 100 hours of additional debate but limits the tactics of filibustering Senators. Deliberations could be expedited because of the Senate's unusual bipartisan unity behind the bill, which is aimed at providing work for some of the 12 million jobless Americans, and because of general exasperation with the three conservative Republicans conducting the filibuster, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who was one of the filibusterers, appeared downcast. ''We've all run out the string,'' he said. The bill, endorsed by Mr. Reagan, has the support of bipartisan Congressional leaders and an overwhelming majority of Congress. But three conservative Republican Senators, who consider an increased gasoline tax regressive and counterproductive, have filibustered against the bill. The President expressed his frustration in a White House interview with radio reporters. ''I think it's ridiculous for a minority to stand in the way of this bill,'' he said. An 'Emergency Situation' Mr. Reagan, whom leaders of both parties persuaded to endorse the measure at the start of the post-election session, said the bill addressed an ''emergency situation'' and asserted that some highways and bridges were so deteriorated that trucks had to be rerouted, increasing the price of the products involved. Mr. Reagan, Senate Republican leaders and most of their Senate colleagues have been trying without success to persuade the filibusterers to allow passage of the measure. Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ''There's a lot of pressure on the Republican Senate - we can't pass a bill that's passed a Democratic House.'' But the three filibustering Senators showed no signs of weakening. Senator Helms introduced 60 additional amendments to the bill today. Earlier, Mr. Helms, Gordon J. Humphrey of New Hampshire and Don Nickles of Oklahoma used quorum calls, points of order and other delaying tactics in addition to speeches on the floor. The Republican leaders, who had said unanimous consent would be required to bring the measure back to the floor, said today they had discovered the bill would return automatically for floor consideration. They also discovered there were parliamentary devices that could expedite the matter. But the leaders acknowledged that the fate of the bill was in the hands of those conducting the filibuster because members of Congress are eager to adjourn for a Christmas vacation and a new Congress will convene in two weeks. The filibusterers could easily delay a vote beyond that date, they admitted. Interpretation of Fall Elections Republican and Democratic Congressional leaders interpreted November's election as a mandate for Government action to curb unemployment, now 10.8 percent. They won the President's reluctant endorsement. Mr. Reagan said that he had never approved of job programs and called the measure a ''highway'' bill that only incidentally would create 320,000 jobs. Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., Republican of Tennessee, the majority leader, called it a ''highway-jobs'' bill, and the House Speaker, Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., Democrat of Massachusetts, called it a ''jobs'' bill. Both Mr. Baker and Mr. O'Neill regarded the measure as a small but symbolic effort to help the jobless. The measure was speeded through House and Senate committees, where it received only one day of hearings and was approved in daylong bill-drafting sessions. The filibusterers called this a legislative steamroller, but supporters argued that Congress was merely responding to a clear-cut national consensus. The gasoline tax would raise $5.5 billion, of which $4.4 billion would be earmarked for highway repair and construction and $1.1 billion for mass transit. It would mark the first time the gasoline tax would be used to help support mass transit. The bill also included increased taxes for large trucks, which pay a maximum of $210 annually and would pay $2,000 under the Housepassed bill and $1,200 under the bill approved by Senate committees. The trucking industry became a major opponent of the measure.

1092-> A Connection To Wordsworth
Having seen your cutting from your issue of Sept. 26 (Connecticut Journal), I thought you would wish me to point out an error of fact concerning Dove Cottage in Grasmere, where William Wordsworth spent much of his life. Dove Cottage and the Wordsworth Museum associated with it is something of which, I am sure, the National Trust would be very proud, but I regret to say that it is not owned by the National Trust. The National Trust's chief link with the poet is its ownership of his birth place, Wordsworth House, Cockermouth, north of the Lake District. Wordsworth House contains a few of the poet's personal possessions and is furnished and decorated in the style of his time. His childhood and, in particular, walking on the terrace in the garden is strongly evoked in his poem, ''Prelude.'' Visitors can enjoy the house between April and October every day except Thursdays 11-5 P.M. and Sundays 2-5 P.M. A welcome is assured and coffee and light lunches may be taken in the kitchen he would have known so well. It is appreciated that the National Trust should be associated with William Wordsworth in this way, because his passionate feeling for the Lake District has been translated into the National Trust's holding for posterity of one quarter of the entire National Park. Arguably, it is Britain's best known and best loved landscape, but its very popularity is causing tremendous problems. The Trust is having to expend large sums of money on the repair of buildings and dry stone walls, on massive tree planting schemes and on combating the serious erosion that many pairs of feet have caused on the paths crisscrossing the countryside. The Trust will shortly launch an appeal for funds to help it in its work here. If you felt able to assist us in this way, the address to send contributions to is: The Lake District Landscape Appeal, The National Trust, Rothay Holme, Rothay Road, Ambleside, Cumbria, England.

1093-> CREDIT MARKETS; TREASURY BONDS UP MODESTLY
The Treasury bond market advanced modestly yesterday in the belief that the Federal Reserve will reduce its discount rate soon from the current level of 8.5 percent. This view also caused a modest rally in prices of tax-exempt and corporate bonds. But rates on short-term bills and other instruments were unchanged on the day, largely because their rates remained well below the dealer cost of carrying them, 8.5 percent. This rate was the same as the overnight interbank lending rate yesterday. Nevertheless, the Treasury's auction of 90-day bills produced an average rate of 7.975 percent, up from 7.857 a week earlier, while that on the companion issue of six-month bills slipped to 8.051 percent from 8.104. Rates on Certificates As a result, the new maximum rate on six-month savings certificates that savings banks and thrift institutions may pay as of today will decline to 8.653 percent from 8.768, based on a four-week rate formula. For 91-day bank and thrift savings certificates, the ceiling will be 7.975 percent, up from 7.857, the same as the average rate on the three-month Treasury bills auctioned yesterday. Earlier, in the secondary market for Government securities, last week's 90-day bills closed the day at a rate of 7.85 bid; the sixmonth issue at 7.95, and the new one-year bills at 8.07, all down about 10 basis points from their highs of the day. Intermediate issues, such as the 9 3/8 percent notes of 1984, were up about a one thirty-second of a point. But the real strength was in the long end of the Treasury maturities. There, the new 10.5 percent notes of 1989 advanced seven-eigths of a point, to 100.18; the 10.75 percent bonds of 2003 gained three-quarters of a point at 100.26, and the 10 3/8 percent bonds of 2012 also rose three-quarters, closing at 99.50. A point is equivalent to $10 for each $1,000 of a bond's face value. Discount Rate Expectations ''The strength of the long end of the bond market may be attributed to the fact that everybody in the Street expects the Federal Reserve to reduce its discount rate from the current level of 8.5 percent,'' said Douglas McAllister, vice president and Government securities specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Indeed, there is little fear that the Fed will attempt to tighten credit in the foreseeable future, Mr. McAllister said, noting: ''The economy is in no shape to tolerate any decline in liquidity. Besides, the threat of inflation is a far secondary consideration at this time for the same reason. Actually, the Fed has no choice but to keep pumping in liquidity.'' 'Pressure on System' While some dealers said they were disappointed over the failure of the Fed to push down the Federal funds rate, which traded between 8.5 and 8.625 percent yesterday, Mr. McAllister said that such a move would not accomplish much this week or next, largely because of technical factors. Mr. McAllister explained: ''For one, there is always pressure on the banking system in the last week of the year. Many institutions like to dress up their accounts with lots of cash for the end of the quarter and the year. This Friday is the settlement day for half of the $26 billion that dealers bought at last week's Treasury auctions, and next week they will have to pay for the other half. Much of last week's $26 billion of new Treasury paper is still in dealer hands.'' Yesterday, the dealer financing rate was 8.5 percent, considerably above the rates on Treasury bills. As long as the rates on bills are well below the cost of carrying them, dealers will be reluctant to add them to inventory. Today, the four-day repurchase agreements effected by the Fed last Thursday are scheduled to expire and many dealers think the central bank will offset much of the drain with new repos to restore liquidity in the banking system. The Fed's only action yesterday was to effect $1 billion of repurchase agreements on behalf of a foreign central bank client. Whether this has a significant impact on banking liquidty has long been debated among dealers. Following are the results of the weekly Treasury auction of threeand

1094-> THE GAME TURNS SERIOUS AT ATARI
WORKING at Atari Inc. is like playing one of the company's video games. It requires quick reflexes, and one's turn at the controls maybe short-lived. Just in the last two weeks three Atari executives - none of whom had been at the company for more than eight months - have been zapped. Such rapid-fire dismissals, as well as resignations, have become a trademark of the world's largest video game producer and of its mercurial chairman and chief executive officer, Raymond E. Kassar. The high turnover was saying something about the management of Atari, but few people were listening. After all, Atari was probably the fastest growing company in the nation, climbing to about $2 billion in sales in a few years as the video game craze swept America. Now people are taking notice. In the last two weeks, a series of revelations have rocked the video game industry. The most stunning was the sudden announcment 11 days ago that Atari's parent, Warner Communications Inc., expected a dramatic slump in fourth quarter per-share earnings - the first such decline in 31 quarters - largely because of disappointing sales of Atari's video game cartridges. The news sent the stock of Warner and other game-related companies reeling and has provoked a major reassessment of a company that has captured as much attention on Wall Street as it has in arcades and family living rooms. ''Why did it happen so quickly? And why were they not in tune with it while it was building?'' said Richard P. Simon, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, referring to the unexpectedly low cartridge sales. ''I think one has to clearly question their controls in light of this.'' Added Michele Preston, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence: ''I'm not satisfied with the explanation. And there are some real fundamental questions posed for the long term.'' The situation at Atari is by no means dire. The video game industry in general and Atari in particular are still growing, although profit margins are shriveling from intense competition. And Warner still expects to report a 10 to 15 percent increase for all of 1982, an improvement that would delight many other companies during a recession. THE gain, however, is just not what people had come to expect from Warner and from Atari, which in the first nine months of 1982 contributed half of Warner's $2.9 billion in revenues and two thirds of its $471 million in operating profits. Warner's earnings statement said the company expects fourth quarter profits to be roughly 60 cents a share, only half the level of the $1.17 a share recorded in last year's fourth quarter. Even more dramatic, the results will be only a third of the $1.60 to $2.00 expected by virtually all Wall Street analysts, who, now furious and embarrassed, say that the company privately confirmed such estimates up to the morning before the Dec. 8 bombshell announcement. Warner's stock slid more than 16 points the following day and has continued to fall, closing Friday at 30 3/4, down from 53 5/8 on Dec. 7. And shareholders have filed suits accusing the company of withholding important information about its finances. Atari is also facing problems in its two other businesses. Its arcade game business has dropped into the red this quarter and its home computer business, which has never yet been profitable, faces a market-share battle. But perhaps even more important than problems with specific businesses is the question of whether Atari's management is ready for a period in which growth and profits will not come as easily. One management problem Atari concedes it has is that its fixed costs have gotten out of line. At a meeting with securities analysts Monday, Emanual Gerard, co-chief operating officer of Warner, said the company would take a hard look at its overhead now that sales are less than expected. Another problem is rapid turnover. A 25-year veteran of Burlington Industries, Mr. Kassar, 54 years old, has been trying to change Atari from a loosely organized band of engineers into a serious, businesslike, market-oriented company. He recruited executives, like himself, with marketing experience but no electronics experience, from companies such as Polaroid, Jovan and American Can. But just as quickly as he lures them, Mr. Kassar seems to lose them. On the same day Warner announced lower earnings it announced that Perry D. Odak, the president of Atari's home video game division, had been discharged, after being on the job six months. The company and Mr. Odak insist the dismissal was the result of a difference in management style between Mr. Odak and Mr. Kassar and was not related to the shortfall in cartridge sales. Also dismissed in the last two weeks were Thomas M. McDonough, senior vice president of sales and marketing in Atari's home computer division, who had been on the job eight months, and Lee Henderson, vice president of field sales for the home video game division, who had been on the job two months. The presidents of Atari's two other divisions, home computers and arcade games, left the company last summer, and there have been numerous other dismissals and resignations in the last few years. Mr. Gerard said the turnover is an inevitable result of rapid growth. Atari has grown from less than $200 million in revenues in 1978, just before Mr. Kassar took over, to roughly ten times that in 1982. Its staff has mushroomed to 10,000 people, with 4,000 added in this year alone. They are spread among more than 50 buildings in California's Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco. ''The stresses and strains that are created by that kind of growth are phenomenal,'' said Mr. Gerard, explaining that the situation was made worse by the fact that Atari, now 10 years old, had no corporate tradition. ''You can't deal with the company as if it were General Electric, because it ain't,'' he said. Others, however, say the turnover is a function of Mr. Kassar's style. ''You can't build a stable organization without solid people,'' said Robert A. Hovee, a former vice president of sales and marketing for the home computer division. Yet, he said, Mr. Kassar does not delegate enough responsibility, making it hard to keep the strong-minded people he recruits. Other former managers describe Mr. Kassar as someone who changes his mind frequently both on company direction and on which subordinates are in his favor. The recent slump in earnings comes at a time when the overall video game business is good. Sales for the entire industry are expected to double in 1982, to $2 billion, with the total about evenly split between the machines on which the games are played - the hardware - and the game cartridges, or software. But, like with razors and razor blades, cartridges are more profitable than the machines. The cartridges cost a few dollars to make and can sell for more than $20 at retail. According to estimates by Mr. Simon of Goldman Sachs, cartridge sales accounted for $180 million of Atari's $280 million in operating profits in 1981. When cartridge sales fell short of expectations, the results went straight to the bottom line. It began back in October, 1981, when Atari met with its distributors and asked them to commit to orders for virtually all of 1982. At that time, Atari had about 80 percent of the hardware and software market, with Mattel its main competitor. In previous years, Atari had been unable to deliver all that was desired, so distributors ordered more than they really thought they would need. But come the middle of this year, the situation had changed dramatically. Numerous companies were in the software business including Coleco Industries, Activision, Imagic and Parker Brothers. ''We got into the last half of this year and we were in a totally different business,'' said Barry Furman, chairman of R&S Distributing Company, an Atari distributor in the Philadelphia area. Order cancellations began pouring in, and Atari's market share slipped precipitously. Analysts wonder why Atari didn't realize until December how serious the cancellations were. ''We were just dumb,'' Mr. Gerard said in an interview, saying the company was ''blind-sided'' because it had never experienced competition and massive order cancellations before. He said the company is changing its procedures to prevent that from happening again. Atari was also hurt because it had a weak lineup of games going into the second half. It was depending on games licensed from the movies ''E.T.'' and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' games that have not been the blockbusters Atari expected. In the first quarter of next year, Atari will introduce five games that are derived from popular arcade games. Such games might restore its market share and could have made a difference if the company had them before Christmas. Mr. Gerard told analysts that the company was ''lulled'' by its previous success. In particular, its home video version of Pac-Man, though widely faulted for the quality of its graphic display, still sold extremely well. It came out just before the competition hit and made Atari think it could sell virtually anything. It couldn't. The events have implications for the entire industry. While Mr. Gerard said overall industry cartridge sales are likely to increase again next year, only popular games from now on will bring profits. Each new game will have to be promoted like a motion picture, entailing high advertising expenses. Indeed, Mattel said that despite increasing hardware and software sales, it expects to lose money in its current quarter, partly because of high promotional expenses. Also, earnings of video game companies in the future will fluctuate like those of movie companies, depending on whether the company has hits or not. The events also raise a question about whether Atari has lost too much of its entrepreneurial spirit and creativity. The company was founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell, whose first successful game was a coin-operated Ping-Pong game called Pong. The name Atari came from a term in the Japanese game of Go. At first the company was run by engineers in tee-shirts. Noah L. Anglin, a former vice president of manufacturing and engineering, recalled that at his job interview, Atari executives were worried because he had spent 13 years at I.B.M. Usually, experience at I.B.M. is considered an asset. But Atari had trouble financing its own growth and began looking for a suitor. Warner purchased Atari for a mere $28 million in 1976, mainly at the urging of Mr. Gerard. ''That has to be the greatest acquisition in history,'' said Donald Valentine, a California venture capitalist who was an initial backer of Atari. Mr. Gerard ousted Mr.Bushnell and his associates and installed Mr. Kassar. As the company has grown, it has shifted to being market-driven rather than entrepreneurial and engineering-driven. The company is using its considerable financial muscle to license arcade games from others - mainly Japanese companies. Some of the games most responsible for Atari's success, such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man, were created by others. But some, like Mr. Anglin, think Atari has become too dependent on others and has been slack in designing its own games. Some of Atari's top game designers, partly because they did not feel appreciated at Atari, have left for competitors such as Activision, which offered them stakes in the company or other incentives. As the competition arose, Atari has also resorted to legal action. At one time or another it has sued Activision, Imagic, Coleco, Commodore and Magnavox, charging patent infringement or unfair trade practices. ''They're seeking to win victory in court that they can no longer win in the market,'' said Arnold C. Greenberg, president and chief executive of Coleco. When Atari sued Coleco for patent infringement earlier this month, Coleco responded by filing an antitrust countersuit, A problem getting its own games to market also has hurt the coinoperated game business. ''The fourth quarter of 1981 was, by a considerable margin, the best quarter in the history of the coin-op division,'' Mr. Gerard told analysts. ''The first quarter of 1982 was very good. The second quarter was a good quarter. The third quarter was a rotten quarter and the fourth quarter is a disaster.'' The arcade game industry as a whole is suffering from a glut of machines and few new places to put them. But Atari is suffering in particular because of a lack of hit games. ''We went dry somewhere in the spring,'' Mr. Gerard said. Recently Atari introduced Pole Position - yet another Japanese game. Mr. Gerard said that game, and some others, are already turning the coin-op division around. Atari's future may lie with its home computer division. The market for home - as opposed to small-business computers - has taken off this year and Atari has seen its sales quadruple, to an estimated $300 million. Yet the division is still losing money, perhaps $25 million $50 million this year. Atari was the first company to clearly aim for the home market with a computer selling for only a few hundred dollars, as opposed to machines like the Apple that sell for more than $1,000. But recently companies like Texas Instruments and Commodore International have come on strong, and a price and market-share war has developed. Atari has many strong suits. It has a joint venture with Lucasfilm Ltd., the producer of Star Wars, to design innovative new games. It has a tremendous advertising budget, estimated at more than $100 milion this year, and a prodigious research and development budget of almost the same size. It has hired Alan Kay, a highly regarded computer scientist, as its chief scientist and told him to ''dream'' up new products. One new product is the mysterious ''Falcon'' project. Atari has said that next year it will introduce a new consumer electronics product, not a game, that will be the basis for a fourth division in the company. Speculation centers on a communications device, perhaps a telephone with computerized functions or a device to be used with cable television systems. But analysts wonder why Atari is alerting everyone to the product's existence if it is really so marvelous. In the new atmosphere of lost innocence and heightened skepticism surrounding Atari, many would rather just wait and see.

1097-> SUNDAY OBSERVER
Bird of a Different Feather Benjamin Franklin wanted to make the turkey the American national bird, but he was voted down by the eagle bloc. As a result, we now have to eat two turkey dinners at the end of every year, and the eagle is almost extinct. If Franklin had prevailed, the situation would now be reversed. After all, you can't eat the national bird. That would be almost as nasty as insulting the flag. And once the turkey had been officially stripped of its grocery value, the turkey population would have withered away. Unable to set roast turkey on Thanksgiving and Christmas tables, Americans would have faced a severe problem. Imagine the festive board creaking under the carbohydrate tons of mashed potatoes, candied yams, Grandmother's secret-recipe stuffing, creamed onions, turnips under gravy, pumpkin and mincemeat pie - all the ingredients of heartburn gloriously assembled, and yet -. It lacks a piece de resistance, something to furnish the coup de grace. ''What's the only thing fit to serve with a meal like this?'' someone would have asked. And someone else, I am certain, would have said, ''Turkey would be ideal, but since we can't eat the national bird, let's settle for roast eagle.'' It would have been the making of the eagle. Very soon huge eagle co-ops would have sprung up across the continent. Breeders would have produced an eagle bulging with white meat under the breast feathers and bred the long, bony, tasteless wings down to stumps. Today, breeding factories would be churning out eagles by the million, and in many an American home the cook would already be starting to thaw out a frozen eagle for the Christmas feast. In a thousand cities and towns, news reporters would be honing their cliches in preparation for the annual descent on orphanages about to be blessed with the arrival of 40-pound eagles given by the eleemosynary classes. ''Eyes will be aglow in this drab dining hall tomorrow, folks, when the menu will be roast eagle with all the fixin's.'' I have never eaten eagle, partly because it's the national bird, partly because it's hard to find one, and partly because I suspect it wouldn't be any tastier than turkey. You can't avoid eating turkey,though. For reasons lost in the depths of antiquity, not eating turkey on the holidays is almost as un-American as it would be to eat eagle. If eating turkey is what you have to do to qualify for fellowship in the American community, I'll force myself to do it, just as I force myself to watch the Miss America Pageant, the Academy Awards presentation and the Super Bowl on television. If the whole country is going to engage in these things, who am I to be snooty about them? On balance I rate turkey as just slightly better than the Miss America Pageant, but not quite as good as the Super Bowl, and about on a par with the Academy Awards show. On the other hand, I don't make a fuss about these things. Once, at a friend's house for a holiday meal, I was astonished when he produced a bottle of great Bordeaux with the turkey. The ideal drink with turkey is water, since it supplies the moisture usually lacking in the white meat, but if you must have wine, anything fancier than muscatel is overkill. Being a good sport and a good American about turkey, I keep my reservations to myself and even do the ceremonial carving now that age and inertia have moved me to the head of the table. I resisted carving for several years after discovering that our only carving knife had not been sharpened since 1950, but I now find it the perfect role for anyone who cannot escape a turkey dinner. As the carver, you can immediately tell whether the white meat has been properly cooked at the expense of leaving the dark meat rare, or whether the white meat has been cooked to balsa-wood consistency in order to get the dark meat properly done. With this knowledge you can choose a piece that is at least palatable. Benjamin Franklin, possibly the wisest American who ever lived, must have foreseen that turkey would one day beset American posterity. With his usual vision, I believe, he was cunningly planning to save his countrymen from turkey when he proposed to make it the national bird. He may not have foreseen that, as such, the turkey would march into extinction, but he surely realized that, once it became the feathery symbol of the nation, all Americans would be eternally relieved of the obligation to eat it.

1098-> INTEREST RATE DROPPING 2 POINTS IN A STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM
The interest rate on a Federal education loan program for students and the parents of students will drop two percentage points Nov. 1, and financial aid officials are predicting a surge in new applications. The rate on Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students will drop from 14 percent to 12 percent for loans made after Nov. 1, the Department of Education announced this month. The rate on the loans, which are made through banks, is tied to the yearly average of interest rates on 90-day Treasury Bills, which dropped for the fiscal year 1982, which ended Sept. 30. ''I suspect we'll see an increase in volume when that change in the interest rate occurs,'' said Dallas Martin, executive director of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. ''They'll probably borrow for the second semester of the year.'' The loan program, originally intended to aid parents, was expanded last year to include self-supporting undergraduate students, and graduate and professional students. The action was taken by Congress at the same time tighter restrictions were imposed on families with incomes above $30,000, who try to qualify for the far larger Guaranteed Student Loan progam. The latter was done at the request of the Reagan Administration. Differences in Programs The borrowing limit for Parent Loans for Undergraduate Studentsprogram is $3,000 for parents of undergraduate students; $5,000 for graduate students and $2,500 for self-supporting undergraduates. The program has more liberal eligibility rules but a higher interest rate and less attractive terms than the Guaranteed Student Loan program. Borrowers must begin repaying interest 60 days after getting the loan. Under the guaranteed loan program, the interest rate is 9 percent, and repayment does not begin until after graduation. The parent and student loan program has expanded dramatically since last year. From Jan. 1981, when it began, through Sept. 30 of last year, only $27 million in loans were made to about 11,000 people. In the year that ended Sept. 30, banks made $94.6 million in loans to 24,998 parents and 11,770 students, mainly graduate and professional students, Education Department figures show. Operates in Most States After the restrictions were imposed on the Guaranteed Student Loan Program, higher education groups said they were worried because few states had parent and student loan programs operating. Now, Education Department officials say all states and territories have the programs except Georgia, Oregon and Puerto Rico, which will have them by month's end, and Florida, whose program will begin Jan. 1. But Mr. Martin of the financial aid administration said that although most states technically have programs, ''It simply is not operational in large parts of the country yet.'' He said the loans were widely available in states like Massachusetts, New York and New Jersey where the programs were quickly geared up. The loans mainly help students in expensive professional schools or private undergraduate colleges, he said, adding that many students use the program to supplement guaranteed student loans. The maximum limit on guaranteed loans, $2,500 for undergraduates and $5,000 for graduate students, is not enough when some medical schools, for example, charge $12,000 for tuition, he said.

1099-> TELEVISION WEEK
The Search for Quality Lady Antonia Fraser, who has written biographies of England's King James, Charles II, Mary Queen of Scots and Oliver Cromwell, also writes mystery novels and television series. Her first mystery, written in 1977, ''Quiet as a Nun,'' was dramatized for British television and was warmly received there. Channel 13 will present the three-part mini-series, under the ''Mystery!'' umbrella, beginning Tuesday evening at 9. Maria Aitken stars as a television journalist who returns to her convent school to investigate a nun's death. The dramatization was done by Julia Jones, Moira Armstrong directed and Jacqueline Davis served as producer. Is there any significance to the number of women involved? According to Lady Antonia last week in a telephone interview from London: ''It wasn't deliberately done, but it was significant in its own way - in the search for quality. I'm not a great one for saying quality is either male or female, so insofar as it succeeds I think it succeeds because of quality.'' At present, Lady Antonia is working on a study of English women in the 17th century. Alternating scholarly and popular writing works ''very well,'' she said. Crop rotation is ''very good for the land and I find that it is very good for me.'' The Right Mixture Elijah Moshinsky, known primarily for his staging of operas, notes that Shakespearean plays and opera are ''similar in the sense that they are not realistic forms. They deal with melodramatic plots.'' Mr. Moshinsky's staging of ''Cymbeline,'' the tragicomedy that is the latest presentation in public television's ''Shakespeare Plays'' series, can be seen on Channel 13 on Monday at 8 P.M. His most current handiwork in the opera field, a production of Stravinsky's ''The Rake's Progress,'' recently opened at the Royal Opera House in London where he was interviewed a week ago by telephone. ''Cymbeline'' is his third production for this series. Shakespeare on television, he said, is done best ''without declamation, rather softly. If an actor tries theatrical speech it becomes too operatic, the performance can become very hammy.'' The ''Cymbeline'' cast includes Claire Bloom, Helen Mirren, Richard Johnson, Robert Lindsay and Michael Pennington. Because the play is ''about relationships and has a lot of plots,'' Mr. Moshinsky said, ''it's very important to get the right mixture of people. We wanted to make sure that there was someone of enormous audience appeal in each plot.'' Southern Folklore Fox fire is a luminous fungus, found in the Blue Ridge Mountains area, that causes decaying wood to glow. ''Foxfire,'' used as one word, is the title of a series of books on Southern mountain folklore written by high school students in Rabun County, an Appalachian community in northern Georgia. It is also the title of the current Broadway play written by Susan Cooper and Hume Cronyn and starring Jessica Tandy, Keith Carradine and Mr. Cronyn. All of these elements are woven together in ''The Foxfire Glow,'' a television special focusing on the folklore, traditions and problems of the county. It will be broadcast Saturday by WNBC at 10 P.M. Arlene Francis and Joe Michaels will be co-hosts. Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn will be interviewed and scenes from the play will be shown. Mr. Michaels visited Georgia to prepare for the program. ''All these people have going for them,'' he said the other day, ''is a couple of hundred years of tradition and the most incredibly beautiful scenery.'' They have little money, he said, and ''flatlanders, mostly people from Florida who want to buy a pretty place in the mountains,'' are coming in to encourage them to sell homes that their families may have lived in for generations. Some folks try to persuade others not to sell, try ''somehow to get light industries or small factories to come in and to try to preserve all of this. ''I think,'' he added, ''sadly enough, it's a lost cause.'' From D.C. to N.Y.C. This Yuletide week will see a plethora of cultural programs originating from the Kennedy Center and the White House. But New York, not to be outdone, will be making a contribution. ''Christmas at Kennedy Center With Leontyne Price'' will present the soprano in an hour of traditional holiday music, songs and readings. Taped on Sunday, Dec. 19, it will be shown on Channel 13 on Wednesday at 8 P.M., with a stereo simulcast on WNCN-FM. Then, an hour later on the same evening, three stalwarts of America jazz - Dizzy Gillespie, Chick Corea and Stan Getz - will be presented ''In Performance at the White House'' on Channel 13. Itzhak Perlman, the violinst, will be the host. This show, taped on Dec. 4, will be simulcast on WNYC-FM. At 2 in the afternoon of Christmas Day, Humperdinck's opera ''Hansel and Gretel'' will be broadcast by Channel 13 as part of the ''Live From the Met'' series. The cast includes Judith Blegen, Frederica von Stade and Rosalind Elias. A simulcast will be offered on WQXR-FM. Later on the same channel, at 8 P.M., the week's second ''In Performance at the White House'' telecast will present Beverly Sills introducing performances by talented young artists. WNYC-FM will carry the stereo simulcast. It was taped in Dec, 1981. Then at 8 on Christmas night, CBS will broadcast ''The Kennedy Center Honors: A Celebration of the Performing Arts.'' The two-hour program, taped Dec. 5, puts the spotlight on this year's honorees and their achievements that have earned them these plaudits: the stage director George Abbott, the actress Lillian Gish, the clarinetist Benny Goodman, the dancer Gene Kelly and the conductor Eugene Ormandy.

1100-> PANEL CUTS $508 MILLION IN PERSHING MISSILE FUNDS
The House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense has cut $508.6 million in funds to produce Pershing II medium-range missiles, jeopardizing the planned deployment of the nuclear missiles in Europe late next year. At the same time, the subcommittee approved funds for the MX missile and two nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, for continuing production of the B-1 long-range bomber and for resuming production of the C-5 air transport, all of which have been targets for those trying to cut military spending. The Pershing program is among the Reagan Administration's top priorities and is intended to reaffirm the United States' commitment to Western Europe and to give America's allies a strong bargaining tool in arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union. Henry E. Catto Jr., the Defense Department's chief spokesman, called the cut in Pershing funds ''a dreadful mistake.'' Administration officials said they would try to restore the funds as the bill moved to the full committee, to the House floor and to a conference committee, where it would be reconciled with the Senate version. Representative Joseph P. Addabbo, chairman of the subcommittee, announced this morning that the cut had been made Monday in a closed meeting. Mr. Addabbo, a Queens Democrat, also said the subcommittee had restricted funds for the Navy's F-18 Hornet light bomber until it met Navy standards. Mr. Addabbo said he had presented the committee with a list that would cut $11 billion from the $214 billion military appropriations bill. Congressional officials said Monday he had hoped to cut $20 billion from the bill. But the Congressman said funds had been trimmed from many items in the first two days of the session; other members estimated that $16 to $17 billion would be cut before a bill was sent to the full committee. Earlier, the Senate Appropriations Committee cut $12 billion from its version of the bill. The subcommittee's actions represent the first challenge to the Administration's military budget since the Nov. 2 Congressional elections, and the bill will provide a test in the post-election session of the depth of Congressional sentiment for cutting the Administration's military budget. Members of the subcommittee said the Pershing program was voted down because of concern over the technical problems encountered by the missile. In its first field test, it blew up several seconds after being launched. Two other tests were postponed. The Administration plans to field 108 Pershing missiles in West Germany, Italy and Britain beginning in December 1983. West German officials recently warned that a failure to meet that deadline, even if for technical reasons, would add impetus to the antinuclear movement in Europe. On the F-18, Mr. Addabbo said that funds had been approved for the fighter version because the Marine Corps needed it. But he added that, on the light bomber version, ''we have locked in the money until the Navy certifies that it reaches the supposed requirements.'' The F-18 has come under criticism as Navy pilots, after a fivemonth operational test, found it unsuitable as a light bomber. The F-18 was designed to operate either as a fighter or a light bomber. The Navy plans to buy 1,366 F-18's for $40 billion in coming years. ---- Arms Cost Estimates Rise WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (Reuters) -The Defense Department announced today that cost estimates for its 40 largest weapons systems rose by about $1.2 billion over estimates three months ago. The Pentagon said in its quarterly cost estimate report to Congress that as of Sept. 30, the cost of the major systems now being developed, produced or planned was $455.6 billion, up from $454.4 billion last June 30. Twothirds of the increase was attributed to inflation, and the rest to new price estimates.

1101-> PIANO: CLAUDE FRANK PLAYS BEETHOVEN
THERE is a nobility in failure, particularly if the attempt is as thoughtful and refined as Claude Frank's was Saturday afternoon in Alice Tully Hall, and particularly if the attempt is to play a composition as willfully difficult and stubbornly sublime as Beethoven's ''Hammerklavier'' Sonata. The pianist may not have bound the work into a convincing whole; he may not have made its brooding fantasy compelling; there were even moments when there should have been more bombast, more reckless lyricism. But Mr. Frank never let a listener forget that this was a masterwork; the impression left was not of a pianist who failed, but astonishment at the nature of the music itself. Drawing attention to the composition rather than to the instrumentalist is something Mr. Frank was also able to do in his performances earlier in the program of Beethoven sonatas. The idiosyncrasies of the Sonata in C (Op. 2, No. 3) occasionally led Mr. Frank astray. But as in the Sonata in G (Op. 14, No. 2) the playing was limpid, finely detailed; no phrase was left to fend for itself. The music's argument unfolded with elegance and wit. At all times, Mr. Frank nobly let the music speak for itself.

1102-> GOING OUT GUIDE
SPANISH The Spanish Institute works out of a handsome neo-Federal style townhouse at 684 Park Avenue at 68th Street (628-0420), and it does culturally for Spain what its similarly housed next-door neighbor, the Center for Inter-American Relations, does for the Americas. There is a constant coming and going of events, gatherings, screenings and exhibitions. The exhibition now on view in the Hastings Gallery, through Dec. 17, on the ground floor, is particularly interesting to the esthete with a taste for modern. It consists of 28 drawings and graphics by nine 20th-century Spanish artists, pieces done on paper and borrowed from the collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, uptown on Fifth Avenue. A walk through this exhibition prompts wonder at the fact that Spain did indeed produce so many contemporary artists whose names achieved worldwide familiarity. The artists include Miro, Picasso and Dali, whose ''Neptune in Center'' (1947) is, by dint of color and largeness and placement on the center of the wall to the rear, most quickly draws the eye. Others are Genoves, Chillida, Zush, Gonzales, Saura and Guinovart. The work does represent the span of the century thus far, from Picasso's etching, ''Les Pauvres'' of 1905 to Chillida's untitled 1980 woodblock print. There are many styles and approaches, each highly individualistic, but all sharing the Iberian peninsula as birthplace for this creativity. Open free from noon to 6 P.M. Mondays through Fridays (not Thanksgiving Day). BAND STAND The bands will be marching down amid the big balloons in the Thanksgiving Day parade tomorrow, but it is necessary to reach perfection before the big show. That is why the All American Band, 104 high school music makers assembled for the 16th year from all corners of the land by the McDonald's Corporation, will turn up for dress rehearsal at 9:30 this morning at Central Park's Great Lawn. The band has two members from each of the states and the District of Columbia and one each from the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. It also will play at the Tournament of Roses in Pasadena on New Year's Day. The Great Lawn is in Central Park above 81st Street. You may look on for free. If it rains, the rehearsal will be in the Bronx, at the Kingsbridge Armory, 29 West Kingsbridge Road. Information: 867-8750. MIME TIME The San Francisco Mime Troupe is back in town with a new show. During its visit, it will perform from today through Sunday at 8 (also Sunday at 2) in Washington Square Church, 135 West Fourth Street (228-1499). The piece on deck is a musical, ''Americans, or Last Tango in Huahuatenango,'' a satirical yarn written after a visit to Nicaragua and one that is critical of American policy in Central America. A five-piece band makes the music, while the cast of 13 mimes DRAWING CARDS The neophyte student of American art need only walk through the duplex quarters of Hirschl & Adler Galleries, 21 East 70th Street (535-8810) to get a quick course. The show there through Jan. 8, ''Lines of Different Charater -American Art from 1727 to 1947,'' consists of 90 pieces spanning our history. One may, perhaps, see much the same, and more, at some of the city's fine museums, but here the quantity is manageable and may be absorbed in one visit. The exhibition's focus is on drawing as an underlying basis for the development of the style of an artist, and shows how artists contemporary with each other approached similar problems in entirely different ways, according to perceptions of line. This broad sweep of Americana takes the visitor through works of Winslow Homer, Henri Delattre, Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh, John Trumbull, Paul Manship, Albert Bierstadt and Childe Hassam. Mary Cassatt, among the 75 artists represented here. They drew America in all of its variety, from steerage to the grand, unopened West, from the Declaration of Independence signing to night clubbing and they also painted what caught their eyes when abroad.

1103-> Sarah Jennings, a Teacher, And Louis Zeppieri Marry
Sarah Dormer Jennings, daughter of Eloise S. Jennings of Manhasset, L.I., and the late Dr. Frank Dormer Jennings, was married yesterday to Louis E. Zeppieri, son of Mr. and Mrs. Orlando Zeppieri of Brookville, L.I. The Rev. Lawrence D. Costello performed the ceremony at St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church in Manhasset. The bride, a physical-education teacher with the Shelter Rock School in Manhasset, graduated cum laude from Dean Junior College in Franklin, Mass., and the State University of New York at Cortland. Her father was clinical professor of dermatology at the State University of New York Medical Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Zeppieri is secretary of the Hicksville Cement Corporation and the Garden City Trans-Mix Corporation, of which his father is president. He graduated from Hartwick College in Oneonta, N.Y.

1104-> HUNGARY REAPS HARVEST OF ITS SHOWPLACE FARMS
Day after day, tractors pulling wagons laden with shining silver-green grapes chug along the roads in and around this village of 13,000 in the hills west of Budapest. The harvest is under way at the Mor state farm, and the news here and elsewhere in Hungary is good: once again, Eastern Europe's most successful farming country will have bumper crops. While Poland and Rumania and the Soviet Union struggle with food shortages, Hungary's wheat yield will approach 14 million tons, just shy of the 1980 record, and its vineyards, such as the one here, will make possible one of the highest levels of wine production in this country in recent years. Rich soil, especially in the Danube plain, plays its part, of course, and so does the native talent and industry of the Hungarian peasant. Then, too, the bureaucrats in Budapest have avoided some of the mistakes of their colleagues in other Communist countries: despite the recession, Hungary kept importing spare parts for farm machinery. This was not the case in Czechoslovakia, where the wheat harvest was spoiled this fall because the inevitable breakdowns of combines could not be fixed in time. But the most important factor in Hungary's continuing agricultural success story, analysts here agree, is the variety and flexibility that has been encouraged by the Government of Janos Kadar. Pal Tressler, an agricultural economist who heads the big Petofi farm cooperative at Dunavarsany, south of Budapest, says that the Government has for a quarter of a century ''provided a stable political atmosphere in which Hungarian agriculture could flourish.'' Putting the same idea into blunter words, he added, ''Everyone, including Kadar, keeps his nose out of agriculture.'' Important for Two Reasons The health of Hungarian farming is important for two reasons in helping to maintain a much higher standard of living here than elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Despite adverse price trends, foodstuffs account for about a quarter of total exports, and they earn hard currencies. The Babolna state farm sells chickens to the Middle East, Mor sells wine in vast quantities to the Swedish alcohol monopoly, and Hungarian salamis show up in shops in New York, Paris and London. ''The farms are our safety net,'' says Andras Sugar, Hungary's top television journalist. ''Industrial sales are terrible this year, but we can still sell our wheat and meat for hard currency.'' Perhaps even more significant is Hungary's ability to keep its own population well-fed - a key element in a country where good eating is a tradition - creating a sense of well-being and political satisfaction. Lines outside food stores, so common in Moscow, Bucharest and Warsaw, are unknown in Budapest. Hungarians grumble constantly about high prices, but the grumbling is good-natured, and whatever deprivations they suffer tend to take the form of inaccessible luxuries. The recent price rises, Western economists calculate, have caused genuine hardship for less than 10 percent of the population. A Female Pensioner's Lot Maria Kovacs, 58 years old, is a typical case. From her pension (Hungarian women retire at 55), from part-time work as a telephone operator and from her two sons and daughter-in-law, who share her apartment, she has a monthly income of about $235. She says that ''a couple of rolls, a piece of sausage and one or two other things come to 100 forints'' - about $2.65 - ''and then you can't afford any more.'' But the family - Mrs. Kovacs is divorced - manages to eat well. The only things it denies itself on a daily basis are beer, wine and soft drinks. The Soviet Union, one of Hungary's best customers for fruits, vegetables and poultry, has watched what has been happening here with not a little envy. Leonid I. Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, has told other Eastern European countries that they should study Hungarian methods, and this summer big delegations of farming experts from the Soviet Union and Poland toured the country. A handful of purely private farms still exist in Hungary, and there are 130 state farms such as the one at Mor, where the Government owns the land. But the biggest share of the land -more than 70 percent - is tilled by 1,360 cooperatives, which range in size from 50 to more than 60,000 acres. Besides owning a share of the common land, members of the cooperatives have the right to private plots of land of a little more than an acre. Although small, these have proved to be the most efficient means of producing certain commodities, accounting for 40 percent of the national poultry output and 60 percent of the national production of pork. At some cooperatives only a minority of the members actually work on the common land. The rest, under a new system introduced recently, make small items - beer pumps, hatchet handles, plastic dog bones - that big state industries find it uneconomic to produce. Innovation in Many Fields The various activities complement each other. Small manufacturing projects provide money for agricultural investment and insurance against poor harvests caused by adverse weather. Similarly, the cooperative sells breeding stock and fodder to the individual plotholders, who can then choose whether to market fattened animals themselves or sell them back to the cooperative, which will do the marketing for them. Innovation has also come in recent months to the state farms, some of which are considered by Western experts to be notably well-run. At Mor the work on a 10,000-acre spread that was assembled from 314 small farms is done by 790 employees, including 32 academically trained agronomists. They are paid a salary and, if there is a profit, as much as a full month's extra salary at the end of the year. In addition to wine, which is bottled on the farm, Mor produces wheat and fruit. Up-to-date farm equipment, some of it made in Hungary and some of it imported from Eastern and Western Europe or the United States, makes it possible to do many farm chores with minimum labor. But, until this year, the blackberry harvest has presented a difficult problem every fall, because it does not easily lend itself to mechanization. The solution was arrived at by leasing the right to pick the berries to a group of employees and selling the fruit back to the state at a prearranged price. After the cost of the lease had been deducted, as well as a fee for the use of state equipment, the 125 workers made profits ranging from $550 to $1,100 apiece for their efforts. Partnership With State ''With the manpower we had available,'' said Zoltan Velez, the burly farm manager, who has just returned from a trip to the American Middle West, ''it would have taken us a month to harvest the berries. A lot of them would have spoiled. But these people mobilized their relatives and friends - about 2,000 people in all - and they did the job in three days. ''Both partners, the state and the workers, got a good deal, and we are looking for ways to extend the system.'' Mr. Velez, who thinks competition is a good thing, has a private plot of his own, and along with five friends grows grapes that go into wine that competes with the state farm's products. It is a good arrangement, he said, ''not only because it satisfies a man's pride,'' but because it leads to the production of ''more and cheaper and better farm goods.''

1105-> BURIED THORIUM ALARMS COMMUNITY
MAYWOOD KARIN MITCHELL keeps her 9-month-old son out of the backyard as much as possible, and her neighbor, Frances Cielo, has been advised by government officials to spend as little time as possible in her bedroom. The reason, according to state and Federal agencies, is low-level radiation from contaminated landfill laced with thorium. Seven families along Davidson and Latham Streets in this middle-class Bergen County community of 10,000 face the problem, and chances of removing the contamination are either nonexistent or years off. For the last two years, or ever since the minute radiation levels were accidentally discovered at three areas in the borough, residents have called upon local, state and Federal officials to investigate the potential health hazard and pay for its removal. But according to the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, the municipality may not qualify for assistance. The low-level radiation is not an immediate threat to health and public safety, said John D. Kinneman, who heads the Nuclear Materials Section of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The section, which is based in King of Prussia, Pa., has been monitoring the levels since November 1980. It was then that a local radiologist detected an elevated radiation count while searching for canisters filled with radioactive materials that had accidentally fallen from a truck on a nearby highway. The thorium was traced to the Maywood Chemical Works, which processed the compound from 1915 to 1956. Prior to and during World War II, the company operated under Federal contract, supplying the Defense Department with the thorium for naval munitions use and dumping processed byproducts on its own property. (Maywood Chemical went out of business in the mid-50's. The plant is now operated by the Stepan Chemical Company, but no longer produces thorium.) Residents agree that the radiation, at its present level, presents no immediate threat, but their concern is over long-term exposure, especially for families with young children. ''From what I understand, the problem on Davidson and Latham Streets started when the area was being developed,'' said Richard A. Fiore, the Maywood Municipal Attorney. He explained that a Maywood Chemical employee carted off truckloads of soil from a dumping area on plant property for use as topsoil in his backyard. Subsequently, as new houses were built in the area, neighbors were given or bought the same fill for their properties. ''Who knew about radiation then?'' Mr. Fiore asked. Town officials say that an expensive cleanup operation must take place soon to assure that property values in the area do not drop. According to Vincent Greber, the borough's Health Inspector, and officials of the state's Department of Environmental Protection, the cost of removing the contaminated soil was $225,000 two and a half years ago, but would probably be well over $1 million today. The increase in cost results from the discovery of two additional contaminated land areas, licensing fees (each state requires special permits to transport such material across it) and the construction of special containers to carry the soil. The material would have to be transported to Richland, Wash., the only place in the United States having a dump site that accepts newly found radioactive waste materials. ''If the Federal and state governments don't provide cleanup funds, the borough is in no position to take on the responsibility itself,'' Mr. Fiore said. Town officials have applied to the E.P.A. for aid under its ''superfund'' cleanup project, which has earmarked $1.6 billion in Federal money for waste removal in locations where materials have posed a threat to the environment and people. Mr. Fiore contends that the Federal Government has been slow in recognizing Maywood's problem because the ''superfund'' was initially created to remove toxic-waste materials threatening water sources, and not radiation. Even if Maywood gets financial aid, Mr. Fiore and Mr. Greber say, contamination removal probably would receive a low priority. This is because only seven families are directly affected, they note, compared to hundreds or thousands of people in other parts of the country. ''The problem is very real to us,'' Mr. Fiore said. ''We just had to convince the right people that this problem deserves immediate attention.'' John Czapor, a spokesman for the E.P.A., concedes that radiation contamination in Maywood deserves consideration, but noted that numerous communities in the state also had applied for cleanup aid. According to E.P.A. officials, 400 sites across the country will be chosen for the $1.6 billion in ''superfund'' aid. Of those, 160 have been made public; the remaining 240 sites will be disclosed at the end of the year, Mr. Czapor said. Some 90 applications have come from New Jersey. Mr. Czapor emphasized that the E.P.A. was weighing radiation contamination problems as well as toxic-waste spills, adding that qualification requirements for aid were numerous. In a criterion called the Hazards Ranking System, an applicant municipality is judged, in terms of priority, as to its population, the toxicity of the hazardous material and the quantity of such material either in the air, water source or soil. Maywood officials say that if state and Federal aid does not relieve the hazards, the borough may be forced to bring legal action against the state and Federal governments to protect the interests of Maywood residents. ''My husband and I bought this house well under the market value a year ago, with the hope that the problem would be cleared away,'' Mrs. Mitchell said. If relief is not foreseeable, she said, the family might have to sell its home at a loss. David Babcock, who moved into the Davidson Avenue neighborhood with his family nearly three years ago -that is, before the thorium contamination was detected - has no intention of moving. ''It took my life's savings to buy my home,'' he said, ''and I'm not about to leave.''

1106-> RURAL JUSTICE ON TRIAL IN LAWSUIT OVER RIGHTS
In a few days, a jury in the nation's capital will deliver a verdict in a case in which the jurors have been asked to sit in judgment of justice in a small Kentucky town. Two former civil rights workers, Alan and Margaret McSurely, are seeking money damages in a lawsuit in which they contend their constitutional rights were violated when they were prosecuted on charges of contempt of Congress and sedition. Under the sedition charge, they were accused of advocating the violent overthrow of the United States and Kentucky governments. With either pride or disdain, witnesses in the Federal district court case here have described the system that ensnared the McSurelys as they tried to build support for the black power movement in Pikeville, Ky., in 1967. From the outset of the trial, a lawyer for a former Pike County Attorney, Thomas Ratliff, who is one of the defendants, made it clear that the jurors would sit in judgment of rural justice. ''The events took place in small-town America,'' Michael Levy, the attorney, said in his opening statement. ''We have to go back in time and distance to Pikeville, Ky., population 5,000, deeply religious, deeply patriotic, deeply moralistic, and dry.'' Others Named in Suit Besides suing the man who prosecuted them, the McSurelys also sued the estates of the late Senator John L. McClellan of Arkansas and two deceased Senate staff members, all of whom were involved in an investigation of race riots. The investigators said they were interested in documents seized from the McSurelys to determine if the couple were involved in the riots. When testimony ends, in about a week, the jurors, one man and five women, will decide whether the defendants' actions against the McSurelys violated their constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure, and if so, whether damages should be awarded for loss of employment, invasion of privacy and embarrassment. The McSurelys' troubles began on Aug. 11, 1967, when their former landlord swore in a complaint that they possessed materials designed to overthrow the government. Acting on the basis of that complaint, the County Attorney drew up an arrest warrant. The county judge, who was not a lawyer, signed it. The county sheriff, accompanied by about a dozen armed deputies, arrested the McSurelys and carted away their possessions. A separate search warrant told him to seize all seditious materials. A Federal court later said the raid violated the couple's constitutional rights and it ruled that Kentucky's sedition law was contrary to the United States Constitution. The three-judge Federal court panel said the McSurelys were prosecuted mainly to stop their community organizing activities. In Washington, a citizen's criminal complaint would, in most cases, go to a prosecutor and then to a judge, who could sign it only after finding ''probable cause'' to believe a crime was committed. McSurelys Now Divorced From the witness stand, the McSurelys, both now 46 years old and divorced, said they felt horror and fear when the sheriff seized their belongings. They said the items taken from them were nothing more than books of poetry, psychology, Marxism, fiction and a manual on training cats. There were also Government pamphlets and Margaret McSurely's love letters from the years before she and Mr. McSurely were married. Several of the love letters were from the columnist, Drew Pearson, who at one time was Margaret McSurely's employer. The McSurelys assert that Senator McClellan, a bitter enemy of Mr. Pearson, who is now dead, ''used the investigation to carry out a personal vendetta'' against the columnist. Senator McClellan subpoenaed the documents taken from the McSurely home. The McSurelys refused to comply and were convicted of contempt of Congress. The conviction was later reversed by a Federal appeals court, which held that the documents had been seized illegally. Another view of the McSurelys was offered by Mr. Ratliff, who said the documents taken in the raid included diagrams on making firebombs and books on how to use explosives.

1107-> News Summary; WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 17, 1982
International Soviet and Chinese Foreign Ministers met in Moscow for 90 minutes in the highest-level encounter the two countries have had in 13 years. The meeting was held in the context of the gathering of foreign dignitaries for the funeral of Leonid I. Brezhnev. Tass said the two ministers had reaffirmed an accord to continue the discussions agreed upon last month in Peking. (Page A1, Columns 1-3.) A cooling in Iraqi-Soviet ties was suggested by President Saddam Hussein. Speaking at a news conference in Baghdad, he said that the Iraqi-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation ''has not worked'' during the war with Iran, and he indicated he was moving gingerly toward improving relations with the United States. (A3:1-4.) Bonn's most-wanted terrorist fugitive was arrested by the police outside Hamburg where he was digging an underground arms dump. Thirty-year-old Christian Klar was seized only five days after the capture in a Frankfurt suburb of two other remaining leaders of the Red Army Faction. (A15:1-3.) The biggest group of human skeletons surviving from Roman times has been unearthed at Herculaneum, a town buried in the same volcanic eruption that destroyed Pompeii, anthropologists reported. They said the finding of more than 80 skeletons was providing new insights into the instantaneous deaths suffered by victims of the eruption of Vesuvius 1,900 years ago. The human remains are expected to yield a rich lode of scientific information about the lives and health of typical Roman citizens. (A1:4-6.) National President Reagan defended his economic program against rising Congressional criticism, denying that increased military spending would compound the recession and extolling the scheduled 1983 income tax cut. In a speech in New Orleans presaging his coming budget battle with Congress, Mr. Reagan said that ''compromise must not mean incremental retreat on principle.'' (A1:6.) More voice in White House decisions will be demanded by House Republican leaders. They agreed to take this tack in light of this month's Democratic election gains. (A23:1.) Moving up the 1983 income tax cut from July to January is being considered by Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan as a way to stimulate the economy, according to Administration officials. They said Mr. Regan was weighing a plan for a tax-cut bill in the special Congressional session that begins Nov. 29. (A1:5.) A tentative pact in the football strike was agreed upon. If ratified, the agreement would allow the National Football League season to resume Sunday. Under the tentative accord, each team would play seven more games in the regular season, which would end Jan. 2, a week later than originally scheduled, and then the playoffs would begin with 16 teams, six more than usual. Super Bowl XVII would be played as originally scheduled, Jan. 30, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. (A1:2.) The Columbia landed smoothly on a concrete runway in southern California's Mojave Desert for the successful conclusion of the space shuttle's first operational mission. Space agency officials hailed the five-day orbital flight as the beginning of regular and more frequent space shuttle operations, with five more missions scheduled in the coming year. (A24:1-5.) A defense of the nuclear arms policies of the Reagan Administration was made by the White House national security adviser, William P. Clark. In a letter to the nation's Roman Catholic bishops, Mr. Clark put forward the position that the Administration's policies were guided by compelling moral considerations. (A1:1.) Edwin Meese 3d was involved in establishing the system to select which young men who refused to register for a military draft would be prosecuted, according to documents made available by the American Civil Liberties Union and introduced in a Los Angeles trial. The case against David Wayte, a former Yale University philosophy student who publicly opposed registration, was dismissed by a Federal District judge in part because Mr. Meese, President Reagan's counselor, refused to testify. (A22:3-4.) The jury in the gun-smuggling trial of Edwin P. Wilson began deliberations after a day and a half of testimony by 11 witnesses. The Government has charged the former American intelligence agent with orchestrating the smuggling of arms for Libya. (A16:1.) Metropolitan A court order against the Yankees has been obtained by New York City in an effort to prevent the team from playing its first three home games in April in Denver instead of at Yankee Stadium. At issue is when construction work now under way in the stadium will be completed. (A1:3-4.) Appeals for water conservation have been issued by New York State and New York City to safeguard dwindling reservoir supplies in regions covering 30 counties. (B1:4.) Budget-balancing plans for New York City were outlined to city and state officials by Mayor Koch. He presented a ''fact sheet'' that showed his administration's plans for a reduced work force and hopes for the City Council and the State Legislature to approve $22 million in increased taxes in the present fiscal year and $200 million in the next fiscal year.

1108-> 2 Steelmakers Plan Closings
Two steel companies announced they were closing down some of their operations because of lack of demand for the product. The Republic Steel Corporation said it would close its coke producing plant at Youngstown, Ohio, about Dec.1 in order to bring raw materials in line with demand for steel. The action will idle about 260 employees. The company, which had a total of 39,000 employees at the start of this year, has laid off 14,000 so far this year and an additional 4,000 workers are on short workweeks. Roblin Industries said it had notified all its employees that it is shutting down its entire steel producing operation including plants at Dunkirk and North Tonawanda, N.Y. on Nov. 19.

1109-> Icahn Broadens Dan River Offer
Carl C. Icahn and his affiliated companies said they had broadened a tender offer to increase their stake in Dan River Inc., a textile concern that is fighting the group's advances. Mr. Icahn, through his Icahn Capital Corporation and other companies, already owns 15 percent of Dan River. The Icahn group said it would increase an earlier unconditional offer to $16.50 a share, from $15, for up to 2 million shares, instead of the original 700,000. If the new offer is successful, it would give the Icahn group just under 50 percent of Dan River. The group also said that its bid for 3.1 million shares at $18 each would proceed if Dan River agrees to its conditions no later than next Tuesday.

1110-> WASHINGTON; Reagan's Man In Bonn
The best spokesman for the United States in Europe these days is Arthur Burns, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and now, at the age of 77, President Reagan's Ambassador to West Germany. He lives along the Rhine in a comfortable old mansion outside Bad Godesberg, looking up at the Hotel Petersburg - that symbol of appeasement where the British Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, stayed at one point during his 1938 negotiations with Hitler for what he called ''peace in our time.'' It may be that Ambassador Burns is effective here precisely because he stays in touch with everybody and appeases nobody - not even his own colleagues in the White House and the Treasury - when he thinks they're wrong. And also because he analyzes the passing differences within the alliance from the perspective of history and speaks with carefully controlled eloquence. For example, he addressed the annual meeting of the Commanders of the German Federal Armed Forces at Hagen the other day, and dealt with what he called ''the mutual ignorance'' on both sides of the Atlantic of each other's contribution to the common defense. He praised the West Germans for the excellence of their fighting forces, for the high state of readiness of their military reserves and their recent decision to commit some 90,000 reservists in support of American combat troops in the event of war. Unlike the United States, West Germany maintains a military draft, and if war did break out, Ambassador Burns observed, the major part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's land, naval and air forces would at the beginning be European. At the same time, he added, the European allies repeatedly inform us that they cannot play an active military role outside of Europe and that worldwide crisis management must be left to the United States. But when America took on this responsibility to counter aggression by the Soviet Union and its surrogates in Afghanistan, Southeast Asia, Poland, Africa or Central America, he complained, it was apt to be criticized for what it did, or how it did it, or both. ''The time is certainly ripe,'' Mr. Burns said, ''for some adjustment in national attitudes on both sides of the Atlantic. ... This year's unseemly post-Versailles spectacle of various national spokesmen making statements of who 'won' and who 'lost' must not be repeated.'' Ambassador Burns agreed that consultation among the allies was inadequate, untimely or both - a constant complaint in Europe - and that precious time and capital were wasted on ''passing disagreements'' instead of concentrating on ''fundamental differences.'' There were at least two of these, he said: first, the United States had to take a global view of world politics whereas the European allies insisted on a limited ''regional'' view. And second, East-West relations were viewed quite differently for historic, geographic or economic reasons. ''Let us not shy away from admitting that there is a major difference in perception here,'' Dr. Burns told the generals. ''My Government has become doubtful about the advantages of detente. Your Government, on the other hand, perceives continuing benefits.'' It is interesting that Ambassador Burns can make such criticisms without creating resentment. This is partly because his analysis is balanced and his language moderate and courteous- and also because he is recognized as a distinguished economist whose views are sought and respected here on financial matters that increasingly puzzle all the allied nations. ''We must do better within our NATO countries, especially in your country and mine,'' he concluded, ''in teaching young people that our shared moral and political values have great significance for their own and their country's future.'' ''It appears to me,'' he added, ''that some young citizens on both sides of the Atlantic at times take an almost perverse delight in exaggerating differences among our nations. Their belittling or totally dismissing the values that bind us together in NATO fills me with sadness. ...'' Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt expressed in private here this week their admiration and affection for Dr. Burns. His advice is not always taken here or in Washington, but that doesn't bother him either. There are some advantages to being 77, he thinks -but not many.

1111-> LIMITS ON DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF TV COMMERCIALS ARE DROPPED
The broadcasting industry and the Justice Department agreed today to eliminate restraints on the duration of television commercials. The consent decree, later signed by Federal District Judge Harold H. Greene, also raised the possibility that eventually all restrictions would be dropped, including those governing the content of advertising, according to broadcasting officials. The decision settles an antitrust suit that the Justice Department brought against the National Association of Broadcasters on July 14, 1979, charging that it was illegal for the members of the trade group to agree to restrict advertising. The three major networks and their affiliates are members of the industry's leading trade group. Although it is a party to the agreement, the association issued a strongly worded statement against it. 3 Limitations Eliminated ''This is a sad day for the American public,'' Edward O. Fritts, president of the association, said. ''Pure and simple, today's action means that the Government does not want television broadcasters to attempt to govern themselves by voluntarily limiting the amount of advertising broadcast into the public's homes.'' The agreement eliminates rules that restricted advertising to one product in each 30-second spot, limited the stations to broadcasting no more than five consecutive advertisements and limited advertising to no more than 8 1/2 minutes an hour. The effect of the decree is to eliminate a voluntary code developed by the broadcasting industry 30 years ago. In New York, representatives of CBS-TV, NBC-TV and ABC-TV indicated that the decree would have no immediate effect on the frequency and content of advertising. They said any change would be likely to come from independent stations. Signs of Community Resistance After the litigation began, the association voluntarily suspended the codes not involved with time, those not mentioned in the Justice Department's complaint, including restrictions against the advertising of liquor and contraceptive devices. In the absence of the restrictions, there has been speculation that individual stations might, gingerly at first, venture into some of the taboo areas. There have been signs, however, that local communities may hold in reserve sanctions much more powerful than those of the association or the Government. The association said that it would meet on dealing with rules not mentioned in the decree. Even though the ''voluntary'' agreements are suspended, the F.C.C. still maintains at least one guideline that restricts advertising time. No more than 16 minutes of commercial time are permitted each hour, with the ceiling lifted somewhat during campaign periods. Broadcasters often refer to this position as the ''raised eyebrow,'' because it is not a law but only a guideline that, if exceeded, might cause the F.C.C. to examine all of a station's practices closely at the time of license renewal. Generally speaking, however, the F.C.C. in recent years has paid little attention to regulation of program content, mostly because of the general movement toward deregulation. Moreover, Mark S. Fowler, chairman of the commission, has said he wants to dergulate television entirely, so broadcasters would be as free to operate as newspapers, with no limits on amounts or types of advertising. Deregulation of Radio Few officials expect any immediate reaction from the industry or the stations, such as a sudden increase in advertising time - if for no other reason than that the soft economy has resulted in declining purchases of advertising time. In addition, the networks have their own separate regulations governing advertising. ''We have heard of no violations since the codes have been voluntarily suspended,'' Shaun Sheehan, a spokesman for the broadcasters' association, said. ''If revenues drop, however, it is difficult to tell what individual, hard-pressed stations might do.'' Radio has been largely deregulated by action of the F.C.C. and Congress. With the lifting of advertising rules that governed radio some months ago, a Boston station put on commercials for vodka. But community pressure forced a withdrawal of the commercials. Last summer, WTHR-TV of Indianapolis conducted market surveys to learn if its community might accept liquor advertising. A resounding note of opposition caused the station to drop the idea. Questions About Consultations ''The preachers beat them to death,'' an official of the broadcasters' association said. The general manager of the station did not return telephone calls. The broadcasters' association, in a long statement, reacted angrily to striking down the code. The association charged, in effect, that the Government's suit was filed mostly as ''an academic exercise within the Justice Department'' and added, ''The academicians may have won, but the public certainly is the loser.'' The association criticized the Government for failing to interview the advertising industry, ''which has publicly supported our code since the initiation of the suit.'' ---- Little Effect Forecast Officials at the three major networks said in New York yesterday that the decree on the code governing adverstising on television would have no effect on the amount of advertising or its content on their stations. Some officials speculated, however, that small stations might decide to show commercials for liquor and other products that had been proscribed. ''After the cancellation of the N.A.B. code some months ago, CBS reviewed and issued its own unilateral guidelines governing advertising acceptance,'' Gene Mater, senior vice president for policy of the CBS Broadcast Group, said. ''Therefore, the decree approved today will not have impact on us.'' Guidelines Resemble Old Code M.S. Rukeyser of NBC said: ''NBC's advertising-acceptance policies are set by the NBC broadcast-standards code. Today's decision will have no effect on those policies.'' Jeff Tolvin of ABC said that ''ABC has our own set of guidelines, and we are continuing to use it.'' At each network, the executives said, the guidelines regulating advertising content and frequency not only resemble the old code, but in a number of cases they are even more stringent.

1113-> THOMAS'S SUES TO KEEP ENGLISH MUFFIN SECRETS
All English muffins are not created equal. And the bakers at Thomas's aim to keep it that way. The nation's leading muffin maker is going to court to prevent three former employees from revealing a 102-year-old secret - how to make muffins with lots of yawning nooks and crannies to hold the melted butter, as the advertisements say. S.B. Thomas Inc. of Totowa, N.J., filed suit in New Jersey to keep the former employees from giving the English muffin recipe to their new employer - and Thomas's new competitor - Entenmann. Michael Sayeau, a spokesman for CPC International Inc., Thomas's parent company, said he believed there was ''a possibility'' that the former employees divulged trade secrets. Jack Sholl, a spokesman for the Warner-Lambert Company, parent of Entenmann, said the suit has ''no merit'' but declined further comment. Thomas's English Muffins and the recipe the company calls ''original and distinctive'' have been around since 1880. Entenmann, another old baking name, recently developed its own English muffin and has been test-marketing the product. The American Institute of Baking would not say which it prefers, but did admit that those nooks and crannies for butter and jam are the key to quality English muffins. ''The air pockets - that's the trick to making English muffins,'' said Don Dubois, director of experimental baking and technical assistance for the institute, in Manhattan, Kan. ''They all try, some with more success.'' ''Without holes,'' he said, ''all you'd have would be a hamburger bun.'' The nooks and crannies are created by using certain chemicals, baking at certain temperatures and judicious use of water, Mr. Dubois said. English muffins, round and less than an inch thick, are usually served split and toasted. Although their heritage is English, they have only recently returned to that country, where they are called ''Yankee Doodles.'' The first muffins were made from leftover dough, which gave them a sour flavor, and they were cooked on a griddle in oil. Later, flour replaced oil and rice replaced flour. Today's muffin is baked on cornmeal. About 335 million pounds of English muffins were made in the United States in 1977, according to the most recent Commerce Department figures. Milling and Baking News, a trade journal based in Kansas City, Mo., says about 100 bakers in all 50 states make English muffins and muffin sales have grown rapidly in recent years.

1114-> 3 Major TV Networks To Cover Launching
The three major television networks said they would provide live coverage of today's space shuttle launching on their regularly scheduled morning news shows. CBS said it would broadcast the launching on the ''CBS Morning News.'' NBC said it would broadcast it on the ''Today'' show. ABC said it would interrupt ''Good Morning America'' at various times from 7:09 to 7:19 for coverage.

1115-> CAIN AND KRAL-AFTER 33 YEARS, STILL GROWING
Pop singers of the 30's, 40's and 50's have, as a rule, not aged particularly well. They had their day when they were young and then, if they stayed around, settled into a predictable performing style based partly on nostalgia, partly on the fading capabilities of their voices. In view of the radical change in pop singing styles brought on by rock and roll, no one would expect - or would want - the earlier generation of pop singers to change their musical colors completely. But it is surprising how few of that generation of singers have grown once they passed a youthful peak. One of the most striking instances is Frank Sinatra, largely because he had stayed at the top for so long that it seemed only the natural course of events when his singing career began to fade as he reached his late 50's. But Mr. Sinatra pulled himself up by his bootstraps 30 years ago when he appeared to have gone into a decline. And as he entered his 60's (he is now 66), he took a new lease on his singing life by seemingly putting more thought, more care and more effort into his vocal projection than he ever had in his younger days when it all came more easily. Mel Torme, at 57, has followed a much more consistent path of growth than Mr. Sinatra, steadily increasing his vocal range and interpretive skills during the 35 years since he was huskily singing as ''The Velvet Fog.'' And Vic Damone, who is now 54, has aged successfully in still another way: he has always been one of the best pop singers of his generation but is only now beginning to get the recognition that his ability deserves. Jackie Cain and Roy Kral have developed in a different fashion from these solo singers. They have been a singing duo, with Mr. Kral on piano as both accompanist and jazz soloist, for 33 years (they have also been married for 33 years). From their beginnings as a team with Charlie Ventura's orchestra, they used a crisp mixture of jazz singing and tightly-organized vocal duets (arrangements by Mr. Kral) in which they swung through tongue-tangling lyrics with great dexterity. Initially, this gave them a distinctive identity. But, as the years and the decades rolled by, this identity sometimes became a burden, limiting them to what was expected of them. As a means of moving out from this in recent years, Miss Cain has been putting more emphasis on her potential as a soloist and they have developed an accompanying group that is an unusually good jazz ensemble. But basically they were still tied to the style with which they had been identified for three decades until, in 1979, they were urged, somewhat against their will, to do a program of songs by Stephen Sondheim, whose work they had previously shied away from. When they introduced their Sondheim material at Michael's Pub in February 1979, it received excellent critical notices and, last July, they came back to the same place with an updated version of the program. After three weeks of nightly performances, it was recorded by Finesse Records and has been released as ''A Stephen Sondheim Collection.'' As a composer and lyricist, Mr. Sondheim is a brilliant extension of the songwriters of the 20's, 30's and 40's on whom Mr. Cain and Mr. Kral have drawn in the past. So, to a degree, they are treading on somewhat familiar territory when they sing his songs. But Mr. Sondheim is a much more demanding writer and he has forced them to stretch themselves, to find more in their vocal resources and their interpretive abiliities than they have in the past. They have responded with performances that lift them to a new performing level and move them in directions that they were merely hinting at before. The collection is a light dusting of familiar Sondheim - ''Anyone Can Whistle,'' ''The Little Things You Do Together,'' ''Side by Side by Side,'' even ''Send in the Clowns'' - with a solid body of relatively unknown Sondheim, including a couple of songs cut from ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and one from Mr. Sondheim's first attempt at a Broadway score, ''Saturday Night,'' which was never produced. For Miss Cain and Mr. Kral, the song forms are often in their established vein but the songs themselves are very different, ''Barcelona,'' the resolution of an airline stewardess's one-night stand in ''Company,'' provides them with a duet that is totally removed from the flip, glib rhythmic duets with which they are usually associat-ed. There is a chance for characterization, for humor based on timing and subtlety of inflection, that brings out qualities in their singing that may have been there all along but never had an outlet before. It also brings out Mr. Kral as an expressive soloist, a new view of him that comes completely into focus when he sings ''Johanna'' from ''Sweeney Todd.'' This is a dark and brooding song which Mr. Kral fills with a close, intimate intensity, an obsessiveness that is colored by the worn timbre of his voice. To hear Mr. Kral in this context is surprising since it has usually been Miss Cain who has been reaching out, stretching her vocal wings and going beyond the duo's earlier parameter. But she, too, goes beyond expectations, improving even on her earlier enlargement of her vocal abilities as she sings ''I Remember,'' Mr. Sondheim's touching vision of nature in terms of manmade objects; in her introductory verse to ''So Many People'' from the unproduced ''Saturday Night,'' an introduction so warmly projected that it overshadows the solo by Mr. Kral that follows; and particularly in ''Not A Day Goes By,'' a ballad from the short-lived ''Merrily We Roll Along.'' Even the performances that are most closely related to their wellestablished styles take on a fresh quality when Mr. Sondheim is providing the basis. The two-part vocalese that has been their forte for years is used in a more varied structural development than usual in Mr. Sondheim's theme for the film ''Stavisky,'' and their long experience with crisp, fast-moving tongue-twisting duets puts them solidly on top of ''Everybody Says Don't,'' ''The Little Things You Do Together'' and a bright and catchy song cut from ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' - ''I Do Like You.'' Aside from being the best album that Jackie Cain and Roy Kral have ever made, ''A Stephen Sondheim Collection'' is a fascinating and revealing cross-section of Mr. Sondheim's work and his genius for taking musical theater traditions to new and original levels.

1116-> WORRIES OF FOOD TAMPERING
As a result of the seven deaths from cyanide-contaminated Tylenol capsules in September, the nation's largest food manufacturers have become just as concerned about the possibility of tampering as their counterparts in the pharmaceutical industry. Many are so worried that they would not even discuss the problem. Although most of the tampering incidents of the past few months have involved drugs, such as Anacin, Dristan and Excedrin in addition to Tylenol, many food manufacturers are concerned that their products could be as easy to contaminate as over-the-counter drugs. In addition, they are worried that the drug tamperings could serve as legal notice that such problems are foreseeable and that further safety measures should be taken. 'No Simple Answer' ''As soon as the Tylenol thing broke, we all began saying to one another, 'What if it happened to us?' and it was a question we couldn't shuck off,'' said Craig Shulstad, director of consumer and public affairs at General Mills Inc. ''Almost everybody in the food industry is reviewing not only their packaging but their product recall procedures. We're all wrestling with the question of where our liability as manufacturers begins - and there's no simple answer.'' On Nov. 5, the Food and Drug Administration issued rules requiring tamper-resistant packaging for over-the-counter drugs. Even though the rules do not apply to groceries, most food manufacturers are exploring ways to make their products less vulnerable to tampering. General Mills, for example, is reviewing its consumer product packaging to determine the vulnerability of its 200 grocery products. Borden has also set up a committee on consumer product packaging, but, like most of those interviewed at a number of companies, Borden officials were nervous about discussing the specific changes being considered. Feeling Vulnerable ''We've made tamper-resistance a major criterion in new product development, and we're going through all of our existing packaging to see how much it shows off tampering,'' said James McCrory, the corporate director of public affairs at Borden. ''Some upgrading of the packaging may already have taken place,'' he continued, ''but I would not feel comfortable discussing that. Actually, we are desperately worried about the Borden's name being used in any discussion, because all the nuts are watching, and you don't want to give anyone any ideas. I think we're all feeling very vulnerable, whether it's food or drugs. There's a kind of paranoia that has set in.'' Recently, William E. LaMothe, the chairman and chief executive of Kellogg, told the Food and Drug Law Institute, ''I can assure you that virtually everyone in the industry is looking for ways to give the consumer a higher confidence level that the product purchased has not been tampered with.'' But Mr. LaMothe, like most others in the food industry, is hoping to avert Federal rules to mandate tamper-resistant containers for all edibles. ''The cost would put many products out of the reach of consumers,'' he said. ''And what do we do with farm produce, fruit, vegetables, bread, cheese and milk?'' About 100 representatives from the food industry gathered in Washington on Dec. 16 to discuss these concerns at a ''Product Contamination Workshop'' sponsored by the Grocery Manufacturers Association. Radical Changes Doubted ''There was certainly a consensus that a problem existed,'' said Mr. Shulstad of General Mills, one of the participants. ''I think you'll see the food industry changing its packaging where it's feasible to do so, but I don't think there will be radical changes. The longstanding criticism of the industry has been that there's too much money spent on packaging, and with the economy where it is, no one's interested in seeing prices go up. At the conference, it became clear to us that we're not as vulnerable as some other companies, like those producing fresh baked goods just wrapped in cellophane.'' One of the people faced with that problem is Paul Khan, the vice president for quality and food protection at the ITT Continental Baking Company. According to Mr. Khan, the tamper-proof seals and closures that might be useful for pharmaceuticals or foods packed in impermeable plastic or glass jars would be useless for baked goods. ''It's a lot easier to protect against bacteria, insects and rodents than it is against people,'' said Mr. Khan, who estimated that the number of food-tampering incidents around Halloween was triple that of previous years. ''If you're dealing with cookies or bread - or bananas and apples - people can stick something right through them, or inject it. In 99 percent of the cases, that's what happens. I can't visualize a practical, economic solution to that problem. Punishing people for such acts, and publicizing those punishments, is the only solution I can think of. I don't think every apple should come in a metal case.'' The Food and Drug Administration, which developed the new rules on tamper-resistant packaging, concedes that from the tamperers' point of view, there is no difference between mouthwash or laxatives, for which new packaging will be required, and milk or orange juice, for which it will not. But, said Chris Smith, an F.D.A. spokesman, ''We don't think the danger is there as much in food.'' ''People look more closely at their food,'' he said. ''They know what it should look like and smell like and taste like. Anyway, tamper-resistant packaging regulations for food are considered impossible in the time frame required for drugs. There are about two billion over-the-counter drug packages sold annually, compared with 338 billion food packages.'' What Cost for Safety? The question of whether tamper-resistant packaging should be more widely required ultimately comes down to one of costs: How much is safety worth? ''I'm not sure people want to pay an extra two cents, or 10 cents, for every milk carton to be sealed differently,'' said Sheila Birnbaum, a products liability lawyer who teaches at New York University law school. ''We've already gone through this in airports, and there was a lot of discussion about whether the hijacking threat was so serious that we needed all the expense and bother of metal detectors. Now we've all paid for the metal detectors, we all feel a little safer, and maybe we're headed in the direction of spending more and more money to guard against the maniacs among us. But it's mighty expensive.'' For manufacturers, there are also legal considerations in deciding whether their packaging is adequate. Until the Tylenol deaths, they could not have been expected to anticipate lethal tampering. Now, however, they may be legally on notice that such things can happen - and, therefore, legally responsible for taking steps to prevent them. ''If a problem is foreseeable, and if there is something reasonable to be done to prevent it, the manufacturer has a duty to do that something,'' said Miss Birnbaum. ''Generally, the legal standard of foreseeability is what is objectively reasonable to expect, not what might conceivably happen. Are we at the point where the manufacturer should expect criminal tampering? I don't think so, but the Tylenol cases are right on the cutting edge of the law.'' One Positive Result The new fears about tampering do have one positive effect. According to Mr. McCrory, consumers have become more sensitive to signs of contamination. ''One of our products has a seal with holes punched in it so that it can breathe,'' he said. ''After the Tylenol problems, people called in suspecting that the holes had been punched with a hypodermic needle. That kind of alertness is all to the good.'' Maybe so, but it can go too far. General Mills got a frightened call from a woman who had found a pill in a box of one of its cereals. It was only after the company representative arrived to investigate that she remembered she herself had dropped some pills into the box.

1117-> AROUND THE WORLD; 2,000 Rebel Tribesmen Surrender, Thailand Says
More than 2,000 Communist rebel tribesmen surrendered today to Government forces in northern Thailand, the authorities said. It was the second mass surrender announced by the Government under an amnesty program instituted this year for guerrillas of the outlawed Communist Party. The first surrender was in northeastern Thailand on Dec. 1 when more than 1,000 rebels and their sympathizers reportedly turned themselves in. Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek, the army's commander in chief, presided over today's surrender ceremony at Umphang airport in Tak Province, 230 miles north of the capital. The rebels handed over their weapons and flags, officials said. Those who surrendered included 220 guerrillas and about 2,000 supporters not directly involved in the Communist insurgency.

1118-> PORTUGUESE PRIME MINISTER SAYS HE WILL QUIT
Portugal's Prime Minister, Francisco Pinto Balsemao, announced his resignation today but said there would be no early general elections. He said in a statement to the press that he had decided to devote himself entirely to his Social Democratic Party, which emerged as the biggest loser in local elections last weekend. Mr. Balsemao gave no indication of who would succeed him. But he said there was no reason for holding general elections before the present Parliament's mandate expires in 1984. This means that the next Government will have to be formed by the ruling Democratic Alliance, which is dominated by Mr. Balsemao's party. Alliance Has Big Margin The alliance, which also includes the Christian Democrats and the tiny Monarchist Party, has a comfortable parliamentary majority. Mr. Balsemao emerged from a meeting of the Social Democrats' national leadership to read a statement saying he had already told President Antonio Ramalho Eanes of his decision to step down, thus bringing down Portugal's 14th Government since the 1974 revolution. Explaining his reasons for resigning after nearly two years in office, Mr. Balsemao said he had faced great opposition from within the Social Democratic Party and the other alliance parties and complained that he had been betrayed. Mr. Balsemao was forced out of office once before, in August 1981. But he returned to power as the only Social Democratic candidate with enough overall support. He took over the Prime Minister's office two years ago when former Prime Minister Francisco sa Carneiro was killed in a plane crash.

1120-> NEXT TIME, A BETTER ELECTION LAW
To the Editor: This year's primary election and its aftermath confirm that there is a need to make several modifications in New York State's Election Law. he one-time reduction in the number of signatures required on designating petitions - from 5 percent of the party enrollment in a district to 2.5 percent - should be adopted permanently. While the percentage of the voting-age population which is registered to vote is exceedingly low, the results of this year's primary indicate that in many districts the percentage of enrolled voters who did vote has increased. This is because there was a greater number of local candidates who were able to attain ballot status as a result of the 2.5 percent petition requirement. Providing the electorate with a greater diversity of candidates, thus encouraging more people to vote, should be the pre-eminent goal of the Legislature in enacting election laws. This year, litigation resulting from challenges to petitions concluded at the Court of Appeals level less than two weeks before Primary Day. The tight schedule - from filing of petitions, to the Board of Elections' hearings, to the Supreme Court, to the Appellate Division, to the Court of Appeals, to Primary Day - was compressed into a six-week period. Within this time frame, the Board of Elections and three levels of the court system had to make decisions regarding the validity of petitions (appellate courts making their decisions in hours, if not minutes), ballots and voting apparatus had to be prepared and candidates had to conduct their primary election campaigns. This system is not conducive to judicious reflection on disputed issues. Voters scarcely know which local candidates will definitely appear on the ballot before they actually have to vote for them. The Election Law must be amended to provide for early petition filing and for sufficient time for the courts to hear and decide petition cases in a non-harried atmosphere, as well as for a campaign period in which a candidate, having dealt with the lawsuit against his or her petition, is free to campaign unburdened by doubts as to whether his or her name will appear on the ballot. Finally, the fiasco of the Manhattan Democratic Party's failure to file its certificate of nomination of candidates for Supreme Court justice on time highlights the need to eliminate the archaic method of nominating candidates for Supreme Court justice - the judicial convention. Candidates for election to the Supreme Court, although nominally nominated at conventions, are in reality chosen by a small group of political leaders who control the county party organization. It is time that the nominations of candidates for this position be made at the primary election, as is the case with every other public office. Next year not being a major election year, the State Legislature should give serious thought to undertaking a comprehensive review of the Election Law's provisions. AARON D. MASLOW Brooklyn, Oct. 22, 1982

1121-> TV: ASBESTOS TRAGEDY, WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY?
WHO is to bear responsibility for the deaths and illnesses that have struck thousands of people who had contact with asbestos over the last several decades? That is the question addressed on an ''ABC News Closeup'' documentary tonight at 8. The answer of the victims is that responsibility rests with the companies that manufactured the useful but sinister product. This hourlong documentary is given over largely to the stories of men, women and children who have been afflicted with mesothelioma, a form of lung cancer whose only known cause is asbestos. Three of them, whose interviews with ABC in 1978 are reshown here, have since died. Legally opposed to the afflicted workers and their families stands the Manville Corporation, the country's largest manufacturer of asbestos products, which filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code last summer in an effort to block thousands of lawsuits that were piling up against it. The company, which remains highly profitable, wants the courts to make a lump-sum estimate of awards for damages. By settling the claims out of such a pool rather than going through costly suits in every case, Manville would save a lot of money. The corporation also seeks to have the Federal Government share the liability on the ground that many of the injuries resulted from the use of asbestos in shipbuilding during World War II. The plaintiffs - and the producers of ''Asbestos: The Way to Dusty Death'' - view the ''bankruptcy'' action as a ploy to avoid dealing fairly with the victims. Although the producers present both sides, in a manner of speaking, the program is inevitably weighted against the company. Jules Bergman, the ABC News science editor, closes by charging Manville with attempting to establish a ''a dangerous precedent'' in depriving the plaintiffs of their ''day in court.'' The widow of a Manville worker frames the charge more bitterly and with fewer cliches: ''Lives are not worth as much as their thirdquarter profit.'' The sufferings of the afflicted workers and their families cannot but be moving, as the camera lingers on their ravaged faces and on treasured snapshots of happier times; the executives who present the Manville case are far too sleek looking to compete for sympathy. On television, the face counts for more than the words - and in this case, the words of the company spokesmen are not compelling. In response to suggestions that the corporation failed for decades to act on findings that asbestos was a grave danger to those who absorbed its dust, one executive says in a disturbingly self-satisfied way, ''We have done what could be done over the years, given the knowledge, the state of the medical art that was available to us at that time.'' Those suing Manville respond that the company did precious little except to conceal the danger. The question of what Manville did or did not do is not clearly resolved, but few viewers are likely to leave this program without feeling that the victims have yet to receive something resembling justice.

1122-> DON'T GIVE WESTWAY UP FOR A PARTIAL TRADE-IN PROMISE
To the Editor: John Oakes writes, ''Senator Moynihan and his Westway allies have figured out a way to prolong the agony - by slipping into a pending highway bill a provision extending Westway's trade-in deadline.'' I am a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works but have received no request from any New York official to try to get the trade-in deadline extended, and have not done so. An attempt was made in the House by Mr. Molinari, but evidently did not succeed. Thus the deadline for a trade-in continues to be Sept. 30, 1983, and clearly the clock is running. In complete openness and sincerity, may I ask that if Mr. Oakes knows differently he tell us, and soon. DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN U.S. Senator from New York New York, Oct. 22, 1982

1123-> CURRENCY MARKETS; DOLLAR DECLINES BROADLY; GOLD AND SILVER RALLY
The dollar fell to seven-month lows against the Swiss franc and Japanese yen in a broad retreat yesterday against all major currencies except the British pound and Canadian dollar. Traders said trading was listless. The dollar's decline and expectations of additional cuts in United States interest rates prompted a rally in bullion markets in Switzerland and the United States. Gold ended the trading day at $457.50 an ounce, up $11.50 from Thursday's late bid in New York and a gain of $10.25 from Friday's closing in Zurich. London's bullion and financial markets were closed for Britain's post-Christmas public holiday, Boxing Day, and will remain closed today. Hong Kong's bullion market was also closed yesterday. In Tokyo, where trading ends before it begins in Europe, the dollar declined for the fifth consecutive trading day, falling to 238.50 yen from 239 yen Friday. It was the dollar's lowest rate since May 24, when it closed at 237.55. The dollar slipped below 2 Swiss francs in Europe for the first time since May 27, closing at 1.9970 francs. The dollar also fell to six-month lows against the French franc, the West German mark and the Dutch guilder. Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday, included: 2.3850 West German marks, down from 2.3954; 1.9970 Swiss francs, down from 2.0095; 6.7430 French francs, down from 6.8000; 2.63475 Dutch guilders, down from 2.6450; 1,376.00 Italian lire, down from 1,382.05, and 1.24415 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2388. Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Friday, included: 2.3770 West German marks, down from 2.3883; 6.7375 French francs, down from 6.7750; 1.9968 Swiss francs, down from 1.9975, and 1.2435 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2408. Gold closed in Zurich at $452.50 a troy once, up from $447.25 at the close Friday. In the first trading since Thursday on the New York Commodity Exchange, bullion for current delivery jumped $11.40 an ounce to close at $458.20. In later New York trading, gold bullion was bid at $457.50 an ounce at Republic National Bank, up from Thursday's late bid of $446. Silver bullion for December delivery surged 41.5 cents from Thursday's close on New York's Comex to wind up at $11.14 a troy ounce.

1127-> Witness Ties Warner Chief to Secret Cash Fund
A former executive of Warner Communications testified in a fraud trial yesterday that Steven J. Ross, the company's chairman, had suggested that an official of the Westchester Premier Theater might be ''helpful'' with a secret cash fund at Warner. The testimony came from Jay Emmett. He is a key witness in the Manhattan trial of Warner's assistant treasurer, Solomon Weiss, who is charged with defrauding the company in connection with the nowdefunct Westchester theater. According to the prosecution, Mr. Weiss received $170,000 in bribes in exchange for arranging Warner's purchase of stock in the theater and then put the money into ''a secret cash fund'' at Warner. The prosecutor, Nathaniel H. Akerman, told the jury that Mr. Ross had put Mr. Weiss in charge of the fund. He did not explain how the fund was used. Link to Ross Is Denied A Warner spokesman said Mr. Ross ''unequivocally denies'' knowing about any secret cash fund. No charges have been filed against Mr. Ross, who is also the chief executive officer of the highly successful entertainment conglomerate. Mr. Emmett testified that he had told Mr. Ross about Leonard Horwitz, a former stockbroker and official of the Westchester Premier Theater, who was trying to sell stock in the theater and was offering to give a loan or cash payment in return for a large stock purchase. Then, Mr. Emmett continued, Mr. Ross suggested that Mr. Horwitz and Mr. Weiss should be brought together for a meeting. ''Perhaps,'' the witness quoted Mr. Ross as saying, ''Len ought to meet with Sol Weiss, and maybe he could be helpful with the Warner cash fund.'' As a result of the conversation, Mr. Emmett said, he told Mr. Weiss to meet with Mr. Horwitz. Warner bought 40,000 shares of the theater stock for $250,000 a short time later. Convictions for Skimming It was necessary for the theater to sell substantial amounts of stock at the time for its public stock offering to become effective. Several men identified as members of organized crime were later convicted of skimming cash from the theater and driving it into bankruptcy. Mr. Horwitz has testified that he delivered $170,000 in cash to Mr. Weiss, beginning in 1973, when Warner bought the stock in the theater. Much of the money for the cash payments was first obtained from Warner, Mr. Horwitz explained, by submitting ''phony invoices'' to Warner for fictitious consulting services. Mr. Emmett testified that he had signed some of the fake invoices to facilitate the scheme ''to generate cash.'' Both Mr. Emmett and Mr. Horwitz have pleaded guilty in the case and are cooperating with the Government in the hope of receiving lenient sentences. Mr. Emmett identified documents including invoices and checks that he said Warner had issued for fictitious consulting services. ''Who at Warner,'' the prosecutor asked, ''arranged for these consulting checks to be issued?'' ''Sol Weiss,'' Mr. Emmett replied, adding that he himself had signed some of the invoices. ''When you signed them,'' the prosecutor asked, ''did you know they were phony?'' ''Yes, I did,'' Mr. Emmett said. On Feb. 9, 1981, Mr. Emmett said, his lawyers were negotiating with Federal prosecutors for him to plead guilty. He said he secretly called Mr. Ross on the telephone to tell him about the negotiations and also informed him that the prosecutors ''wanted me to be wired'' to record a conversation with Mr. Ross. Asked by the prosecutor why he had made the call, Mr. Emmett testified that ''I called Mr. Ross, one of my best friends, to let him know what was happening in my life.'' Later, in a telephone call that was taped by Federal agents, Mr. Emmett started to talk to Mr. Ross about the case, but Mr. Ross said that ''I can't talk to you about it.''

1130-> STROCK CARVES ROLE AS MIAMI RELIEVER
MIAMI THERE was a time in his 10-year career with the Miami Dolphins that Don Strock envisioned himself as the team's ''quarterback of the future.'' He was young and ambitious and, like any quarterback entering the National Football League, eager to prove his worth. But also like any incoming quarterback, Strock had skills that were unrefined by N.F.L. standards. He had a strong arm but limited knowledge of reading defenses. He also had a willingness to work when no work was available. That's because the Dolphins' regular quarterback that year, 1973, was Bob Griese, and all Griese did that season was lead the Dolphins to a second straight victory in the Super Bowl. Strock spent that season on the taxi squad. So Strock waited, playing a little here, a little there. But mostly he waited. David Woodley, an eighth-round draft choice in 1980, became the regular starter in the fourth game of his rookie season. Griese retired at the end of that season. Somewhere along the way, another thought occurred to Strock: ''I'm no longer the quarterback of the future.'' And here it is, the Dolphins are about to play the the next-to-last game of the 1982 regular season - tonight against the Buffalo Bills - and Strock is still playing a little here, a little there. But mostly waiting. Now he waits with a different purpose. Years and circumstances have reshaped Strock's role with the Dolphins. He is not so much a backup quarterback now as a relief quarterback, a specialist, whom Coach Don Shula uses in the same manner as a relief pitcher in baseball. ''I can't think of anyone else in football,'' says Strock, ''who does the same thing I do.'' None does, at least on a contrived basis. Before 1978, Strock either started because Griese was injured or he played in the final minutes, when time would not permit the score to change enough to affect the outcome of the game. By 1979, Griese's last full season, Strock began spot relief duty. A look at the record indicates in which role he has been more successful. Strock has worked in 89 games as a Dolphin, 86 in the regular season and three in the playoffs. In 19 relief appearances, he has won five, lost none, ''saved'' two games in which the Dolphins led by less than a touchdown when he entered the game, earned one ''tie'' for bringing the Dolphins from behind to a deadlock and got ''no decisions'' in 11 games because neither the lead nor deficit that existed when he went in changed. In 18 games as a starter, he has won eight, lost six and got a ''no decision'' in four games because he was replaced by another quarterback before each of those games ended. He has played in 52 other games as a holder for the kicker. ''It takes a guy with a certain temperament to do what he does,'' says Shula. ''I don't think everybody could handle it. Certainly, not every pitcher in baseball can handle being a reliever. You have to be cut out of a certain mold.'' Strock is cut of such a mold that he can do either, and he says the achievement he is most proud of was starting the first seven games of the 1978 season, when Griese was injured, and helping the Dolphins to win five of them. By last season, with Griese a year into retirement and Woodley being a neophyte but learning rapidly, Strock evolved into his unusual role, a player who can dramatically change the face of a game, as he did a week ago Saturday against the New York Jets. He entered the game with 4 minutes 37 seconds remaining and with the Jets leading, 19-17. On his first series, the Dolphins lost 2 yards, but on the next, he completed six of seven passes and brought the Dolphins to the Jets' 30-yard line. Then, with seven seconds remaining, Uwe von Schamann kicked a 47-yard field goal for a 20-19 victory. That was his second ''victory'' of the season. In the first game after the strike, the Dolphins trailed Buffalo, 7-6, at the half. Strock replaced Woodley at the start of the third quarter, and the Dolphins won, 9-7. ''The key thing for me,'' says Strock, ''is to stay prepared. What happened against the Jets didn't come by chance. I have been put in games after eight minutes of the first quarter, after the half and, like last week, with four minutes to go. What I do along the sidelines is stay ready on every play, know what to call, know what I would like to do on the next play. Because a lot of times, I don't know when I'm going to go in.'' Strock and Woodley would never be mistaken for each other on the field. Each creates his own kind of difficulties for the defense but differently. Strock, 3 inches taller at 6 feet 5 inches, is a dropback passer who will run only when necessary. Woodley scrambles so much that he is now the team's second-leading rusher with 188 yards. Strock throws a soft pass; Woodley throws darts. Strock calls his own plays; Shula sends in plays for Woodley. Strock, because he is older, understands better the nuances of passing and reading pass defenses. When he enters a close game, his receivers seem to sense that the fireworks are about to go off. Duriel Harris, whose 17 catches this season are the most among the wide receivers, compares Woodley and Strock this way: ''It's as if you're talking to two different people. Both get their point across, but one has a larger vocabulary. He can say it so many more different ways. That's Don.'' Strock never said it - never showed it - in so many different ways as he did Jan. 2, 1982, in the Dolphins' playoff game against the San Diego Chargers in the Orange Bowl. Strock replaced Woodley with 12:05 left in the second quarter and the Dolphins losing, 24-0. The Dolphins had three more possessions before the half, and Strock produced points on all of them: a 34-yard field goal by von Schamann, a 1-yard scoring pass to the tight end Joe Rose, and the most memorable play of the game, a 25-yard pass to Harris, who lateraled to the running back Tony Nathan, who ran 15 yards for a touchdown as the half ended. Strock opened the third quarter with another touchdown drive to tie the score at 24-24, and by the end of the fourth quarter, the score was 38-38. The Chargers finally won, 41-38, with a field goal in overtime, but Strock finished the game with 29 of 43 completions for 403 yards and four touchdowns, his best day as a professional. ''It's hard to explain what happens when he comes in,'' says Harris. ''You feel like, 'O.K., this is it. It's time to do it.' He brings in an intensity that there's no way to explain.'' Shula can account to some degree for the intensity, allowing that Strock often replaces Woodley with the game on the line. ''When he's in there,'' Shula says of Strock, ''he's usually throwing every down.'' But Shula cannot account so easily for Strock's failure to seize opportunities he has had to win the job as starter - in 1980, for example, when Griese retired. ''I don't know,'' Shula says, looking perplexed. ''Different things happened to him. He just hasn't been able to get it all going when he's had the chance.'' In the longer view, it is probably just as well. Woodley at times still has trouble moving the offense and scoring points. ''The biggest problem with Woodley,'' says Shula, ''is people comparing him to Griese, to Morrall, to veteran quarterbacks. That hurts him. For all he has accomplished, Woodley is still only in his third year.'' And Strock, as a reliever, has proved to be oblivious to the suffocating conditions of the other team's leading or time running out or both. ''I can't speak for all relief pitchers in baseball because we're all so different,'' says Dan Quisenberry, the ace relief pitcher of the Kansas City Royals, ''but after talking to a lot of them, the one thing we're all able to do if we come into a game in the ninth inning is relax. I don't know Strock, but he must be able to relax.'' Strock says he can. Preparation takes care of that. When he's not in the game, he stands beside Shula, helping make sure the right players, according to down and distance, are on the field each play. Then, when Shula makes the switch he's ready. And relaxed. ''Because of the atmosphere in there when I go in, I have no time to get tense,'' Strock says. ''Especially if we're in the two-minute drill.'' This is about as close to tense as he gets: ''Every game before I walk out there - and this has nothing to do with not having the confidence, because I do - I think to myself, 'I have prepared for the game. I know what I have to do.' But the last thing I always wonder is, 'How will it come out? What's going to happen today?' Because you never know.'' Strock no longer dreams the dream. He accepts reality, that Woodley is not only the Dolphins' quarterback of the future, but also the quarterback of the present. Strock is 32 years old. He makes close to $200,000 a year. He will be a free agent after this season, as he was after the 1979 season and the 1980 season, and he says he will look around to see if another team might be interested, as he did before. ''My contract runs out Feb. 1, and I won't think about it until then,'' he says. Meanwhile, the Dolphins will take on the Bills with Strock in a familiar position, standing beside Shula on the sidelines, calling plays in his mind and wearing his orange and blue Dolphins cap until it's time to put on his helmet.

1131-> ALTERNATIVE TO REAGANOMICS
I have been in business for 34 years and I believe we are facing the most dangerous worldwide economic situation of my professional experience. We are facing it with a political philosophy that appears to be uncaring and backward and without a governmental process worthy of the name. We are facing it with less international cooperation than at any time since World War II. All over the world, trade and economic activity is contracting, unemployment is growing and financial structures are getting weaker. In America, a victory over inflation (which may turn out to be Pyrrhic) has been achieved at a very high cost in terms of unemployment, a collapse of investment and a polarization of our political system. The present best-case scenario for 1983 calls for a slow recovery for the economy. That will not be good enough for our basic industries, not good enough for investment in public-works projects, not good enough for employment and not good enough for the health of a seriously strained international banking system. We are currently lulled by the tremendous rise in the stock market over the last few months. This rise is mostly due to short-term interest rates falling as a result of a belated change in Federal Reserve policy. A market structure dominated by large institutions, none of which wants to be left behind, and vast amounts of foreign capital looking for relative political stability have had an effect as well. None of this reflects a successful economic program; the rise in the stock market might create a more positive psychology and encourage more consumer spending this winter, but it is a far cry from economic growth spurred by capital investment and savings that we were promised two years ago. It does not begin to address the economic crisis of the rest of the world and the dangers of a deflationary spiral to the international financial system. Although it is dangerous to generalize about the meaning of any election, especially in an off year, some conclusions may be drawn about the recent one. To the extent that the election was a referendum on the Administration's economic program - not necessarily its goals, but its effectiveness - the Administration and the Republican Party lost rather decisively. And on arms control, voters from New England to California expressed disillusionment with a program that will continue to build expensive new weapons rather than try to negotiate a reduction in arms. With few alternatives presented, voters expressed mainly disillusionment. In most races, Democratic candidates felt they could comfortably attack the current economic program, usually on the basis of its unfairness. This is a valid criticism, but it is not an alternative. Alternatives to Reaganomics must be put forward. Reaganomics is not simply an economic doctrine embodying supplyside economics and strict monetarism. It is a philosophy and a process of government, and it is in those areas that it departs most radically from our experience in the last 50 years. While the stated objectives of supply-side economics are valid - encouraging savings and investment, limiting the growth of government spending, promoting tax reduction and less regulation - the application of the program has been totally incoherent and expectations were raised that could not be fulfilled. Massive tax cuts and huge increases in defense spending combined with tight money to create high interest rates, steep recession and high unemployment. Nor is rational monetarism necessarily lethal. The notion of slow, steady growth in the money supply has much to commend it. The difficulty lies in defining money supply. In a volatile economic climate, money-supply measurements are suspect and a strict application of monetarism can be dangerous. The Reagan philosophy construes government to be the source of most evils; virtue is reserved for the theoretical free marketplace. Since such a philosophy does not believe in government, it has no process with which to govern. The incoherence of the program combined with the absence of a means to carry it out aggravates rather than diminishes many of our more serious difficulties. One of the strongest lessons that we have learned from the economic failures of the past decade is that the way we reach and implement a program or policy is fully as important as its theoretical and substantive design. The problems we face cannot be solved without cooperation, and the price of that cooperation is involvement in the decision-making process. My conservative Republican friends take me to task for what they consider my dangerously interventionist, liberal views. But I believe that large social, economic and political problems can be handled only when there is a conviction that government has not only a right but a duty to intervene when imbalances become too great. The process must accommodate the bargaining and all the constituencies must be heard in order to find solutions. This is particularly true in times of economic strain, when sacrifice has to be negotiated; over the long run, it cannot be legislated. Our most urgent national objective has to be the reduction of unemployment through high economic growth rates and low interest rates. Our objectives for growth must be raised from their present modest rates and coordinated with Europe and Japan. A coherent program to bring this about must begin with a bipartisan social contract involving the Executive, the Congress, business and labor, and the Federal Reserve in an effort to bring about a balanced budget within five years and maintain low interest rates. Current budgetary projections indicate annual deficits ranging from $180 billion to $200 billion for the foreseeable future, possibly reaching as high as 6 percent of gross national product. This cannot be tolerated. To reverse the trend would require cutting the growth in Social Security and health-care costs, cutting the growth in military expenditures and imposing new taxes. However, in a period of deep recession, any new taxes are dangerous. It would be a mistake at this point to cancel the 1983 tax cut. A plausible argument can probably be made, in view of the weak economy, to advance it to Jan. 1, 1983, but the prospect of higher deficits could unsettle the financial markets. It is not worth the risk, since lower interest rates at this point are the most important stimulus. The imposition of a tax on gasoline would be much less damaging to the economy if the proceeds of the tax were recycled as part of a major national investment program. There is, at present, a proposal for a 5-cent gasoline-tax increase to finance such things as road and bridge repairs. This is grossly insufficient. A gasoline tax of 50 cents a gallon should be phased in over a five-year period, at the rate of 10 cents a year, with rebates to lower-income groups. Coupled with an import fee on crude oil, it could ultimately reduce our deficit by up to $50 billion a year, improve our balance of payments, protect the auto industry's huge investments in small cars and prepare us for the next OPEC shock. A critical part of a budget compact would be a commitment on the part of the Federal Reserve to accelerate its downward pressure on interest rates, especially long-term rates. We must recognize the fact that real, as opposed to nominal, interest rates have not come down at all. The real rate of interest today, namely the difference between the nominal rate and the rate of inflation, is, if anything, higher than it was a year ago. That is the real impediment to investment and recovery. We must then face the issue of employment. We cannot stimulate our economy sufficiently and reduce unemployment without major investment in industry and rebuilding the infrastructure. To reach those sectors that normal market forces or government policy have neglected, new structures should be created, notably a modern version of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation of the 1930's. The original R.F.C., set up by Herbert Hoover and energized by Franklin Roosevelt, functioned essentially from 1932 to 1945, though it lasted until 1953. During that period, it saved thousands of banks, railroads and businesses, financed public works and ultimately defense plants in World War II. It created organizations functioning today, such as the Commodity Credit Corporation and the Rural Electrification Administration, and it returned a profit of $500 million to the taxpayers. The 1980's are different from the 1930's, of course, but the basic principles of a modern R.F.C. would be the same. The R.F.C. would be the investment and development bank of the Government, publicly accountable, but sheltered from political pressures. It would be a focus of American commitment to our basic industrial underpinning as well as to rebuilding cities, harbors, transportation systems - the complex of facilities known as infrastructure. A commitment to basic industry would not be easy, but it is important. A major world power like America cannot be credible without a strong, competitive manufacturing base. Today, high technology is a very glamorous notion; basic industries such as automobiles and steel are not. But the auto industry is one of the largest customers of microprocessors as well as of industrial robots and many other high-technology products. In the future, we will employ far fewer workers per automobile or per ton of steel. But that does not mean that those same workers, with proper training, cannot make the robots, the machine tools and the many products of tomorrow that will go into a car or a ton of steel. That will not happen, however, if we take the position that we do not care about the survival of our auto industry as long as we make better semiconductors. This year the American auto industry will manufacture roughly 5,000,000 cars; the Japanese will manufacture 7,000,000 cars, of which we will buy about 1,700,000. What would the Japanese minister of industry say to a suggestion to cut his auto industry in half in order to invest in biotechnology? Obviously, retraining for the industries of the future has to be part of any economic and social program, but we must first save what we have today. At the same time, there is much talk in Washington today of a need to invest in public infrastructure, partly to create jobs and partly to fill a real need. The program proposed by The Administration call for a five-year, $32.9 billion highway and mass-transit investment, to be financed largely by the proposed increased gasoline tax. No one knows what level of investment may be required to bring our national capital plant back from its present decay. Some estimates run to over $1 trillion. The New York City mass-transit system alone is estimated to require $5 billion over the next five years, and the city as a whole has estimated a need for up to $40 billion during the 1980's. The Federal Government will obviously have to make a much greater effort than is currently being discussed, because local government cannot afford it. Slowdowns in the growth of Social Security and health-care costs are absolutely essential. At the same time, our defense program cannot be immune from both retrenchment and transfer of funds to domestic nonmilitary investment. If we are serious about defense, we should reinstate the draft and increase our conventional capability. The draft is not an economy measure but a philosophical one: National service cannot be limited to the children of the poor and the minorities; it must include the children of the middle-class and the well-to-do. The current target for defense spending over the next five years is about $1.6 trillion. It is hard to believe that $100 billion could not be provided for the R.F.C. and other nonmilitary needs from those funds; in addition, considerable economies could be made in the military programs themselves. The reduction of nuclear weapons is both a moral and an economic issue. On both counts, it has to happen. An R.F.C. could be funded initially by the Treasury at $5 billion and with the capacity to issue an additional $25 billion of government-guaranteed bonds. By requiring outside matching funds, it would thereby generate a minimum of $60 billion of new investment over a period of time. The leverage of government-backed credit can best be observed by New York City's four-year financial plan. A $4.5 billion financing package was put together in 1978 on the basis of $1.6 billion of Federally guaranteed bonds with the balance coming from the public and private financial markets. Every Federal credit dollar produced $3 of financing. A similar ratio applied to the R.F.C. would produce roughly $90 billion of investment. In the industrial field, the R.F.C.'s investments would be limited to those basic industries such as automobiles and steel that could be made competitive. The R.F.C. would provide funds only if there were concessions on the part of labor, management, suppliers and bankers sufficient to make the company competitive with the the best foreign producers. Similarly, in the public-infrastructure field the R.F.C.'s capital would be available only if local support - such as tax changes, union productivity and wage concessions, fare and user fees -assured the viability of the projects. These would include mass-transit systems, sewers, roads, bridges and so on. The need for political independence for an organization like the R.F.C. is obvious. It would need to husband its resources and to target them. It should require matching investments from the private sector in the case of industrial investments and by local governments in the case of public investments. The R.F.C. could not be a substitute for an industrial or a regional policy. It would be a useful tool and a needed focus. It would be a small part of a large program, but it could play a critical, temporary role. It should self-destruct in 10 years. Improving life in the inner-city ghetto would be another objective of an R.F.C. Regional development corporations as well as city and state business and labor groups would be created to work with the R.F.C. If the auto industry and Middle Western cities were to get new funds, for example, the program should include inner-city manufacturing facilities tied directly to inner-city school systems, union commitments to minority apprenticeship and possibly two-tier minimum wages during training. The programs should be run by private industry, in facilities financed by the R.F.C. and leased to the companies, in the same manner as the defense plants leased by the R.F.C. during World War II. Any such program of government-assisted financing obviously would require the input of business and labor as well as government. The board of the R.F.C. would be an obvious focus for this; it would also become a focus for a policy that could relate wage increases to real productivity improvements. The kind of stimulus our economy needs, both to insure our own future and to avoid a worldwide credit crisis, is much greater than the current forecasts. It will require guarding against a renewal of inflation caused by wage settlements in excess of productivity improvements. Wage and price controls in an advanced industrial society cannot work for long, and a formal, legislated policy, such as a tax-based incomes policy, is probably neither practical nor fair. However, a change in our labor cost structure has to be examined if low inflation is to co-exist with high growth. The most practical way to approach this would be for all major labor contracts to expire simultaneously every year, with wage increases related to existing economic conditions and current inflation; significant elements of profit-sharing should reward real productivity improvements. We should take a cue from Japan and Germany and have an annual, national wage negotiation involving business, labor and often the government. The result should be keyed to the performance of the economy. This is the practical equivalent of an incomes policy for most of the economy. A viable, growing economy and containment of poverty and healthcare programs have to be the first step to the New Federalism proposed by the Reagan Administration. This would then make possible a swap providing for the assumption of all poverty programs by the Federal Government in exchange for state assumption of various Federal programs. A portion of a national gas tax or an energyseverance tax could make up any shortfall sustained by the states. Local tax increases, in all but the energy-producing states, have been, and will continue to be, an enormous drag on the national economy. A constructive approach to New Federalism should carry with it the possibility for local tax cuts rather than increases. The Federal Treasury gets a portion of that benefit anyway, since local taxes are deducted from Federal income taxes. Without an active business-labor-government process of cooperation, coupled with real bipartisanship, none of this can happen. Neither an R.F.C. nor a new approach to labor costs nor a balanced budget with all its implications nor a new and fair Federalism will be politically possible. Such a result will not happen with a hands-off government and a blind faith in the market process. A different process and a different philosophy are needed in the international sphere as urgently as they are needed in the domestic arena. We are in a worldwide recession for the first time since World War II, with dangerous deflationary overtones. The international banking system is badly overextended with many large overseas borrowers in danger of bankruptcy. Western Europe and Japan are in difficulty; Canada is in a crisis; much of Eastern Europe is bankrupt; Mexico, Argentina and Brazil are staggering under huge debt; the third world economy is largely a disaster. A worldwide recovery of sufficient magnitude to give us some margin of safety can only come about with coordinated, stimulative policies of the major NATO partners and Japan. In the United States, the Federal Reserve narrowly avoided a catastrophe and changed to a stimulative policy. We must aim at significantly higher real-growth rates than the 2 to 3 percent presently forecast. This must then be coordinated with our major trading partners to enable many large debtor nations to service their debts and maintain social balance. For 25 years after World War II the international monetary system functioned as a result of the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944, which produced extraordinary growth and wealth throughout the world. Because it posed many problems, we have replaced this international system based on fixed exchange rates with a system based on floating rates, which poses even greater problems. The wild fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, speculative raids on individual currencies, the uncontrolled growth of the Eurodollar market -all have contributed to worldwide inflation and destabilization. Cooperation among America, Japan and Western Europe in an effort to synchronize economic policies geared to sound growth is now vital. As part of any program of industrial redevelopment, we will need a change in our trade relationships with Japan. This should include not only opening Japanese markets to our goods, including agriculture, but negotiating a fair and stable exchange relationship between the dollar and the yen. It is impossible for our industries to compete effectively, no matter how much we invest and no matter how efficient we become, at the present level of approximately 260 yen per dollar. A quick agreement should be negotiated between our respective governments and their central banks to bring the dollar/yen relationship to approximately 200 yen per dollar. The central banks of America, Japan and Western Europe must also cooperate in controlling movements of currency. Such major currencies as the pound, the mark and the yen have fluctuated wildly over the last few years; these swings have been accentuated by speculative forces. There should be clear and public commitments among the major central banks to maintain their respective currencies within specific limits as long as their respective governments maintain rational economic policies. One way to do this would be to expand the European monetary system to include America, Japan and possibly Canada. Such close cooperation is obviously inconsistent with actions such as the recent sanctions against American and European companies involved in the construction of the Soviet gas pipeline; however, it would certainly permit negotiations aimed at tightening European subsidies of exports to the Soviet Union or anywhere else. As part of any such program, we must challenge the Soviet Union to share with the West the burden of financing Eastern Europe. This should become part of arms-control negotiations and should be aimed at diverting investment in weapons to economic development. Further, the wealthy OPEC countries must bear a greater burden with respect to the financing of the third world. The oil producers' great wealth will not be protected - nor their ruling classes be immune - from the effects of worldwide economic crisis. I believe that we are presently running not only economic risks but risks to our political system. Many of my friends believe that I am seeing ghosts, and I hope they are right. But I did grow up in Europe in the 1930's and I have seen the fragility of democracy when economic events get out of hand. We are now told that basic, permanent unemployment in this country will be close to 6 or 7 percent, but our current, real unemployment would reach 14 percent or more if one were to count unemployment honestly. Not counting those who have given up looking for work is like listing only the walking wounded as casualties in a war. This means that almost every third family in America will be affected. Educational and income disparities are increasing, and even though fairness is a much overused term, too many people question the fairness of the present program to be ignored. A no-growth economy causes the most suffering among those who have the least; it is unfair but inevitable. The recent budget and tax programs, however, have created more instead of less disparity. They will have to be corrected. A democracy, to survive, must at the very least appear to be fair. This is no longer the case in America. In looking for alternatives to Reaganomics, we therefore need a different philosophy and a different process. We also need a Democratic Party less frightened of its past and more willing to assert its own philosophy and process. There are desirable aspects to Reaganomics and they deservedly enjoy a considerable measure of popular support. Those objectives of Reaganomics that are desirable should be included in an alternative program. An R.F.C., after all, is the liberal version of stimulating the supply side of the economy and a gasoline tax is a perfectly respectable way to tax consumption in order to encourage investment. A balanced budget is a completely reasonable goal as long as everyone pays the price, including Social Security and the military. A viable version of New Federalism should undoubtedly get support among all groups. All over the world, systems of the right and of the left are trying to find the answers to the same question: how to have a viable economy and a fair and balanced social structure. There may be no viable answers to some of the problems, but there is no alternative to trying, being willing to fail and trying again. There is no alternative to real bipartisanship any more than there is an alternative to real business/labor/ government cooperation. The Democratic Party will undoubtedly produce many alternatives to Reaganomics. In doing so, there is no need to claim a plethora of new ideas. First of all, it is not true; secondly, it is not necessary. A simplified tax system with lower maximum rates as proposed by Senator Bill Bradley and Congressman Richard A. Gephardt is a good idea. So is the notion of encouraging high technology, as suggested by Senator Gary W. Hart and Congressman Timothy E. Wirth. These are good ideas without being new. Good ideas have been around for a long time (including some from John Maynard Keynes as well as some from Milton Friedman). There are no technological breakthroughs in government and economics, and those who pretend to have them should be treated with great skepticism. Albert Einstein told the French poet Paul Valery that he had only had two original ideas in his whole life. But that was more than enough. New York City and New York State are about to face once again the harshest kinds of budget problems. They will be met with painful and destructive service cuts and tax increases. This time, however, New York is not alone. All over this country, if not all over the world, the process of contraction is continuing and the danger of spiraling downturn is very real. Economists are fighting the last inflation just as generals always fight the last war. The immediate concern is unemployment and deflation, which only growth can cure. Stimulating growth runs the risk of inflation; it can be contained, however, and it is the lesser risk. We can no longer deal marginally with a problem that vastly transcends our shores. Whether a Republican or a Democrat is President, bipartisanship at home and statesmanship and cooperation abroad will be required. Franklin Delano Roosevelt's type of leadership in wartime will have to be re-created in the 1980's.

1133-> BURTON B. TURKUS, 80, PROSECUTOR OF MURDER INC. IN THE 1940'S,; DIES
Burton B. Turkus, who prosecuted Murder Inc. as a member of the Brooklyn District Attorney's office and sent seven of its members to the electric chair in the 1940's, died at his Madison Avenue office on Monday. He was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan. After leaving the District Attorney's office in 1945, he became one of the city's foremost arbitrators, principally on the waterfront and as a member of the State Board of Mediation. When District Attorney William O'Dwyer of Brooklyn selected Mr. Turkus to head his homicide bureau in 1940, Mr. Turkus went to work on the string of gangland murders in the borough in the late 1930's. He had come to the District Attorney's attention by his defense of 17 men accused of murder. Mr. Turkus saved them from the death penalty. Mr. Turkus got his first big break when Abe Reles, one of the bosses of Murder Inc., agreed to cooperate. Called 'Mr. Arsenic' ''You don't have Sherlock Holmes,'' Mr. Turkus said later, ''and you don't have Hollywood legerdemain. Reles was an encyclopedia. He revealed for the first time the existence of the Syndicate, the pattern or the blueprint of organized crime.'' The crowning success of Mr. Turkus's efforts was the conviction in 1941 and execution in 1944 of Louis (Lepke) Buchalter, who ruled the rackets in garment districts for nearly two decades by ordering countless underworld executions. Mr. Turkus obtained nine firstdegree murder convictions and contributed to the solution of scores of other murders. Organized crime called him ''Mr. Arsenic.'' Born in the Prospect Park section of Brooklyn, the son of an immigrant watchmaker and a seamstress, Mr. Turkus got his first job as a telegraph operator for Western Union after leaving the Manual Training High School. He worked from midnight to 8 A.M. so he could attend day classes at New York University, where he received a law degree. In 1925, he was admitted to the bar. Practicing criminal law in Brooklyn with a quick intelligence, Mr. Turkus dazzled judges and juries alike and came to the attention of Mr. O'Dwyer. He made his only bid for public office in 1942 when he lost a race for county judge. He resigned as a prosecutor in 1945 and went into private practice. Handled Playboy Club Dispute In 1948, Gov. Thomas E. Dewey appointed him to the State Board of Mediation, where for 10 years he served as an arbitrator and mediator in nearly a thousand management-labor disputes. With his appointment as arbitrator of the Port of New York waterfront in 1957, Mr. Turkus imposed settlements in labor disputes beyond the waterfront. In a 1974 decision in which he ruled against four women who were dismissed from a Playboy club because of their supposed loss of the ''Bunny image,'' Mr. Turkus wrote: ''While a freshness of youth is manifestly transitory and evanescent, it is not always easy for a Bunny to accept the inevitable - that it has finally happened to her.'' One of his central achievements as an arbitrator was his pioneering role in ''instant arbitration'' - an on-the-spot settlement of labor disputes without a formal hearing. Mr. Turkus is survived by his wife, Naomi, and a son, Donald, both of Manhattan. A funeral service will be held today at 1 P.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 81st Street and Madison Avenue.

1134-> MAJORITY OF BISHOPS SAID TO BACK ARMS LETTER
More than two-thirds of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops basically agree with a proposed pastoral letter that strongly opposes the use of nuclear weapons, according to results of a survey made public today. The findings confirmed the view held by many bishops that the letter has generally solid support, although many prelates balk at certain parts. The informal survey was carried out by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops at the outset of a debate over the letter at the group's annual meeting here. Forms listing various positions to be checked off were filled out in discussion groups. This provided the first concrete indication of how the bishops felt about the overall document and pointed up particular sources of discord. After debate this week, the letter is to be sent back to a special committee for final drafting. That version will be voted upon next spring. It Has a Strong Impact In issuing a pastoral letter, the bishops exercise their function as teachers of morality. Such a letter has a strongly advisory impact upon individual American Catholics, to whom it is addressed. In the survey, 195 bishops said they were ''basically in agreement'' with the 110-page letter, 71 said they had ''major reservations'' and 12 were in ''basic disagreement.'' The chief division was in the area of ''theological principles'' and ''moral conclusions,'' a category that includes nuclear deterrence. While 141 bishops said they were in basic accord with the letter's views in this area, 114 had major reservations. In its current form, the pastoral letter would condemn the use and threatened use of nuclear weapons and allow for nuclear deterrence only as a means of achieving negotiated disarmament. The draft also calls for a bilateral verifiable nuclear freeze, declares that nuclear war is ''immoral'' and rules out any first use of nuclear weapons. 'Toughest Moral Problem' The Rev. Bryan Hehir, the head of the bishops' office of international justice and peace, said he was not surprised by the debate over deterrence. ''It is not easy when you've got the toughest moral problem in the world to deal with,'' Father Hehir said. Six bishops who addressed the conference on the letter Monday displayed substantial disagreement over deterrence. Some bishops favored a total condemnation of nuclear deterrence, while others, drawing upon the church's traditional theory that some wars are just, voiced backing for a stronger emphasis on a nation's right to defend itself with nuclear weapons against unjust aggression. According to the survey, the bishops were most pleased with the social and political analysis employed in the letter. They also voted by a margin of more than two-thirds in support of its ''presentation of Catholic tradition and teaching.'' They were least content with the document's style and format, and many were unhappy with its length, considerably greater than past pastoral letters.

1138-> BENCH AND BAR TAKE A FOUR-MILE RUN THAT FINISHES AT FOLEY SQUARE
The United States Court House in Manhattan has witnessed its share of legal jostling over the years, but nothing quite like yesterday morning, as more than 500 lawyers descended upon Foley Square in sweat pants, T-shirts and running shoes. ''How often do you get a chance to elbow someone you might have to face in a conference room or a courtroom?'' asked Daniel Haines, a lawyer with Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler of Manhattan. The occasion was the National Law Journal's first Courthouse Run, a four-mile race sanctioned by the New York Road Runners Club. Braving blustery winds, temperatures in the low 40's and a rugged Manhattan Bridge roadbed, 524 lawyers wended their from Foley Square to the Federal Courthouse in Brooklyn and back again. The field included representatives of several governmental offices and of corporations, as well as of many of the city's major law firms. Robert B. Fiske, former United States Attorney, ran, as did Judge Richard Owen of Federal District Court in Manhattan, and several members of the Justices of the Supreme Court Chowder and Running Society. ''The motto of our group is 'Jus sapienter curret,' or 'Justice runs prudently,' '' said Justice Edward J. Greenfield, who founded the group two years ago and leads its lunchtime jogs. ''That is precisely how those of us in the race intend to run today.'' The lawyers depicted by Daumier and Dickens may be heavyset, baldish men, but, according to David Katz of the Roadrunners Club, the New York lawyer fits quite nicely into the profile of the typical runner - that is, between 30 and 49, with a work schedule so overloaded and inflexible that the morning or evening jog is the most reliable form of exercise available. The winner in the men's event at 20 minutes 37 seconds was Marcel Philippe, a track star at Fordham and a member of the 1976 French Olympic team; coming in a second later was Steven Kaiser, a Long Beach, L.I., personal-injury lawyer who ran 146th in last year's New York Marathon. For his efforts, Mr. Philippe, an assistant in the Manhattan District Attorney's special narcotics bureau, won a plaque declaring him the ''best overall male.'' Mary Rosado, formerly with Casey, Lane & Mittendorf and now working on the Assembly campaign of Henry Neale Jr. of Westchester, was ''best overall female.'' ''All personal-injury lawyers watch out for the potholes!'' Robert Abrams shouted, shortly before the opening gun. Mr. Abrams, the States Attorney General, was an official of the event. The professional self-mockery went only so far, however. Organizers of the race had originally contemplated using an ambulance as the pace car, but later reconsidered. They settled on a gray Cadillac, instead.

1139-> Commodities; Platinum Picture Changing
PLATINUM is a Cinderella metal that has lacked glamour in recent years, compared with gold, but the situation is changing. In futures trading, the allure of precious metals often is measured by the spread in price between them. For example, gold for April delivery closed last Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange at $446.70 an ounce, while platinum for April delivery sold at $359.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange - a spread of more than $85. Some months ago the spread was as wide as $130 or so. Traditionally, however, platinum has sold at much higher prices than gold - a fact that intrigues sophisticated speculators. Paul Sarnoff, vice president and director of Paine Webber's metals unit, said the other day, ''We have a bizarre situation where for months gold has been selling at a premium price above platinum.'' Looking back, he recalled the price roller-coaster of 1980. Gold reached a high of about $850 an ounce, and a few months later platinum was selling at more than $1,050 an ounce in terms of futures contracts, which quite different from today. Lately speculators have been quietly buying April platinum and selling April gold - one reason that the spread has narrowed. Since the platinum contract is for 50 ounces and the gold contract consists of 100, the spreaders generally buy two platinum deliveries and sell one gold contract. Encouraged by recent declines in interest rates, the speculators believe that an economic recovery might be under way. Since platinum is more of an industrial metal, they reason, its price would tend to rise with a business revival and at the same time typical gold hoarders might lose interest and sell. Being pragmatic, the spreaders do not care whether platinum rises in price or gold falls. As long as the spread continues to narrow, they have a chance of making money. Bette Raptopoulos, senior metals analyst at Bache, Halsey, Stuart Shields, observed, ''The spread remained over the $100 level for quite a while and did not narrow until the present perception of declining interest rates.'' She interprets the recent narrowing of the spread, along with rising platinum prices, as a hint of industrial recovery. ''We go along with this optimistic thinking,'' she said. She warned that the spread involves ''a volatile relationship'' and that this trading technique should be used only by sophisticated investors. The analysts also note some buying of platinum by users stockpiling the metal, now that interest rates (and hence carrying costs) are declining. For centuries gold has been regarded as a metal to be hoarded in times of trouble and inflation. It is also used for coinage and is valued in the form of jewelry. Platinum, also used in jewelry, goes mainly to the automobile industry (where it serves as a catalyst in antipollution devices) and to the petroleum industry (where it helps in the catalytic cracking process for refining gasoline). It also is used in medical devices and in dentistry. Platinum seldom has been coined, although the Soviet Union once minted a small quantity of platinum coins to honor the Olympics - and with good reason. The Russians are one of the world's major producers of platinum, selling an estimated 750,000 ounces a year. Naturally they like to encourage high platinum prices. Soviet sales, though, are much smaller than those of South African producers - mainly Rustenburg Platinum Holdings and Impala Platinum Holdings, which account for 2.2 million ounces a year. In addition, Canadian nickel producers account for about 10 percent of world platinum output as a byproduct. In the United States a small amount of platinum is produced, and large amounts are recycled. While the Russians tend to sell platinum only when its price is high, the South Africans sell it regularly because they have longterm contracts with major car manufacturers. The General Motors Corporation has contracted to pay $475 an ounce for platinum, well above the current price, but some analysts suggest that the South African producers have been giving discounts. Meanwhile the fundamentals of the platinum market remain discouraging. Auto makers are not producing as many cars as they had hoped, which means a continued low demand. The petroleum business is in the doldrums at the moment. The jewelry business, particularly in Japan, is not doing well, and the Japanese show more interest in buying gold than platinum. However, Miss Raptopoulos reports that Japanese car makers are using more platinum in emission-control devices. Mr. Sarnoff adds that some people are taking a new look at platinum for its inherent value. ''The world has 55 years' use of gold above ground but less than three years' supply of platinum above ground to meet demand,'' he said recently. The Commodity Research Bureau, in its latest weekly report, summarized the platinum situation this way: ''The extremely wide discount for platinum relative to gold prices appears to have attracted some support for platinum futures, but any sustained price recovery appears dependent upon improvement in the ailing auto industry.''

Prof. Roger N.Johnson (Opinion Page, Oct. 3) performed a valuable public service with his monitoring of WOR-TV's performance this past spring. It is vital that New Jersey residents have available to them news and information about events and decisions that take place in New Jersey and that affect their lives. Professor Johnson's appeal for a statewide and fully professional news program ignores the fact that such a program is already available. New Jersey Nightly News is seen each night at 6:30 on Channel 13, at 7:30 on the four stations of the New Jersey Network and again at 10 o'clock on the New Jersey Network. New Jersey Nightly News sets a standard against which coverage of New Jersey can be measured by WOR-TV or any other television stations. While New Jerseyans continue their now 21-year wait for the return of commercial television service, they can be fully informed by watching New Jersey Nightly News. GORDON A.

1142-> AROUND THE WORLD; 574 Suspected Leftists On Trial in Turkey
A total of 574 suspected members of a militant leftist organization go on trial in Ankara Monday in one of Turkey's largest trials since the coup of September 1980. The military prosecutor is demanding the death sentence for 186 of the group, said by authorities to belong to Revolutionary Way, one of the most prominent leftist groups involved in political violence before the military takeover. A 1,319-page indictment accuses the 574 of trying to overthrow the state by force and covers more than 300 killings, attempted murders, bombings, shootings and robberies. Last year 540 suspected Revolutionary Way militants went on trial on similar charges in the eastern city of Erzerum and more than 400 members of a similar group, Revolutionary Left, were put on trial in Istanbul. Both cases are still in progress and the trial beginning Monday is also expected to last months.

1143-> LETTERS; Missed Chance
To the Editor: With regard to points made in Alan Oser's article on the Lincoln West development, ''The City's Process of Review'' (Sept. 16), it is important to point out that all of the studies and reports produced were merely a gloss on the developer's plan. Amazingly, there was no public planning for the site (and for the adjacent site owned by Harry Helmsley and the American Broadcasting Company) separate and distinct from the proposal offered by Lincoln West Associates. he elaborate facade of the review process did not change the fact that a single plan was offered by a single developer and that plan was adopted without any serious effort by the city itself to explore alternatives or to encourage elements in the private sector to do so. And this for the largest remaining undeveloped waterfront site in New York! The members of the Board of Estimate, when confronted with a choice between Lincoln West and no development, did the responsible thing in voting for the proposal. The missed opportunity derives from the city's failure either to establish independent development parameters or to stimulate creativity by encouraging competing alternatives.

1145-> Advertising; Celebration Is Planned At Esquire
HAVING pulled Esquire magazine back from the brink of disaster, the rescue team headed by Phillip W. Moffitt, editor, and H. Christopher Whittle, president, is now planning a yearlong 50th anniversary celebration capped by a media event that it hopes will challenge the glories of television. In the 50th anniversary issue of December 1983, 50 of the country's best-known writers will each contribute an original piece on one of the 50 persons that the magazine's editors believe have made a difference in their fields or in our lives. ''It is going to be the Super Bowl of journalism,'' Mr. Moffitt said, adding: ''Imagine Time's Man of the Year piece written by Gore Vidal and not by a staff writer. Then multiply that 50 times.'' Although there will not be a premium charged to advertisers for any of the editorial specials of next year, Esquire management wants the advertising crowd to know about them anyway. So that special issue and another one planned for next June will be promoted in a full-page ad scheduled for tomorrow in The New York Times and next week in a list of the advertising trade publications. It may also run later in The Chicago Tribune and The Los Angeles Times. The ad will mention the writers but not the subjects - Mr. Moffitt is determined to keep them secret until publication time. The bylines will include Louis Auchincloss, Truman Capote, Peter Drucker, David Halberstam, Ken Kesey, Tom Robbins, Irwin Shaw, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Gay Talese, Gore Vidal, Tom Wicker and Tom Wolfe. The cover price, usually $2, will be $3 for the June issue and $4 for December's. ''We want to create a publishing event that can rival the kind of event television can create,'' said Mr. Moffitt, who was joined in his office by Mr. Whittle and Alan Greenberg, the publisher. All are under 40, Southerners and go-getters. ''We want to show the power of print at a time when television has dominated our scene,'' Mr. Moffitt added. The other excitement planned for next year will be a new monthly section, The Esquire Review, which will be 14 to 15 pages of reviews in the traditional cultural areas as well as cable television. It will replace a quarterly insert, each of which dealt with a separate topic - music, movies and so on. That's set for February. Then in March comes another new section, The New America, five pages of editorial material on new technology. There will be no premium charge for advertising in the inserts. The special June edition will be made up of articles selected from among the 10,000 already run during Esquire's history. Mr. Moffitt describes it as a ''unique kind of history about how we got to where we are today.'' Both special issues will be featured in two direct-mail subscription promotions of one million pieces each. All of this editorial excitement should have its rub-off on the advertising picture, and maybe that's why Mr. Greenberg has set a goal of over 1,100 ad pages for 1983. That would be up 35 percent from this year's 815 pages, which was a bounce of 67 percent from 1981.

1147-> AROUND THE NATION; Ex-Mayor Ends Defense Against Murder Charge
The defense rested its case today in the murder trial of Eddie Carthan, the former Mayor of Tchula, who is accused of arranging the killing of a political rival. The prosecution called only one rebuttal witnesses. The jury decided to begin deliberations Thursday morning on the charge that Mr. Carthan arranged the murder of a Tchula alderman, Roosevelt Granderson, in 1981. If convicted, Mr. Carthan could be sentenced to die in the gas chamber. Mr. Carthan says the ''white power structure'' falsely accused him of the murder because of his efforts on behalf of Tchula, a Delta town where a majority of the residents are black. Mr. Carthan, like Mr. Granderson, is black. The final defense witness was Herbert Granderson, a brother of the slain alderman. He testified that a white Tchula alderman, John Edgar Hays, visited his home the day after his brother was shot to death and blamed Mr. Carthan for the slaying. Mr. Granderson testified that Mr. Hays appeared intoxicated, adding, ''When I got tired of him, I ran him off.'' Mr. Carthan has described Mr. Hays as a political rival.

1148-> COLLAGEN AND COMPLEXION CARE
Collagen and Complexion Care June Weir's article ''The New Emphasis on Skin-Care Products'' (Sept. 26) has touched on a subject which is seen and discussed by more and more dermatologists in their daily practice. At present, the major cosmetic companies have developed or imported ingredients such as collagen, sodium ribonucleic acid (RNA), Swissmix extract or such to help make skin ''look clearer, smoother and younger looking.'' However, it is a well-known medical fact that these ingredients cannot penetrate the skin, and just add to the price of the product. I hope that the cosmetic companies will abandon fancy gimmicks and concentrate on offering the public good skin-care treatment through the efforts of basic research. I feel strongly that American women and men are becoming more educated and aware of good skin care and will not just become victims of the European sell-through.

1149-> On Campus Drinking: Case Against Curbs
In ''Curbs Sought on Campus Drinking'' (10/3), Hugh O'Haire depicts benevolent university administrators acting in the best interests of students by curtailing alcohol consumption on campuses all over Long Island. Mr. O'Haire's article exemplifies biased or naive journalism in failing to question why students have not independently identified and pursued their ''best interests,'' and in failing to consider why, after abandoning the role of in loco parentis in the 1960's, universities would again prefer it to non-paternalistic cooperation with students, faculties and staffs. There are at least three reasons why curbing alcohol consumption on campuses violates the best interests of students: - It will displace consumption to off-campus locations accessible only by automobile, thereby increasing alcohol-related traffic deaths and injuries. - It will encourage use of illegal narcotics and hallucinogenics, with their perils of accident, overdose and addiction, and criminal records to boot. - It will create by coercion a more restrictive environment on campuses than in the community; this shortsighted expedient may inhibit students' personal growth in maturity, responsibility and independence. The problems of alcohol and drug consumption on campuses should be addressed. Perhaps enlightened university administrators will cooperate with students, faculties and staffs to clean up their houses. Until that happens, student governments should beware of power grabs by administrations, which are influenced by the interests of outside funding and political powers, as well as by on-campus interests frequently in conflict with student interests. ROBERT A. MICHAELS, Ex-chairman, Graduate Student Government, S.U.N.Y., Stony Brook Helping Sanctions To Be Effective I am pleased to read about the efforts being made by Long Island universities and colleges to adopt and enforce reasonable rules relating to alcohol use on campus. I believe this is part of an overall awareness in our society that citizens need not stand by watching helplessly while the personal and social destruction caused by alcohol abuse continues to mount. Sanctions against illegal, unhealthy and dangerous uses of alcohol will only be effective if they are widely accepted, so that peer pressure and social values will support their enforcement. Thus, the widespread discussion of these issues on campus and the formation of groups of concerned students and faculty are most encouraging developments. Societies that have least alcohol problems seem to have the most clear-cut and accepted social rules for safe alcohol use. SHEILA B. BLUME, M.D. Director, State of New York Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse A Farm and a Spirit That Endure As a faithful, loyal customer and admirer of Youngs Farm, I feel I must respond to Richard F. Shepard's article ''About Long Island'' (Sept. 12). There are many adjectives that I could use about the Youngs family. Their spirit continues to revitalize not only their farm and produce, but Long Island as well. My only fear is that one day they will bow to the bulldozer and disappear. They have endured amid housing developments and country clubs. Family commitment, team spirit and the highest-quality products - these components spell success not only for the Youngs family, but also for Long Island.

1150-> ABROAD AT HOME; FIRST CONSEQUENCES
The MX missile may now never be built. Congress will take a harder look at all the plans for nuclear weapons, and at the rising defense budget generally. President Reagan will have strong new political incentives to negotiate seriously with the Russians on arms control. Those are likely to be among the consequences of the 1982 election: extraordinary consequences. It is not often that American voters send so clear a message on a substantive issue of foreign and defense policy. The voters also sent an unmistakable message on political methods: Neo-McCarthyism is not welcome. The candidates who made the rawest attacks on their opponents did badly. The New Right, with its tactics of fear and smear, did not repeat its 1980 successes. The nuclear arms question was the subject of what amounted to the largest referendum on any issue in American history. A quarter of the country's population had before it calls for a mutual freeze, and the resolutions carried nearly everywhere. Of nine statewide freeze proposals, all won except Arizona's. Among many local votes, the freeze lost only in Suffolk County on Long Island and in two small counties in Arkansas and Colorado. Liberal Democratic gains in the House of Representatives will have their impact on nuclear weapons issues. For example, after strenuous lobbying by President Reagan against a freeze resolution, the House on Aug. 5 adopted a Republican substitute by just a two-vote margin, 204 to 202. The votes are not likely to be there for the President next time. A key figure in the House vote against the freeze was Representative James Coyne of Pennsylvania, a young Republican moderate who had favored the freeze but was persuaded by Mr. Reagan to switch his position. His opponent in this election, former Representative Peter Kostmayer, made an issue of that switch - and won. The House also approved an appropriation for the MX by only a narrow margin last summer. The vote was 212 to 209 when $1.14 billion for production of the first nine of the giant new missiles was challenged on July 21. And even that vote for the MX made money for deployment contingent on approval of a permanent basic method. President Reagan is expected to announce soon that he favors ''dense-pack'' basing: putting 100 MX's, each armed with about 10 nuclear warheads, close together. That idea has already raised much skepticism among scientists, in addition to the doubts that the United States needs such a new weapon at all. The election results will deepen the resistance. That the freeze resolutions carried as they did was the more remarkable because Mr. Reagan worked hard to defeat them. He sent top aides to denounce their asserted dangers. He even said that people who wanted to weaken America were ''manipulating'' advocates of the freeze. In fact, the freeze resolutions were very cautious in their approach. The text in Massachusetts, which was typical, urged the Government ''vigorously to negotiate a mutual nuclear weapons moratorium and reduction, with appropriate verification, with the Soviet Union and other nations.'' The purpose was to indicate a mood, not a command. The mood is unquestionably there now, and it will not be easy to wish away. The Neo-McCarthyism was on display in various races around the country. In several of them, the results indicated that the targets of the smear attacks actually picked up votes by pointing out the smear and standing up to it. Representative Margaret Heckler, a Massachusetts Republican, insinuated that her opponent, Barney Frank, favored prostitution and pornography. An eight-term winner, she was overwhelmed by Mr. Frank this time - and her advertising was a self-defeating factor. Representative Robin Beard, Republican of Tennessee, used a vicious television ad suggesting that Fidel Castro was grateful to Senator Jim Sasser. Mr. Sasser won handily. Senator Harrison Schmitt, Republican of New Mexico, said falsely that his opponent, state Attorney General Jeff Bingaman, had helped ''free a convicted felon'' by a pardon. Mr. Bingaman picked up the seat. Representative David Emery, Republican of Maine, said that Senator George Mitchell had voted against veterans - at a time when he was not in the Senate. Mr. Mitchell, way behind in the polls, zoomed up and won. Then there was the right-wing effort in California to deny confirmation to three state supreme court justices. That did not work either. For believers in decent elections, it was a good day's work. Of course the distorting effect of money on American politics was still there, but the big spenders did not win them all. And Ncpac, the New Right nasties who used the ''social issues'' to knock off so many Senate Democrats in 1980, got nowhere with their money this time.

1152-> 2 PLEAD GUILTY TO DUMPING CHEMICALS INTO HUDSON
A former oil company president implicated in years of toxic waste dumping in the New York area pleaded guilty yesterday with an associate in Newark to Federal charges of extensive chemical dumping into the Hudson River and elsewhere. The businessman, Russell W. Mahler, 56 years old, and Kenneth Mansfield, 36, each face up to five years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines upon sentencing Dec. 9. Mr. Mahler was president and Mr. Mansfield was general manager of the now-defunct Hudson Oil Refining Corporation and Edgewater Terminals in Edgewater, N.J. As part of the plea agreement with the office of W. Hunt Dumont, the United States Attorney in New Jersey, both agreed to cooperate in related investigations of waste dumping. In their pleas before Judge Herbert J. Stern in District Court in Newark, the men admitted conspiring to defraud customers and the state of New Jersey. According to the charges, the men contracted to treat and properly dispose of dangerous wastes but, instead, dumped thousands of gallons of untreated chemical wastes into the river and unspecified sites in 1978 and '79. The materials that were illegally dumped, according to the Government, included cyanide-contaminated water, dyes, detergents, oil and creosote. Mr. Mahler is already serving a one-year sentence in Pennsylvania after pleading guilty to charges there of dumping waste oil contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals into abandoned coal shafts leading to the Susquehanna River. He and his company also paid fines of $750,000. Additional Federal charges against Mr. Mahler are pending in New York. According to Mr. Dumont's office, Mr. Mahler is one of the highest-ranking business executives ever convicted and jailed in a toxic dumping prosecution. Mr. Mahler replied with a simple ''yes'' when asked by Judge Stern if he had committed the acts charged. Mr. Mansfield replied, ''Yes, Your Honor.'' Neither man made any comment when leaving the court. Mr. Mansfield then went on to Staten Island, where he testified in State Supreme Court as a prosecution witness in the trial of John Cassiliano, a former supervisor in the New York City Sanitation Department. Mr. Cassiliano is accused of taking bribes in connection with illegal waste dumping at the Brookfield landfill. Mr. Mansfield testified that he had delivered wastes there for Mr. Mahler on numerous occasions. Mr. Mahler was to return to Allenwood Federal Penitentiary last night to continue serving his term, which ends in April. Although convicted on state charges, he was granted a request to serve his time in a Federal prison. Mr. Mahler's companies, which have been valued at millions of dollars, have been cited for numerous violations over the years, but until the Pennsylvania prosecution in 1980, the cases were usually settled with a fine that enabled the companies to continue operating. Earlier this year, New York's State Senate Select Committee on Crime conducted hearings into some of Mr. Mahler's operations and questioned why the illegal dumping had not come to light earlier. On one occasion, the hearings brought out, New Jersey paid Mr. Mahler $2.25 million to clean up an oil spill he had supposedly helped create.

1153-> FOR MOST POLES, THE FUTURE LOOKS AS GRAY AS THE PAST
Collectors take notice. The Polish Government is issuing a new stamp tomorrow commemorating, of all things, the imposition of martial law one year ago. Designed by a Colonel Tulodziecki, the stamp shows two sides of a medallion. One face is the Polish eagle and the formal name of the junta, the Military Council of National Salvation. The obverse has the words, ''We shall save our fatherland, Poland.'' ''What impudence,'' sputtered a disgruntled Pole. ''They saved the country from the people. They saved it for themselves.'' The Polish Parliament will also mark the day the troops went into factories and snowy streets. Suspension of martial law is on its agenda. But, after a year in which the military authorities have moved firmly to snuff out Solidarity, the independent trade union that briefly embodied the hopes of some 10 million Poles, Parliament's action will seem almost anticlimactic. The crackdown had been swift and sure. At one time or another, some 10,131 Solidarity activists, dissident intellectuals and other troublemakers were rounded up and held in internment camps and 3,616 arrests were made for violations of martial law. The authorities say they broke up 677 opposition groups, mainly affiliated with Solidarity, seized more than one million illegal leaflets, silenced 11 clandestine radio stations, and closed down 360 underground printing shops equipped with 1,196 presses or mimeograph machines and 486 typewriters. At first there was a short burst of defiance with demonstrations that turned in some cases into near riots in May, June, August and October. But by November, Solidarity was unable to make good on its call for a nationwide strike and it was clear that the heady, anarchic challenge to 36 years of Communist rule was finished. Whatever the cosmetic changes, the prospect seems to be for continued martial law without the label. Polish diplomats and traveling Government officials have been buttonholing Western dignitaries and telling them that military rule is soon to be ended in the hope that the painful trade sanctions the West imposed will be ended as well. But party officials say openly that there will be little change in day-to-day life. But Solidarity's leader, Lech Walesa, keeps trying. He released a letter yesterday to Poland's ruler, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, asking for national reconciliation through an amnesty for those sentenced under martial law, reinstatenent of those dismissed for political reasons and a trade union policy based on the principle of plurality. (President Reagan declared last week that the United States was prepared to re-establish normal relations with Poland if it introduced ''meaningful liberalization measures.'' He indicated these would have to go beyond the end of martial law and include the release of all detainees and a dialogue with ''the freely formed trade unions.'') There have been strong hints that any easing of martial law will be a long process and that the Government will hold on to extraordinary powers. ''Certain temporary measures are being prepared which will apply after the lifting of martial law,'' Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said. Although internment would end, he said, it did not necessarily follow that all the internees would be released. The Government has already enacted a framework of new laws to make sure things don't get out of hand. The new, toothless unions established by the legislation that outlawed Solidarity will be tied to the Communist Party and their ability to strike will be virtually nonexistent. The unions can only be named after their factories; any catchy titles like, say, Solidarity, are out. All during the fall workers were being fired for trying to organize strikes; now out of work, they can be pressed into road gangs or other Government work under a bill aimed at ''social parasites.'' Regime Lacks Popular Support The Government has won its victory over what had been a determinedly peaceful revolution. It has yet to win the support of its people. Solidarity was born out of frustration with steadily deteriorating conditions, out of a desire for the good things of life after years of empty promises and out of cynicism about ruling class corruption and privilege. These feelings have not changed. For Poland, and for the rest of Eastern Europe, troubled by similar problems of economic crumble and frustration, the lesson seems simple: Their Communist rulers do not intend to budge. General Jaruzelski now has to win the allegiance of a disenchanted citizenry and a sullen, uncooperative workforce. In a recent widely discussed newspaper column, Mr. Urban conceded that lack of support for the Government was even more of a threat than the underground, blaming ''the indifference of the Polish people, their passiveness, naivete, weakness for myths, refusal to take part in public life and passive waiting to see what will happen.'' Large sections of society, particularly intellectuals, have become nonparticipants. The most visible manifestation is the continued boycott of state television by most of the nation's best-known actors and actresses. In trying to build support, General Jaruzelski appears to have acquired a new ally in the Roman Catholic Primate, Archbishop Jozef Glemp. Despite some criticism from the ranks, he seems to be bringing the authority of the church to bear on the side of the Government, even admonishing the actors to get back ''where they belong.'' At bottom, much of the problem is economic. And, despite a carefully selected set of optimistic statistics, they seem near insoluble. The Government points to a slight increase in production, mainly in coal. But this is done by comparing a six-day week to last year's five-day week, one of Solidarity's short-lived gains. The miners are getting premium pay for working a Saturday shift, an improvement on the militarization of the mines to keep them going. But the zlotys the miners get are worth less and less. There is little in the stores to spend them on - neither shoes, meat, soap, nor clothes. The main improvement that the end of martial law seems likely to bring is the silencing of the metallic voice repeating ''rozmowa kontrolowana'' over every telephone call that has been made for the past year, a warning that all the conversations are being taped and monitored. Whether the eavesdropping will stop is another question.

1154-> REPORT QUESTIONS LILLY ROLE ON DRUG
Eli Lilly & Company did not disclose reports of 26 British deaths linked to Oraflex when it sought Government approval to market the antiarthritis drug, according to investigators for the Food and Drug Administration. Last August, Lilly voluntarily withdrew the drug, generically known as benoxaprofen, from United States markets after a decision by the British authorities to suspend sale of the drug there. Oraflex has been associated with 96 deaths outside the United States and up to 20 deaths in this country. The deaths reportedly resulted from liver and kidney damage, gastrointestinal hemorrhages or perforated ulcers. The investigators' field report was obtained and released by Ralph Nader's Health Research Group, and the Federal agency acknowledged its authenticity today. The report shows that the investigators inspected Lilly's records on Oct. 18 and Nov. 19 in Indianapolis, the company's headquarters. Bill Grigg, an agency spokesman, said the drug agency received the report earlier this week and that top agency officials would review the ''raw investigative report to determine what further action is necessary.'' The drug agency is also investigating Lilly's apparent failure to made complete reports on adverse reactions to several other drugs. Report Cites Several Failings According to the investigators' report, Lilly ''did not promptly investigate and report to the Food and Drug Administration all findings associated with the use of drug that may suggest significant hazards, contraindications, side-effects and precautions pertinent to the safety of the drug.'' The report said that 26 British deaths ''were known to Eli Lilly & Company and/or its divisions, subsidiaries or affiliates prior to the new drug approval date.'' These death reports were apparently made to Lilly's British subsidiary, Dista Products Ltd. The investigators also charged that the company failed to maintain complete files and failed to report the British deaths after the drug was approved for sale in this country on April 19, 1981. Asked about the authenticity of the charges, Mr. Grigg of the agency declined to pass judgment. But he said the report appeared to corroborate earlier findings by Representative L.@H. Fountain, Democrat of North Carolina. On Sept. 20, Mr. Fountain, who had held hearings on the agency's approval of Oraflex, said that Lilly had failed to report at least eight British deaths. ''Eli Lilly & Company did not report eight deaths in the United Kingdom,'' Mr. Fountain said at the time, ''despite the fact that Lilly's British subsidiary knew of these deaths and had, in fact, reported them to the British Government months before F.D.A. approved Oraflex for sale in the United States.'' E. Ronald Culp, a spokesman for Lilly, would only say today, ''The company has complied with the laws regarding the reporting of adverse reactions.'' Although the company would not clarify its position, an F.D.A. official who asked not to be identified said the company apparently believed agency regulations did not require American companies to provide reports received by its affiliates overseas. The agency contends such reports are required by law. Company in Earlier Denials Lilly has denied allegations in the past that it knew of deaths before the drug was marketed in this country. Lilly's reporting practices have been of particular concern to the agency. In September 1981 Dr. Michael Hensley, an agency investigator, reported that Lilly's failure to submit complete adverse reaction reports for Oraflex ''is not anomalous, but is instead typical of all Lilly new drug application submissions.'' At that time, he recommended further investigation to determine if Federal laws had been violated.

The San Diego Padres have convinced Jerry Kapstein, the agent for the free-agent first baseman Steve Garvey, that they are serious about signing the former Los Angeles Dodger star. Garvey has been asking for a five-year contract worth about $1.5 million a year and Kapstein said the Padres' offer was serious. Ballard Smith, the Padres' president, said after meeting with Kapstein and Garvey that ''basically, they are waiting for one more proposal.''

1156-> FLEA MARKETS SET CRITICS HOPPING
''WE'RE a phenomenon - the wave of the future,'' said Sigmund Margulies, president of Tri-County Flea Markets, who estimates that his Smithtown outlet draws as many as 60,000 customers ''on a good day.'' Indeed, as shoppers in search of bargains flock in ever-increasing numbers to the Island's rapidly breeding crop of flea markets, the organized opposition to these ventures rises accordingly. In 1980, retail sales totaling about $11 billion were made in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. The retail committee of the Long Island Association of Commerce and Industry estimates that 11 percent of that business was transacted through flea markets. It is the opinion of the committee that ''as flea markets erode legitimate retail sales into the double digits, the matter becomes a serious concern.'' Both the Long Island Association and the Queens Business Alliance contend that flea markets enjoy an unfair advantage in the increasingly keen competition for consumer dollars. Last year the storekeepers lobbied unsuccessfully for passage of a state law aimed at forcing flea markets to organize more along the lines of general retail businesses. The bill, which would have mandated detailed reporting of sales tax collections and compliance with town zoning codes as well as adherence to labor laws, is likely to be reintroduced next year. ''There's a high cost of doing business in line with the law; if flea markets were made to comply, they couldn't possibly offer such low prices,'' said William Gaylor, executive director of the Long Island Association. ''We find that less than 10 percent of the vendors collect sales tax, and that allows them to keep their overhead low,'' Mr. Gaylor said. ''They don't have to maintain cash registers, and they don't bother with keeping receipts. They're not apt to comply with building or sanitary codes, and who knows if they even make Social Security payments?'' While the Long Island Association is channeling its lobbying efforts and its funds into obtaining regulatory legislation, the Town of Hempstead is suing the Barterama Corporation and the New York Racing Association. Barterama operates flea markets in both the Aqueduct and Belmont race tracks' parking lots, where it rents space from the racing association. The lawsuit seeks to have Barterama conform to Hempstead's town codes. Furthermore, it questions whether flea markets that occupy rented state land, such as the race-track property, should be able to enjoy the same zoning exemptions accorded the New York Racing Association. ''It's a clever idea for the racing association,'' said Jeffrey Stadler, Hempstead's deputy town attorney. ''It gives them muchneeded revenues, at a time when racing attendance is way down due to Offtrack Betting. But it doesn't mean the flea market should be exempt from town and city zoning ordinances and permits. We should be able to control their sanitary systems, their litter and their traffic.'' The most recent court battle with Barterama was argued in the Appellate Division in Queens County in early November. A decision has yet to be rendered in the suit, which was brought jointly by Hempstead Town, the City of New York and the Queens Business Alliance. ''I'm in business eight years now,'' said Sheldon Hills, president of the Barterama Corporation, ''and the lawsuits against me read like the Encyclopedia Britannica. I've been charged with unfair competition, not having insurance, not collecting taxes, not having clean facilities, not maintaining proper security and not paying the scale to my employees -and it's all nonsense.'' ''We get inspected more than a chicken, and they never come up with anything,'' Mr. Hills said. ''We get inspected by the State Tax Agency, we get inspected by the Labor Department. All it amounts to is total harassment.'' He maintained that the vendors were individually responsible for collecting and reporting sales taxes. He also said his employees were paid well above scale. ''The retailers are trying to burden us with all the stuff they have to do,'' he said. Mr. Hills is of the opinion that the major department stores near his flea markets have put together ''a war chest'' of funds to put him and others like him out of business. But he and his colleagues look upon the flea market concept as ''a time-honored New York tradition in the venue of Orchard Street.'' ''We see the flea market as a return to the mom-and-pop stores of a bygone era,'' said Jay Factor, manager of the flea market at Roosevelt Raceway. ''First there were the pushcarts and the mom-andpop-type operations. Then there were the department stores, then the discount houses, and now we've come full cycle.'' In the case of the Roosevelt Raceway flea market, Mr. Factor said that venture was unique because it not only adjoined but enhanced the nearby shopping mall. The market is close to Roosevelt Field and shares a parking lot with Ohrbach's and Fortunoff's. Several flea market owners assert that they rent booth space on weekends to retailers who run established stores during the week. Many vendors travel the circuit, working four and five markets in the course of a week. They are supposed to display tax certificates and report regularly to the state on all tax revenues collected. Much of the merchandise they sell is obtained at auction. Nonetheless, the flea market owners concede that a portion of the public believes the goods sold in these outlets are stolen. The owners say, however, that detectives and insurance agents are dispatched regularly to check out the flea markets by manufacturers who have ''had a load lifted.'' More than ever, flea market operations are locating in buildings once occupied by now-defunct department store and discount chains. One of Tri-County's outlets rents the former home of the Mays department store in Levittown. Mr. Margulies predicts that flea markets will move into the premises now being vacated by the Woolco chain. ''The flea markets have come out of the Dark Ages,'' Mr. Margulies said. ''In the early 50's, the mobs were at the department stores. Now they're in the flea markets. Where else can you buy a fur in one booth and a pickle for a nickel in the next?''

1158-> DEAR WASHINGTON: I THINK...
WASHINGTON ''IT is with complete amazement that I am writing to disagree with the President's proposal to tax unemployment benefits. Those people must be in Disney World to believe that the people on unemployment lines are doing this because they want to.'' ''I am writing to urge Congress not to fund the MX. MX escalates the arms race and makes future negotiations more difficult.'' These are among the typical letters that Long Island Representatives have been receiving in increasing numbers from their constituents during the post-election session. According to Congressional aides, Long Islanders have been asking their Representatives to vote against the MX, the proposed increase in gasoline taxes and the unemployment-check levy, and to insure that Social Security benefits are not cut. The Island delegation's offices in Congress have also been receiving a steady flow of ''case-worker'' mail dealing with specific constituent problems - for example, someone having difficulty getting unemployment benefits - and a number of letters and postcards on a smattering of other issues. Long Island Representatives well realize, as do most members of Congress, that the way they respond to their mail can help keep them in office. Most see answering the mail a their top priority, as well as a way to gauge public opinion. ''Don't kid yourself,'' said Fred Whiting, press secretary to Representative Raymond J. McGrath, Republican of Valley Stream. ''Members of Congress are very responsive to the constituent mail. We send out questionnaires and meet with constituents, but the personal letter is the most effective tool we have for communicating with the constituents.'' From the beginning of the 97th Congress until June of this year, Mr. McGrath received 50,000 letters. The discussions with the aides revealed that the Island-delegation offices spend a lot of time analyzing the trends and responding to the swelling flow of mail, which has increased enough to make it unlikely that the average Representative will see more than a portion of the letters coming into his office. The mail burden is left to aides. But each letter usually gets an answer. According to Elmo Boydston, deputy postmaster of the House of Representatives, the influx of mail to all Representatives since 1972 has more than tripled, from roughly 50 million pieces to 160 million pieces in 1981. Mr. Boydston expects the level to exceed 160 million this year. Most of the Island delegation's offices devote at least half of their staffs, in one case as many as eight people, to answering the mail. The staff does everything from sorting the mail to drafting responses and making sure that return letters actually bear the Representative's signature. Most offices file form letters in word processors for automatic printing, and often switch paragraphs around from the memory banks to create new letters. Representatives sometimes walk a fine line in their correspondence so that they are not bound to a position on an issue that they cannot support later. As Johanna Schrambling, a spokesman for Representative William Carney, Republican-Conservative of Hauppauge, put it: ''Sometimes it is difficult for a member of Congress to say, 'I support such and such without any qualms.' People don't understand how many changes can be made between the introduction and the final bill.'' Representatives from the Island received thousands of pieces of mail during this year's budget battle and tax-bill fight. Michael Thomas, a spokesman for Representative John LeBoutillier, Republican of Westbury, said, ''You almost know when the votes are coming up because you start getting the mail.'' Most of the Island's Representatives have been receiving between 50 and 200 pieces of mail during the current session. Mr. LeBoutillier's mail has declined now, most likely because he lost his election bid, but Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Amityville, has received much more mail than he expected, over 500 letters at the beginning of the special session. On the decline in mail at his office, Christian Braunlich, administrative assistant to Mr. LeBoutillier, commented: ''Probably what people are writing about to us is not typical. They are probably also writing to Bob Mrazek.'' Robert J. Mrazek of Centerport defeated Mr. LeBoutillier in the election but will not take office until next month. Almost all Long Island Representatives received 15 to 20 letters a week on the MX missile proposal before the program's setback Tuesday when the House voted down initial financing for the weapon. Bill Roberts, a spokesman for Representative Norman F. Lent, Republican of East Rockaway, said that the mail in his office was running 8 to 1 in favor of defense-spending reductions, with many letters saying specifically to cut the MX. Mr. Downey has been receiving five to 10 letters a day on the MX. ''There has not been one positive piece of mail on the MX,'' said Kathy Tynan, a staff assistant for Mr. Downey. On Social Security, the constituents have been unanimously opposed to cuts in benefits. Mrs. Schrambling said that in Mr. Carney's office roughly one-fourth of the constituent letters dealt with Social Security, and ''all were opposed to cuts.'' Mr. Lent's office received several cartoons of a duck on crutches expressing opposition to cuts in Social Security benefits: ''Don't let a lame-duck session cripple Social Security,'' the caption said. ''Take Social Security off the special session.'' Mr. Roberts said that the response of Mr. Lent's office to the cartoons, which were likely generated by a senior-citizen organization, was a letter explaining that Congress would not hold hearings on Social Security until Feb. 1. Many Long Islanders have also been asking their Representatives to oppose the 5-cent gasoline tax increase, a bipartisan proposal supported by President Reagan that is designed to rebuild the nation's highways and thereby create 320,000 jobs. The House passed the bill on Monday by a vote of 262 to 143, and the Senate is now working on its version of the bill. Gene Meyer, a legislative assistant to Representative Gregory W. Carman, Republican of Farmingdale, said that the response to the gas tax in his district had been ''mixed,'' but he read the following letter from a constituent on the topic: ''Please make sure the House puts a definite damper on Reagan's proposal for a 5-cent increase in the gas tax. I'm absolutely sick and tired of the constant increase in our cost of living and the failure of our political figures to bring about some real grass-roots change.'' Miss Tynan said that voters from Mr. Downey's district were also opposed to the gas tax. ''There is little mass transportation on Long Island,'' she said. ''People are very car-dependent. The proposal would be more harmful to people on Long Island, unless some of the money is set aside for mass transit.'' Although these issues have elicited constituent mail, Mr. Meyer pointed out, as did others, that the mail was slower now, compared with other times in the year. ''There is not really a burning issue at the moment,'' he said, not in the sense that the last summer's tax-increase bill was a burning issue. Some of the other mail-drawing issues mentioned by Representatives include: the nuclear freeze, the general state of the economy, the budget, the environment, public hearings on the Shoreham nuclear facility, tuition-tax credits and the balanced-budget amendment. Although there is no overriding issue now, Mr. Meyer said that if the President made a speech, ''you're going to get a swamp of letters.'' At some points last year, so many letters came to Capitol Hill that there were delays in delivering the mail. Those missives came in all forms: postcards, form letters, drawings, cartoons and personalized letters. If a Representative gets hundreds of postcards or form letters on a single issue, the staff will draft a form letter in response and let the Congressman know how many cards he is receiving. ''When you get 300 postcards that are identical, you know someone is sponsoring it,'' Mrs. Schrambling said, ''but rarely are the sponsors listed on the cards.'' The personal letter receives more attention. According to some aides, the Long Island letter writers are fairly sophisticated compared with their counterparts in other sections of the country. ''I have been here almost three years,'' said Miss Tynan, ''and the letters are very sophisticated in terms of being aware of what is going on or when an issue is being considered. But the writers usually give a personal reason for what they believe in.'' She said Mr. Downey usually wrote a note on the top of constituent letters to give his staff an idea of how to respond. The most sophisticated letters are the ones that are most likely to reach the lawmaker's desk. As Mr. Whiting put it: ''The most effective letter is one that is clear, detailed enough that it shows the writer understands there are at least two sides to an issue, and one that makes a good case for the writer's point of view.''

MINNEAPOLIS CRIME WATCH PROGRAM CENTERS ON 8 MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 16 (AP) - Eight people with felony records are drawing more than the usual scrutiny from the Minneapolis police, who are trying to cut crime by keeping watch on those considered most likely to commit it. The program, Target 8, which began Nov. 2 and has drawn some opposition, takes a tip from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's ''most wanted'' list. Local police drew up their own list of criminals considered ''most likely'' to try again. ''This is absolutely ludicrous,'' Bill Kennedy, the Hennepin County Public Defender, said. ''It means they have assumed for themselves the right to select a group of people and spy on them. Maybe tomorrow they are going to select the Jews or Lutherans or Scandinavians.'' Bernard Jablonski, deputy police chief, counters that it is a way for the city's 400 officers to keep track of eight men the department considers the most prone to commit a crime. Worried by Implications Mr. Kennedy argues that if one of the men on the list sits down to talk with ''two or three people, those two or three are going to wind up in police dossiers.'' ''This is an issue that when you think it through is rather frightening in its implications,'' he said. The Minnesota Civil Liberties Union said it was uncertain about the constitutional aspects of the program. The Target 8 files are confidential, but copies of the mugshots and file cards were obtained by The Associated Press. ''I think it's against my rights,'' Gordon E. Grafft, 23 years old, one of the eight, said in an interview. ''It's against my privacy. I've never done any violent crimes or anything like that.'' Convicted Twice of Burglary Mr. Grafft said that he was convicted twice on felony charges, one of the criteria for being included in Target 8, both times for burglary. He said he served 90 days in jail on his first conviction and a year in a state prison on the second. ''I already did my time and I'm still on probation,'' he said. ''I've been in trouble. I admit I did wrong, but I don't think I should be extra-punished.'' Deputy Chief Jablonski said the program was requested by police officers, who asked for a way to keep each other informed. Lawyers were consulted and a system developed for selecting the eight, he said. It provides for officers in the field to make nominations on a sheet that asks questions about the individual's convictions and what sort of crime was committed. A point system is used to screen some of the candidates. The final selections are made made by a committee headed by the captain of the department's organized crime division. Once the eight were selected, cards were printed on each of them and distributed to patrolmen. In the view of Mr. Kennedy, the public defender, ''the real message that comes from Target 8 is that the police are singling out a group of people and deciding they are bad people and we don't want them here. Even though they've paid their debt to society they don't want them here. ''The police are going to determine who is desirable and who isn't. I always thought that was up to a judge and jury rather than the policeman on the corner.''

1166-> AROUND THE NATION; Hurricane Iwa Hits Hawaiian Island of Kauai
Hurricane Iwa, with winds of up to 110 miles an hour, hit the southern side of Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands tonight, night, knocking out power on the entire island. No injuries were initially reported. About 5,000 residents of the island were evacuated from the lowlying areas to shelters on high ground, the Civil Defense office in Honolulu said. At 8 P.M. local time, the eye of the hurricane was reported over Lihue, the island's capital. Powerful winds blew out a wall of plate glass windows in the Kauai War Memorial Convention Hall crowded with more than 1,500 evacuees. No one was hurt, eyewitnesses said. Kauai, 72 miles northwest of Honolulu, and nearby Niihau, a privately owned island with a population of 256, were battered by high winds and heavy rains as Iwa drew close to the islands, which are on the northern edge of the Hawaiian chain.

Investment bankers have not scheduled any significant new bond offerings in the corporate or tax-exempt markets this week. They said, however, that there was such a backlog of issuers - particularly in the corporate market - that a few issues could be brought to market if investor demand materialized. In the Treasury market the only auctions are today, for three- and six-month bills. Late Friday, outstanding three- and six-month Treasury bills were bid at rates of 7.9 percent and 8.01 percent, respectively.

1171-> JOHN LYMAN DEAD; RAN HISTORIC FARM
John Lyman Sr., a figure in Connecticut agriculture, business and education, died Friday at Middlesex Memorial Hospital in Middletown, Conn. Mr. Lyman, a lifelong resident of Middlefield, Conn., was 86 years old. He had operated the 1,110-acre Lyman Farm in Middlefield, one of Connecticut's oldest family farm operations, from 1921 to 1958. The farm was established in 1741 and is now run by the eighth generation of Lymans. Mr. Lyman, a former First Selectman of Middlefield, had served 26 years on the local Board of Education, many of them as chairman. He was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1923. He also served on the State Board of Education from 1938 to 1951, and was chairman for four years. The family farming operations began on a 43-acre site. An annual apple crop of up to 60,000 bushels and 12,000 to 15,000 bushels of peaches were produced. About half of the annual fruit crop was sold on the property. Mr. Lyman graduated from Taft School in Watertown and was a 1917 graduate of the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale University. He was a past president of the Lyman Gun Sight Corporation and a director of the Hartford Electric Light Company. He is survived by his wife, the former Edna Anderson; a son, John Jr., of Middlefield; three daughters, Elizabeth Warden of Ballston Lake, N.Y.; Dorothy Waller of Columbus, Ohio, and Mary Heist of Old Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Henry H., of Middlefield; two sisters, Esther DeLacour of Durham, Conn., and Sarah Woolverton of Cassopolis, Mich.; 15 grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

1172-> COMPANY NEWS; Braniff Set Back
The attempt to get part of Braniff Airways flying again was set back, as its pilots refused to give further concessions to form a joint venture with PSA Inc. Richard L. Goduti, an official in the Airline Pilots Association who heads the New York area council of Braniff pilots, said a straw vote of members showed that they were unwilling to give up their seniority for a joint venture with Pacific Southwest Airlines. When the pilots refused to give on the seniority issue last week, PSA broke off talks on the venture.

1173-> SUBSTITUTE IN 'TOSCA' HAILED
Olivia Stapp, the Metropolitan Opera soprano, scored the kind of success that every young singer dreams about on Monday night when she rushed to the Washington Opera from New York to substitute for the ailing Shirley Verrett in ''Tosca.'' It was such short notice that Miss Stapp had to practice on the Eastern Airlines 5 P.M. shuttle. She was applauded by the flight attendants and passengers in the first five or six rows who were able to hear her. Miss Stapp had not sung the role in a year and a half and was practicing the part of Lady Macbeth when she got the call, so considerable coaching and practice were needed before she could go on stage and sing, stab the evil Baron Scarpia and fling herself from a parapet in the last act. Gary Fifield, the Washington Opera's managing director, said that Miss Stapp sang the part in the taxi out to La Guardia Airport and then in the front seat of the shuttle. Practice Before Each Act Then she sang the role in the taxi from National Airport to the Kennedy Center Opera House,and the intermissions were extended so that she could rehearse before each act. The audience gave her an ovation and the reviewer in The Washington Post said of her performance, ''She was just sensational.'' Miss Verrett, who had suffered an allergic reaction to medicine she was taking, is to return to the role Saturday night opposite the Cavaradossi of Carlo Bergonzi. The audience did not know of the substitution until the performance was to begin, and just two patrons of the 2,000 on hand walked out in disappointment over Miss Verrett's absence. On the other hand, several hundred applauded when they heard the announcement of Miss Stapp, who sang here last year in ''Macbeth.'' Today Miss Stapp returned to New York to resume praparing for her role in ''Macbeth,'' in which she will alternate with Renata Scotto.

1176-> COPTERS MOVING MORE ACCIDENT VICTIMS IN CITY
A city program that went into full operation in recent months is using police helicopters to rush accident victims who have suffered severe burns or other critical injuries to specially designated New York hospitals. Helicopters have flown accident victims to city hospitals occasionally in the past. But now the city's Emergency Medical Service has established the regular medical evacuation system with the Police Department. Dr. Alexander E. Kuehl, the head of the Emergency Medical Service, said the program - known as the ''med-evac system'' - ''will save lives'' in New York. The medical service operates the city's 911 municipal ambulance system. The helicopters will be used primarily in the city. But emergency cases from the surrounding region will also be flown in to the hospitals designated as special centers for trauma, burns and reattaching limbs. Copter Saved Snake Victim The new system, however, will not try to fly helicopters to a majority of serious accident cases, as is done in many rural areas. Nor will they be used as extensively as they are in such spread-out Western cities as Denver, Houston, Salt Lake City and Kansas City, Mo. In a recent use of the system in New York, a Long Island animal importer who was bitten on the thumb by a poisonous king cobra at Kennedy International Airport on Oct. 7 was flown in a police medevac helicopter to the Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, the city's only snake-venom facility, where he was given a massive dose of serum. According to Dr. Kuehl, the victim, 31-year-old Robert Hughes of Freeport, would never have survived a long ambulance ride. In another case, microsurgeons at Bellevue Hospital Center were able to reattach the partically severed foot of a 16-year-old boy because he was brought from Queens by a police helicopter in a matter of minutes. Limited Use in New York Dr. Kuehl is chiefly responsible for bringing helicopters into the system. He previously served as a director at the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems in Baltimore. The institute uses helicopters extensively in moving critically injured patients to its trauma center. But Dr. Kuehl said helicopters would be used far less often in New York than there. Only two or three patients a week are now being flown to hospitals here. This is because the city has nearly 100 hospitals and ambulances can get to them quickly. Also, there are not that many places a helicopter can land in the city, particularly in Manhattan. The Bronx Municipal Hospital Center, designated as that borough's trauma and burn center, has a parking lot just outside its entrance that will be used as an emergency helicopter landing pad. In Manhattan, several hospitals are expected to receive similar designations. Bellevue is expected to be officially designated as a trauma and limb-reattachment center, using the East River heliport a few blocks away at East 34th Street as its landing pad. Central Park Landing Pad For uptown hospitals, Central Park is planned as a landing spot. And at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn an adjoining baseball field is to be used as a landing pad. According to Dr. Kuehl, a helicopter is only requested from the Police Aviation facility at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn after a regular ambulance crew determines that it will not be able to get an emergency case to a particular hospital fast enough, and only after a suitable spot is found nearby for the helicopter to land.

1177-> Rumania
To the Editor: ''Moldavian Masterpieces'' (Travel, Nov. 21) brought back memories of our own trip to Northern Rumania last fall. Like R.W. Apple Jr., we found the medieval frescoes in the monasteries exquisite, but the region has much else of interest and merits a longer visit than Mr. Apple's. v. e went on many beautiful walks in the farmland valleys surrounding the monasteries and occasionally hiked across the hills from one monastery to another. (The hike from Sucevita to Putna, a monastery not mentioned in the article, was particularly enjoyable.) In the hills, one sees only an occasional logger with his horse and soon realizes that tractors have not yet replaced horses on many of the farms. All the monasteries are accessible by public transportation, and the inconvenience of traveling by bus is more than offset by the increased contacts with Rumanians. People at bus stations were always willing to offer opinions about sights, accommodations or current events - if only through sign language. There are restaurants, inns and campgrounds at almost all of the monasteries. DANIEL PERLSTEIN Hoboken, N.J.

1178-> All Goals Met, Holmes Ready to Retire
Next month, Larry Holmes will tape some commercials for Coors Beer, and the world heavyweight champion will gladly drink to that. The toast would not be to his long-sought recognition, but to the end of his boxing career. Active athletes are prohibited by Federal law from endorsing alcoholic products. Holmes will also be doing advertisements for Cutty Sark soon. At the age of 32, undefeated in 40 fights and with nothing to prove and no compelling contenders around, he is getting ready to retire. ''I'm not so naive to think I can continue to take punches,'' he said in an interview this morning, three days before he defends his World Boxing Council title against Randall (Tex) Cobb at the Astrodome. He said this would be his next-to-last fight. ''Cobb is tough, but he's not a big puncher, and for the last one, I don't want a big puncher, either,'' he said. ''What do I need it for?'' Gets A Call From Ali A few days ago, he said, he got a telephone call from his old sparring partner, Muhammad Ali. He said the voice on the other end of the line was slurred. ''He had too many fights,'' said Holmes. The only reason Holmes did not retire after his last bout June 11, when he knocked out Gerry Cooney in the 13th round, was a hotel. He paid about $5 million for what is now called the Larry Holmes Commodore Inn, a 141-room hotel in New Jersey across the Delaware River from his home in Easton, Pa. ''Listen, I don't even know the address,'' he said. ''But it's the hotel, that and tax reasons, why I'm still fighting. I had to pay about $3 million in taxes for the Cooney fight.'' His purse was about $8.5 million before expenses. The champion, who will earn about $1.5 million for this nationally televised bout (ABC), about twice what Cobb will get, said he was ''truly thinking'' of winding up his career with an exhibition in his hotel ballroom with Marvin Stinson, his longtime sparring partner. ''Then I'll make Marvin retire, too,'' he said. ''He doesn't need the money. I paid him $25,000 for the Cooney fight, and he knows if he ever needs money he can come to me.'' Says Fighters Get Scared Holmes was stretched out on the couch in his suite. His wife, Diane, entered and reported that their two children, 3-year-old Kandie Larie and 2-month-old Larry Jr., were still sleeping. ''I think the only reason Larry's still fighting,'' she said, ''is because he doesn't want to get up in the middle of the night and change diapers.'' Holmes laughed. ''I may look relaxed, but believe me, fighters get scared,'' he said. ''Eddie Futch told me something about Alexis Arguello, how he went almost crazy before the Aaron Pryor fight, how he starts talking stupid stuff, like dying, which almost happened against Pryor because they let the fight go on too long.'' Futch, who trains Holmes, was in Arguello's corner Nov. 12, when he was knocked out by Pryor in the 14th. That was the night before Duk Koo Kim was fatally injured by Ray Mancini. Holmes said referees' decisions were ''all subjective, so if they can justify the reasons why they let it go on, then they can justify why they stopped it early.'' For Stricter Examinations He advocates stricter prefight physicals, and before many of his fights he arranges for tests that include brain scans, skull and rib X-rays. ''If I didn't pay for them myself, no one else would do them,'' he said. ''The only place I've ever had a brain scan was in New York. The rest of the places just check your knuckles and your blood pressure. At least here in Texas they checked my eyes.'' He said he was thinking of offering to pay for a complete prefight physical for Cobb. ''I'm serious,'' he said. ''Maybe it'll change things later. Fighters aren't protected enough. I took full tests before and after the Cooney fight.'' He said that he would have another physical when he went to Las Vegas, Nev., for the Dec. 10 World Boxing Association heavyweight title bout between Mike Weaver, the champion, and Michael Dokes. He said he was not interested in fighting the winner to unify the title, nor in a rematch with Cooney. ''They're trying to build him back up,'' he said. ''How come when a guy like Cooney doesn't go to the gym, everyone gets concerned? 'Boxing needs you,' he's told. Boxing ain't going to miss him. Remember how they'd say boxing won't be the same after Ali. It's on television every weekend now.'' Holmes termed the Cobb fight ''a relief'' after the often-emotional buildup for the Cooney fight, with its racial overtones. Cobb, like Cooney, is white, but Holmes said that ''this time people ain't calling me a racist, and there've been no threatening phone calls.'' He said he was grateful that Cobb had shied away from the racial issue. Holmes likes Cobb, a burly West Texan with a solid chin and heart, but hardly with the skills to bother Holmes, unless the champion was out of shape, which he is not. ''This guy might give me trouble,'' he said. ''He takes a lot of punishment. Cooney, I hit him four or five times and he got drunk. Cobb ain't gonna get drunk. I'm not predicting a knockout.'' Holmes said he realized that a victory over Cobb, and whoever he chose for his finale, would not add to the luster of a career in which he has met all challenges successfully. ''I don't need credit,'' he said. ''I got cash.''

1181-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
The Post-Christmas Rush L ike Olympic runners leaping off the blocks, shoppers with Christmas gifts to return and post-Christmas bargain hunters hit the city's department stores yesterday. ''It beats the ball game on Sunday,'' said Rosemarie Brown, who came up from East 52d Street to stand in a fast-moving service line at Bloomingdale's. She held a box of perfume rejected by a friend. ''She says she doesn't wear it,'' Mrs. Brown said with a shrug. ''I'll change it and get it over with, because tomorrow I'm sure it's going to be worse.'' Designer perfumes, cosmetics and high-priced clothing that failed to please went back on the shelves. Dorothy Johnson had given her 18-year-old daughter a designer coat and a watch from another designer. The timepiece was pronounced ''tacky looking,'' so Mrs. Johnson went back to Bloomingdale's from West 97th Street. ''She's in bed resting,'' said Mrs. Johnson of her daughter, a freshman at Brown University. ''She has a lot of exams coming up. She was satisfied with the coat. It was quite a coat.''

1182-> HOUSE VOTES TO BAR OIL LEASES
The House today approved a $7.4 billion appropriation bill containing a provision that bars Interior Secretary James G. Watt from approving oil and gas leasing off the northern two-thirds of the California coastline. The vote, 275 to 73, sent the bill to the Senate. Secretary Watt, the California restriction and other limits on the Secretary's authority went almost unmentioned in the floor debate. The bill provides funds for the Interior Department and related agencies for the fiscal year 1983, which ends Sept. 30, 1983. It would prohibit Mr. Watt from using Federal money to lease oil drilling rights on the outer continental shelf in a strip extending from Pismo Beach, Calif., to the Oregon border. Offshore tracts there have been scheduled for a lease sale next September. Use of Park Facilities Limited The measure would not affect a large offshore oilfield recently discovered in the Santa Maria Basin. It also would continue an existing ban on approval of oil and gas leases in designated Federal wilderness areas and national forestlands. The ban, unless extended, would expire Dec. 17. Other restrictions, also unchallenged in the House debate. would limit Secretary Watt's use of a discretionary fund and the use of National Park Service facilities for political or social functions. The restrictions were prompted by Mr. Watt's use last year of the Custis-Lee Mansion in Arlington National Park for a Christmas reception and breakfast. The bill would provide $3.7 billion for the Interior Department, $1.5 billion for the United States Forest Service, $927 million for Energy Department programs and $1.3 billion for such smaller agencies as the Smithsonian Institution. The total that would be appropriated is $809.6 million above President Reagan's budget request but $48.7 million below a budget ceiling approved by Congress earlier this year.

1183-> AROUND THE WORLD; Dispute on Chad Blocks Opening of Africa Parley
A conference of the Organization of African Unity failed to open on schedule today because of a deadlock over Libyan objections to seating a delegation from the new pro-Western Government of Chad. The white seaside conference hall was deserted as the scheduled opening time slipped by, with African leaders locked in informal meetings in the Grand Hotel here, the headquarters for most of the delegations. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, met with three of Africa's most important leaders, President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, President Shehu Shagari of Nigeria and President Julius K. Nyerere of Tanzania, African diplomatic sources said. The meetings failed to produce a compromise that could allow the conference to open on time, and there was no official word from the O.A.U. as to when, or if, the formal meeting would take place. The dispute is over which Chadian faction constitutes the landlocked nation's legitimate government.

1184-> Boros to Be A's Manager
Steve Boros, a former major league infielder, will be named manager of the Oakland A's today, replacing Billy Martin, who was dismissed four weeks ago after three years with the team. A source close to the A's said yesterday that Boros, who has been a coach with the Montreal Expos for the last two seasons, was selected over Jim Leyland, a Chicago White Sox coach, and Ray Miller, Baltimore's pitching coach. Boros's appointment leaves only the Yankees without an announced manager for 1983. Martin is a strong candidate to replace Clyde King, who completed last season as manager and has not been told if he will continue. At a news conference yesterday, the A's announced the signing of Tom Burgmeier, a free-agent relief pitcher who is 39 years old and has been in the major leagues for 15 years. According to a source familiar with the signing, Burgmeier, a left-hander, was signed for two years at about $400,000 a year. He was 7-0 with two saves for Boston last season. Boros, 46 years old, was primarily a third baseman during his career with Detroit, the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati, finishing with a .245 batting average. In the last 13 years, he has managed in the minor leagues for six seasons and coached in the majors for seven, five with Kansas City and the last two with Montreal.

1185-> LEBANESE LEADER GETS NEW POWERS
The Lebanese Parliament gave the administration of President Amin Gemayel the power today to rule the nation by decree for six months. The Parliament also gave a vote of confidence to the administration and its 10-member Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Chafik al-Wazzan. The approval of the special powers and the vote of confidence were linked in a single proposition. But many of the 91 legislators seemingly expressed their dissent by abstaining or being absent. The vote was 58-1, but the approval came only after the Government agreed to compromises that gave it slightly less power than it asked for last week. The approval was Mr. Gemayel's most significant victory in domestic politics since he became President on Sept. 23. The victory came as Lebanon was preparing, probably later this week, to meet with Israel to negotiate the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon. The negotiations are expected to be difficult and perhaps take months, but under the powers granted him today, President Gemayel has authority to deal as he wants with Israel, as well as with Lebanon's other two occupiers, the Syrian Army and the guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who control much of the north and east of the country. Strengthening of Army The vote of confidence meant that Parliament approved of the administration's general policies: to effect the withdrawal of the occupying military forces, to strengthen the Lebanese Army and to start reconstruction of the nation after years of strife. Among the most significant of the special powers granted today was that over the army. After years of weakness and ineptitude, the regular army has gradually been taking control of Beirut. It has largely disarmed the leftist and Moslem militias in West Beirut, but in East Beirut and other areas around the capital the Christian Phalangists are still strong. In the mountains southeast of the capital there has been sporadic fighting for several weeks between the Moslem Druse and the Christian militias. Mr. Gemayel, a leader of the Phalangists before his election as President, has said he intends to disarm all the militias, including the Phalangists, who were fiercely loyal to his younger brother, Bashir, who was assassinated on Sept. 14 after being elected president. While the administration has not disclosed its plans for the army, it now has the legal authority to restructure its command, possibly giving more Moslems higher posts in an officer corps traditionally dominated by Maronite Christians. The administration is also free to revise the tax structure, under which salaried workers pay set amounts, but businessmen, entrepreneurs and professionals, such as doctors and lawyers, pay little, if anything. 'Internal Security' The administration is also free to take whatever measures it wants for ''internal security,'' which could lead to a curtailment of civil liberties. The special powers also include authority to change criminal law and make sentences stricter. The powers also authorize the Government to broaden free public education and to make loans and reschedule Government debts. Power to control information could lead to censorship, but no such plans have been disclosed. The compromise the administration made with the Parliament was twofold: First, the special powers were given for six months, instead of eight, as had been requested. Second, the administration agreed not to insist on power to change election laws without the consent of Parliament. These two points were critical to the deputies. Allowing the Government to change the election law for eight months would have meant until June 30, the date the present Parliament's term ends. Before that date, the administration could have revised the law in a way that would leave many present deputies without a seat. Although he has not been specific, Mr. Gemayel is known to seek a greater political reconciliation with the nation's Moslem leaders. One way would be to establish at-large elections, or proportional representation, which would almost certainly give Moslems more legislative power at the expense of Christians.

1187-> G.O.P. HOUSE CANDIDATES LEADING IN FUND RAISING
Despite the bad political news of the recession and discouraging national polls, Republican candidates for the House of Representatives have improved their prospects in Tuesday's elections with a surge of contributions that has overtaken the total raised by their Democratic rivals. As unemployment went up, so did Republican receipts. A computer analysis by The New York Times of 802 reports filed by House candidates with the Federal Election Commission this month showed that in the first nine months of this year 381 Republicans raised $50,069,314. In the same period 421 Democrats raised $48,498,903. The new totals represented a change from an earlier tally. That analysis, covering 1982 receipts through June 30, showed the Democrats, who still control the House numerically, ahead in fundraising by $1,508,609. G.O.P. Advantage in Close Races The new study of House races, which cover the entire nation while Senate elections this year occur in only 33 states, showed that the Republican advantage was biggest in districts with apparently close contests. In the three months ended Sept. 30, Republicans got the most money where it was likely to matter most. In 63 such marginal districts thetypical Republican outraised his Democratic opponent by $56,000. Richard N. Bond, deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee, said he believed the money had come in, despite national polls suggesting major losses for the party in the House, because the candidates raised most of their money from ''local contributors responding to local realities.'' The party had recruited candidates of quality, he added, who often looked as though they could win despite high unemployment in their districts. Administration's Success Cited Nancy Sinnott, executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said she believed Republican contributors had responded to the Reagan Administration's success in reducing taxes and inflation. As she noted, her party's candidates raised less from political action committees than Democrats did. This year such committees have given $15,662,442 to Democratic candidates for House seats. Republicans have received $12,907,996. William Sweeney, deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said Republicans had worked hard for many years at building a financial base and teaching fund-raising techniques. He said their success was ''really, really troubling'' and guaranteed the Republicans an edge in some House races that the Democrats might otherwise capture by 2 to 4 percent of the vote. 63 Marginal Districts Studied The typical Republican incumbent has raised $136,711 this year, $64,372 of it in the last three months. The typical Democratic Representative has raised $110,532 this year, $46,789 of it in the July-September period. The Republican advantage was greater and grew faster in the 63 marginal districts studied. Identified by politicians in both parties as close, these districts include open seats in which no incumbent is on the ballot, contests with two incumbents opposing each other and contests involving tough challenges to incumbents of each party. In those districts the median Republican, or the Republican whose totals fell in the middle of his party ranking, had raised $198,763. Of that sum, $110,536 was contributed in the last three months. The median Democrat had raised $142,511, $82,659 of it in July, August and September. The advantage was widespread. In 55 of the 63 districts, one party's candidate had raised at least $20,000 more than the other party's. Forty-one of those with an edge of that amount were Republicans, and 14 were Democrats. Panels' Spending Compared The Republican financial lead in marginal districts, which are the key to the party's hopes of maintaining President Reagan's slim working coalition in the House, gained armor plating from the comparative resources of the two national Congressional campaign committees. The National Republican Congressional Committee reported Oct. 13 that it had paid $3,237,994 in bills for its candidates. That is 96 times as much as the $33,658 reported by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The Democratic total for all candidates who were helped is less than the single-district limit of $36,880 that the Federal campaign law permits a committee to spend in ''coordinated expenditures'' for any one candidate in most states. (In states with a single Congressman, such as South Dakota or Delaware, the limit is $73,760.) Martin Franks, executive director of the Democrats' committee, declined to say how much more had been spent since Oct. 13 on the ground that the information would provide ''tactical'' aid to Republicans. Joe Gaylord, campaign director of the Republican group, said it had paid $3,701,606 worth of bills for 155 candidates. The Republicans have paid about the legal limit of bills in at least the 63 closely contested districts. In such districts the $36,880 from the party committee, plus the money raised by the candidates, produces a Republican advantage of about $93,000 in a typical marginal district. Record Campaign Fund Likely To reach their total, the Republicans added $26,043,762 raised in the July-September period to the $24,025,552 raised earlier this year. Democrats raised $22,964,742 in the last three months to go with the $25,534,161 raised before. In the 1979-80 election cycle, the 833 House candidates in the general election raised a total of $123,507,332. The $98,588,305 total of the two parties so far this year seems certain to lead to a record when the commission compiles a total reflecting the money raised in the last three months of 1982 and in 1981. In five House races the candidates in the general election have raised a total of more than $1 million, although in some instances much of the money was spent in a primary. In Tennessee's Fourth District, Cissy Baker, the Republican, raised $711,794, and Jim Cooper, the Democrat, $591,811, for a total of $1,303,605. It is a new district. In New Jersey's Seventh District, Adam Levin, the Democrat challenging Representative Matthew J. Rinaldo, raised $986,643, more than any other candidate this year. Mr. Rinaldo raised $236,273, for a total of $1,222,916. Three-MAn Race in California In California's 43d District, another new district, the Republican nominee, John Crean, raised $955,100. Like Mr. Levin, he used mainly his own money. The Democratic nominee, Roy Archer, has raised only $14,779. But Ron Packard, another Republican who was narrowly defeated by Mr. Crean in the primary and is now waging a write-in campaign, has raised $249,142, for a district total of $1,219,021. In Massachusetts's Fourth District, two incumbents have been thrown together by redistricting. Representative Barney Frank, the Democrat, has raised $827,647 this year. Representative Margaret M. Heckler, the Republican, has raised $385,424, for a total of $1,213,571. In Illinois's 20th District, Representative Paul Findley, a Republican, has raised $582,793 this year. His Democratic challenger, Richard Durbin, has raised $417,635, for a total of $1,000,428. For only four of those candidates did political action committee contributions make a significant difference. The committees provided 28 percent of Mr. Rinaldo's and Mr. Durbin's financing, 27 percent of Mrs. Heckler's and 23 percent of Mr. Findley's. PAC Money for Incumbents Such committees, however, provided 32 percent of all money raised by Democratic House candidates this year and 26 percent of the Republicans' total. Money from political action committees went heavily to incumbents. The median Democratic incumbent raised $45,399, or 41 percent of his total, from such committees. The median Republican raised $47,553, or 35 percent of his total, from the committees. Seventy percent of the money from political action committees this year has gone to incumbents, some of whom face serious challenges or had opponents in primary elections. Representative John H. Rousselot, Republican of California, led with $254,579, followed by Representatives Phillip Burton, Democrat of California, at $205,600; Bill Chappell, Democrat of Florida, at $189,775; Phil Gramm, Democrat of Texas, at $184,969, and Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House minority leader, at $182,208. Democrats Even in Cash on Hand The only nonincumbent in the top 20 recipients of money from political action committees money was Milton Marks, Mr. Burton's Republican opponent, at $138,435. He was in 10th place. The analysis indicated that Democratic incumbents were even with Republicans in one important campaign money category, cash on hand. The median Democrat had $48,853 to $48,362 for the median Republican. In the 63 close districts, the median Republican had $25,695, compared to $16,139 for the typical Democrat. Because there are more Democratic than Republican incumbents, the total cash on hand for all Democratic candidates was $17,241,933 to $14,082,844 for all Republicans. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, led that list with $623,571, followed by Representatives Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, with $409,973; Tom Loeffler, Republican of Texas, with $405,526, and Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, at $384,349.

1188-> OTB Deserves to Expand
To the Editor: Your Nov. 1 editorial ''Offtrack Betting Over Its Head'' does not address the essential point of the Comptroller's recent review of New York City's Off-Track Betting Corporation. The Comptroller has warned that OTB, which in 12 years has distributed $1.1 billion to government and the racing industry, faces a crisis caused by a combination of static handle, projected city-negotiated labor increases and the rising financial needs of New York's racing industry. OTB was originally intended to generate revenue for the city. When the corporation accepted its first bets in 1971, state law provided only 1 percent of offtrack wagers for racing. Over the years the Legislature has increased racing's share by 500 percent, to 5.7 percent, or about $51 million annually, today. The city's offtrack betting revenue has been correspondingly reduced. Over this same period OTB's handle has increased dramatically. Rigorous management and effective cost con-trols have enabled OTB to accommodate this increase in wagering without increasing the number of its employees, which declined from 2,347 handling $588 million in 1973 to 2,230 handling $883 million in 1982. This increase in operating efficiency has preserved OTB's profitability in the face of city-negotiated labor contracts that have increased OTB's personnel expenses from $28.4 million, or 4.8 percent of handle, in 1973 to $58.3 million, or 6.6 percent of handle, in 1982. Even with this 105 percent increase in labor costs, OTB remains highly profitable: in 1982 the corporation ''covered its overhead'' with more than $127 million to spare, which it distributed, by state law, as follows: $51 million to racing and $77 million to various governments, including $50 million to New York City. The crux of the problem confronting OTB is that streamlining the branch office network and other reductions in operating costs being implemented by management is only a partial answer. The rest of the answer is increased OTB wagering. The proven means to accomplish this is live televised racing (''simulcasting''), which in a 12-month experiment in two Staten Island offices has increased wagering on harness racing by 200 percent. Simulcasting has tremendous potential and profound implications not only for OTB but for the future of horse racing. If OTB, which has generated more than $826 million for government and $371 million for racing and is more important to city, state, racetracks and horsemen than ever before, is to continue to generate essential government and racing industry revenues, simulcasting must be expanded. In the long run there is no real alternative if New York's substantial parimutuel revenues are to be preserved. At this critical juncture OTB deserves the public and the governmental support that it has earned. HENRY T. MCCABE, Chairman and President N.Y.C. Offtrack Betting Corporation, New York, Nov. 2, 1982

1190-> NEW ROLE FOR A BALLET VETERAN
The wine glasses may be empty at the party that opens George Balanchine's production of ''The Nutcracker.'' The fast-growing Christmas tree may be a matter of pulleys. But when Francisco Moncion steps out onto the stage of the New York State Theater this week in his new role of Drosselmeier, the ancient visitor whose gift of a nutcracker initiates adventures, he will be proof that the magic is not all of the stage. A very real family inhabits the stage at each performance. Mr. Moncion, its oldest performing member, has spent 36 of his 60 years with the City Ballet. The adult dancers who share the stage with him represent two more generations. And the children, some of them as young as 9, are students at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet where Mr. Moncion learned to dance as a child and still takes class. Although the role of Drosselmeier involves mime and naturalistic movement rather than dancing, Mr. Moncion's longevity on the stage is unusual, and balletgoers over the last few decades can remember him as a striking interpreter of a large number of ballets. A dancer of intense dramatic presence, Mr. Moncion was the first Dark Angel of Mr. Balanchine's ''Orpheus,'' the boy in Jerome Robbins's ''Afternoon of a Faun'' and the death-figure in Mr. Balanchine's ''La Valse,'' which he continues to perform. He created roles in ballets that range from ''The Four Temperaments,'' choreographed in 1946 by Mr. Balanchine, to Mr. Robbins's ''In the Night,'' created in 1970. He speaks of it all with quiet authority, looking back today over years that were filled with hard work, considerable pain and ''tremendous love'' for Mr. Balanchine, founder of City Ballet with Lincoln Kirstein. A native of the Dominican Republic, Mr. Moncion started his ballet studies at 15 at the School of American Ballet, a few years after it had opened at Madison Avenue and 59th Street. ''I just grew up in the streets,'' he recalled. One day he found a magazine article about Mr. Balanchine's choreography for the film, ''Goldwyn Follies.'' The school was mentioned, and the brochure he sent away for had enticing designs by Tchelitchew. ''I've often marveled at how I came to ballet school at all. I guess it was just a hunger, a grappling for something different.'' He'd had a taste of ballet, watching dancers stretch and flex in the hallways of the YMCA on West 63d Street, where he went for children's sports. Able to stand on point in his sneakers and imitate such difficult steps as cabrioles and entrechats six, he had to argue his way out of the front line at his first ballet class. ''At that time male dancers were a scarce item,'' Mr. Moncion said. In 1942, he made his stage debut with the New Opera Company, a group devoted to presenting music and ballet, then moved on to the Marquis de Cuevas's Ballet International, most notably portraying the title role in Leonide Massine's ''Mad Tristan.'' This Tristan was an androgynous schizophrenic. ''Most of the ballets in that repertory had a great deal of theater in them,'' he said. ''My technique was not as advanced as it could have been, but I could move and I had a talent for partnering. That's the all-important thing. You learn a great deal as you go along.'' In 1946 Mr. Moncion found himself in Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. The company was much smaller then. Everyone danced everything, and danced it often, with a sense of the weight and value of the gesture that Mr. Moncion worries is being lost today. ''One doesn't do these things mechanically,'' he said. ''They have to happen.'' He reaches out from his chair, his arm curving into the gesture of tying a rope, and suddenly his warm and comfortable apartment with its sweeping view of northern Central Park becomes a fetid, brooding underworld and he the Dark Angel, enthralling an absent Orpheus. Mr. Moncion was a noted interpreter of the title role of Mr. Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son,'' which he loved for its emotional qualities. ''Apart from the pleasure and seductiveness of that role as a role, the basic premise of the ballet was important to me,'' he said. ''The idea of tearing away from home and the abject return, with the father's final gesture. That must be underplayed, but it works so well as a crushing moment and the crux of the ballet.'' He paused. ''I was brought up by my mother, and I think basically I had a longing for family life. A father figure like that.'' He and Tanaquil LeClerq brought to ''Afternoon of a Faun'' an emotional undercurrent very different from the usual interpretation today of two innocent ballet students who fleetingly entice each other. ''Jerry (Robbins) had given me the Mallarme poem to read and think about, which I did. The ballet evolved very easily. He had ideas, and they were very clearly imprinted. Tanny and I developed a kind of ardor, a heat that just expressed itself very gently,'' Mr. Moncion said. ''We were like a pot boiling with the lid on. Not going 'puh, puh' but just exuding heat. That was one of Tanny's favorite roles. She'd purr like a kitten when we came off.'' Mr. Moncion has partnered some of City Ballet's most famous ballerinas in his time. He smiled as he recalled dancing with Melissa Hayden in William Dollar's ''The Duel.'' ''She gave so much in performance that you just couldn't help enjoying yourself,'' he said. ''And that ballet was so physically demanding. By the end, after she'd slipped lower and lower from her horse, her body one long series of circles in the air, our lungs were exploding. But it was cathartic. ''And 'The Firebird.' Sol Hurok had acquired the old Adolf Bolm production. City Ballet got the costumes and sets from him. They were almost tatters, but everything was in those days. Mr. Balanchine just worked and worked. Then Maria Tallchief exploded as the firebird and we had a hit. ''You get the quality of that performance from the photographs by George Platt Lynes. The partnering in the pas de deux, with the bird trying to escape the prince and being caught, was off center but not rough. It took concentration. But we knew each other. I knew where her body would be. We hardly had to rehearse. 'Hold me here and we'll do just a spin,' Maria would say before the performance. 'See you when we get out there.' It's a trust you develop.'' Mr. Moncion can look back on some strange choreographic adventures. He'd danced, for instance, in Mr. Balanchine's ''Opus 34,'' created in 1954, the same year as ''The Nutcracker.'' ''It had two sections, set to the same music,'' he said. ''He patterned the first part after the German Expressionist films of the 1930's. It was gruesome. Bloody bandages pulled here and there, metal surgical instruments being passed back and forth, bodies shooting off stretchers and two figures being engulfed and erupted by a black tarpaulin, a little like 'Noah and the Flood.' '' The dancers wore body stockings painted with bones and muscles, and at the end klieg lights were suddenly turned on audiences, drawing shrieks and shaken fists. He remembers the movement for the second section as being so strange that even today, he feels, its abstraction and irrational quality might surprise audiences. In one section, Mr. Balanchine told the dancers to do anything they wanted for 16 measures. ''Some of the girls did fouettes. This and that. Out of chaotic ordered movement came real chaos.'' This surely uncharacteristic Balanchine ballet quickly left the repertory. Mr. Moncion also remembers ''Divertimento,'' a 1947 ballet set to music by Alexei Haieff. ''It was Mr. Balanchine at his most tenderly romantic and whimsical,'' Mr. Moncion said. ''There were four couples and, at first, a man who mimics them. They leave, and as if she is late to a party, a girl arrives. There is a lovely pas de deux, with yearning hands, and a solo, called the 'berceuse' for the girl that was very slow and controlled, with a charming, unruffled quality.'' He has staged ''Divertimento'' in a shorter version since he performed it with Mary Ellen Moylan at the premiere. ''It should be in any little company's repertory. It shouldn't be lost.'' He would like to set the ballet, and his own ''Pastorale,'' a ballet for a blind boy, a girl and her lover that he choreographed in 1957, for the annual workshop performances of the School of American Ballet. ''I think it is the kind of thing students should have the opportunity to dance,'' he said. ''So much of what they do in those workshops is technique-oriented. Technique is important. but a little drama should be injected to give them the human side of performing.'' With all this behind him, Mr. Moncion was surprisingly hesitant about taking on the role of Drosselmeier in ''The Nutcracker.'' He'd danced the Coffee solo at the premiere, smoking a hookah and drinking a cup of coffee provided by four tiny parrot-costumed children from the school, then falling asleep. The solo has been rechoreographed and is now danced by a sensuous woman. ''When we moved into the big State Theater, it was felt there ought to be something for the daddies in the audience.'' Mr. Moncion had long been asking to do Drosselmeier, but when he watched the part from out front recently, faced with the prospect of performing it, he was appalled. ''This is terribly complicated,'' he thought. ''I'll never make it.'' Shaun O'Brien's portrayal seemed ''incredibly compact and detailed,'' and Andre Kramarevsky, who shares the role with Mr. Moncion and Mr. O'Brien, was ''flamboyant, extroverted, very Russian.'' ''I guess I look strong and fierce on stage, right off the bat,'' Mr. Moncion continued. ''So I've made Drosselmeier very tactile, very human. I pick the kids up and touch them. I use my hands in the way of a magician. A prestidigitator doing his tricks.'' He has added some mime that gives a foretaste of the transformations to come. Mr. Moncion, who is also a visual artist, picks up a collage as he talks. Fashioned from crumbling, soft-colored bits of paper he'd found behind an Oriental screen, it suggests a landscape of paths, mountains and water. ''A sense of the anecdotal, of reality,'' he said. ''That's what I try for in performance. A sense of place.''

1192-> Metaphysics
To the Editor: In Harold Bloom's review of Dan Jacobson's ''The Story of the Stories: The Chosen People and Its God'' (Oct. 17), he compares Mr. Jacobson's attempt ''to examine the relation between 'The Chosen People and Its God' '' to Thomas Mann's ''achievement in 'Joseph and His Brothers.' '' Admitting that this is ''rather unfair,'' Mr. Bloom explains: ''I am contrasting the two writers not as novelists but as moralists working out their own psychological analyses of biblical beliefs and actions. Mann's pervasive irony acknowledges our vast distance from the psychic universe of biblical writers. Mr. Jacobson does not wish to know that distance, and his emotional zeal makes him at moments almost a contemporary of the ancient stories. ... That zeal ... makes him anachronistic in his central interpretations.'' Thomas Mann depended heavily on the Jewish metaphysical philosopher Oskar Goldberg. Although Goldberg is little known today, his views on the significance of the Pentateuch caused quite a stir in Berlin between the two wars. His most important and controversial book was ''Die Wirklichkeit der Hebraer'' (''The Reality of the Hebrews''). Among those enraged by Goldberg's ''mystical rationalism'' was Gershom Scholem who maintained until his death such an antipathy for this man that he included a series of deprecating anecdotes about Goldberg and his ''sect'' in ''From Berlin to Jerusalem'' and, more importantly, ''Walter Benjamin: The Story of a Friendship.'' Let me quote from the latter, which speaks directly of Thomas Mann's reliance on Oskar Goldberg: ''After 'Die Wirklichkeit der Hebraer' had appeared (1925), I wrote a long, critical letter about the book; (Walter) Benjamin and Leo Strauss disseminated copies of it in Berlin, and it won me no friends among Goldberg's adherents. That others were impressed, indeed entranced, by the imaginative verve of Goldberg's interpretations of the Torah ... is evidenced not only by the writings of the paleontologist Edgar Dacque but above all by Thomas Mann; the first novel of the latter's Joseph tetralogy, 'The Tales of Jacob,' is in its metaphysical sections based entirely on Goldberg's book.'' Actually we know that Mann studied intensively under Goldberg while preparing the four novels and used more than Goldberg's published words in his own writings. After directing his ''pervasive irony'' against Oskar Goldberg's philosophy, Thomas Mann turned it on Goldberg, the man. As Scholem tells it, ''(In 'Dr. Faustus') Goldberg appears as the scholar Dr. Chaim Breisacher, a kind of metaphysical super-Nazi who presents his magical racial theory largely in Goldberg's own words.'' According to a disciple of the philosopher, even though the Breisacher portrait was indeed very funny and accurate, Goldberg was not amused. If Dan Jacobson, then, has given us ''his own (my italics) highly individual understanding of the Bible,'' Thomas Mann most certainly has not. He has, however, provided us with a literary rendition of the philosophy of Oskar Goldberg - not to mention a nasty sketch of the man - whose major works have never been translated and have virtually been forgotten even in the original German.

1193-> THE NATION; Spending Cuts At Street Level
For many cities the ''new federalism'' looks a lot like the old short shrift. A study released last week by the United States Conference of Mayors found that the consolidation of Federal aid into block grants had shrunk funds available for human services programs while the need for them expanded. The mayors' study, based on a survey of officials in 55 cities, said consolidation resulted in cuts as deep as 56 percent in employment and training programs and 42 percent in health services. When 56 Federal aid programs were lumped into nine state-administered block grants last year, most of them were also cut by 20 percent to 25 percent. Surveyed officials also said they were ''not fairly represented'' in the process by which the reduced funds were distributed. The study said cities were increasingly unable to meet the needs of an emerging group of ''the new poor'' - ''people who are losing their jobs, exhausting their financial resources, exhausting their unemployment benefits and losing their homes.'' In more than half of the cities, municipal revenues were being used to shore up federally funded programs. Even so, the study said, ''in not one of the human service areas examined was even 50 percent of the eligible population being served.'' In short, said William T. Donahue, president of the Conference of City Human Services Officials, ''people are homeless and hungry.'' A White House spokesman who had not seen the study said the President's economic policies were ''beginning to work'' and would alleviate many of the problems local officials cited. According to a survey by Congress's Joint Economic Committee, alleviation would come none too soon. More and more, the survey found, cities are hiking the property tax to help meet an income loss from all sources of an average 6 percent this year, despite a property tax revenue increase of 13.4 percent since 1980.

1195-> FLORIDA BABY SITTER PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDERING THREE IN HER CARE
Christine Falling pleaded guilty today to charges of murdering three children in her care and was sentenced to life in prison. She will be eligibile for parole in 25 years. Had the 19-year-old defendant gone to trial and been found guilty, she could have been sentenced to death in the electric chair. Miss Falling, who dropped out of junior high school, was given three concurrent life sentences for strangling and/ or suffocating 2-year-old Cassidy Marie Johnson of Blountstown in February 1980, 8-month-old Jennifer Yvonne Daniels of Perry in July 1981 and 2-month-old Travis Coleman of Blountstown in July 1982. In exchange for the guilty pleas, the state agreed not to prosecute Miss Falling in the deaths in 1981 of two Lakeland boys she had been hired to look after or in the death in January of this year of an elderly Perry man. 'Offer We Could Not Refuse' ''The bottom line is, the state made us an offer that we could not refuse,'' said Baya Harrison 3d, one of Miss Falling's lawyers. ''Christine was facing six potential death sentences.'' In the farming community of Blountstown this morning, Miss Falling pleaded guilty to two murder counts. She was then driven about 100 miles southeast to Perry, another rural Florida county seat, where she pleaded guilty to the third count. Miss Falling earlier pleaded not guilty to all three charges. Miss Falling declined comment today on the change in her plea. But prosecutors played the woman's confession, taped July 20 at a Tallahassee psychiatric unit. An officer asked her what happened to Johnson baby. This was her reply: ''Well, it was about, I'd say about 8:30. She got kind of rowdy or something. Anyway, I choked her until she quit breathing and she had turned purple. ''Her heart had stopped beating and her pulse had stopped and she wasn't breathing. So I tried to get her back to breathing and I couldn't. So then I went and called the sheriff department and they come out there and then they called the ambulance to come out there and they took her to the hospital and they transferred her to Tallahassee''' The Johnson baby died three days later in a Tallahassee hospital. Doctors thought she had encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Three weeks before Miss Falling's arrest, Travis Coleman was found dead in the trailer Miss Falling shared with her boyfriend, Robert Johnson. The infant had become the fifth child in two and a half years to die in Miss Falling's care. His death brought a new round of publicity about Miss Falling and renewed speculation about a link to the first four deaths, which had been attributed to natural causes. Miss Falling had told reporters she was the confused victim of a grim coincidence. On July 13, she voluntarily entered the psychiatric unit in Tallahassee after a psychiatrist said that she was suicidal. She was released a week later, placed under arrest and held without bond.

1196-> HOUSE RACES TEST REAGAN AND ECONOMY
PRESIDENT Reagan, the state of the economy, conservatism, Joseph M. Margiotta - and the advantages of incumbency - will be tested in five Congressional races on Long Island 10 days from now. Four Republican incumbents and a lone Democrat, Representative Thomas J. Downey, are seeking re-election to a shrunken Long Island delegation to the House of Representatives. Another incumbent, Representative Gregory W. Carman, is not seeking re-election because his district was eliminated in the reduction of the Island districts from six to five in the decennial reapportionment. The reduction is part of a statewide drop of five House members because New York's population remained stable in the last 10 years while other parts of the country had population booms. The Island has a small slice of another district - the Eighth District, which extends from northern Queens into Great Neck. Representative James H. Scheuer, a Democrat whose district was moved from southern Queens and southeastern Brooklyn in the reapportionment, does not even have a Republican opponent and is virtually assured of re-election. The differences on national policy and the ideological confrontations are pointed up by Congressional Quarterly's ''rating'' of House members. Representative William F. Carney in the First District is actually an enrolled Conservative - the only one in the House - with Republican endorsement, but he is no more conservative than his Island Republican colleagues. All have records of supporting the socalled conservative coalition in at least 75 percent of the ''bellwether'' votes in the House in 1981 and a similar record in supporting the Republican Party line in the House. Mr. Downey has even a higher party-loyalty record than his Island colleagues - 84 percent - and he voted against the conservative coalition in 81 percent of the key votes in 1981. This ideological gap among incumbents carries over into most of the Island's races, where there are clear liberal versus conservative differences. The Democratic candidates tend to mute the ideological differences because of the strong Republican enrollment margins they confront. At the same time, some Republican incumbents are more likely to emphasize their constituent services rather than do battle on such issues as the economy, which polls indicate is cutting against Republicans. The economy is one of only several issues in the most hotly contested election on the Island, one that has drawn national attention, in which Representative John LeBoutillier, a Republican, opposes Suffolk County Legislator Robert Mrazek, a Democrat. The districts of Mr. LeBoutillier and Mr. Carman were combined and shifted eastward into Suffolk so that the new district extends across the top of the Island from Glen Cove to Smithtown. The wealthy Mr. LeBoutillier, an heir to the Whitney and Vanderbilt fortunes, spent $500,000 to upset a longtime Democratic incumbent, Lester L. Wolff, two years ago. Although only 27 years old at the time, Mr. LeBoutillier had somewhat of a national reputation as a conservative activist. That reputation has been enhanced by his outspokenness, including personal attacks on such leading Democrats as Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. of the House as well as such fellow Republicans as Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois. Mr. LeBoutillier has heavily emphasized the crime issue in his campaign, including a proposal for a ''polar prison'' in Alaska, although crime is not generally an issue in House races. Mr. LeBoutillier is relying on an extensive television advertising campaign that will cost at least $225,000, according to Chris Braunlich, Mr. LeBoutillier's Congressional assistant. That is just under the $227,800 that Mr. LeBoutillier poured into his campaign two years ago after the final pre-election campaign financial report for a last-minute television blitz that took Mr. Wolff by surprise. Mr. Mrazek made an issue of that money, even questioning its legality. Mr. LeBoutillier has said the money came from his father's estate, but it is not listed on his personal financial disclosure statement. Such an expenditure would be legal only if it is by the candidate himself. Otherwise, there is a $1,000 limit on election campaign contributions. The Federal Election Commission is investigating the expenditure. Like other Democrats, Mr. Mrazek is making an issue of the economy as well as Mr. LeBoutillier's reputation as a maverick. Mr. Mrazek is also emphasizing his own record on the Southwest Sewer District scandal in Suffolk, the environment and other issues in the Suffolk County Legislature. Mr. Mrazek - tall and lean like Mr. LeBoutillier - was also a political lone wolf when he was first elected to the Legislature in 1975. His tweedy sweaters at legislative meetings gave way to suits as he joined the County Legislature's establishment as minority leader. The Mrazek-LeBoutillier election is a clear-cut liberal versus conservative confrontation, as are three other Island Congressional races. The Democratic candidates in the First, Fourth and Fifth Districts also have in common relatively recent connections to the districts they are running in. A candidate does not have to be a resident of his House district, although that does not stop opponents from raising the carpetbagger issue. In the First District, Ethan C. Eldon, a former New York City commissioner of air pollution control, is a newcomer to the district. Challenging the two-term incumbent, Representative Carney, he is making an issue of what he says are Mr. Carney's votes for ''pork barrel'' Federal projects in other states and his votes against Federal education programs, among others. Mr. Eldon is also emphasizing his own environmental background and says he is counting on a strong run by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic Senator, to keep voters on the Democratic line for the next position on the ballot, the House of Representatives. On paper, the 40-year-old Mr. Carney is stronger than he was in his two previous elections. He had overcome Republican opponents in G.O.P. primaries in 1978 and 1980 but had no opposition in the primaries this year. In addition, his district, having moved eastward, is more Republican than it was. In the last two years, Mr. Carney emerged as one of the leading spokesmen for the Reagan Administration's position on a nuclear freeze and has also been outspoken on a politically delicate subject, the fiscal problems of the Social Security system. In the Fourth District, the Democratic candidate, Robert Zimmerman, had hoped to run against Mr. LeBoutillier but was persuaded to step aside for Mr. Mrazek and challenge Representative Norman F. Lent, the dean of the Long Island delegation in the House. Mr. Lent, 51, is seeking his seventh term. Mr. Zimmerman, 28, who was an aide to Mr. Wolff, is basing his campaign on the economy and the assertion that Mr. Lent has been a lackluster Congressman with few solid achievements. He also identifies his opponent with Mr. Margiotta and his legal problems. Mr. Zimmerman is hopeful that he can win in the 40 percent of the district in southeastern Nassau that was not part of Mr. Lent's old district but is now. Mr. Lent, in turn, makes a point of Mr. Zimmerman's Great Neck residence, outside the district, and his lack of governmental experience. The incumbent, unlike most others, often meets with his own opponent at forums and debates around the district. Next door, in the Fifth District, Arnold Miller is concentrating on Mr. Margiotta to the point of even asking voters, as a conversation opener, whether they think Mr. Margiotta should step aside. ''I'm calling it a referendum on Margiotta,'' said Mr. Miller, 41, a former Carter Administration press official as well as a liberal antiwar activist like Mr. Lowenstein. Mr. Miller plays down the Lowenstein connection now, saying that the two had ''much different styles.'' Mr. Miller added that he did not view the election as a liberal-conservative confrontation. But the Republican incumbent, Representative Raymond J. McGrath, seeking his second term, does, and he emphasizes the Miller connection with Mr. Lowenstein and other liberal Democrats. Mr. McGrath also points out that Mr. Miller, although raised in the district and a former local representative for Mr. Lowenstein, has spent much of the past decade working outside the district. Mr. McGrath, who won his first term against a well-known and wellfinanced liberal Democrat, Karen Burstein, two years ago, is campaigning on crutches as a result of a foot infection. While emphasizing his constituent services and what he sees as his reflection of the district's ideology, Mr. McGrath is somewhat concerned about the Margiotta issue. ''I don't see people not voting for me because of a party relationship I may have'' -hardly a ringing endorsement of his political mentor. In the final Island contest, the political shoe is on the other foot as the Democratic incumbent, Mr. Downey, runs a well-financed committee that seems intended to run up as large a plurality as possible - fodder for a possible future candidacy for the United States Senate in 1986 or later. At age 33, Mr. Downey, seeking his fifth term, has time. A liberal Democrat, he has consistently won election in a constituency that is substantially to his right. One of his G.O.P. opponents in the past was County Executive Peter F. Cohalan, then the Islip supervisor. His Republican opponent this year, Paul Costello, 34, makes a point of the ideological gap between Representatives while acknowledging that Mr. Downey's staff serves constituents well. The Downey staff also may be responsible for prodding the Federal Merit System Protection Board into charging that Mr. Costello was violating the Hatch Act, which bars political activities by Federal employees. As a result, Mr. Costello had to step aside temporarily as Suffolk County Welfare Inspector General because of his monitoring of Federal welfare funds. Mr. Costello is expected to return to his post after the election

1198-> JURY IN DRUG CASE INDICTS DE LOREAN
John Z. De Lorean was indicted by a Federal grand jury today on charges of drug trafficking and racketeering. His lawyers posted $10 million bail soon afterward, and he walked out of the Federal prison here after spending 10 nights in jail. The indictment charged that Mr. De Lorean financed a multimilliondollar cocaine operation that was aborted last week when drug agents seized 60 pounds of cocaine worth $24 million. The indictment supersedes similar charges that were filed against the maverick automobile company executive on Oct. 19. William Morgan Hetrick and Stephen Arrington, who were also arrested in the case, were charged in the 11-count indictment as well. Named in Nine Counts Mr. De Lorean, who is 57 years old, is named in nine of the counts. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 72 years in prison and fines totaling $195,000. His bail was raised to $10 million from $5 million as a result of discussions between Federal prosecutors and his lawyers. Alexander Williams 3d, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said the higher bail was intended as additional insurance against Mr. De Lorean's fleeing. Mr. De Lorean, smiling and carrying a Bible in his hand, left the Terminal Island prison about 6 P.M. and got into a black Jaguar with his wife, Christina, a bodyguard and a second woman, believed to be his mother-in-law. Shortly afterward, their car was involved in an accident with at least one other vehicle on the Santa Monica freeway near downtown Los Angeles. The collision spun their car around in rush-hour traffic, but the occupants were apparently unharmed and were quickly picked up in a second car, driven by a friend, who took them to the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills. As collateral for the higher bail, Mr. De Lorean offered his ranch near San Diego, a cooperative apartment on Fifth Avenue in New York and an estate in Bedminster, N.J. In addition, he posted a cash bond of $250,000, the same amount required under the lower bail. The two principal charges against him are conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and possession of the drug with intent to distribute it. The other counts are lesser offenses, chiefly the use of telephones and an express delivery service to carry out a narcotics transaction and interstate travel in aid of racketeering. Mr. Hetrick was charged with the most serious offense, conduct of a continuing criminal enterprise. He has been called the cocaine supplier in the deal, and investigators maintain that he has been operating a major drug smuggling ring between points in the Caribbean, Florida and California. Charge Carries 10-Year Term The charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, with a possible life sentence and $100,000 fine. The United States Attorney, Stephen Trott, said neither he nor any of the Federal officials assembled for the announcement of the indictment would answer questions on ''the substance or the evidence'' of the case. He said the Government had seized or would seize property and assets belonging to Mr. Hetrick that were believed to have been acquired using profits from drug deals. The property includes four boats, five airplanes, seven bank accounts in California and Nevada, three motorcycles, a trailer and 11 cars and trucks. Mr. De Lorean was arrested Oct. 19 in Los Angeles, shortly after arriving here from New York. The Government says he meant to carry out a transaction to sell at least $100 million worth of cocaine. The indictment cited few substantive details of the Government's case, in contrast to last week's arraignment papers. It did not mention heroin distribution, despite a statement by Mr. Walsh at Mr. De Lorean's arraignment last week that heroin was to be distributed along with the cocaine. One new piece of information in the indictment was an assertion that Mr. De Lorean had turned over all the stock of the De Lorean Motor Company - not half of it, as the Government had maintained earlier - to an undercover agent on Sept. 29 as part of the transaction. Stock Certificates Sent The indictment said that Mr. De Lorean ''sent stock certificates representing 100 percent of the stock of De Lorean Motor Company Inc. to an undercover agent using the name James Benedict in San Carlos, Calif.'' ''Mr. Benedict'' was an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who posed as a crooked banker to ease the transfer of money among Mr. Hetrick, Mr. De Lorean and another undercover agent posing as a drug distributor who was to contribute $3.2 million to the transaction. Mr. Hetrick was charged with a total of six counts. Mr. Arrington, purportedly the deliveryman in the deal, was charged with three counts. Bail remained at $20 million for Mr. Hetrick and $250,000 for Mr. Arrington. Neither was expected to be released. Mr. Trott said a trial would be scheduled within 70 days. The defendants will be re-arraigned at a hearing Nov. 8. Officials of the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration, which jointly pursued the investigation, have theorized that Mr. De Lorean's motive for intitiating a drug scheme would have been quickly raising large sums to save his company, which he set up to produce a futuristic car after leaving the General Motors Corporation.

1199-> Cameron Crone To Be Married
Mr. and Mrs. Walter Seth Crone of Charleston, S.C., Buffalo, and Glenwood, N.Y., have announced the engagement of their daughter, Cameron Crone, to Brent Ross Bilger, son of Mrs. Richard Muth Bilger of Timonium, Md., and the late Mr. Bilger. A spring wedding is planned in Hanover, N.H. at Dartmouth College. Miss Crone, a graduate of the Elmwood Franklin School and the Nichols School, both in Buffalo, received a B.A. degree from Dartmouth College, and M.B.A. degree from The Citadel. She also received an M. Sc. degree from the London School of Economics, where she is studying for a Ph. D. degree. Her father is president of Buffalo Brake Beam Company, and the Buffalo Railroad Equipment Corporation in Charleston. Mr. Bilger, who is a project engineer in the advance technology group of the LTX Corporation in Westwood, Mass., producers of automatic test equipment for the semiconductor industry, was graduated from the McDonogh School in Baltimore, and received B.A. and B.E. degrees from Dartmouth. He also received a master's degree in electrical engineering from Cornell University. His father was a retired director of marketing in the cement division of the Martin Marietta Corporation in New York and later Baltimore.

1200-> AIDING THE FAMILIES OF THE MENTALLY ILL
''MY family has been understanding, but my friends can't deal with the fact that my daughter is mentally ill,'' said Linda C., whose 16-year-old daughter recently attempted suicide. ''I don't know if they can't face the situation or they can't face me. It's as if I don't exist anymore to them,'' Combating the stigma of mental illness, says Phyllis Vine, a professor in the graduate program in health advocacy at Sarah Lawrence College, is ''the first step to securing needed support and services for the families of the mentally disabled.'' Miss Vine, who teaches courses in family history and the history of health care, is the author of ''Families in Pain'' (Pantheon, $15), a book in which 17 families speak out about the problems of dealing with a mentally ill relative. It is estimated that 15 percent of the population in the United States suffers from some form of mental disorder and 10 percent of all families have an immediate member afflicted with mental illness. The author, who herself has a mentally ill relative, spent three years researching and writing the book. She said the silence surrounding mental illness comes from an ignorance about it and the public's hesitancy to ask questions. ''I wrote the book,'' she said, ''because, in trying to assist my relative, I realized there were so many things I didn't know. Where could I take her for treatment? How would she respond? What could I expect for her recovery? What would be my role in the future? I needed to find answers to the hard questions many psychiatrists and social workers were unwilling or unable to supply.'' Miss Vine said the reluctance of mental-health professionals to share information with families about diagnosis and treatment or to provide adequate explanations of the illness and its implications, kept families ''on the periphery of their relative's problems,'' put them at a disadvantage in planning for their relative's future and added to their sense of isolation. ''I would call doctors on the phone to ask 'What can I do?' or 'Can you tell me how long my relative's hospitalization will be?' '' she recalled, ''and I could only feel the frustration, resentment and aloofness other families experienced.'' Miss Vine said the ''alienating behavior'' of many mental-health professionals resulted from their tendency to stereotype the families of the mentally ill. This tendency, she emphasized, serves to ''discredit'' the families and ultimately makes their task of supporting the patient more difficult. ''Instead of being treated as the parents or spouse of somebody who has had a breakdown,'' she writes, ''family members are often treated according to preconceived notions about what they are supposed to feel, how they are supposed to act, and with what range of emotions they are likely to respond. This gets in the way of dealing with them as individuals or listening to what they say with objectivity.'' A continuing reliance by some psychiatrists and psychologists on unproved theories that attribute disturbances in behavior to the family has been a further disservice, she said. ''Blaming the family for the patient's illness has increased their sense of guilt and in some cases acted as a barrier to effective therapy for the patient once he returns to the family setting,'' she said. Miss Vine called the rapid growth of self-help groups, which try to check the negative impact of these theories, monitor professional behavior and pinpoint pitfalls in the provision of mental-health services, a ''positive response.'' Self-help groups have gained importance nationwide with the shift in the last two decades to community care for the mentally disabled, according to Dr. Kenneth Terkelsen, medical director of The Family Institute of Westchester in Mount Vernon. ''Eighty years ago,'' he said, ''only 15 percent of the people suffering from significant psychosis'' - schizophrenia or manicdepressive illness -''left the hospital; today, with the availability of antipsychotic drugs, no more than 10 percent remain in the hospital. Families who used to visit their severely disturbed relatives in an institution now must secure housing for them in the community or live with them at home. Many families are finding they can't do either alone.'' Miss Vine said membership in a self-help group could be a critical source of support for these families, who must learn to handle the ''prolonged dependence of a mentally ill relative'' and ''erratic disruptions'' in their life style. ''Hearing how others have coped, what mechanisms they have drawn upon, what responsibilities they have faced and who has helped them conquer particular problems allows families to place their own experience in a perspective that is comforting and useful,'' she writes in her book. But, the author conceded, providing solace soon becomes secondary to a family's desire for knowledge of the illness, strategies for dealing with crises and solutions to daily problems. Mimsey Geiger, president of the Advocacy League for the Mentally Ill of Westchester, one of 22 self-help groups for families of the mentally ill in the state, agreed. ''When our group began meeting two years ago,'' she said, ''just being able to admit we each had a mentally ill relative and share common concerns was a relief. But when we realized how little we knew about the mental-health system, we decided our first priority was to educate ourselves and the community about the nature of the illness, laws related to hospitalization, medication, community housing, employment and economic assistance for our relatives.'' The group, with 150 members, has spawned a network of smaller self-help groups that meet weekly or monthly in private homes and a psychiatric hospital. It has also begun to organize a political constituency to influence legislation and health-care policy on behalf of the mentally ill. The Alliance for Mental Health of Northern Westchester is another advocacy group. It includes patients, ex-patients and families of the mentally ill. Organized three years ago by Jean Bouricius of Katonah, its purpose is ''to improve conditions in the community for patients living there.'' She termed the supply of alternative housing for the mentally ill ''totally inadequate'' and non-existent for discharged patients who need permanent supervision. There are 28 supportive-living apartments and seven halfway houses for the mentally ill in Westchester. ''These residences provide 140 beds to a population estimated to need 800 beds,'' said Linda Smith, director of housing for the Department of Social Services and Community Mental Health. ''We are well aware that what is available now doesn't begin to meet the needs of existing patients and expatients.'' Her office is exploring new types of living environments for the mentally ill and alternative ways of financing them through a balance of public and private funds. Miss Vine said access to residential housing was an issue that concerned all mental-health professionals, because many families of the mentally ill now bear major responsibility for the relative's well-being. Calling the 17 families in her book who shared their stories ''courageous,'' she added: ''We're all hoping the experience of the family in coping with mental illness will be recognized. Mentalhealth professionals must begin to realize what it is like for families to have to systematically reorganize their life and their expectations for their relative and assist them with sensitivity in the process.'' Among the subjects discussed by families in her book are early symptoms of mental illness, difficulties in diagnosis, treatment procedures, psychiatric hospitals, day-hospital and out-patient programs, community residences and the organization of advocacy groups. An appendix includes a glossary of terms and lists statutes regarding emergency hospitalization, commonly used medications and community resources.

Box 1138, White Plains 10602; 948-1192 (evenings). It sponsors a workshop, ''Coping Skills for Families,'' conducted by Dr. Terkelsen, covering current research on mental illness, definition of disorders, physicians' diagnosis, the influence of treatments, the experience of the patient and the family at home and in the community, and genetic counseling.

1202-> A CLUTTER IN SPACE MIGHT STOP ICBM'S
To the Editor: American political leadership and the public as a whole have been alerted by the MX ''dense pack'' controversy to the possibility of countervailing blast forces that would abort the mission of simultaneously attacking ICBM's. here is, however, the possibility of establishing a vastly superior shield. Debris from previous space shots has already become something of a menace to flight in geo-centric space. A small piece of debris - considering the velocity at which it would be traveling its earth orbit - could smash into and debilitate an attacking ICBM. Computer simulations at our firm indicate that the launching of a great amount of debris would constitute a long-lasting clutter, effectively diminishing the penetration of ICBM's into the continental U.S. We have sufficient launching capacity for this purpose. With this passive shield, space-borne intercontinental attack can be considerably deterred, and first-strike tensions would be eased. LEONARD M. GREENE President Safe Flight Instrument Corp. White Plains, Dec. 21, 1982

1203-> HOW POLICE FOUND LINK IN BURGLARIES
GREENWICH ON Oct. 4, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested three Massachusetts men in New York City on Federal charges of interstate transportation of stolen goods. The charges against the three pertain to a burglary in New Jersey. But the men also are considered suspects in a string of burglaries over four years in four states - including roughly 50 in Greenwich, a dozen each in New Canaan and Darien, and 25 in Bedford, N.Y., just over the border from New Canaan. The link between all the burglaries, police say, is that the victims were listed in the Social Register, a compendium of 50,000 prominent people. Although 14 law-enforcement agencies have been involved in the case, it was largely two detectives from Greenwich and one from Bedford who solved the puzzle that led to the arrests. This is how they did it. Detectives Frank Branca and James Hirsch had worked together in Greenwich for 13 years, spending the last several working almost exclusively on burglaries. But in 1980 they began noticing a different sort of burglary. The burglars always struck at night. They always cut the telephone or burglar-alarm wires, sometimes both. They always took silverware and jewelry, in amounts ranging from $6,000 to $100,000. ''It got to the point,'' Detective Hirsch recalled, ''that you could take the complainant's name off any of these burglary reports and exchange it with any other one: they were all identical.'' ''It got embarassing,'' said Detective Branca. ''You could tell the people what happened but not why.'' The two detectives knew there had to be some common denominator between the victims. They cross-checked everything from garbage-collection services to tree surgeons to the clubs to which victims belonged. Nothing covered every victim. Meanwhile, the burglaries continued. Some of the victims compared the sense of violation to rape. One family sold their home. A woman called Detective Hirsch every day for two months, hoping for an answer that did not exist. As for the detectives, ''What we felt was not fit to print,'' Detective Branca said. ''It was so frustrating,'' he continued. ''It's like knowing someone's going to hit you over the head with a hammer, but not knowing when. And when they do hit you, you don't know who did it.'' Detective Kenneth McGoey had something of the same feeling in Bedford. He first noticed something unusual on a weekend last April. Two houses were broken into by night; most of the burglaries in Bedford take place by day, when the residents are at work. In both homes, the phone lines had been cut and the same items - jewelry, silver, art works and antiques - were taken. The choice of loot told him these burglaries were professional jobs. ''People steal only what they can sell,'' the 13-year veteran of the Bedford force said. ''A burglar is only as good as his fence. A junkie doesn't have a good fence; he goes to a pawnbroker. But someone who steals paintings, he has a good fence. You know you're not dealing with something run-of-the-mill.'' One Bedford home was struck on each of the next two weekends. A home was hit every weekend in May, too, culminating with five burglaries over the Memorial Day weekend. Again, the burglars took the jewelry, art, silverware and antiques; but at one house, they clipped a wedding announcement from a New York newspaper and at another they tore out a story from Money magazine. Detective McGoey recalled having no idea why. It was in late May or early June that detectives from Bedford and Greenwich gathered for their regular monthly meeting. In discussing cases, the similarities in the burglaries in the two towns immediately struck detectives McGoey, Branca and Hirsch. Something else struck them, too. Pound Ridge, N.Y., the town between Greenwich and Bedford, had not reported any similar burglaries. ''A burglar doesn't care where a town border is,'' Detective McGoey said. ''It made us wonder why only Greenwich and Bedford.'' As detectives Branca and Hirsch had, Detective McGoey tried comparing the club memberships and occupations of the victims. Several links turned up in the clubs, but, obviously, someone in Bedford did not belong to the Round Hill Club in Greenwich and someone in Greenwich did not belong to the Bedford Club. Detective Hirsch checked on the whereabouts of the members of the so-called ''Dinnertime Boys,'' a gang that burglarized Bedford homes in the early 1970's by looting upstairs bedrooms while families held dinner parties downstairs. No link could be established to the recent crimes. He followed up on suspects from Connecticut to New Jersey, again without luck. Then the detective's curiosity returned to the wedding announcement and magazine article that had been stolen. He began to ask victims what publications they received. Finally, in early July, one mentioned the Social Register. '' 'Why don't you try this,' '' Detective McGoey recalled the man saying as he lent him a copy of the book. '' 'We're all probably in here.' '' The detective looked for the other names of victims. Indeed, every one appeared in the Social Register. He returned to his office and called detectives Hirsch and Branca in Greenwich. ''Give me a name from one of your cases,'' he told Detective Hirsch. Then Detective McGoey read back the victim's address, occupation and college background. ''Where'd you get that?'' Detective Hirsch asked. ''Never mind,'' Detective McGoey said. ''Give me another name.'' It worked again. The Greenwich police immediately contacted the publishers of the Social Register - whom they credit with being enormously helpful - for several back issues of the book. Detectives Branca and Hirsch cross-checked the names of every victim against the books. ''Once you put two or three together,'' Detective Hirsch said, ''you knew you had the rest. It's like putting together the puzzle.'' ''The hard part,'' Detective Branca added, ''wasn't putting the puzzle together, but finding the pieces.'' Then something strange happened in Bedford. This type of burglary stopped. Detective McGoey wondered why, so his department put out an all-points bulletin, describing the style of the burglaries and asking who else across the country had encountered them. Teletypes came back from as far as Reno and Chicago. The Saratoga, N.Y., police seemed to have had some similar cases, but theirs involved only the theft of cash. Then Officer Arthur Burke of the major case division of the Massachusetts state police called. He told Detective McGoey that he had investigated similar burglaries in 1978. He invited the detective up to compare information, and in late August detectives McGoey and Hirsch went to Framingham, Mass. The pair returned surer than ever that they had found an active and wide-eranging burglary ring. They began to chart out where such burglaries had occurred over the preceding four years. The only problem was that for four months of 1980, no such burglaries could be found. That is, until the Nassau County Police on Long Island told of a string of jewelry and silverware thefts -alarm and phone lines cut before them - during the four-month period. They had dealt with four burglaries on a single weekend. The Greenwich police convened a meeting of 25 law-enforcement officials from Massachusetts, New York and Connecticut, including the F.B.I., on Sept. 20. Massachusetts officials offered the names of some suspects. It turned out that three of them - Dennis Quinn, Raymond Flynn and Charles Gallagher - had been stopped in Greenwich 10 days before, driving after dark in a residential area near the Merritt Parkway. But because there had not been a report of a burglary, the police could not hold them. Only a few weeks later, however, the same three were halted by F.B.I. on the Throgs Neck Bridge in New York. The agents said they found in the trunk of the car silver that had been reported stolen from the home of a Princeton, N.J., man who was listed in the Social Register. And they said they found two copies of the Social Register itself, with check marks next to some of the names. At this point, the three men stand accused of only one crime. The police in Greenwich, Darien, New Canaan, Bedford and other towns face months of work in trying to trace stolen goods to the men or to place them at the scene of a burglary. There is no certainty they will succeed. But in the meantime, they have begun, as Detective Branca said, ''to feel a lot better.'' ''I can't tell you how many days off I gave up,'' said Detective McGoey. ''Our wives probably appreciate the fact we brought this to a conclusion. They're the ones who really suffered.''

1204-> THE WORLD; Rebels Attack; In Salvador
El Salvador's insurgents have long contended they can neither be defeated nor win militarily, but that conclusion hasn't kept them off the battlefield. They were pushing hard last week in at least half of the country's 14 provinces. In Chalatenango in the north and Morazan in the northeast, the Government hit back with 5,000 United States-trained troops supported by American-built fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships. Then the guerrillas opened a diversionary attack farther south, in San Miguel province. ''The situation is pretty critical,'' a national guard commander said, reporting heavy Government casualties in the north. Military experts said the three-pronged attack was the biggest guerrilla effort since their ''final offensive'' collapsed in January 1981. In the capital, four bombs exploded near the presidential palace and gunmen killed two customs policemen. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, Amnesty International said 2,600 Indians and peasants had been killed since Gen. Efrain Rios Montt took power in March. Washington, seeking to resume aid, had been stressing that human rights abuses had diminished and relative calm had been restored in the capital. But last week, a nephew of General Rios Montt was kidnapped on a Guatemala City street.

1205-> KITCHEN EQUIPMENT; WIRE BASKETS FOR FOOD
FOR many years, European women have carried their personal wicker or wire baskets to the marketplace while shopping. A familiar sight in rural France to this day is the shopper strolling through a village with her basket overflowing with provisions for that day's meal - and always a long baguette sticking out of the middle like an antenna, often with the very top nibbled off. The ubiquitous waterproof, leakproof plastic sack is slowly replacing that traditional basket in some places, but somehow fresh food seems to deserve a better vehicle. The attractive wire baskets shown here, which are manufactured near Brest, are so well designed that they could also serve as table centerpieces filled with fruits and flowers. One version is called the fruit basket. It has a 9- or 10-******y*y**** **a pper lip. A nice feature is that it collapses into a flat disk for easy storage. These baskets are made of shiny tinned steel so they are durable and rust-resistant. The other size, shaped like a picnic basket (it comes with or without the lid), is often used by produce pickers in Europe. It is strong enough to hold as many pounds as one could carry from an orchard. A more genteel use would be to lay a cloth napkin inside and fill it with picnic provisions. This version measures 14 inches long by 9 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches deep. It could be hung from the ceiling and used as a receptacle for garlic, onions or potatoes or as an herb-drying container. I also have seen it used as a holiday gift package. Lined with a colorful cloth and stocked with herb vinegar, mustard, candies or fruitbreads, it would be a fine gift. Both baskets are available at Turpan & Sanders Inc., 386 West Broadway (between Spring and Broome streets). The fruit basket costs $19 (9-inch diameter) and $23.50 (10-inch diameter); the picnic basket $24 (without lid) and $36 (with lid). Pierre Franey

1206-> KOCH WARNS SANITATIONMEN OF 'SLOWDOWN' LEGAL ACTION
Mayor Koch warned yesterday of possible legal action to stop a slowdown by sanitation workers that the city said had continued for a third day. ''I don't think people should violate the law,'' the Mayor said, ''and if they do, they have to be prepared to accept the penalties for violation of the law.'' He explained that he was referring to the state's Taylor Law, which forbids strikes or job actions by public employees and provides for loss of pay and union fines as penalties for violations. The Mayor made it clear that he was ''not seeking a confrontation'' with the sanitation workers, who are currently in negotiations with the city for a new contract. But he said he had ordered disciplinary action against any employees violating the law. Department Issues Complaints ''We're not going to be bullied into something we don't want to do,'' he said. Norman Steisel, the Sanitation Commissioner, said that overall performance yesterday was about the same as on Wednesday and Thursday - slower than normal. Sanitation Department officials have issued more than 600 complaints this week against individual workers for below-normal performance on the job. Vito A. Turso, director of public affairs for the department, reported that 49 trucks were held in garages for short periods for mechanical adjustments yesterday compared with 225 on Wednesday and 96 on Thursday. Also, he said, the needed repairs were completed quickly and the trucks were on the streets in an hour or less, an improvement over the delays in the previous two days when sanitation workers demanded repairs for a wide variety of defects before taking out the vehicles. Nevertheless, the backlog of uncollected garbage and refuse grew yesterday to 550 truck loads, or about 3,300 tons, Mr. Turso said. But he said that he saw no threat of a health hazard at this point. In a normal day, the department collects 17,000 tons. He said that 230 men who regularly sweep and clean streets were diverted to garbage collection yesterday, but that the backlog still grew. He said that 175 cleaners would be used in garbage collections today. Planned Slowdown Denied Edward T. Ostrowski, who heads the Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, repeated his earlier denials of any planned slowdown. But he emphasized that sanitation workers would insist that defective and unsafe trucks and equipment be repaired before they took them out of garages. Although he emphasized that the union did not condone any job actions, he said that he thought the sanitationmen were ''upset'' and ''disgruntled'' because they felt the city was attempting to ''shortchange'' them in contract negotiations. The city has sought a settlement with the sanitationmen on the basis of its earlier agreement with the nonuniformed employees. This provided for an 8 percent increase for the first year, with a two month lag before the pay rise became effective, and 7 percent increase in the second year. But a later settlement with police officers and firefighters provided for an 8 percent increase the first year, with no lag, and an 8 percent increase in the second year. Mr. Ostrowski said that the sanitationmen, whose productivity has improved with the use of two men rather than three men on sideloading trucks, wanted increases at least as large as those received by the police and firefighters. The bargaining talks between the city and the sanitationmen are expected to resume early next week. Mr. Ostrowski, who was recently re-elected president of the sanitationmen, and other top officers were formally sworn in yesterday by Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo at the union's headquarters, at 23-25 Cliff Street in Rosebank, S.I. A Cuomo spokesman said that Mr. Cuomo had made the commitment several weeks ago.

1207-> DECISION FILE; C.A.B. Reports More 'Bumps'
There were more ''bumps'' this past summer, according to a report by the Civil Aeronautics Board. But, as of last month, anyway, the bumps didn't bruise as much. ''The rate of passengers involuntarily denied confirmed seats (bumped) increased in July by 49 percent over the same period the previous year,'' the agency reported. The way the agency dissected it, 3.90 people of every 10,000 were bumped in July 1981 compared with the 5.81 people per 10,000 who were bumped this past July. Airlines continue to have trouble estimating how many people will not show up for their reservations, according to an agency official. The companies overbook flights to compensate for ''no-shows,'' but airline computers have had difficulty making predictions in the volatile market. When a passenger with a confirmed seat is bumped, Federal regulations require the airline to pay a consolation bonus equal to the full face value of the one-way ticket, up to $200, and then book the passenger a seat on the next available flight. In addition, the airline must double the bonus if it cannot get the person to his or her destination within two hours of the originally scheduled arrival. The latter portion of this rule was dropped in the aftermath of the air traffic controllers' strike. But it was reinstated in October and that's why bumps don't bruise as much as they once did. Burial Plot Change Good news for aged, blind and disabled Americans. No longer must they give up their burial plots to qualify for Supplemental Social Security benefits. Under the old rules, only eligible individuals with resources of less than $1,500 or couples with less than $2,500 qualify for benefits. Owning a burial plot, or putting money aside for one, formerly put people into unacceptably high levels of net worth. Public Law 97-248 has changed all that. Squeeze Toy Peril Wanted: ''Happy Mates'' toys. The Consumer Product Safety Commission, in cooperation with the toy manufacturer, wants parents to return these squeeze toys because they pose a lethal hazard. The toys, said the agency, are small enough to lodge in a child's throat and obstruct airways. Although these particular toys have not been noted in connection with any choking incidents, similarly shaped toys have caused deaths and injuries, according to the Federal agency. The toys, made by Electro-Plastics Inc. of Port Newark, N.J., are about three inches long and are decorated with an orange lion's head, a yellow cat's head, a green frog's head or a pink pig's head. Packaging bears the number H702. For more information about the recall and refund, call the company at 201-589-2525 or the commission at 800-638-2772. Cost of Driving The American Automobile Association says it costs about 25 cents to drive a car a mile, but the Internal Revenue Service says it costs only 20 cents. Unfortunately, it is the I.R.S. estimate that counts. The tax collecting agency recently announced that it would continue using the 1981 mileage allowance rates for 1982 car expenses associated with business, charitable, medical or moving trips. The business rate is 20 cents for the first 15,000 miles, after which it sinks to 11 cents a mile. The revenue service allows nine cents per mile for car costs associated with charitable, medical and moving trips. This rate is supposed to cover ''such items as depreciation, maintenance and repairs, tires, gasoline (including all taxes thereon), oil, insurance and registration.'' ''If anything,'' said Roderic Young, a spokesman for the I.R.S., ''the rate would have gone down this year because gas prices have gone down.'' He said the rate had been based on a report by an independent consultant. Melitta Hartung, research editor at the automobile association, said the I.R.S. estimate ''doesn't have anything to do with the actual costs of owning and operating a car.'' She said, for example, that the costs of operating a typical medium-size car, (in this case, a 1982 General Motors Chevrolet Citation), would be 24.4 cents per mile if the car was driven 15,000 miles a year, or 32.4 cents per mile if the car was driven 10,000 miles per year. Add another nickel a mile if you live in a city. Taxpayers, especially city dwellers who own big cars, may decide to record and deduct their actual expenses rather than using the I.R.S.'s ''convenient rate schedules.'' Michael deCourcy Hinds

1208-> UNLOAD POISONS AT THE 'FRONT END'
To the Editor: The Dec. 1 editorial ''Pursue the Poisoners'' focused commendable attention on the widespread practice of ''midnight dumping'' of toxic wastes. But illegal disposal along deserted roads is only the most widely talked-about aspect of the problem. Under Federal definitions, American industry generated roughly 57 million tons of hazardous waste in 1980 alone. This amount could double by the year 2000. o date, government, industry and public efforts to deal with toxic wastes have centered, perhaps necessarily, on disposal: how to cope with already existing problems, improve disposal practices and find suitable sites for new dumps. The 1976 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act sets stringent requirements for waste management. However, the act alone cannot resolve the critical future dilemma: how to handle the enormous volume of toxic wastes when expansion of storage and treatment facilities cannot be assured. Suitable sites are already hard to find. Strong local resistance hampers government decisions on potential sites. Storage is complicated by the fact that there is no foolproof way of permanently containing toxic wastes. In the long run, the most reliable way to prevent hazardous-waste problems is to produce less. It is becoming clear that sustained economic growth and protecting the environment and human health from further abuse will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to modify production so as to reduce waste generation at the ''front end'' of industrial processes. Inform, an environmental research group, has just undertaken a study of toxic waste reduction at its source in the chemical industry, which produces 60 percent of the nation's hazardous wastes. The study will document for the first time what a major industry is doing to minimize waste output. It will examine the use of solventrecovery systems, materials recycling, or simply ''housekeeping'' improvements to prevent leaks and spills. These practices not only minimize pollution but reduce the demand - and the cost - for raw materials, waste-treatment technologies and disposal capacity. Estimates of the impact on the toxic waste problem through reduction at source range from 30 to 80 percent -an exciting challenge and opportunity that deserves nationwide attention. JOANNA D. UNDERWOOD Executive Director, Inform New York, Dec. 6, 1982

1209-> HOMOSEXUAL ADOPTING A SON
A judge has granted a 29-year-old homosexual permission to adopt his teen-age foster son. ''Oh, God, I'm happy,'' David Frater said in a telephone interview Tuesday following the hearing that gave him adoption rights to Kevin Frater, 17 years old. ''This is the greatest Christmas present ever.'' The decision was handed down in a closed hearing by Superior Court Judge George Grover, a court clerk, Rosaura Corona, said. Kevin Frater, a high school senior who said he wanted to become a sportscaster, said he was ''very happy that the judge decided in our favor,'' adding, ''It's great.'' 'Place I've Been Looking For' The home, which David Frater shares with his mother, ''is the place I've been looking for,'' the youth said. He has been with Mr. Frater for two years and has adopted his foster father's last name. It was not until after the Riverside Department of Public Social Services placed the youth with Mr. Frater that it learned through an anonymous tip that Mr. Frater was a homosexual. The social services department did not recommend the adoption until Dec. 9. Gloria Allred, Mr. Frater's lawyer, said the department was ''afraid of setting the precedent of allowing an openly homosexual person to adopt a child.'' She described the Fraters as having ''an exemplary father-son relationship.'' ''David is very concerned about Kevin's progress in school, and in his emotional development,'' she said. ''He is a very caring parent.'' Mr. Frater is a systems analyst with Management Assistance Inc. At the age of 3, Kevin said, he was taken away from his mother, who had drinking and other problems, and spent the next dozen years in 15 different foster homes until the county placed him with Mr. Frater. None of the previous homes had worked out ''because they weren't the right parents for me,'' Kevin said.

1210-> VENEZUELAN URGES U.S. ROLE IN GUYANA DISPUTE
A Venezuelan political leader says the United States has a ''moral responsibility'' to involve itself in finding a solution to the border dispute between Venezuela and neighboring Guyana. Dr. Ralfael Caldera, who was President of Venezuela from 1969 to 1974 and is the governing party's candidate for next year's presidential elections, said in an interview in New York this week that there was ''room for discussion'' in his nation's claim to the Essequibo region. The implication was that Venezuela might not press its claim to the whole disputed area, which includes about fourfifths of Guyana's territory. The Venzuelan claim is active again after the expiration last month of an agreement deferring discussion on the matter. Venezuela argues that historical material that has surfaced over the last 50 years supports the view that Venezuela was the victim of secret deals during the arbitration that awarded the territory to Guyana nearly a century ago. ''When the matter was settled in 1899, there was no Venezuelan lawyer or judge,'' Dr. Caldera said. ''There were only British lawyers and British judges and American lawyers and American judges - and one Russian. The United States should now speak to the British Government about bringing about a friendly solution.'' At the 1899 arbitration proceedings, the United States represented Venezuela - or did not allow Venezuela to take part itself, according to many accounts. Guyana was then the colony of British Guiana. Both Britain and the United States have so far not involved themselves in the present dispute. Dr. Caldera, 66 years old, is the founder of Venezuela's conservative Social Christan Party and the President of the World Inter-Parliamentary Union, a group of Members of Parliament of democratic nations. He will be opposed in the elections scheduled for December 1983 by a range of parties, most prominent among them the social democratic party, Democratic Action. In the interview Wednesday, Dr. Caldera said he believed that Venezuela, with longer experience as an oil-producing nations, could avoid the more serious problems now faced by Mexico. He said the oil boom ''took them by surprise'' in Mexico. ''They tried to control it,'' he said, ''but I am afraid they lost that control.'' He said he thought that Venezuelan relations with the United States would not suffer a serious, long-term erosion because of the different positions the two countries took in the Falkland Island crisis. Dr. Caldera was critical of United States Congressional opposition to aid for Central America. ''The amount of assistance needed by Central American countries is so small that it is surprising that some people in the Congress and other sectors are worried,'' he said. ''What does $100 million mean to the United States? That is practically nothing. But for a small Central American country it may be the solution to a very serious situation.''

1211-> Letter: On New Jersey's Budget; The Popular Way to Raise Taxes
To the Editor: Should Governor Thomas Kean peek out of the tax window to which your recent editorial alluded, he will see that there is popular support for one of the two tax choices being discussed in Trenton: increasing the income tax on incomes of $50,000 or more. We believe that voting for the income tax hike will not be a political liability in next year's elections, but will be popular among the state's taxpayers.$ Most New Jersey taxpayers feel they already pay their share of taxes or more. This is particularly true following the passage of the Reagan tax cuts, which gave the largest tax breaks to those who earn the most. A family which earns $60,000 will re-ceive almost $3,000 in reduced Federal income taxes when the third year of the Reagan tax cuts takes effect. That same family will have to pay only $100 in new New Jersey taxes under the graduated income tax proposal. The graduated tax on upper incomes also wins the support of conservatives, like its Republican sponsor, Senator Wayne Dumont. Since President Reagan argues that Federal programs must be returned to the states, the states have to find a way to fund them. The fair way is to recapture in New Jersey a portion of the large Federal tax windfall provided to the wealthy. Fewer than 7 percent of New Jersey's taxpayers will face tax increases if the income tax proposal becomes law. And the new revenues will benefit 100 percent of the state's residents, as we prevent more teacher layoffs, more library closings, and more cuts in important state services. The New Jersey Citizen Action coalition, whose members include senior citizens, tenant organizations, labor unions, church affiliates and community groups, will be organizing citizens throughout New Jersey to meet with their state legislators and bolster their courage to vote for an equitable - and popular - solution to New Jersey's budget crisis.

1212-> No Headline
To the Editor: What a forceful and cogent article by Walter Kerr making it very clear that a proscenium arch does not a theater make. What makes a theater are actors, led by a hard-working creative director, who can, by the alchemy of his imagination, transform any space into a theater of passion, poetry and art. Jean-Louis Barrault has done this, as have countless young directors whose roots are firmly grounded in the classical tradition of making theater with the art of acting.As an example, for 15 years, while endless committees and millions of dollars have struggled to give birth to a repertory theater at the Beaumont by artificial insemination, Christopher Martin has provided New York with a brilliant and imaginative permanent repertory theater called the Classic Stage Company - and he has done this without a proscenium arch. Who then invented the proscenium arch and who wants it? Stage designers. Not actors or directors with the art to create theater anywhere with ''two boards, a trestle and a passion.''

1214-> ISRAELI TROOPS KILL ARAB YOUTH
An Arab youth in the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Nablus was shot and killed today and another student seriously wounded by Israeli troops, the Israeli radio reported. An army spokesman said soldiers had fired at the feet of youths who had hurled rocks at an Israeli bus, smashing one window. He said the troops had initially fired tear gas followed by several shots into the air to disperse the demonstrators. ''But they continued to attack,'' the spokesman said. The dead youth was identified as Samir Ghazal Taflak, 19 years old. He was hit in the chest with a bullet, Palestinian sources said. An unidentified youth nearby was listed as seriously wounded, the sources added. Several hundred students of the King Talal High School had hurled stones at Israeli vehicles, including a bus and a border patrol jeep, protesting the curfew imposed Thursday on the nearby Balata refugee camp, Palestinian sources said. The students waved the flag of the Palestine Liberation Organization and photos of its leader, Yasir Arafat, the sources said.

1215-> LAWS SOUGHT BY CITY TO END UNNEEDED AMBULANCE RUNS
The Koch administration will seek state legislation next month to give New York City ambulance crews and emergency room physicians authority to refuse emergency ambulance service to people they decide do not need it. According to an aide to Mayor Koch, Victor E. Botnick, the proposal is intended to eliminate unnecessary ambulance runs to hospitals, reduce ambulance response time and thereby save lives in real emergencies. The Emergency Medical Service, which operates the city's ambulance service, estimates that 25 percent of its runs are for nonemergencies. Absolving City of Responsibility Under present New York State rules, anyone who calls for an ambulance can insist on being taken to a hospital, whether or not the ambulance crew believes it is necessary. Crews that refuse to take patients must get them to sign a form stating that they do not want an ambulance, thus absolving the city of liability. But few people sign the forms. The legislation, according to officials, would apply only to New York City because unnecessary ambulance calls are not regarded as a major problem elsewhere in the state, where most of the runs are made by volunteers. City officials contend that ambulances are often requested simply for rides to hospital clinics or during bad weather or for conditions that do not warrant emergency care. ''If a person only has a hangnail, he should not be taken to the hospital in an ambulance,'' Mr. Botnick said. ''We will continue to respond to every call, but we intend to remove emergency ambulances from the taxi business.'' Response Time Has Been Cut According to officials of the Emergency Medical Service, unnecessary ambulance requests on the city's 911 emergency telephone system have caused enormous problems for the city. The response time, once the longest of any major city in the country, has been cut from 18 minutes to just under 10 minutes for serious medical emergencies. Eliminating unnecessary hospital runs, officials of the service said, would cut response time further. According to the city, its 911 system received 62,247 calls for an ambulance in October. After screening out about 9,000 calls as unnecessary, 53,380 ambulances were dispatched. Of these, 25 percent proved not to be emergencies. Any move to restrict emergency ambulances once they respond to a call is regarded as politically sensitive because a majority of the calls on the 911 system come from poor, predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Resolution of 'Misgivings' James R. Tallon Jr., of Binghamton, chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, said he was ''personally receptive'' to the request because ''the waste of the city's emergency medical resources could not be justified.'' But he also said that the ''misgivings and concerns by legislators with minority constituencies'' would have to be resolved. Toward that end, Alan G. Hevesi of Queens, the deputy Assembly majority leader and sponsor of the city's legislative proposal, said he planned to confer with members of the Black and Puerto Rican Caucus in an effort to get its support for the bill in the January session. Dr. Alexander E. Kuehl, the head of the city's Emergency Medical Service, said the measure would cut an estimated 75,000 of the 350,000 annual ambulance runs to the hospital. He said that in borderline cases ambulance crews would take the patient. Dr. Kuehl said some cities, such as Seattle and Los Angeles, where response times are about six minutes, permitted paramedics to deny an ambulance under certain conditions.

1216-> 95 SUBDUE BLAZE ON STATEN ISLAND
Ninety-five firefighters and 25 companies fought for more than five and a half hours yesterday to contain a stubborn, smoky blaze at a center to train cerebral palsy victims on Staten Island, authorities said. The three-alarm fire at the United Cerebral Palsy Training Center at 296 Richmond Avenue, at Post Avenue in the Port Richmond section, was declared under control at 5:02 P.M. Three firefighters and a lieutenant were treated for minor injuries at St. Vincent's Hospital on Staten Island and released. No Occupants Were Injured None of the occupants of the building, which was evacuated before firefighters arrived, was injured, officials said. John Mulligan, a deputy fire commissioner, said the fire in the one-story, 30-by-50-foot brick building was under investigation by fire marshals. Such an investigation was routine, he said. Mr. Mulligan said the blaze became difficult to contain when the first floor fell into the basement, acting as a lid on the fire and hampering efforts to extinguish it. Foam was used to smother the fire, Mr. Mulligan said. Cause of Fire Not Known He said it was not known how the fire started or what was kept in the basement that might have burned. Cerebral palsy victims were trained at the center to care for themselves, Mr. Mulligan said. The fire was first reported at 11:20 A.M., and required a second alarm at 11:45 A.M. and a third alarm at 1:56 P.M., a Fire Department spokesman said. The 25 companies fighting the fire included 10 called to the scene from off the island.

1217-> 4 TICKETS SPLIT $11 MILLION JERSEY LOTTERY PRIZE
A roofer, a clothing fitter, a supervisor of messengers and the owner of a maintenance company were among the holders announced today of the four winning tickets in the largest lottery prize in the nation, and they came to the State Capitol to collect their shares of $11,141,892. Each winning ticket was worth $2,785,473 over a 20-year period, before taxes, and the winners and their families said they were ''stunned'' and ''shocked'' and ''numb.'' One winner planned to retire; the rest, for now, said they would stay on their jobs. They all appeared a bit bewildered, but then it has been a bewildering week in New Jersey. The fever and fantasies that surrounded the record prize had made mornings at the bus stops and afternoons at the lunch counters times of lively conversation. State officials said the 2,500 lottery vendors in the state had sold more than 7.6 million $1 tickets, which broke the record of 3.4 million tickets sold during the week of Oct. 21. On Thursday alone, lottery patrons bought more than 3.5 million tickets. The winning numbers, which were chosen last night, were 3, 5, 12, 17, 18 and 25. Governor Kean presented them with their first checks, and then the winners faced reporters in the Governor's outer office. ''My husband said, 'This week let's go for a dream,' '' said Amelia Rowbotham, 48 years old, of Iselin, explaining why the couple decided to buy six tickets. Mrs. Rowbotham is an office worker. Her husband, George, 47, is a roofer. The trip to claim the prize was apparently too much for one member of the family who accompanied the Rowbothams. Lottery officials said that when the Rowbothams arrived at the division's offices in Lawrence Township to present their ticket, their daughter-in-law, Agnes Caso, was taken to Mercer Medical Center by state police because she thought she was in labor. She was not, however, and was later released. Solomon Bryant Jr. of Newark, a 41-year-old supervisor of a messenger service at New Jersey Bell, said that he regularly played the lottery, but that this week he waited until the last minute to buy his ticket and neglected to play the six numbers he usually selected. Thinking he had lost, he said, he did not bother to check his ticket, but when he came home from work this morning with the newspapers, he saw the lottery ticket on the table. ''I jumped up,'' Mr. Bryant said. ''I got 'em all.'' He said he would buy a new house with his winnings and give his present home to his parents. He said that his wife had died and that he was engaged to be married. Marie and Pasquale Desimone of Whippany bought 35 tickets. When they discovered they had won, ''we went pale,'' Mrs. Desimone, said, ''just for a little while, then we went limp.'' 'Do Something Special' Mr. Desimone, 42, owns a maintenance company in East Orange. Mrs. Desimone is a community service worker in Newark. They said they planned to share their winnings with family members and ''do something special.'' Olga Roccosanto, 63, of Millburn, who has worked for 23 years as a clothing fitter for Lord & Taylor, said winning the lottery had liberated her. ''I'm a sick girl and I wanted to retire,'' she said. She did not elaborate. She said that she and her husband, Nick, 69, were having coffee this morning at about 11 A.M. ''I said, 'Don't you want to see if we're going to win?' '' she recalled. ''He says, 'We're not going to win because I heard somebody next door won.' So I said, 'Let's look anyway.' '' First Checks Were $100,378.40 The holders of each winning ticket received a check for $100,378.40. This will be followed by 19 annual payments of $112,000. The state withholds 20 percent of the winnings for Federal income taxes, but there are no state income taxes on lottery winnings. The winners had a year to collect the first installments on their prizes. To play the Pick-6 Lotto, a player must choose 6 numbers from 1 to 36 and mark them on a card that is fed into a computer, which in turn prints a ticket. Each play is a dollar. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 1.9 million. Prizes in the game are linked to sales. The top prize this week had been building since Oct. 21, when four people shared $7.2 million. There had been no winners since then. Size of Volume Unanticipated State lottery officials, who had not anticipated the large volume of sales, had planned to limit the top prize this week to $10 million. But as the lottery fever spread, they lifted the limit. From now on, however, they will impose the $10 million ceiling. Based on projected sales for next week, they estimated that the top prize will be $1.1 million.

1218-> BUSINESS DIGEST; SATURDAY, OCTOBER 30, 1982; International
Washington and its allies are weighing a long-term approach to East-West trade issues under which the U.S. would drop sanctions against companies involved in the Soviet natural gas pipeline. The plan was said to include widening restraints on high-technology exports to the Soviet Union and denying it subsidized credits. (Page 1.) Pressure is building in Mexico for an inquiry into reports of corruption in Pemex. So far, the outgoing Government has insisted that the ''kickbacks'' charged in some cases involving American companies were minor in scale. But aides close to President-elect de la Madrid acknowledge privately that illicit commission practices in the hugh state oil monopoly have grown out of hand. (37.) The Economy The index of leading economic indicators rose 0.5 percent in September, the Commerce Department reported, confirming figures released by officials earlier in the week. The increase, giving the Administration hope that recovery may be imminent, was the fifth in the past six months.

1219-> DISAPPOINTING END FOR 'ALL-SAVERS'
The meteoric life of the ''all-savers'' certificate, a special one-year, tax-free deposit aimed at helping thrift institutions and the housing industry, is nearing its end in the midst of general disappointment with the results. This week is the public's last chance to buy the certificates. But if recent experience is any guide, there will be few takers. As far as the public is concerned, the all-savers, with an interest rate of only 6.26 percent, is dead. ''Our expectations for the certificates were much higher, especially after the first month of sales,'' said John W. Sapanski, president of the Dime Savings Bank in New York. He said that the drop in short-term interest rates reduced the all-savers rate, which was set at 70 percent of the one-year Treasury bill yields, by so much that it was not competitive with other kinds of deposits. Huge Initial Success Hopes were high when the certificates were introduced in October 1981, and the scramble by banks and thrift institutions to attract deposits led to a barrage of advertisements and special bonus offers similar to those offered on the new money market accounts. In the first two months of sales, the certificates were the most successful kind of deposit ever introduced, and attracted $39.3 billion. But growth soon tapered off. Instead of rising to $200 billion or more, the level expected by some in the thrift industry, the peak for all-savers was $53.2 billion at the end of September. Since then, the level has fallen by more than half, as most of the maturing certificates originally bought in October 1981 at rates of more than 12 percent have been shifted to other deposits or investments. Lacking public support, the all-savers certificates did not provide the expected amount of help to savings and loan associations and the housing industry. They did not prevent the savings and loan associations from accumulating losses of $3.3 billion in the first half of 1982, nor did they provide much of a lift to the housing market, where new starts remained depressed at about one million units a year during the life of all-savers. But with only $53.2 billion of sales in the first 12 months, ''there was just not enough deposit flow to have much of a measurable effect,'' said Charlotte Chamberlain, an economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Provided Some Help In defense of the all-savers, its backers say that conditions for the thrift institutions and the housing market would have been even worse without it. Jack Carlson, president and chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, said, ''The concept is worthwhile, and it would have been more so if the rate were fixed at 80 percent or 85 percent of the Treasury bill yield,'' compared with the 70 percent that prevailed. Even with the disappointing results of the certificates, he said, ''more funds went to housing'' than would have without the certificates. He estimated that the certificates might have been responsible for a fifth of the $65 billion that flowed into the housing market in 1982. While the all-savers were undoubtedly of some benefit to the savings and loan industry and housing business last year, even its backers fear that the limited time offering may have backfired. Heightened Public Awareness ''The certificates did us a favor by heightening the public's awareness of what the tax-exempt market is all about,'' said Richard J. Franke, president of John Nuveen & Company, a Chicago-based firm that specializes in tax-exempt securities. Yields of more than 11 percent were widely available in the tax-exempt market during the past year. Based on last Thursday's auction of one-year Treasury bills, the rate for all-savers certificates is 6.26 percent until the end of the year, when authority to sell the certificates expires. For many investors who had already earned the maximum $1,000 of tax-free interest allowed to an individual, the all-savers were a nonevent long ago. ''The potential of all-savers was limited, what with the limits on the amount of tax-free interest one investor could earn,'' said Willam H. Turner, executive vice president at Chemical Bank. ''They are not like the new money market accounts, which clearly have much greater potential.'' Bankers said the all-savers were undermined as banking regulators began eliminating interest rate limits on deposits. Because long-term rates did not fall as sharply as short-term rates during 1982, rates on longer-term deposits became more attractive, even though interest paid on the longer-term deposits was taxable. For example, the ''small-saver'' certificate - whose yield is equal to 30-month Treasury securities -jumped to 15.8 percent when the old 12 percent ceiling was lifted on Aug.1, 1981, and remained well above the all-savers rate in subsequent months. Limited Appeal Another problem with the all-savers, according to a recent study by James W. Christian, chief economist of the United States League of Savings Associations, was that it appealed strongly only to households in the 30 percent or higher tax bracket, and had little appeal to households in lower tax brackets. The moral of the all-savers story, according to Allen Sinai, an economist at Data Resources Inc., is that ''Congress should never be hurried into passage of a tricky kind of program like this.'' The idea for the certificates was not originally a part of the 1981 tax package, but was inserted by legislators who were sympathetic to the plight of the savings and loan industry. By offering an interest rate equal to 70 percent of the investment yield on one-year Treasury bills, backers of the all-savers hoped to create a deposit that would reduce the cost of deposits to banks and savings and loans, and thereby help the housing industry. The public would be attracted, it was said, because the exemption from Federal income tax would make the all-savers more attractive than other kinds of deposits that paid higher rates but were taxable. Federal Revenues Lost For the savings and loan industry, the certificates were a step toward one of its major goals - exempting from income tax the interest paid on deposits. The Treasury Department has often been opposed to such a suggestion, partly because it would reduce tax revenues. Treasury officials have not yet estimated the lost revenues from the all-savers experiment, but the United States League of Savings Association put the loss at $2.9 billion, assuming that allsavers totaled $70 billion at the end of September, not the $53 billion that was actually outstanding. Against that cost, the United States League's study estimated that banks and thrift institutions saved about $1 billion of interest expense. Of course, the reduction in interest expenses because of the low rate paid on all-savers was not confined to financially troubled savings and loans since commercial banks accounted for about 45 percent of the market. Although legislators decided against renewing the authority for issuing all-savers certificates, some interest on savings deposits will be exempt from Federal income tax beginning in 1985. At that time investors may exempt from Federal tax up to 15 percent of interest and dividend income, up to a maximum of $450 per individual.

1220-> DINING OUT; IN AN ITALIAN-CONTINENTAL STYLE
AQUA MANOR is an outpost of northern Italian dining situated near the water in Manorhaven, an area of marinas and yacht clubs. It has been under new management for the last two months. The change has not altered the comfortably pleasant, dark wood panel look of the place, but the garish pink and white fluorescent lights that draw the eye to the undulating ceiling in the second dining room could have been eliminated without regret. The menu is shiny and new with listings that are mostly old hat - the standard specialties that one has come to expect in northern Italian-Continental establishments, interchangeable with dozens of other restaurants. It is augmented by several special offerings each evening that are worth noting. The preparation is competent and, while capable of authoritative seasoning, it can also be careless. Better coordination between kitchen and dining room might result in fewer dishes being served barely tepid. The appetizers and pasta dishes outshine the entrees, a flaw that Aqua Manor shares with many restaurants. The hot shrimp Masaniello were excellent, the hotness referring both to temperature and to the forcefully seasoned tomato and pepper sauce in which the trio of juicy butterfly shrimp had been sizzled. Oysters were served baked in their shells beneath a blanket of spicy tomato sauce and bechamel cream sauce. The dish was well prepared but less satisfactorily conceived, since the delicate flavor of the oysters was incapable of competing with the sauces. Mussels in white wine sauce mariniere style were fresh and tasty and served in a rich, briny wine-and-garlic broth, but they would have been more appealing had their shells been scrubbed more thoroughly. Aqua Manor is to be commended for offering appetizer portions of pasta. These are $5.95, as against the main course price of $7.50, but the advantage is that sharing is not required. The linguine tossed with white clam sauce and a nice lacing of hot red pepper, or mingled with cheese, egg, bacon and onion carbonara style, was very good, as was the tortellini alla segreta, the ''secret'' sauce being a pleasantly seasoned, slightly creamy tomato mixture populated by the somewhat overcooked green tortellini. Salads are given the big-deal tableside flourish to good effect in the case of Caesar, but less show with the spinach salad, which the captain inadvertently forgot to wilt with warm dressing. An entree of roast veal stuffed with spinach, consisting of four pinwheel slices of meat rolled around a subdued green filling and presented in a lightly sherried sauce, was one of the better entrees. Veal scaloppine topped with eggplant and cheese was chewy, and the veal chop Valdostana, stuffed with ham and cheese and served with mushrooms, was subjected to a thick glutenous gravy that tasted too sharply of mediocre brandy. After the nearly raw pepper steak was returned to the kitchen to become closer to medium rare, it was fine, with the crushed peppercorns applied in reasonable quantity and a sauce that held cream and brandy in correct balance. But the lobster fra diavolo was oddly mushy of texture and thus quite unpleasant. Decent chocolate cake with a mousselike feeling and cassata cake fortified with Amaretto are the dessert cart highlights. Zuppa inglese was also good, its soft custardy texture making it closer to the ''English soup,'' or trifle, than one usually finds. But the banana cake was leaden and topped with slices of fruit that had become unattractively brown. The wine list is divided between French and Italian selections, and had vintage years been included, it would have been quite a useful document. On it you will find the refreshing Collavini pinot grigio for $12, the light and crisp Galestro by Antinori, also $12, and the full-bodied, velvety Chateau Fortia Chateauneuf-du-Pape 1978 for a mere $16. Although the service is professional, it occasionally becomes disjointed, as when the waiter can find no place to rest his tray and returns it to the kitchen before reappearing some moments later with food that has become a few degrees cooler. A three-course dinner with wine is likely to average $30 a person, including tax and tip. *Aqua Manor 175 Manorhaven Boulevard, Manorhaven. 883-4660, 767-9534.

1222-> TEXT OF SHULTZ'S STATEMENT ON THE U.N. AND ISRAEL
Following is the text of the statement by Secretary of State George P. Shultz today on Israel's participation in the United Nations: Recently there have been proposals at the United Nations General Assembly in New York and at the Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union in Nairobi against the continued participation of Israel in those organizations. The United States views these threats with grave concern. The exclusion of Israel from the General Assembly or the International Telecommunication Union in these circumstances would be contrary to the principle of the United Nations. In the case of the General Assembly, it would be a clear-cut violation of the United Nations Charter. Such action defeats the very purpose of the United Nations - to resolve disputes among nations - by creating further conflict and division. It would do grave damage to the entire United Nations system and it would hurt us all. The excluion from United Nations bodies would also be a serious setback for progress toward peace in the Middle East, to which the United States and virtually all members of the United Nations are committed. Hope in Middle East It would be a tragic irony if such moves against Israel in the United Nations system were to succeed just at the time when there is renewed hope for progress in the Middle East. The United States has always made clear that any attack on Israel's right to participate in any United Nations organization, if successful, would have grave consequences for our own continued participation and support. As evidence of our determination to oppose such actions we withdrew our delegation from the Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency following the wrongful rejection of Israel's credentials on Sept. 24, announced that we would reassess our participation in the I.A.E.A., and suspended participation in a broad range of agency activities. Pending the outcome of our reassessment, we are making no further payments to the I.A.E.A. We will take such action in other United Nations organizations, if there are similar moves. United States Position If Israel were excluded from the General Assembly, the United States would withdraw from participation in the Assembly and would withhold payments to the United Nations until Israel's right to participate is restored. We would also withdraw our delegation from the International Telecommunication Plenipotentiary Conference in Nairobi if Israel were excluded and suspend further payments to that organization. The I.T.U., the I.A.E.A. and other technical agencies must not be undermined or destroyed by such political attacks on the rights of member states. We trust that the majority of nation members of the United Nations and all its agencies recognize the grave dangers of any further attacks on Israel's right to participate in United Nations bodies and will work to turn aside such initiatives.

1224-> JETS LOSE ON A KICK WITH :003 LEFT
In a game of missed kicks, the Dolphins won dramatically today when Uwe von Schamann kicked a 47-yard field goal with three seconds to play for a 20-19 victory over the Jets. The margin of defeat was Pat Leahy's missed extra point, the fifth one he has missed in the last four games. The loss also spoiled, for this week anyway, the Jets' chance to clinch one of the National Football League's playoff berths, and it snapped their five-game winning streak. It was a stretch that started after they had bowed to the Dolphins in the season's opener. Now, both clubs are tied in the American Conference standing with a 5-2 mark; each has two regular-season games remaining. For a few minutes, however, it appeared that Leahy could retrieve his lost stature. With 9 minutes 6 seconds remaining, he kicked a 49-yard field goal, equaling the longest successful kick of his nine pro seasons and giving the Jets a 19-17 edge. His teammates mobbed him with joy. But the Jets could not halt the veteran Don Strock, who replaced David Woodley at quarterback and directed the final Miami drive that started with 108 seconds remaining. In those closing seconds, Strock connected on six of seven passes as the Jets yielded the short yardage. ''We went back, hoping they wouldn't have enough time,'' conceded Coach Walt Michaels in the somber Jets' locker room. ''They made a 47-yard field goal. What's the percentages of that?'' But for the Dolphins, it was a remarkably businesslike comeback in the frenetic Orange Bowl, where 67,702 fans stood for the final minute. This was, after all, as close as the Jets and Dolphins have come to a clutch game in this strike-interrupted season. It had the feel of a playoff game, with its crunching hitting and pressure situations. Ed Newman, the all-pro guard for the Dolphins, described the atmosphere: ''Ironies and paradoxes abounded all over the place. Don Strock is yelling to the flankers even before the ball is down. We're screaming at the officials, 'Get the ball down, get it down!' We get down, set, hut!'' Newman's reverie was perfect, but it might not have happened so perfectly. For on the final drive, Strock nearly was intercepted by Bobby Jackson, the left cornerback, who let a pass bounce out of his hands with 32 seconds remaining. An interception would have given the Jets the victory and, probably, have made a New York hero out of Leahy. ''I had a chance to win the game and I didn't,'' said Jackson. Von Schamann Also Misses Instead, fans will be seeing replays and remembering that five of Leahy's last 12 extra-point attempts have failed. Leahy also had a 28-yard field goal blocked today; in his last four games he is 5 of 10 in field-goal attempts. Von Schamann also missed two of his first three field-goal attempts today. PU ONLY ADD SUB JETS This was a game the Jets thought could continue their strong showing, following their five straight victories, and establish them as a leading contender to reach the Super Bowl. ''We're down to earth now,'' said Kurt Sohn, the Jets' special teams player who had taken von Schamann's final kickoff at the gun, run with it, and lateralled to Bruce Harper, who was stopped. No Joy for Leahy ''The extra point came back to haunt us,'' Leahy said later. Even the 49-yard field goal that had given his club the lead meant little to him. ''It doesn't matter now, does it?'' he asked. The disappointment came almost immediately for the Jets, who moved smartly to their first touchdown after taking possession on the opening kickoff. Richard Todd, the quarterback, employed two of the National Football League's prize players, the receiver Wesley Walker and the running back Freeman McNeil, to produce a six-play, 59-yard touchdown drive. The drive ended with Walker snaring a 22-yard pass. That continued his remarkable stretch of success against Miami. It was his ninth touchdown in the 10 games he has played against the Dolphins since joining the Jets in 1977. Letdown Follows Touchdown Over all, he caught seven passes for 96 yards, giving him a record of 42 receptions and 785 yards in those 10 games. But while his teammates were celebrating the touchdown on the sidelines, Leahy went onto the field and kicked the extra-point attempt wide to the left. A missed extra point immediately deflates the team that has just scored. This one also elated the Miami fans and, in a sense, gave the Dolphins a free point. Most of Leahy's misses over the years have occurred when he has slumped. But no slump lasted this long. Michaels, who backed Leahy earlier in the week, would not indicate after the game whether he might look at other kickers. Two years ago, he threatened that action when Leahy was in a slump, and the kicker pulled out of it. Other Mistakes Committed Leahy's mistakes were the most obvious ones. But the Jets often were caught in penalties that stalled their own drikes or kept alive Miami surges. Even Todd, whose interception percentage has become one of the league's best since the Dolphins picked him off three times opening day, was intercepted twice today. The first one positioned von Schamman's first field goal, also from 47 yards, that cut the Jets' edge to 6-3 in the opening quarter. On the Dolphins' next possession, Woodley, given time to throw by his offensive line, guided the club 69 yards to a score. The Jets led the league in sacks last season, but this season they have played three games without a sack, including the opener against the Dolphins. Today they produced no sacks in the first half and only three in the game. Long Catch by Gaffney Andra Franklin got the touchdown, on a fine 25-yard run, and the extra point gave Miami a 10-6 lead. The Jets' Derrick Gaffney and the Dolphins' Duriel Harris each made long touchdown catches in the second quarter, with Leahy successfully hitting the extra point. Gaffney's 45-yard reception was the longest touchdown catch of his pro career. Leahy, meanwhile, brought the Jets to within 17-16 at the half when he booted a 40-yard field goal that went wide to the left, hit the upright, then ricocheted back over the crossbar. Finally, in the fourth quarter, he hit another one, the 49-yarder with fewer than 10 minutes remaining that appeared to have been enough for the victory. That 19-17 edge looked good because the defense was starting to pressure Woodley. Mark Gastineau was to get all the Jets' sacks in the second half, his whirling antics delighting the small number of Jets' fans, while tens of thousands of others booed and Gastineau twirled faster. Good Gains by McNeil Other positive statistics were turned in by McNeil, who gained 89 yards on 21 carries. That kept ahead of Franklin, who gained 75, for the N.F.L. rushing lead - 621 to 593 yards. But Todd, whose two touchdown tosses were marred by two interceptions, gained only 174 yards, completing 16 of 29 attempts. ''It happens,'' said Michaels at game's end. ''You play long enough, you'll get another one like this.''

1226-> CHESS; CANADIAN ASSET
The biggest recent boost to Canadian chess was the arrival of the international master Igor Ivanov from the Soviet Union three years ago. He is the national champion, was the Canadian entrant into the Toluca Interzonal Tournament and played first board for their Olympiad team in Lucerne, Switzerland. Before leaving the Soviet Union, Ivanov held no international rank, although he had attracted notice by defeating the world champion, Anatoly Karpov, in the Spartakiad (Russian team tournament) in 1979. That Ivanov has strengthened the 17th-seeded Canadian team can be seen from their surprising upset of fourth-seeded England. He defeated Anthony Miles, and Lawrence Day defeated Jonathan Mestel, while Jean Hebert drew with Jonathan Speelman and Duncan Suttles lost to John Nunn. Against Miles, Ivanov ventured a speculative pawn sacrifice and showed great virtuosity in his final attack. Ivanov provoked a sharp struggle with 8 Q-Q3!?, NxN; 9 PxN, acquiescing to doubled QBP's to obtain a big pawn center. It would not have been wise for Miles to try the prophylactic 9 . . .P-B4?! since 10 N-N5, BxB; 11 KxB, N-B3; 12 P-K4! would have broken open the position favorably for White. It is a question whether Miles should have kept the doubled pawns in place with 10 . . .N-B3 - after 11 B-K3, P-Q3; 12 N-Q2, R-B1; 13 P-B4, B-QR3, a difficult battle would have ensued. Of course, what he had in mind with 10 . . .PxP was the sort of position that arose after 17 . . .KxB: the white KP and QBP were both under fire and Black had always available . . .KR-B1. Ivanov threw down a complex, ingeniously thought-out challenge with 18 P-B5!? It could have been declined by the prudent 18 . . .KR-B1, but Miles, with just as much fighting spirit, charged ahead with 18 . . .BxP?! This gave Ivanovic the chance for 19 P-Q5!? with the point that 19 . . .BxP; 20 Q-Q4ch, K-N1; 21 QxB, QxQ; 22 RxQ, NPxP creates an ending in which White's bishop may prove stronger than Black's three pawns. Still, Miles should not have avoided this because his 19 . . .BxN? got him into much more trouble. After 20 BxB, it would have been wrong to capture with 20 . . .RxP because 21 RxR, QPxR (21 . . .NPxR?, 22 Q-B3ch wins a piece); 22 P-Q6! yields White a lion of a passed pawn. Thus, after 20 . . .Q-B1; 21 P-B6 Ivanovic had a formidable passed QBP, while Miles's knight stood out of play. However, Miles, underestimating the seriousness of his predicament, soon offered a draw with 22 . . .Q-B3. Ivanovic's 26 B-N4! was a powerful way to press his attack - the threat was 27 B-Q7, winning the KP. Miles did not dare play 26 . . .QxP because of 27 RxBP!. For example, 27 . . .KxR; 28 B-K6ch, K-N2; 29 Q-Q4ch, K-R3; 30 Q-B4ch, P-N4; 31 Q-B7, R-KR1; 32 B-B5 permits no defense against the threat of 33 R-K6mate. Miles's attempted defense with 26 . . .P-B4 ran afoul of Ivanovic's trenchant bishop sacrifice, 27 BxP!, PxB; 28 QxP. Here, 28 . . .Q-B3 would have lost to 29 Q-R5, Q-N3; 30 R-KN4. After 29 Q-R5, defense by 29 . . .R-KN1 would not have held up against 30 R-B7, R-KN2; 31 R-B8ch, R-N1; 32 RxRch, KxR; 33 Q-K8ch, K-N2; 34 RxPch, RxR; 35 QxRch, K-N3; 36 P-B7 forcing a new queen. Ivanovic's 32 R-R6! revealed the full fury of his onslaught: The key point was that, on 32 . . .R-KB2, White wins the queen with 33 RxPch!, QxR; 34 QxR. Miles, therefore, strove desperately for perpetual check, but it was not in the position. He was obliged to give up after 40 RxPch!, since 40 . . .QxR; 41 QxQch, KxQ; 42 P-B7 will promote a queen.

Forty of Mr. Scholder's art works are on view in a one-man show that starts today and fills the ACA Galleries, 21 East 67th Street (628-2440). About a quarter of these are his rather stark and craggy views of the Empire State Building, which has caught his eye and imagination ever since he first visited New York in 1963. Its tall aloofness from its surroundings seems to have inspired him as much as the tall figures of native Americans that he saw rising from flat plains. He established himself here years later, after a lifetime of living out West, where he still maintains roots. He has had more than 100 solo exhibitions at the Tucson Museum of Art in Arizona and has also been represented at group shows in New York, Washington and elsewhere. The new show coincides with the publication in several languages by Rizzoli International of ''Fritz Scholder.'' The exhibition, through Nov. 20, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. FILM Established may be an unfortunate word to apply to organizations that seek new things, avant-garde and other, but once they have been around for 10 years, that is what they are. This decade-mark has been achieved by the Collective for Living Cinema, at 52 White Street, west of Broadway, in TriBeCa (925-2111), which is celebrating its survival and growth by a program that looks back on all the forward looks it has screened in years past. ''Ten Years of Living Cinema'' is the festival's name, and it is about midway through its run. Through Nov. 21, it is showing 130 films by 95 of the more than 1,000 film makers that it has shown throughout the years. The Collective was established with several purposes: to encourage new work, to rediscover old work and to impart more understanding of film to the general public. To this end, it has workshops, seminars and special film events. The festival pieces, mostly short, are screened Thursdays through Sundays at 8 P.M. Tonight's six films include experimentations with light and sound, a child's fantasy about the Messiah, a short family reminiscence and a comedy of sorts. Among themes of tomorrow's three films are overheard conversations and a study of a light beam. Admission: $3. Richard F. Shepard

1228-> CYNTHIA PROPPER SETON, NOVELIST AND ESSAYIST
Cynthia Propper Seton, a novelist and essayist, died yesterday of acute leukemia in Northampton, Mass. She was 56 years old and lived in Northampton. Reflecting on marriage in her second book, ''A Special and Curious Blessing,'' Mrs. Seton wrote that ''it was good to be married because it protected me from the ignorance in which I had been reared - an ignorance about the possibilities of human relationships.'' It was a sense of these possibilities that infused Mrs. Seton's writing. Like Jane Austen, to whom she was often compared, she wrote comedies of manners whose light tone hid a more serious intent. Critics praised her precise, elegant prose, which she said was modeled on Gibbon, George Eliot and Proust. She taught herself French so she could read Proust in the original. Many of her novels concerned affluent, middle-aged women who found themselves dissatisfied with the life they had built. But she eschewed feminist rhetoric, substituting a graceful and ironic style laced with compassion for women struggling to find expression and for the men in their lives. Mrs. Seton once told an interviewer: ''I want to write about husbands who may be obtuse, but who are not brutes, and remind their wives that there is a great deal to hang in there for. And I want to take the middle-aged woman and evoke her refusal to be demeaned, to honor it with a serious acknowledgement.'' Mrs. Seton was born Oct. 11, 1926, in New York City. She graduated from the Fieldston School and received her B.A. degree from Smith College in 1948. For 12 years, Mrs. Seton wrote a regular column for The Berkshire Eagle of Pittsfield, Mass. Her first book was a collection of the columns and was followed by two volumes of essays discussing the problems of family life and marriage against the backdrop of the Vietnam War. In 1971, she turned to fiction with the publication of ''The Sea Change of Angela Lewes.'' Her third novel, ''A Fine Romance,'' was nominated for the National Book Award in 1976. Her last novel, ''A Private Life,'' was published in April. Mrs. Seton was in demand as a lecturer on literary and feminist issues. She taught at the Indiana Writers Conference and contributed book reviews to several publications. She is survived by her husband, Dr. Paul Seton of Northampton.; her mother, Charlotte Propper, also of Northampton; a son, Anthony, of San Francisco; and four daughters, Julia, of London; Dr. Margarret Seton-Jacobson of Osceola, Ark., and Jennifer and Nora, both of Cambridge, Mass.

1229-> THE BERLIN PHILHARMONIC-WHAT MAKES IT GREAT?
New York is a crossroads for the great orchestras of the world, but a visit here by the Berlin Philharmonic remains a rarity. Its last concerts in New York came six years ago. This week, as part of its 100th birthday celebrations, the Philharmonic returns to Carnegie Hall for four long-since sold-out concerts under its music director since 1955, Herbert von Karajan. At this late stage of his career (he is 74 years old), Mr. Karajan is still widely recognized as a master of late Romantic repertory from Wagner through Shostakovich, and the first and fourth of the concerts at Carnegie will give us a taste of that repertory. Tuesday night, following Stravinsky's ''Apollo,'' there will be Richard Strauss's gorgeously excessive ''Alpine'' Symphony, and Saturday offers Mahler's Symphony No. 9. In between, Wednesday and Friday, Mr. Karajan and the orchestra will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Brahms's birth with the complete Brahms symphonies. (The orchestra will offer only four other concerts on this American tour, all in Pasadena, Calif., at the end of the month.) No one questions Mr. Karajan's mastery of orchestral technique, or his ability, shared by all great conductors, to elicit an individual sound from any ensemble he faces. In late Romantic music, his penchant for mystic rapture combined with unsurpassed tonal elegance can make for remarkable performances. But with earlier standard repertory, the core classics that he has played over and over again, many critics sense a detached overrefinement. These remarks are based on Mr. Karajan's past work and more particularly on the evidence offered in a lavish, six-box set of record albums - 33 disks in all - that Deutsche Grammophon has issued as part of the Philharmonic's centenary celebration. The six boxes in the series, which may be purchased individually, are: ''Early Recordings'' (2740 259, five disks); ''Wilhelm Furtwangler'' (2740 260, six disks); ''Herbert von Karajan'' (2749 261, seven disks); ''Celebrated Soloists'' (2740 262, five disks); ''Eminent Guest Conductors'' (2740 263, six disks), and ''Karajan Digital Recordings'' (2741 008, four disks). (There is also, somewhat tangentially, a seventh album devoted to chamber performances by members of the orchestra.) Among many other things, these boxes suggest that the Berlin Philharmonic under Mr. Karajan need fear no challenge as one of the undisputed great orchestras of the world, which is ample explanation in itself for the anticipation that awaits this week's concerts. Under Mr. Karajan's baton, the Philharmonic may play better than it ever played before; indeed, it is Mr. Karajan's very obsession with the niceties of balance, phrasing and tone that produces astonishing orchestral virtuosity and, at the same time, makes some of his performances sound mannered and fussy. Beyond his specific concern for detail, the Philharmonic retains a personality of its own, one that predates Mr. Karajan and can be heard from the earliest recording (1913) in DG's retrospective series. Parallels drawn between cities and their orchestras are always slightly fanciful and suspect. But it is tempting to hear the Philharmonic's dark, earnest sound, with soloistic brilliance contained within firm discipine, as an aural reflection of the best of the Prussian character. DG's 33 retrospective disks have their flaws, however, both as a comprehensive historical overview and as a series that can be recommended without qualification to the record buyer. All of the material has been previously released, which means that any serious collector is likely to have some of it already. The selection was made by DG officials, not by the orchestra. Its failure as a historical survey derives in part from the fact that for a long time DG was not the only company recording the orchestra. In addition, the written material in each box oscillates uneasily between a history of the orchestra, glorification of performers and commentary on the music. And production has not been perfect, either: in the first set of the ''Celebrated Soloists'' this reviewer received, what was labeled as the first movement of the Beethoven Triple Concerto was actually the complete Paganini Fourth Violin Concerto with Salvatore Accardo and the London Philharmonic; the error was corrected in a subsequent set. Ideally, DG and German Electrola should have cooperated to release a collection of true Berlin Philharmonic highlights, supplemented by previously unreleased radio-archive tapes. As it is, the selection is understandably weighted toward the present, when better recorded sound is available but when less magisterial conductors abound. Still, the set has its merits, and helps us hear the orchestra's history over most of its 100 years - a history that does much to explain the Philharmonic's present eminence. The Philharmonic is actually something of an anomaly within the German musical world. It is a world-class orchestra in a musical culture that puts its primary emphasis on opera. It was a product of the middle classes in a country where most performing-arts institutions date back to the aristocracy. It became the cultural jewel of a city that, before 1870, was a grim, provincial outpost. And now, it flourishes as a showpiece in a city, West Berlin, that is itself sustained by subsidies from the Federal Republic of Germany. German musical culture grew up around the opera companies of the hundreds of principalities that became Germany in 1870. Often the orchestras of those companies would give concerts, as with Berlin's Konigliche Kapelle. A few cities had major symphony orchestras, above all Leipzig, with its Gewandhausorchester (which will tour America later this fall under its music director, Kurt Masur). Before 1870, however, Berlin lagged far behind Leipzig and many other cities in its musical sophistication; both the Vienna and New York Philharmonics were founded as early as 1842. Frederick the Great had played the flute, and Bach dedicated his ''Brandenburg'' Concertos to the Margrave of Brandenburg. But royal music-making was mostly of chamber proportions and took place in Potsdam, well away from the city itself. In the course of the 19th century, a number of private orchestral ensembles devoted largely to light-Classical pot-pourri repertory and playing in local garden-restaurants and beer halls flickered in and out of existence. One such ensemble was the Bilsesche Kapelle, run by a dictatorial skinflint named Benjamin Bilse. In 1882, 54 musicians in this orchestra revolted against their leader and set themselves up independently -first as the ''Former Bilsesche Kapelle,'' but soon thereafter as the Philharmonic Orchestra. They organized themselves as a cooperative - which still defines their self-governing administrative structure - and gave their first, formal ''Philharmonic concert'' 100 years ago this Saturday. From the beginning they were encouraged by a man without whom they would have surely foundered. That was the concert impresario Hermann Wolff, who helped the players resolve their administrative and financial crises. It would be years before they received any substantial governmental support, and in the meantime they made their way by renting themselves out for private occasions, playing pops concerts and, every summer until 1911, entertaining at a spa on the Dutch coast. It was Wolff who found them their own hall, a converted rollerskating rink in central Berlin into which they moved in 1887; it was destroyed by firebombs in January 1944, and finally replaced by a modernistic new hall in 1963. Wolff also steered the orchestra toward the first of the four chief conductors who have played the main role in shaping the Philharmonic's destiny. Hans von Bulow led the Philharmonic from 1887 to 1893, until shortly before his death. A Wagnerian who had lost his wife, Cosima, to Wagner, Bulow was a didactic disciplinarian with a streak of grandiose ostentation: during performances of Beethoven's ''Eroica'' Symphony, he would conduct with white gloves but change them to black for the funeral march. Bulow was not just a Germanic showboat, however; he has been credited with shaping our modern style of Beethoven interpretation, and he also championed the then-new symphonic works of Brahms. It is an instructive paradox of the Philharmonic's cooperative organization that it has always been willing to select stern podium dictators; the musicians' pride and desire for self-betterment has transcended any more comfortable inclinations. Bulow's death threw the orchestra into a dangerous interregnum - dangerous because at that point, the wrong choice as the successor might have deflected the still-young orchestra's evolution. Fortunately, Arthur Nikisch was prevailed upon to accept the post. Like his successor, Wilhelm Furtwangler, Nikisch was also conductor of the Gewandhaus, although by this time Berlin's place as the political and economic center of the new Germany had begun to cast Leipzig into the shadows. Nikisch, who led the Philharmonic for over a quarter of a century, was also on the podium for its first recording of a complete symphony - Beethoven's Fifth in 1913, and it is here that Deutsche Grammophon's 33-disk recorded history begins. The Nikisch Beethoven Fifth - one of three Beethoven Fifths in the collection - is a justifiably famous performance, balancing a freedom of pulse with a fine rigor of dramatic exposition. Unlike Bulow, Nikisch was an inspirational mesmerizer of both players and audiences. Other conductors in this historical album, the only one that can be wholeheartedly recommended, are Leo Blech, Bruno Walter (who had his own Philharmonic series in the 1920's), Hans Knappertsbusch, Erich Kleiber, Oscar Fried, Hans Pfitzner and Richard Strauss. Furtwangler, who led the Philharmonic from 1922 to 1954, combined Nikisch's inspirational fervor with a surer intellectual command of music. There are some incandescent performances in the Furtwangler box, including a Beethoven ''Egmont'' Overture recorded live only two days after the conductor's emotional reunion with the orchestra in 1947, when he was permitted to conduct it once again. But the fact remains that many of Furtwangler's greatest recordings were either on Electrola or with the Vienna Philharmonic, so that as a documentary of his achievements, or even of his achievements with this orchestra, the set falls short. Mr. Karajan has certainly preserved the orchestra's sound, and has energetically fostered the careers of young conductors and soloists. Unfortunately, his interpretive gifts in the late Romantic repertory are poorly documented in the two boxes that bear his name. There is a wonderfully pointed, brilliantly performed Mussorgsky-Ravel ''Pictures at an Exhibition'' from 1966. But much more here consists of merely dutiful music-making, lacking in interpretive vitality or communicable commitment. Conversely, there is no Karajan Wagner, Bruckner, Mahler, Sibelius or Shostakovich, and the entire series ends, inappropriately and unidiomatically, with a complete disk of Offenbach. The soloists and guest-conductors volumes include some stirring performances: a Beethoven ''Emperor'' Concerto from Wilhelm Kempff, Mstislav Rostropovich's Dvorak Cello Concerto, a Brahms Second Symphony from the young Claudio Abbado, Eugen Jochum's Bruckner Fourth and a superb Dvorak ''New World'' Symphony from Ferenc Fricsay, to name the best. But all of these are available individually at record stores. By now, the Philharmonic's days as a private venture are long past, with generous subsidies from both West Berlin and the federal government in Bonn. And for all the reservations some feel about Mr. Karajan's interpretations, the orchestra faces the future as one of the great instrumental ensembles of Western music. Mr. Karajan has not been in the best of health in recent years. But with his conductor competitions and his generosity toward talented younger maestros - Klaus Tennstedt, for instance, now records regularly with the Philharmonic - he would seem to be actively concerned with ensuring the Philharmonic's future. The orchestra has built a tradition of continuing excellence, and has survived all the turmoil that politics and war can bring. Even in a divided city and an unsure world, it is easy to imagine the musical community celebrating its bicentenary in 2082.

1230-> Cup Downhill Skiing Is Canceled by Blizzard
VAL D'ISERE, France, Dec. 11 -(AP) - The men's World Cup downhill ski race was canceled today after being postponed for three straight days because of a blizzard. Drifts of more than six feet piled up on some parts of the 3,400-yard long downhill course as a gale-force wind whipped up the nonstop snowfall. Visibility high on the Bellevarde Mountain was close to zero. The World Cup Organizing Committee decided to transfer the Val d'Isere downhill race to a ski meet scheduled next weekend at Val Gardena, Italy. Efforts will be made to run the scheduled giant slalom race in Val d'Isere on Sunday.

1232-> AROUND THE NATION; Chrysler Sets Deadline On Canadian Strike
Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, told the United Automobile Workers today that striking Canadian employees of the concern must be back at work by Dec. 13 or the company would recess contract talks in the United States and Canada until January. ''This means an agreement must be reached by early next week to allow time for ratification and for the employees to be back at work no later than the first shift on Monday, Dec. 13,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''After Dec. 13, it is inefficient to start up the Canadian plants only to shut them down for the Christmas holidays,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''That would jeopardize the high quality and productivity which have been achieved in our Canadian operations.'' Douglas A. Fraser, the union president, said, ''Perhaps this will serve both parties well, to have a pressure point.'' About 10,000 Canadians struck Chrysler Canada Ltd. on Nov. 5 after the company rejected the workers' demand for an immediate substantial pay increase. Chrysler workers in the United States rejected a tentative contract this fall, but they voted against a strike and in favor of resuming talks in January after negotiations broke off Oct. 18. However, 4,600 of the 43,200 Chrysler workers in the United States have been idled because of production cutbacks as a result of the Canadian strike.

1234-> METEORITE CRASHES INTO HOUSE IN CONNECTICUT
A six-pound meteorite about the size of a grapefruit hurtled out of the sky over Wethersfield, Conn., Monday night and tore through the roof of a house and its second- and first-floor ceilings. It crashed into the living room, and ricocheted through a doorway and into the dining room, where it came to rest at the end of a trail of plaster and splinters. ''We were in the family room, maybe about 15 feet from the living room, watching 'M*A*S*H' on television - it was about 9:20 - when we heard it,'' said Wanda Donahue, who was alone in her home with her husband at the time. ''I thought at first it was a picture falling off the wall, but then I thought, 'It's a bomb, an explosion.' But it was muffled.'' Neither Mrs. Donahue nor her husband, Robert, was injured. 'It's Wonderful, Just Beautiful' Yesterday, scientists from the Smithsonian Institution, Yale University and Trinity College went to Wethersfield, a suburb of 26,000 people just south of Hartford, to gaze at the black object and, finally, to pronounce it a genuine meteorite. ''It's wonderful, just beautiful,'' said Barbara Narendra of the Peabody Museum at Yale. ''It's a classic - the thin crust, the gray interior. If anything ever looked like a meteorite, this is it.'' The scientists were drawn because of the rarity of actually finding a meteorite. But they were especially intrigued that this was the second time in 11 years that one had crashed through the roof of a house in Wethersfield. ''Meteorites are always a dramatic occurrence,'' said Dr. Ursula Marvin, a geologist with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass., ''but to have two strike the same town is, well, almost incomprehensible.'' Some scientists on the scene yesterday had already dubbed the latest find ''Wethersfield 1982.'' The meteorite that rolled to a stop under the Donahues' dining room table in all probability came, Dr. Marvin said, from an asteroid belt - which she described as a ''sort of celestial rock garden'' - between Mars and Jupiter, more than 100 million kilometers away. Dr. Marvin said scientists estimated that about 500 meteorites a year survived passage through the atmosphere to land on earth, almost none of which are ever recovered. Until recently, in all of history only about 2,100 meteorites had been scientifically validated worldwide. One meteorite, however, may produce thousands of fragments. In recent years, however, the number of authenticated meteorites has been rising noticeably, Dr. Marvin said, because of explorations in the Antartic, where several have been found. ''Meteorites tell us about pressures, temperatures and the history of parts of the solar system,'' she said. ''They are a fascinating source of scientific knowledge about space.'' The Wethersfield police said yesterday that shortly before Mr. Donahue telephoned to say that there was a hole in his ceiling and that he thought there had been an explosion, there had been several calls about bright lights and explosions in the night sky. Dr. Marvin said such reports, which were also filed Monday night in parts of Massachusetts, were often indicative of celestial conditions that might accompany meteorites passing through the earth's atmosphere. The meteorite that crashed into another Wethersfield house 11 years ago - on April 8, 1971, about a mile from the Donahue home - was purchased for an undisclosed price and is now on display at the Smithsonian in Washington. Yesterday, the Smithsonian sent Dr. Roy S. Clark, its curator of meteorites, to Wethersfield to examine the new find and possibly seek to purchase it. Miss Narendra said the Peabody Museum was also interested in having the meteorite, which is about five inches in diameter, for its collection. Last evening, less than 24 hours after the meteorite landed, it was sent to a laboratory in Washington State for tests under the auspices of the Smithsonian. ''I know of no other meteorite that was sent as quickly to a laboratory after landing as this one, which makes it of immense scientific worth,'' said Charles R. Hammond, an adjunct professor of astronomy at Trinity College. Earlier in the day, it was at the Wethersfield police station. ''Its ultimate disposition,'' said Lieut. John Karangekis, ''is up to the family.'' And what will they do with it? ''We have no plans yet for it,'' Mrs. Donahue said. In the meantime, the Donahues are more concerned with the holes in their roof and ceilings. Mrs. Donahue said they had checked to see if their insurance covered such things as damage done by celestial rocks. Then she added with a chuckle, ''We're covered.''

1236-> ABOUT LONG ISLAND
WHAT do you do when there's nothing to do, you have had an at least trying week in the city, it's your day off on the Island and you don't want to do anything, and everywhere you go at home you keep meeting yourself coming through doors and around corners? And, most important, you are dedicatedly lazy? Or, as the great Durante put it, did you ever have the feeling that you wanted to go, but you wanted to stay, but you wanted to go? Just such a day arrived for me recently, and I put all those questions to the former Eileen Palmer. ''Well,'' she said, ''I'd say you had to do something about it.'' Oh, my. Sorry I'd asked. If opposites attract, we are a well-matched pair. She is a natural doer, not a do-nothing, like her husband. What would I be told? Clean all that junk out of the attic? The garage? Clean up my desk? Get busy? Horrors. But she didn't say anything like that. ''Feeling kind of lazy myself,'' she said. ''What I'd like to do is just get in the car and go.'' ''Where?'' ''Anywhere. Nowhere. Everywhere. There's a lot of Long Island I still haven't seen and a lot I'd like to see again.'' Hm. Not bad. ''But you don't like to drive,'' I said. A certain smile. Aha. A conspiracy was afoot. ''Oh, I don't have to, I've got a driver,'' she said, and took the keys to my car off the hook of the Dutch door that leads to our kitchen, and handed them to me, ''and I know your car has a full tank of gas and I've done the shopping and you've done the banking. Shall we?'' Why not? It had been too many years since we'd taken A Drive in the Country, indulged ourselves in that glorious, irresponsible feeling of losing a day, of wasting time. There was so much more country to see when we settled in our first Island home, in Hicksville, and to walk in. I wasn't sure it was possible to take A Drive in the Country anymore. Robert Moses' vision created all those parkways for city people to use for pleasure and recreation, and in no time at all they became Long Islanders' business travel routes. Then came William Levitt, who had different ideas about the Island's development. Many of the open fields of our early marriage have sprouted houses and children. But the hands of the two master builders did not reach everywhere. THe Island is too big. The North Shore, the Long Island of the 1930's movies, still has estates (albeit several are now museums), farms and pastures. Being dwellers of the far more cluttered South Shore, we naturally headed for the North Shore. At first we thought we'd visit museum-estates we had always passed up. But we had only $26 between us, and even though we had an inexpensive lunch in Huntington, it still halved our funds. The first discovery: If you're on such a meaningfully aimless journey, don't take a lot of money along. You'll spend less and discover more for almost nothing. We strolled the streets of Huntington. We found a store that sold dolls for prices that once bought automobiles. We discovered young men walking young dogs with the handles used by the blind, but these walkers were not blind, and they were watching and directing the dogs. They were training them. And then a really blind man, who knew the village's streets, came along with a student dog, making moves and giving directions, oral and by touch, that were far more expert than those of the sighted trainers. ''Something's coming back,'' the former E.P. said, watching this. ''We must be near the place where we got our dogs that day. Remember? When Tommy was building the model ship and he needed some gear they only sold in this part of the Island?'' ''I think I can find it,'' I said. We drove east from Huntington. At a bend in the road I stopped the car. ''About there,'' I said. ''I don't see the house,'' she said. That fall day a decade ago we had passed a falling-down old house with a sign on it: Shepherd puppies/Free! Our own dog had just been killed on the road. We adopted two balls of fur and four huge pleading eyes. A brother and sister of the litter. The female ran off somewhere when she was 3; the male is still with us. ''No house, no,'' I said. ''I guess it just fell all the way down. But look at those two big trees and the space between them.'' ''Yes, yes! That's the place,'' she said. Then she wanted to see the place, ''the one all green inside,'' she said, where we'd had lunch and watched boats in a harbor. I'd forgotten that, but it came back in a flash when I pulled off Fort Salonga Road and into Northport: Green Street, the restaurant with all the green plants, and its view of the harbor and distant Centerport. I remembered something else about Northport, stepping off one of its steep curbs without looking and breaking an ankle. Now I snugged the car's wheels up to the curb before we got out to walk. The Northport Historical Society had an exhibit of artifacts of the turn-of-the-century era when the village was a shipbuilding center. Quite a show, all for 50 cents apiece. One artifact was a wooden case with a handle sticking up out of it and a horn on its side. ''Fog Horn,'' the sign said. ''Crank the handle fast,'' a man said. The former Eileen Palmer did, it let out an enormous whonk and she let out an eek. She does not like sudden noises, not even if they were necessary once to save souls in treacherous waters. Farther east, we visited a couple we used to know. He and she had both had careers and had done well. They had to; they had many children. But now all the children were grown, and our friends had retired. They were our age, but they seemed older. We told them of our discoveries and they only nodded, offering no comment. We had nothing in common with them anymore. ''Please, please,'' the woman I married said as we drove away, ''don't ever retire?'' On 25A, a storm came up. I parked. On the right was the Sound, its gray waters roiled white by the storm. On the left was a pasture. We saw three sleek, slim-ankled horses huddling together. In memory, we saw something else - our eldest daughter, as a preteen-ager, winning prizes for her horsewomanship at a riding academy we had managed to afford. The academy has been replaced by homes. Well, more people need houses than horses need stables. We would have gone on and seen and lived and relived more, so much more, but the storm kept up. On our way home we bought dill and lemons - ''from Spain, look at the size!'' -and in Freeport, flounder for dinner. We agreed that we'd have to lose more days like that, that it hadn't been a waste of time at all, and how much time does anybody have in this life, anyway?

1237-> Market Place; Prospecting, After the Rally
THE strongest bull market in recent times has sent shares to such high levels that some investors fear there may be no major gains ahead. But other investors argue that the market was so depressed before the August rally that stock prices are simply catching up. Even with the impressive gains of the past three months, these optimists say, the 30 stocks of the Dow Jones industrial average are still only valued at close to stated book value. Howard Silverman, managing partner of Gruntal & Company, says that if the 30 Dow stocks were to be capitalized at 1.25 times their collective book values, the industrials average would reach 1,250. Nonetheless, after the impressive price gains since August, many are wondering where they should make their next investments. Gruntal says future gains will come from new ideas in technology, merchandising and services, and growth in these areas will far exceed growth of mature industrial companies. In a report to be released soon, Gruntal's research department singles out four companies it believes can provide unusually good returns for clients. Bolt, Beranek & Newman is an American Stock Exchange company that is highly regarded for computer technology research. It is now beginning to manufacture and market its own computer products, which permit computers of different manufacturers to interact. Revenues from manufacturing are minimal for this well-established company, but Gruntal estimates that Bolt, Beranek will achieve earnings of $1.35 a share in the fiscal year ending June 1983, up from 73 cents in the prior 12-month period. In the fiscal year 1984, Gruntal says, the company's earnings could rise to $2.30 a share from the successful penetration of commercial markets. As in any major new venture, Bolt, Beranek faces competition from a number of larger companies already established in this market. The shares, which traded as low as 10 earlier this year, closed yesterday at $31.375, for a lofty price/earnings ratio against the 1983 fiscal estimate. Another Gruntal pick is Pope, Evans & Robbins, an Amex company that produces military uniforms from tough new forms of fibers. The company buys fibers such as Nomex, which is highly flame resistant, and Kevlar, a fiber that is woven into other materials to make the cloth ''stronger than steel.'' The company's fire- and ballistic-resistant uniforms are already in use worldwide. Pope, Evans earned only 15 cents a share in the fiscal year ended June 1980. But earnings rose to $1.12 a share in the fiscal year 1981 and to $1.90 a share in the fiscal year 1982, and Gruntal looks for $2.40 a share in the fiscal year 1983. The shares, which traded as low as 8 this year, closed yesterday at $16.50. R.P.M. Inc., an over-the-counter company, manufactures a broad range of coatings for the housing and other markets. The company has developed and is marketing a single-ply roofing product for industrial and commercial use that Gruntal analysts believe will provide sales growth of 40 percent annually for several years. The material lasts so long, Gruntal maintains, that it is cheaper on a long-term basis than competing roofing materials. Since 1975, this material, which is also marketed by some R.P.M. competitors, has captured a 16 percent share of the replacement and new roofing markets, up from 1 percent. For the fiscal year ending May 31, 1983, R.P.M. profits could rise to $1.40 a share from $1.16 a share in the prior fiscal year. Translux, Gruntal's fourth new favorite, created ''The New York Experience,'' a critically acclaimed audio-visual theater presentation on the history of New York City. The company, which is listed on the Amex, is now working on a new production designed to simulate interplanetary travel. The first of the theaters to present this feature is to be built in New York City and Translux hopes to franchise as many as 20 units within two years. Revenues from these extravaganzas complement Translux's basic communications business, which includes electronic printers for Western Union, telex and stock quotation equipment. The Gruntal analysts believe Translux can earn $1.40 a share in 1982, up from $1.27 in the calendar year 1981. They expect a modest increase in 1983, but believe earnings by the end of 1983 could be running at an annual rate of $2 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $14.50.

1238-> RICHMOND TO PAY WALCO $425,000 IN S.E.C. CASE
Former Representative Frederick W. Richmond agreed today to pay $425,000 to a company he founded to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that he had violated Federal securities laws. In a long complaint filed today, the agency charged that Mr. Richmond had improperly exercised secret control of the Walco National Corporation after he asserted that he had retired. While many of the allegations outlined in today's action are not new -some were part of an earlier Federal grand jury investigation - the complaint does offer a mass of details supporting the charge that Mr. Richmond completely dominated the company's operations while serving in Washington. Mr. Richmond formally resigned as the company's chairman after his election to Congress in 1974, and in subsequent years also resigned as its president and as a director, Mr. Richmond, without admitting or denying guilt, agreed among other things, to reimburse Walco $425,000 for previously secret perquisites received since 1979. The agreement also forces Mr. Richmond to release Walco from the balance of a 10-year, $100,000-ayear pension agreement. Walco also agreed to appoint two independent members to its board of directors to review future contacts with Mr. Richmond. Mr. Richmond, a four-term Democrat from Brooklyn, resigned from the House of Representatives in August after pleading guilty to tax evasion, marijuana possession and making an illegal payment to a Government employee who helped provide contracts for the former Brooklyn Navy Yard. The S.E.C. case was not part of that proceeding. Walco, a machinery manufacturing concern formed by Mr. Richmond in 1960, has been embroiled in several bitter takeover fights that have left a trail of critics. Since the mid-1970's, Walco has bought and sold back stock in a number of companies - many of which have said they did not want to be associated with Walco. Today's S.E.C. action was the first that formally accused Mr. Richmond, who holds about 43 percent of Walco's stock, of directing the company's acquisition tactics. The commission's complaint, filed in Federal district court here, charges that Mr. Richmond and the company feigned his 1974 retirement. It was understood, the complaint says, that Mr. Richmond ''would retain virtually the same duties and responsibilities as prior to his 'resignation.' '' In particular, the complaint says, Mr. Richmond ''continued to chair Walco board meetings, continued to select investment and acquisition targets, continued to represent Walco in negotiations with acquisition targets and continued to receive undisclosed personal benefits from Walco.'' According to the complaint, among the perquisites that Mr. Richmond enjoyed after his resignation ''was an automobile and chauffeur, use of the company's facilities and personnel at no cost, and charitable contributions made to organizations that were intended solely to benefit Mr. Richmond.'' The complaint said Walco paid 90 percent of the expenses of his coop apartment at 25 Sutton Place, including ''a live-in housekeeper, luxury furnishings, repairs, telephone systems and daily items such as groceries, laundry and tipping the doorman.'' Walco, whose shares are now traded on the American Stock exchange, merged in 1969 with the National Casket Company, the second-largest manufacturer of coffins. Soon afterward, the new company acquired Federal Forge Inc., a producer of steel forgings for the automotive and farm equipment industries. Since then, the company has grown rapidly by acquiring small manufacturing companies and buying substantial holdings in companies for investment.

1240-> STAGE: 'FABULOUS 50s,' CLAUDE MCNEAL MUSICAL
Popular music of the 1950's - the fading of the traditional pop styles of the 30's and 40's during the first half of the decade and the doo-wop singing and Elvis-rock that colored the last half - is a rather slight and deceptive subject for parody or satire. The songs and vocal styles were often so ridiculous in themselves that there is little left for the parodist or satirist to add. Claude McNeal and Arthur Howard, who, respectively, wrote and directed ''The Fabulous 50's,'' a musical at the No Smoking Playhouse, have taken different approaches to the two halves of the decade. The first half is set in a television studio where something very close to ''Your Hit Parade'' is on the air. The songs - ''Mr. Sandman,' ''Volare'' and ''If'' - are sung fairly straight and very capably. The comedy comes from the fact that the television camera concentrates on close-ups of singers and announcers while just beyond the eye of the camera a frantic director is feeding lines and props to the singers, getting from one side of the studio to the other by crawling under the camera and coping with physical and emotional problems. The do-wop and Elvis period moves to a high school gym, where a radio disk jockey is broadcasting a hop with such live entertainment as Frankie and the Fabrications, the Taffetas, the King of the Cowboys and his Consort, and a deaf singer who weeps his songs. The television segment is a fast-moving series of crisp images propelled by Ray Horvath's busily slapstick projection of the director and a steady flow of cameo characterizations. When ''The Fabulous 50's'' moves to the gym, it gets into territory already staked out by ''Grease'' and has relatively little of its own to add. Mr. Horvath's hip-talking disk jockey is a much thinner conception than his television director and the focus turns to the singers and the songs. This gives Scott Robertson a chance to show off his high lead voice, to become a gently agonizing Johnny Ray and a sentimental Roy Rogers. Angeles Echols, who spends most of the evening in secondary parts, gives the one show-stopping individual performance, building a song from an opening rap to a gospel fervor. Mr. McNeal and Mr. Howard have wound up with a show with a split personality - half Marx Brothers comedy, half period nostalgia that seems a letdown after the momentum established by the early segment. The Cast THE FABULOUS 50'S, by Claude McNeal; di- rected by Arthur Howard; musical direction and arrangements by Rick Lewis; choreography by Patty Quinn; sets by Pamela Garrett; lighting by Jamie Gallagher; costumes by George Vallo; sound by Buzz Turner; production stage man- ager, Rodd Berro; hair and wig design by Daniel Paul Platten.

1241-> CARROLL'S CURIOUS KIN
To the Editor: It was good to learn from The Times of Dec. 18 that in the 150th anniversary year of his birth Lewis Carroll was honored by a plaque in the Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. It is curious that the recognition should come so late. But perhaps even curiouser is the article's reference to ''the poet's 5- and 7-year-old great-granddaughters,'' said to have attended the unveiling of the plaque and to have laid posies on it. Those of us who caught Carroll's obituary in The Times of Jan. 16, 1898, recall the statement in it that ''(Carroll) had no children of his own, having never married.'' THOMAS O. JONES, Rockville, Md., Dec. 19, 1982

1242-> 76ers 128, Pistons 111
PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Julius Erving scored a season-high 44 points as Philadelphia posted its 19th straight over Detroit at the Spectrum, where the Pistons last won on Nov. 2, 1974. Philadelphia, which had suffered a 123-97 Atlantic Division loss to the Boston Celtics Friday night, raised its record to 18-4. Detroit lost its fourth straight. Erving's 44 points, just one short of his N.B.A. career high, included 16 in the first quarter. Maurice Cheeks added 20 for the 76ers. Phil Laimbeer was high for Detroit with 20 points and Vinnie Johnson followed with 19.

1243-> DEFENSE TAKES 2 APPROACHES IN BRINK'S CASE
In five weeks of pretrial hearings into last October's $1.6 million Brink's robbery and triple slaying, two distinct themes have emerged from the defense team for Kathy Boudin as it confronts eyewitnesses against her. Most recently, Miss Boudin's lawyers, Martin Garbus and Leonard J. Weinglass, have started building an argument that a key witness really did not see her. Earlier, they had all but conceded her presence at a police roadblock where two officers were killed by automatic-weapons fire. But the lawyers argued she had nothing to do with the murders. That contention came after two police officers who survived the shootout testified that Miss Boudin emerged from the cab of a rented truck seconds before gunmen emerged from the rear of it. Both officers said Miss Boudin was unarmed, appeared frightened by police weapons, and had her hands raised as she walked toward two police officers who were later shot and killed. New Approach Taken Mr. Weinglass and Mr. Garbus used those descriptions to argue that Miss Boudin was a captive - ''in custody,'' as they put it - and not a willing participant in the shootout. They also established that she was in the line of fire. Mr. Weinglass and Mr. Garbus have lately been taking a new approach. Now they are concentrating on undermining the credibility of one of the prosecutor's main witnesses - a middle-age woman who testified this week that she saw the ''entire'' shootout from the front seat of her car. Her car was pinned 20 yards from the scene, she said, by the rented truck in front and a parked car in the rear. The woman, the fourth prosecution witness allowed to testify anonymously because of self-professed fears, testified confidently, and asserted twice that she was ''very visual.'' Her account of Miss Boudin's actions before the gunfire differed from those of the surviving police officers. It was damaging to the defense, and the lawyers began to attack her ability to recall the incident. The woman said she never saw Miss Boudin's hands raised, and saw no police weapons. She described Miss Boudin as ''frantic,'' and said Miss Boudin was looking side to side and ''moving in very quick movements,'' before she ''darted'' away as the shooting started. The woman said she herself became ''terrified'' and ''frantic.'' She said she had seen Officer Waverly Brown's body ''convulse'' as he fell mortally wounded. She and her elderly mother were forced from their car by a gunman with a submachine gun, she testified. As the gunman sped away in her car, the woman said, her elderly mother was ''in a state of shock'' on the roadway, and the woman was on her hands and knees rolling her mother off the pavement and expecting to ''see her full of bullet holes.'' Attack on Memory After the woman's graphic testimony, Mr. Weinglass and Mr. Garbus called several investigating officers to the stand. The lawyers sought to establish that the woman was so traumatized by her experience that it affected her memory, and that she may have mistaken Miss Boudin for another female defendant in the robbery and killings, Judith A. Clark. The woman was suffering, the lawyers said, from ''retrograde amnesia.'' Such victims, Mr. Garbus said, block out particular elements and afterward, in calmer moments, reconstruct events incorrectly. By week's end, the two lawyers were seeking to prove that the woman saw Miss Boudin and Miss Clark together in captivity at the Nyack police station, confused the two, and in subsequent recollections of the shootout placed Miss Boudin where Miss Clark had actually been. As yet, Miss Boudin's lawyers have done little to undercut another important prosecution witness, Michael Koch. He is a New York City correction officer who captured Miss Boudin as she fled from the scene of the shooting, and who testified she said, ''I didn't shoot him, he did.'' In these hearings, which began Sept. 13, Kenneth Gribetz, the Rockland County District Attorney, must produce all witnesses to the crime. The defense looks for inconsistencies or for mistakes in procedure that could make the testimony inadmissible. Lawyer Seeks Discrepancies For instance, drawing out eyewitness discrepancies has been the main approach of Evelyn Williams, lawyer for another defendant, Samuel Brown. Mr. Gribetz has not been forced to call all his eyewitnesses now because four defendants - Nathaniel Burns, David Gilbert, Miss Clark and Donald Weems - and their lawyers voluntarily left the hearings on Sept. 28. Miss Boudin and Mr. Brown did not join their protest.

1245-> STAGE VIEW; THE SPECTACLE OF 'CATS,'OR INFLATION BEYOND REASON
Imust say that those cats at the Winter Garden are making a spectacle of themselves. Indeed, it's the very best thing the sleekly coated creatures are prepared to do. We weren't precisely surprised, as we walked into the theater that had been extensively renovated as a resting-place for Andrew Lloyd Webber's fresh-from-London ''Cats,'' to note that the space once called a ''stage'' now spilled over its strangely missing apron to crawl upward and outward over the auditorium's balcony, boxes and even its celestial ceiling. We'd read about the rubbish heap that John Napier was designing to accommodate the prowling and the prancing of some 26 felines whose undulating tails and tigerishly striped legs Mr. Napier had also spent nights dreaming about. Yup, there it was, a somehow pinkish and prettified pileup of derelict automobiles, discarded copies of The New Yorker, overstretched bras (I think) and emptied-out cartons of Cat Chow. Just about as we'd imagined it, except for one thing. Its scale. Mr. Napier had made everything oversized, but not too oversized, not as though inanimate objects could ever overwhelm, or even intimidate, the animal kingdom of T.S. Eliot (whose ''Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats'' was providing the evening with its libretto). As we worked our way to our seats, we realized - with a small jolt of surprise - that while a curled-up cat may be no larger than an abandoned hi-fi record, it has legs to leap with and eyes that probably can see more than we suspect. This proportion was right and we knew it before we'd been seated. With the first big-city clang from Mr. Webber's hidden 25-piece orchestra, it was clear that the spectacle we were in for was going to be a no-nonsense uprush. We did not go gentle into the back-alley night. Instead of a gradual musical build and a slow fade-in under a muddy moon, we were hit between the eyeballs with eyeballs, what seemed hundreds of pairs of them - green and blinking at us. (Later, cats would brush by us in the dark of the aisles, pausing to glare electronically into our own no doubt enlarged pupils.) On stage, the blackness was now being stabbed by the knifelike thrust of strobe lights, and we were beginning to see haunches hoisting themselves and tails uncoiling as the neighborhood stirred. And then, in overhead patterns of frozen forked lightning, thousands of miniature Christmas-tree lamps staggered on, seeming to make more noise than the accelerating orchestra as the massed chorus of cats began its evening bustle. At this juncture a man might well have been forgiven for remembering the first time he'd strayed into Mama Leone's just before Mardi Gras. What else was happening at the Winter Garden? Oh, quite a lot, taking the occasion as a whole. A sizable circle of blue and white lights that had been biding its time at center stage on the floor slowly began to rise to the heavens, trailing smoke. (Quite a long while after, a rope would slither down from its center, followed immediately by a most athletic cat.) As velvety cats, scruffy cats, spiky cats and all kinds of cats (in quite stunning outfits) sang of their pride in belonging to the Jellicle breed and issued invitations to the coming Jellicle Ball, a properly oversized shoe was hurled into their midst from some human giant (unseen, of course) in a window above. A locomotive spouting puffs of steam was put together on the spot for a railroad cat named Skimbleshanks (Reed Jones). A Rumpus Cat (Kenneth Ard) boasted fireball eyes that blazed and simmered ferociously. A chorus line was so artfully lighted by electrician David Hersey that, as it kick-stepped its way backward into a sky of trailing clouds, it seemed literally to melt into space. A very vigorous cat named Rum Tum Tugger (Terrence V. Mann) kicked a hole in the sky in his eagerness to get into the act, then calmed down sufficiently to bestow a benevolent kiss on the bald spot of a gentleman in the audience. At the end of the evening a Godlike cat named Old Deuteronomy (Ken Page) escorted a down-at-paw whore-cat named Grizabella (Betty Buckley) onto a spaceship fashioned from an automobile tire and into the so-called Heaviside Layer (heaven, in case you're not a cat). The ceiling of the Winter Garden opened to send a traveling staircase to meet her. And I haven't even mentioned the two music-hall turns that appeal to me most. When an Old Gumbie cat (Anna McNeely) tossed off her shaggy and bedraggled accumulation of fat and fur to reveal herself as one Jennyanydots in orange-and-white layers of vaudeville fringe and smilingly elected to lead the chorus in a tap routine that seemed to ripple a little sideways (the effect didn't exactly arrive at counterpoint but you could hear the cleated feet nudging each other to move over a bit), I was charmed. And I found myself amused by the mock-operetta performed in a 19th-century toy theater while the principal singers (Stephen Hanan, Bonnie Simmons) were being surrounded by enemy sanpans and Mongol pirates wearing those templecut headdresses. (I'm sure I don't know what these last two items have to do with T.S. Eliot or, for that matter, with cats, but they provided moments of pleasant relaxation for me.) In exchange for the price of a ticket, you will get all of the colorful extravagances I've mentioned, and more. You will also get tired. There is a reason for this. Confronted with so much bigness, so much busyness, such a massive sweeping of sounds and bodies from the back stage wall to the lobby doors, we begin to listen very, very hard to the Eliot lyrics (with some alterations by director Trevor Nunn) to see what there is in them to justify such massive illustration, such elaborate fantastification. And, no matter how fiercely we listen, we can't find it. The connection is just not there. Mr. Napier may have got his proportions right in designing human shoes from a cat's-eye view, but there is a staggering disproportion here - between the ballooning-out of the effects on stage and the simple lines that have supposedly begat them. So great a disproportion that our well-intentioned efforts to resolve it, and our failure to do so, wear us down. I don't think it matters much whether you are a fan of ''Old Possum's Book'' or not. It's not a question of resenting liberties taken. (I am less than passionate about the little volume myself, though it is quite understandable that so important a poet might have wished to leave behind him something in the slight, graceful and witty manner of Edward Lear, Lewis Carroll or Hilaire Belloc. For me, even his cats' names are a bit forced; the whimsical sits indifferently on his shoulders. It is possible that this particular poet was too tall to stoop.) But never mind that. The point is that the verses are small, casual, almost studiously offhand and unburdened with moral weight. To blow them up to the size of figures in a Macy's parade is to inflate them beyond all reason, beyond such meaning as they possess. The strain after a false significance puts us under a strain as well, the strain - and it is a futile one -of trying to make verses and visuals (together with music) match. Mr. Webber's score is, or could be, fun, cheerfully helping itself as it does to any style that comes quickly to hand: Puccini, burlesque-strip rhythm (''Macavity''), bagpipe marches, not-too-hardrock for the Rum Tum Tugger, a hymn in praise of Jellicles that seems to belong somewhere between ''Louisiana Gals, Are You Comin' Out Tonight?'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band.'' Now that we don't know precisely where we're at in pop music, why not ride the range? But when you hear the composer begin to huff and puff in an effort to expand Deuteronomy's godliness (there is none in the lines, it must be done through scoring alone), you sense men at work, not at play. And when the same Deuteronomy escorts his cat-saint up, up, up toward the escape-hatch in the roof, the musicians can thank God (the other one) for amplification. Without it, they'd burst. Director Nunn is put under the same severe pressure. Back walls must unfold like the drawbridges of castles, groundsmoke must accompany each orbital trip, the strobes and the lightning-strings must repeat their interruptive flashes again and again, and the cat on the flying trapeze must take off meantime. The business of assembling a locomotive with real wheels isn't anywhere near as effective (or honestly imaginative) as Mr. Nunn's putting a stagecoach together, in his mounting of ''Nicholas Nickleby,'' out of no more than the passengers and their luggage. But, you see, he is forced to repeat and enlarge at any cost, because his source-book demands so little. Gillian Lynne's choreography suffers as well from the need to do, do, do again what she's done, done, done before. The first cat to arch its back or stretch its belly along the floor is charming; the 65th needs a brand new repertoire. Cats may have nine lives; but they don't really seem overendowed with dance-steps. In the end, as the whore who has sung ''Memory'' (already a hit song) alone under a cloud-streaked moon makes her perilous ascent to the machinery above, we have a strong feeling that scarcely a physical device used in ''Jesus Christ Superstar,'' and possibly in ''Via Galactica'' as well, has been omitted. Everything's been more smoothly managed here, and there are genuinely engaging moments; the directorial hand is quite steady. But more and more, and perhaps most obviously in ''Cats,'' we are making our theatrical mountains out of less and less solid rock.

1246-> OBSERVER; LOCKING UP TIGHT
For five weeks I traveled across beautiful autumnal America. It was like a booby hatch of the criminally insane. In Detroit they were finding razor blades in hot dogs sold at the grocery. In California somebody had laced eyewash with corrosive chemicals. In Chicago, capsules sold as headache remedies came packed with cyanide. In New York and its suburbs, not to be outdone, people spent the weekend inserting needles and pins into candy they planned to give children on Halloween. At various stops along the route there were campaigning politicians clamoring for use of the electric chair, the gallows or the gas chamber as devices for restoring public civility. Everywhere one was confronted with what seemed like a national obsession for more and more security. Nowhere was this more chillingly apparent than in Beverly Hills, whose sumptuous houses must contain vast riches. Every other house, it seemed, bore a large placard announcing the identity of its private security guard service, and most of these carried a supplemental placard that said, ''Armed Response.'' Those hundreds of ''Armed Response'' warnings on house after house quickly dampen the enthusiasm for a brisk walk on a soft sun-drenched morning. You are suddenly aware that you are the only person on foot for blocks around. Quite possibly a suspicious character. You move very carefully after that. ''Armed Response.'' And head swiftly back to your hotel. There, obeying firmly stated instructions, you lock, bolt and chain the door. The hotel management still declines to guarantee the safety of your wallet, however, unless you have surrendered it downstairs for safekeeping in the hotel vault. The ''security'' proliferation is apparent everywhere. Armed guards in uniform patrol drugstores and bookshops. And at every airport, of course, there is the inevitable X-ray examination of luggage and personal scrutiny by the metal detector to remind you that airplanes attract maniacs, desperadoes and glory-drunk terrorists as irresistibly as the candle lures the moth. Very little of this ''security'' existed in the country 20 years ago, but now it is a national passion. The irony is that the more ''security'' we buy, the less secure we are. If the airport X-ray and the metal detector and the cop with the big gun on his hip discourage assaults on airplanes, the criminal and the lunatic divert their energies to the supermarket where they can poison the headache powders or tuck razor blades into the hot dogs. The invariable response to such threats is always more ''security,'' but how can we secure the supermarket? By frisking customers at the door? By posting a cop in every aisle? Maybe by abolishing the supermarket and returning to old-fashioned over-thecounter selling in which only clerks - thoroughly investigated by security experts - have access to the goods. And what about the Halloween candy? A metal detector for every 5-year-old trick-or-treater? What's alarming here is that we all live by the faith that insanity will not prevail. This is the faith that makes it possible for us to go optimistically about our business in the thermonuclear world. And yet, in this proliferation of ''security'' we are steadily losing the ease and openness of our society to the tyranny of a minority that is beyond the reach of reason. I was struck by the sense of encroaching madness while sitting behind triple-locked doors in hotels in Chicago and Detroit watching Charlton Heston and Paul Newman debate national nuclear policy on two successive midnight television shows. They were arguing about the nuclear freeze. Newman was for it, Heston against, and though both seemed like sensible men, you could not help wondering why this vital debate about an issue of transcending importance should be left to two movie actors. When slavery was the great issue, we had Lincoln debating Douglas. Now when the issue was the survival of humanity, we were down to Newman debating Heston. There's no mystery about why television prefers Paul Newman and Charlton Heston to more profound thinkers. As stars with faces we love to love, they were men whom Americans would sit up past midnight to watch. Those television folks understand us all too well. Triplelocked into our secure cocoons at midnight, it's entertainment we crave to keep our minds off all the insecurity lurking outside the door. What Newman and Heston were debating, of course, was whether the entire world has put itself in jeopardy by striving for more and more security built on atomic arsenals. In so many other matters, more security had turned out to be less. It seems a good question for good people to debate, but in a world like this there's no audience for Lincoln and Douglas.

1248-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; The Tight Legal Market
When Joseph Tock, a third-year student at the St. John's University Law School, walked into the Bronx District Attorney's office last week for his second job interview, his heart sank. ''There were 45 people in the waiting room,'' he said. ''Honestly, it seemed like a cattle car.'' In a glutted New York market of lawyers, thousands of new practitioners are flooding district attorneys' offices with resumes. Edward McCarthy, a spokesman for Mario Merola, the Bronx District Attorney, said that perhaps 2,000 people would be interviewed by April for 30 openings. A parallel situation was reported by Elizabeth Holtzman's Brooklyn office. Mr. McCarthy attributed the inundation to the peculiarities of his borough. ''If you want to be a lawyer,'' he said, ''the Bronx is the best place to learn. We get every kind of crazy case in the world. If you can survive here, you can survive anywhere.'' But William Miller, who is running the recruitment program for Miss Holtzman, pointed out one way in which Brooklyn is slightly more attractive. Salaries are set at the discretion of each district attorney, and in Brooklyn, the starting pay is $22,000. It's $21,000 in the Bronx.

1249-> AROUND THE WORLD; Mugabe Asks U.S. Help Against South Africa
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe told Vice President Bush here today that the Reagan Administration should ''side with Africa'' on the issue of Namibian independence. His appeal came in a speech at a dinner in honor of the Vice President, who had flown from Moscow, where he headed the American delegation to the funeral of Leonid I. Brezhnev. The Prime Minister was never directly critical of the Administration's policy of ''constructive engagement'' with South Africa or its concentration on the question of getting the Cubans out of Angola. But he described the Cuban issue, which Washington has presented as a key to a Namibian solution, as ''an extraneous precondition.''

1250-> KEY FIGURE IN SPIES' EXPOSURE NOW WRITES HIS SIDE OF STORY
By his own account, Michael Whitney Straight always wanted to be a kind of political knight-errant. Certainly he had the means to do so: inherited money, a superb education and friends in high places here and abroad. Yet, 20 months ago, Mr. Straight was suddenly depicted as a onetime Communist conspirator turned informer who became the instrument that cracked open top-level Soviet espionage in Britain. He is now sorting out the consequences of that disclosure in the quietude of his suburban manor in a memoir, ''After Long Silence,'' which is actually an autobiography. It is to be published in the spring. In the wake of months of accusations in newspapers, magazines and books, Mr. Straight's manuscript is an effort to give his own version - with a number of previously unpublished details - of a life divided between the highly public and the very clandestine that has lately subjected him to painful attention in the press, especially in England. Invitation to a Student Briefly, as related in the book manuscript and elaborated on in an interview, he was a student Communist at Trinity College, Cambridge, who was invited in 1937 by Anthony Blunt, then a young don, to become a Soviet agent in the United States. Mr. Straight did not say no, although he declined the Soviet assignment to enter a Wall Street investment firm. Instead he came to Washington, where, from 1938 to 1942, he periodically met a Soviet agent he knew only as Michael Green. Mr. Straight was desultorily employed in those years at the State Department, Interior Department and as a speechwriter for President Roosevelt. He had no access to classified documents, but he did provide Mr. Green with his own analyses of political and economic developments here. The meetings with Mr. Green seem in retrospect to have been relatively harmless. However, when he was offered a post in the Kennedy Administration, Mr. Straight, haunted for 26 years by his compact with Mr. Blunt, confessed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The F.B.I. was not much interested in his contacts with Michael Green. What caught the attention of the bureau's counterintelligence chief was Mr. Straight's account of how he had come to be a Communist at Cambridge, his recruitment and his acquaintance with Guy Burgess, a Communist mole in the British Foreign Service who escaped to Moscow in 1953. Anthony Blunt, after all, had held a senior British intelligence post in World War II. First Evidence of Treachery After interrogation in London, the British told Mr. Straight that his story was the first substantive evidence of the treachery of Mr. Blunt, who was by this time a member of the royal household. Mr. Blunt confessed. Mr. Straight's revelation also led to the implication of other Soviet moles in Britain: Leo Long, another Cambridge Communist who made his way into the intelligence service; Guy Burgess, already long gone, and, ultimately, Sir Roger Hollis, director of MI5, the counterespionage service. It is a tale that makes John Le Carre's oeuvre of treachery look more like fact than fiction. One of Mr. Straight's central problems was his attitude toward loyalty. Referring to his brother, he wrote: ''I had no sense at all that Whitney had acted disloyally in becoming a British citizen, or that I owed any loyalty to the United States.'' This was, he writes, perhaps the outcome of having been taken at the age of 9 to live in England, where he was enrolled in a zanily progressive school run by his mother and stepfather. He could be loyal to causes, but not to nations. Mr. Straight remembers his days of commitment to communism as anything but a matter of dreary discipline or strict cadre work. Rather it was more like an extended college bull session, the Communist cell convening openly in his rooms at Trinity. Of his green party card he says: ''I threw mine away. I thought it was stupid.'' Finding the Courage to Confess A later problem was how to screw up the courage after the war to admit what he had been and done. ''I knew by 1946 what I had to do, but the only question was what I was going to do about it,'' he said, sipping tea. ''I started to go to the British,'' he said of a moment in the Korean War after he suddenly encountered Guy Burgess on Massachusetts Avenue and realized he was spying for the Russians under the cover of a British Embassy post. ''I started to go to the C.I.A.,'' he added. ''It was like standing three feet away from a fire in which somebody is burning.'' He went to lunch with his first cousin, Tracy Barnes, who was deputy director of the agency. ''Please ask me questions about Cambridge,'' he recalls saying. ''It doesn't interest me,'' his cousin replied. As Mr. Straight writes: ''I needed one beckoning word or gesture to lead me on. Without it I lacked the resolution to carry out my impulse.'' So it was not until 1963, when he was offered a post as an adviser on the arts and humanities in the Kennedy Administration, that Mr. Straight felt a sufficient gesture was at hand. Sensing that if he took the job his past might be exposed, he told his story to Arthur Schlesinger Jr. at the White House, then went to the F.B.I. Still Bears the Stigma He thinks he still bears the stigma of ''an informer,'' he says, but he heatedly rejects suggestions that he was a ''traitor,'' ''spy,'' or ''Soviet agent.'' Much of his book is set in Washington, as Mr. Straight moved from his awkward restaurant meetings with Mr. Green to White House dinners with the Roosevelts and the easy company of the young New Dealers, then, in the late 1940's as the editor of The New Republic, to the wrathful days of Senator Joseph McCarthy. His boast is that, after shedding his Communist affiliations, ''I remained a political liberal.'' Having published several novels and a play, Mr. Straight says that ''After Long Silence'' is mainly an effort ''to explain myself to my children and grandchildren.''

1251-> A Real Election for Manhattan Judges
Because Democratic apparatchiks failed in their simplest task - filing candidates' names on time with the Board of Elections - Manhattan will have a unique experience on Tuesday: an election for Justices of the State Supreme Court actually decided by the voters. The Democratic column, which usually guarantees victory in these races, will be vacant on the Manhattan ballot. This is an undeserved disaster for two of the candidates chosen at the Democratic convention but now off the ballot; it is hazardous for some Democrats who survive on the ballot only with Republican or Liberal endorsements. But it creates an opportunity for aspirants who would not have had a chance in an election determined by party column voting. All 14 candidates for 10 posts on the state's main trial court are qualified. We recommend retention of five incumbents seeking second 14-year terms. All appear on both the Republican and Liberal lines: Edward Greenfield, Arnold Fraiman, James Leff, Jawn Sandifer and Amos Bowman. Next, we favor the three other innocent victims of the Democratic default, all only on the Liberal line: Felice Shea, a highly competent Civil Court judge; Carmen Ciparik, an able Criminal Court judge, and Bruce Wright, also of the Civil Court. That leaves two positions for six qualified aspirants. Harold Baer Jr., a successful Manhattan lawyer and bar leader, should get one of them. He entered the judicial sweepstakes only after the Liberal Party replaced him with Al Del Bello as running mate for Mario Cuomo. But Mr. Baer now seems a serious candidate and his professional standing would be a major asset for the court. For the final slot we favor Civil Court Judge Shirley Levittan (Republican line only), though Court of Claims Judge Rose Rubin (Republican and Liberal lines) is a strong runner-up. If Judge Levittan wins, we hope Governor Carey will reappoint Judge Rubin to the Court of Claims so that she can continue to serve the Supreme Court as an Acting Justice. More than ever, the fiasco makes clear that New York needs a system of merit appointment for judges, with election reserved for retention or removal of those already on the bench. Most other races in Manhattan and the other boroughs are the foregone conclusions party chieftains desire. We are pleased that one shoo-in is Renee Roth, winner of a hotly contested Democratic primary, for Manhattan Surrogate.

1252-> Unharvested Cabbage And the Needy
''Cabbage Left Unharvested,'' proclaimed a recent headline in the Long Island Weekly section. To a nonfarmer, such a situation came as something of a shock. At a time when the ranks of the needy are increasing, however, food is especially precious. Would it not be feasible for one or more of Long Island's charities to muster able-bodied unemployed people to harvest at least a part of an unwanted crop? Although not a particular favorite of mine, this vegetable unquestionably is nourishing both in its natural state (for salad) and cooked (as a soup). Permitted simply to rot on the ground each year, perhaps the crop enriches the soil, but surely it's more important that it help fill the stomaches of the hungry. Volunteer harvesters under charitable auspices could be the solution to the problem of using nature's bounty to good purpose. The article mentioned harvests ''as late as January,'' depending on weather conditions, so it appears that the current crop is still not beyond being salvaged. THOMAS G. MORGANSEN, Jackson Heights

1254-> 3 AMERICANS FREED BY ANGOLA
Three Americans who had been held prisoner in Angola arrived in Lusaka today in a Red Cross plane as part of a complex exchange for three Soviet military men and 94 Angolan soldiers. The Americans were then flown to Paris. Two of the Americans, Gary Acker, 28 years old, of Sacramento, Calif., and Gustavo Grillo, 36, of Jersey City, were mercenaries captured in the 1975-76 Angolan civil war. The third, Geoffrey Tyler, 32, of Lakeland, Fla., was a pilot seized in 1981 after making a forced landing in Angola while delivering a light plane to a customer. They were exchanged for two Soviet airmen captured by Angolan guerrillas, and a Soviet sergeant major and Angolan soldiers captured by South Africa during operations in southern Angola against guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization. Informed sources said Angola also returned the bodies of two South African soldiers killed in raids into southern Angola, and South Africa delivered the bodies of nine Angolan soldiers and a Cuban soldier captured by South African forces in southern Angola. The Americans flew here from Luanda, the Angolan capital, this afternoon on a Red Cross plane. The Soviet and Angolan soldiers were flown here from Mariental, South-West Africa, in an Air Botswana cargo plane chartered to the Red Cross. After the signing of the exchange documents by Soviet and American officials, the three Americans were put aboard a commercial flight to Paris. The Angolans boarded a Red Cross plane tonight for Luanda. A seven-member Soviet delegation gave the Soviet soldiers a hearty welcome on the tarmac. They were then taken to the Soviet Embassy in Lusaka. In Washington, State Department officials said negotiations began in August 1981.

1255-> O'NEILL BEATS ROME IN CONNECTICUT RACE FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP
Two incumbents, Gov. William A. O'Neill, a Democrat, and Senator Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a maverick Republican, won election yesterday in Connecticut. Mr. O'Neill, who became Governor 22 months ago when Ella T. Grasso resigned because of failing health, scored an easy victory over his Republican challenger, Lewis B. Rome, to win a full, four-year term in his own right. Mr. Weicker won a third term by a narrow margin over Representative Toby Moffett, a liberal Democrat who has served four terms in Congress. With 726 of 737 precincts reporting in the gubernatorial race, the vote was: O'Neill558,386 (53%) Rome488,831 (47%) With 726 of 737 precincts reporting in the Senate election, the vote was: Weicker528,442 (51%) Moffett484,043 (46%) DiFazio 28,280 (3%) The third candidate in the Senate race was Lucien P. DiFazio Jr. of the Conservative Party. As Mr. O'Neill built up a substantial early lead, Mr. Rome, a former Republican leader of the State Senate, called the Governor to concede defeat only 37 minutes after the polls closed at 8 P.M. ''I gave you physically everything I could possibly give,'' Mr. Rome, a former majority leader of the State Senate, told his subdued supporters last night at the Parkview Hilton Hotel in Hartford. ''I don't intend to be involved in government again,'' he added. Mr. Weicker, in his shirtsleeves and surrounded by his family, told his cheering supporters in the same Parkview Hilton ballroom that Mr. Moffett was ''a class act - the toughest opponent I've faced.'' The Senator, who had to fight for renomination by his own party, said: ''This is probably the most emotional moment in my life because basically this election said one thing, and it had nothing to do with Republicans and Democrats. It said that a man or a woman, or anyone else in this nation, can stand up and say what's on their heart and mind - tell it like it is - and the people who have imposed their trust in that individual are going to go ahead and stand beside that individual.'' Crying and Chanting A few blocks away at the Polish National Home - where Mr. Moffett faced supporters who were both crying and chanting, ''Toby, Toby'' - the Democratic candidate said of Mr. Weicker, ''We must tip our hats to a tough customer and a decent campaigner.'' ''I don't want any Monday morning quarterbacking on Wednesday morning,'' Mr. Moffett continued. ''Promise me you won't do that.'' Politics, he said, ''is public education, and you did a lot of that.'' He urged his supporters ''to think about what my next function is for the public,'' and then joked that he was going to be ''the next commissioner of baseball.'' It was the first time in 32 years that Connecticut had elected a senator and a governor from different parties in the same election. In 1950, William Benton, a Democrat, won a Senate seat, while John Lodge, a Republican, was elected governor. In addition to the race for governor and senator, Connecticut voters elected five other state officers, six United States representatives, all 187 members of the General Assembly and eight county sheriffs, as well as some local officials such as probate judges and registrars of voters. 'Lined Up' at Polls The summerlike weather apparently drew out voters at a rate that some state election officials said could exceed the 66.8 percent voter turnout in the last gubernatorial election in 1978. ''They were lined up at the polls this morning waiting to vote,'' said Sandy Kelly, a Democratic registrar of voters in New London. While Mr. Weicker did little campaigning yesterday other than voting at the S.B. Butler School in Groton, near his condominium in Mystic, Mr. Moffett continued to campaign hard while the polls were open. He shook hands with workers at dawn at the Electric Boat submarine factory in Groton and with insurance company workers in Hartford before hurrying off to vote at the firehouse in Litchfield. The Weicker-Moffett Senate race, whose planning stages began last fall, pitted two of Connecticut's best-known political figures and was the costliest in the state's history. Spending Topped 1980 Race Through mid-October, Mr. Weicker had raised $1.95 million, compared with $1.25 million for Mr. Moffett. The combined total topped the $3 million that was spent in the 1980 Senate election in which Christopher J. Dodd, a Democrat, defeated James L. Buckley, a Republican. The 51-year-old Mr. Weicker, whose grandfather founded the Squibb drug company, was the only Republican holding statewide office. He also has never lost an election in a political career that began 20 years ago with a race for the Connecticut House of Representatives and led eventually to becoming first selectman of Greenwich, a United States representative in 1968 and a United States senator after a three-way contest in 1970. But his independent ways in the Senate, including opposition to some programs of the Reagan Administration, and his frequent spats with the Republican state organization in Connecticut caused Mr. Weicker considerable problems in winning renomination. Challenger Dropped Out He was challenged by Prescott Bush Jr., a Greenwich insurance executive and the brother of the Vice President. But Mr. Weicker, capitalizing on the belief of some Republican leaders that he had the best chance of beating Mr. Moffett in November, won the endorsement of the Republican state convention in July. Mr. Bush dropped out of the race instead of forcing Mr. Weicker into a primary election in September. By contrast, the 38-year-old Mr. Moffett was unchallenged for the Democratic nomination at his party's state convention last July. Mr. Moffett, the son of Lebanese immigrants, was the first director of the Connecticut Citizen Action Group, which was founded by Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. From that base, Mr. Moffett was elected to the House of Representatives in 1974 and was re-elected three times by wide margins in the Sixth Congressional District in northwestern Connecticut. As one of the post-Watergate class of young Democrats in the House, he helped overturn the seniority system and staked out a prominent role in energy and environmental legislation as chairman of a subcommittee.

Free throws by Ray Williams and Kevin Loder in the final six seconds lifted Kansas City. The Kings led by as many as 24 points and held a 62-49 advantage at halftime. But Utah trimmed the lead to 1 with 21 seconds lefts on a 26-foot jump shot from 3-point range by Darrell Griffith. Williams sank two free throws with 6 seconds left to put Kansas City up by 119-116. Williams fouled Rickey Green one second later, and Green hit his two free-throw attempts to the Kings' lead by 1. Loder was fouled with three seconds left and sank one of two free throws.

1257-> CONNECTICUT GUIDE; TRUMBULL EXHIBITION
John Trumbull, one of America's first great painters and a 1773 graduate of Harvard, gave a collection of his paintings to Yale College in 1832, where they were installed as the founding gift in America's first college art gallery. In celebration of the 150th anniversary of what is now the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, the first retrospective exhibition of Trumbull's work will open there Thursday and remain on view until Jan. 16. It includes 170 pieces, such as his famous portraits of American statesmen and scenes from the Revolutionary War, and less familiar miniatures, landscapes, figure drawings, architectural projects, religious and allegorical paintings. Although most of the work is from the Yale collection, some pieces are on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington, the White House and numerous museum and private collections. The Yale Art Gallery has been moved to new locations on campus twice since Trumbull's time, and Mr. and Mrs. Trumbull have moved with it. The childless artist, soldier and diplomat regarded his paintings as his offspring, and requested to be buried beneath the gallery that contained them, along with his wife. His wish was carried out upon his death in 1843. Each time the gallery was relocated, the ashes of the Trumbulls were disinterred and reburied. Lectures, gallery tours and symposiums will be held through November and December, a list of which may be obtained by telephoning the gallery at 436-8062. Opening and closing on the same dates is an exhibition of some 200 pieces of American silver covering three centuries. Among them is an early-18th-century monteith bowl by John Coney. Before the introduction of sanitary dining habits, guests at elaborate dinners used the communal monteith bowl to rinse their wine glasses between courses. A 17th-century caudle cup, also a communal vessel for drinking the mead-like hot mixture for which it was named, will be on view, with tankards and bowls by Paul Revere, and candlesticks, cups, bowls and chocolate pots made by the finest craftsmen of the period. The gallery, at 1111 Chapel Street at York Street, is open without charge from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. Tuesday through Saturday, 2 to 5 P.M. Sunday and from 6 to 9 P.M. Thursday. CHILDREN AND DIVORCE Three lectures on the problems of divorced parents and children are scheduled from 7:30 to 9:30 P.M. on the last Monday of October, November and December at the Children's Divorce Center, 264 Amity Road, Woodbridge. The four-year-old center has four staff members and an average clientele of 30 families seeking to resolve problems resulting from separation or divorce. ''Divorce is not like appendicitis,'' said Marcia Lebowitz, who has a master's degree in social work and is head of the center. ''It starts a continuum of change.'' The focus is on the child's point of view. ''We do not become involved in court cases and we do not accept childless couples seeking divorce counseling,'' said Mrs. Lebowitz. The first session is for single fathers because ''fathers rarely come,'' she said. ''Their problems begin when they don't even realize that the child must have a defined place in the father's home ... a toothbrush, a mug, a place to sleep, a place where the child does not feel like a guest.'' The second session concerns holidays and how members of split families spend time with their children. The final session deals with divorce-related books for children. Admission to each lecture is $10. For more information, call 387-8887. FEMINIST FILMS A feminist selection of Halloween films will be shown from 7 P.M. to midnight Friday by the Feminist Film Society of the Yale Law Women's Association. The program is part of an annual series depicting various perceptions of women by film makers around the world, and is often followed by a speaker and discussion. ''Kuroneko,'' a 1968 film made in Japan, is set in the 12th century. In the title role is a black cat that aids a woman and her daughter in avenging their rape and murder by a gang of outlaws. ''The Smiling Madame Beudet'' was directed in France by Germaine Dulac in 1922. The silent, surrealistic film revolves around the fantasies of a woman who attempts to escape her bourgeois marriage with a gun. Carl Dreyer was the director of the 1931 German film ''Vampyr,'' about an elderly countess who preys on young women. Experimental cinematic techniques were used by Dreyer to achieve unusual visual effects. Admission is $3, and more information may be obtained by calling 865-6141. SEAL COLONY GROWS The newest creature to be exhibited at Mystic Marinelife Aquarium is a 25-pound female fur seal that has survived unusual misfortunes in her 14 months of life. Discovered by California fishermen, Delta Joy, wheezing with a respiratory ailment, was taken to the California Marine Mammal Center for treatment. Restored to health within a few months, she was set free, but she ventured up on a beach near Berkeley and was struck by a car. Deemed unsuitable for life in the wild, she was shipped east. She has joined two male and seven female northern fur seals, the only captive colony of its kind in the country, at the Marinelife Aquarium. Eleven other stranded marine mammals are among the 2,000 live specimens on view in natural settings. The facility is open daily from 9 A.M. to 4:45 P.M. Admission is $5; children, $2.50. Call 536-9631 for more information. HALLOWEEN HARBINGERS Pumpkins weighing more than 100 pounds are expected today in a growers' contest to determine the biggest at The Inn on Lake Waramaug, New Preston, from 1 to 4 P.M. In addition, hundreds of normal-sized pumpkins will be available free to those who wish to enter a jack-o'-lantern carving contest. Winners of both contests will receive certificates and free dinners at The Inn. There is no charge for spectators or participants. Call 868-0563 for driving directions. In Stamford, pumpkins to be entered in a jack-o'-lantern contest scheduled today from noon to 3 P.M. at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center on Scofieldtown Road must be carved at home. Registration begins at noon, judging at 2 P.M. Admission to the grounds is $2 for adults, 50 cents for children. Call 322-1646 for more information. Eleanor Charles

1258-> 2 Slain in Harlem Apartment, Apparently Victims of Robbery
Two men were found shot to death yesterday in their Harlem apartment, apparently the victims of a robbery, the police said. One of the victims, 40-year-old Ralph Alphonso, was found lying face down in a bedroom with a pillow over his head. He had been shot once in the left side of the head, the police said. The other man, Ernest Davis, 40, had been shot in the back of the head. His body was found near the front door of the apartment, at 405 Manhattan Avenue. Both men had been bound and gagged, the police said. Sgt. John Carroll of the 26th Precinct detective squad said Mr. Davis had recently been released from the Clinton Correctional Facility after serving a term for robbery. Sergeant Carroll said that the apartment had been ransacked.

1259-> WITNESS SAYS FORMER MAYOR HIRED HIM TO SLAY OPPONENT
The former Mayor of Tchula wanted a political rival killed and the slaying to appear a robbery, a confessed killer has testified. The witness, Vincent Earl Bolden, told a jury in Holmes County Circuit Court Wednesday that former Mayor Eddie Carthan hired him to kill Alderman Roosevelt Granderson of Tchula in June 1981, and that Mr. Carthan pointed out the convenience store where Mr. Granderson worked part time. Mr. Carthan said after the court session that Mr. Bolden's testimony did not disturb him. ''When you know the truth it doesn't bother you,'' Mr. Carthan said. ''I only fear God.'' Mr. Bolden, a 30-year-old native of St. Louis, was sentenced to life in prison after agreeing to testify for the prosecution. When Assistant District Attorney Hallie Gail Bridges asked Mr. Bolden who hired him for the killing, he replied, ''Mr. Carthan.'' Cousin Is Awaiting Trial At that point, Mr. Granderson's widow, Nona, burst into tears and had to be carried from the courtroom. Mr. Bolden continued, saying that he and his cousin, David Earl Hester, were told they could make $75,000 by killing Mr. Granderson, robbing the store and a Tchula bank. Mr. Hester is awaiting trial in the case. Mr. Carthan told him he would get $10,000 for his role in the murder, Mr. Bolden testified. The jury had been sent from the courtroom for that part of the testimony, which was ruled inadmissable by the judge before the jury was allowed to return. According to Mr. Bolden, he was introduced to a man called ''Eddie'' by Mr. Hester before the killing, and the three men drove past the store where Eddie told them the person to be ''hit'' would be. Asked what he meant by ''hit,'' Mr. Bolden replied, ''Killed.'' Mr. Bolden said that he and Mr. Hester donned bandannas and entered into the store as it was closing. ''Granderson grabbed my gun handle and at that point I shot him,'' Mr. Bolden said. Mr. Carthan resigned last year as Mayor of Tchula, a predominantly black town of 1,900 people in central Mississippi, because of an assault conviction. Mr. Carthan, who is black, maintains that he is being framed by ''the white power structure.''

1260-> DANCE: ART BRIDGMAN AND MYRNA PACKER
Art Bridgman and Myrna Packer danced about love and war on their collaboratively choreographed Thursday night program at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater. Mostly, however, they danced about love. They even danced about love when they were dancing about war. In ''Scenario for a Limited Nuclear War,'' to rock songs and news reports about nuclear weapons, Miss Packer and Mr. Bridgman first appeared as giddy teen-agers oblivious to disaster and then became adults clinging desperately together. Clearly, they were urging the world to make love, not war, and their duet was a heartfelt plea for peace. The rest of the evening was all choreographic billing and cooing. It soon became evident that Miss Packer and Mr. Bridgman, who have been giving duet programs since 1978, have adopted very distinct stage personalities. Mr. Bridgman is vigorous and slightly blustery; Miss Packer, whimsical and capricious. Their new ''For Floricica'' contrasted brisk episodes with quiet ones. And when Miss Packer and Mr. Bridgman stretched out on the floor and wiggled their fingers, they resembled two lovers sharing silly jokes. Mr. Bridgman's gusto and Miss Packer's gentleness were again contrasted in ''Solitaire'' and in two complementary new solos, ''Conversation 1'' and ''Conversation 2.'' Typically, Miss Packer kept changing her mind choreographically in her solo and she fussed as if before an invisible mirror. When she spoke, she spoke in sentence fragments. Mr. Bridgman also spoke in his solo. But he spoke coherently about choreography and sexual role-playing and swept and strode across the stage. The dances, as well as the characters in them, tended to be similar and parts of one dance could have been placed in another without anyone possibly being the wiser. The accompaniments also helped the program seem episodic. Most of the dances were set to several different scores, ranging from folk songs to Elvis Presley and new music by Frank Ferrucci. As a result, the dances tended to splinter apart. A charming couple, Miss Packer and Mr. Bridgman made one hope that love could one day conquer all. Yet one couldn't help wishing that their dances would be self-sufficient choreographic units, rather than episodes from some ongoing serial.

1261-> A 3-TERM CONGRESSMAN WOOS NEW CONSTITUENCY
The senior citizens' center here is a traditional campaign stop for candidates for the House of Representatives. But when the three-term Republican incumbent in the Ninth Congressional District, Harold (Cap) Hollenbeck, arrived today, hardly anyone seemed to know who he was. ''I live in Elmwood Park, but I get your newsletter,'' Henry Holland told him. Mr. Hollenbeck said, ''You're in my district now.'' The director of the center, Goldie Singer, began to introduce Mr. Hollenbeck as ''Congressman Roukema.'' Marge Roukema used to represent Fair Lawn when it was in the Seventh District. But this year, the Democratic-controlled New Jersey Legislature put Mrs. Roukema in a newly created Fifth Congressional District and redrew Mr. Hollenbeck's solidly Republican Ninth District. Sixty percent of the new Ninth District was part of other districts in 1980. The Legislature subtracted Republican communities such as Demarest and added Democratic ones such as Fair Lawn. Registered Democrats now outnumber registered Republicans by 94,000 to 67,000 in the district. Democrat Goes Door to Door It is one of the problems that Mr. Hollenbeck faces in what is seen as a close race against Robert Torricelli, a Democrat who is a former counsel to Vice President Walter F. Mondale and former aide to Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. While Mr. Hollenbeck was in Congress during the summer and early fall, Mr. Torricelli was waging a vigorous, seven-day-a-week campaign. Mr. Torricelli said he had attended small campaign parties in private homes every night since February and had gone door to door in much of the district. He criticizes President Reagan's economic policies, citing Mr. Hollenbeck's vote for the three-year tax cut, and has made issues of the incumbent's opposition to gun control and his support for nuclear power. ''I don't want to win just because the Republicans have failed,'' said Mr. Torricelli, a 31-year-old native of Bergen County. ''I want to win because I have something to say. But I probably will win or lose on people's perception of Reagan's program.'' Mr. Hollenbeck, who is 43, said: ''My opponent is waging an aggressive campaign, but the real problems are the redistricting and the question of how people will look at Reagan. And that won't be answered until Nov. 2.'' Mr. Hollenbeck has been been reminding voters of his reputation as a liberal Republican. He says he would vote for the tax cut again but he emphasizes the votes on which he differed with the Administration. He voted to override the President's veto of a supplemental spending bill and against the 1982 military budget, which he said was too large. He also mentions his efforts to bring the fruits of social programs, in the form of subsidized housing and public works funds, to his district. Mr. Hollenbeck is one of only two Republican House candidates in New Jersey - the other being Representative Matthew Rinaldo - to receive the endorsement of the state's A.F.L.-C.I.O. However, the Bergen County A.F.L.-C.I.O. declined to take sides in the race, and Mr. Torricelli won the approval of the New Jersey Education Association and the state branch of the United Auto Workers. 5,000 Receive Postcards Mr. Torricelli, in his first bid for office, has raised somewhat more money than the incumbent - $240,000 to $200,000. The gun control issue has been particularly hard fought. Handgun Control, a group that favors exactly that, contributed $5,000 to Mr. Torricelli and the National Rifle Association gave $4,950 to Mr. Hollenbeck. The rifle group also sent postcards saying: ''Bob Torricelli doesn't trust you. Why trust him?'' to 5,000 residents and notified 1,000 by telegram of a debate between the candidates. Mr. Torricelli favors the Kennedy-Rodino bill to restrict the sale of handguns, as well as Representative Mario Biaggi's proposed ban on bullets that can penetrate bulletproof police vests. Mr. Hollenbeck said violent crime could be stopped more effectively by adopting mandatory minimum sentences and improving social programs. ''What Torricelli's trying to do,'' said Mr. Hollenbeck, ''is relate me to violent crime and relate the N.R.A. to the Ku Klux Klan.'' Mr. Torricelli denies this. The candidates have also clashed on environmental issues, primarily nuclear power. Mr. Hollenbeck said he supported it, ''for the practical reason we're going to run out of oil and I don't want to use coal,'' which he said resulted in pollution. Mr. Torricelli calls for a moratorium on construction of nuclear plants until a method is found of safely disposing spent fuel. What may be the largest issue of all, as both candidates mount their last advertising campaigns, is visibility in the redrawn district. Mr. Torricelli is counting on his earlier start in the campaign, and Mr. Hollenbeck on the familiarity of his name. He served in the State Assembly and State Senate, his father is a former Mayor of East Rutherford and his cousin, Robert Hollenbeck, serves in the Assembly.

1262-> Chargers 44, Colts 26
SAN DIEGO (AP) - Dan Fouts threw five touchdown passes, three to the tight end Kellen Winslow and two to the wide receiver Wes Chandler. The victory extended San Diego's winning streak to five games, the club's longest in 18 years, and set up a final-game showdown with the once-beaten Los Angeles Raiders next week. San Diego (6-2) built up a 23-0 lead in the second quarter against the National Football League's youngest team. The loss dropped the Colts to 0-7-1, their worst start since the club's inception in 1947. Fouts, who has 13 touchdown passes in the last three games, had first-half strikes of 30 and 13 yards to Winslow and a 41-yarder to Chandler. He added a 44-yard scoring toss to Chandler in the third period and hit Winslow on a 28-yard scoring play in the fourth quarter. It was the third time in Fouts's 10-year career that he has thrown for five touchdowns in a game. Coming off an N.F.L. record of two consecutive 400-yard passing games, he finished the one-sided contest with 18 completions in 30 attempts for 298 yards and one interception. The Colts got a 58-yard field goal from Dan Miller, the third longest in N.F.L. history.

1263-> SPORTS PEOPLE; Mancini Won't Quit
Ray Mancini says he has no plans to retire from boxing after the death of Duk Koo Kim, whom he knocked unconscious in their title bout Nov. 13. ''I've experienced this kind of tragedy before,'' he told The Meadville (Pa.) Tribune. ''I don't understand it, but I think it's for a reason. I just have to trust the Lord.'' He did not explain the previous tragedy, but Dave Wolf, his manager, said in New York that the fighter was talking about the shooting death last year of his brother Lenny Jr. ''I'm weary, I'm still tired and sore,'' Mancini said, but added, ''In my mind, I know which way I want to go.''

1265-> TAXES ARE RISING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL
BECAUSE of cuts in State and Federal aid, rising expenses, deteriorating public facilities and no lessening in the demand for services, Long Island residents can expect to be paying more taxes at the local level. The City Council of Glen Cove, for example, has unanimously approved a record 1983 city budget of more than $13 million, calling for a tax rate increase of more than 41 percent. This could push the average Glen Cove homeowner's tax bill to $213. When he presented his proposed budget, Glen Cove's Mayor, Alan Parente, described this year's budget-making process as ''the most arduous task I have had to perform since taking office.'' Like other officials in Nassau and Suffolk County faced with a similar fiscal responsibility, Mayor Parente blamed current financial difficulties, in part, on anticipated revenues that did not come in. For example, while $2 million in sales tax revenues had been expected by Glen Cove, actual receipts for 1982 are currently calculated to be about $1.5 million because of depressed consumer spending. Despite the record tax increase, Mayor Parente described his budget as a ''bare bones'' measure and observed that it contained a one-year freeze on city employees' salaries and a salary cut of $1,000 for each of the six members of the City Council. City Hall observers, meanwhile, pointed out that last November, after the adoption of the $11.2 million 1982 budget, the City Council members voted to double their salaries from $2,500 to $5,000. The cut will reduce the pay for their part-time jobs to $4,000. The Town of Oyster Bay, meanwhile, is considering the first increase in its general town tax rate in six years. The proposed budget totals $30.4 million. If approved, the 1983 town tax rate for homeowners would be set at slightly more than 87 cents for each $100 of assessed valuation, a rate increase of nearly seven cents, or about $4.60 in actual taxes on a home assessed at $7,000. A public hearing on the budget is scheduled for this Tuesday at 10 A.M. and 8 P.M. In the Town of Huntington, Supervisor Kenneth P. Butterfield has proposed a budget that would raise town taxes by 25 percent, or $1.59 per $100 of valuation. This would mean a tax increase of about $60 for the average Huntington homeowner. ''No elected official likes to raise taxes,'' Mr. Butterfield said. ''But we have to pay off some loans on money borrowed between 1980 and 1981 when the Republicans were in control here.'' In addition, he said the town had lost $350,000 a year in state and federal aid and faced increased costs for highway repairs and other services. Meanwhile, he warned that ''the town tax increase is dwarfed by the county and school tax hikes coming down the pike.'' He said Suffolk and Nassau taxpayers suffered from an overlapping of taxing districts, of which he said there were 712, exceeding other similar areas across the country by more than 10 times. ''There was an explosion of taxing districts after World War II on the Island,'' Mr. Butterfield explained. ''Everyone wanted their own Fire Department, Playground District and Parks Department, and now no one wants to give them up.'' Suffolk County Executive Peter F. Cohalan, who last year proposed a ''draconian'' fiscal plan that ''held the line against inflation,'' has offered a 1983 budget that would raise taxes for Suffolk residents by 9.7 percent, the largest since 1977. This would increase the average taxpayer's county tax from $482 to $529. Last year Mr. Cohalan said the county would not continue to conduct ''business as usual'' in the face of cuts in Federal and state aid and that he would not make up the difference by passing the slack onto the local taxpayer. He pointed out, however, that some costs were mandated by Federal and state statutes, including Medicaid, public assistance, subsidies to the Long Island Rail Road, and education for handicapped children. And he noted that ''these costs continue to rise at a greater rate than the revenues required to support them.'' Also having an adverse effect on the county budget is the fact that since 1981 Suffolk has lost $20.3 million in Federal aid for mandated programs, crime control grants, transportation aid, health grants, aging funds, social service reimbursement and revenue sharing. He said the Federal share of Suffolk County's revenue as a percent of expenditures in the general fund had dropped from 28 percent in 1981 to a projected 13.4 percent in 1983. Mr. Cohalan said that if basic services were to be continued, the county would have to pick up where the Federal and state governments have left off. He also said he would make virtually no cuts in programs and not propose any layoffs in county employees. In addition, his fiscal blueprint calls for a $5,000 raise for himself to $65,000 a year, and a $2,500 raise for county legislators, which would increase their salary to $30,000 a year. The 9.7 percent increase in the county's general tax rate adds 94 cents to the tax rate, increasing the combined general fund and police district tax rate from $9.64 to $10.58 for each $1,000 of equalized full valuation. The budget proposal calls for the county to spend a record $863,2 for operating expenses. When combined with the $60 million already approved by the County Legislature for capital expenditures, the combined spending by the county in 1983 would be $923 million. ''I think people are willing to pay for a basic safety net of services if the tax increases are not astronomical,'' said Mr. Cohalan. Nassau County is in the midst of its budget making process. County Executive Francis T. Purcell is scheduled to propose his fiscal blueprint next month. He has called on all department heads to ''hold down spending, maintain tax stability, and provide all services as economicaly and efficiently as possible.'' County taxes account for about 25 percent of the average taxpayer's total bill, which also includes school, town and village or special district taxes. For example, in the Town of Oyster Bay, only five cents of every tax dollar goes to the town. Fifty-seven cents goes for the school tax and 26 cents to Nassau County. The county's General Fund receives less than half of the 26 cents, while the rest goes for police district services, the courts and Nassau Community College. The 12 percent that goes to special districts does not go to any one particular governing body. Special districts include fire protection, water supply, and sanitation collection, among others. Those Islanders who live in villages with village governments also pay village taxes. The only break taxpayers may be getting will result from a new law passed this year by the State Legislature affecting assessment practices throughout the state. The law has two objectives. The first is to repeal the section of the Real Property Tax Law that had been held by the courts to require full-value assessment, such has been achieved in the Town of Islip. The second is to maintain the status quo regarding the percentage of the total property tax levy paid by residential, public utility, and commericial and industrial property owners. Incidentally, the Town of Islip is one of those few local governments that has proposed no tax increase for 1983. By adopting measures provided under the second objective of the new state law, the town hopes to shift back to business that portion of the tax burden residents picked up when Islip was court ordered in 1978 to assess all property at its full market value. The town is also saving money through attrition. According to Islip Comptroller Winston Feurtado, ''We continue to follow a policy of doing more with less.'' He said that last September there were 1,028 full-time employees working for the town. ''As of this date, the number has been reduced by 73,'' which he said was ''unprecedented in the town's history.''

1266-> THE NEW TECHNOLOGY; FOR ENGINEERS, DIVERSIFICATION IS THE SPECIALTY MOST IN DEMAND
WHEN Robert Roy chose chemical engineering as his major at the M assachusetts Institute of Technology in 1978, he thought getting a j ob after graduation would be a snap. There was much discussion aboutt he critical shortage of engineers, and petroleum and pharmaceutical c ompanies, along with a wide range of other manufacturers, flocked tot he M.I.T. campus to woo new graduates in chemical engineering. But by the time Mr. Roy's turn came last January, the recruiters were nowhere to be seen. While students specializing in electrical engineering, robotics and computer sciences had their pick of job offers, the demand for new chemical engineers had declined sharply, as the nation's oil and chemical companies tried to recoup profits lost in a sustained downturn. Despite Mr. Roy's impressive academic record, he was sent polite apologies but not a single job offer by Philips Petroleum, Exxon, Mobil and about 30 others. In June, the 22-year old went home to Chicopee, Mass. He still makes regular forays to Boston looking for a job. Mr. Roy is not alone. ''We ended last term like the intermission between two acts of a play,'' said Robert K. Weatherall, director of M.I.T.'s office of career planning and placement, reflecting on the unusual plight of Mr. Roy and many of his classmates. ''There was blood on the floor. For the first time in quite a while, we had engineering students - good students -without offers.'' In short, Mr. Roy and his classmates found out that the job market for engineers can be fickle. While engineers are generally in demand even in hard economic times, specialty disciplines within the profession experience unpredictable bouts of job droughts. For example, five years ago aeronautical engineers were scrambling to develop skills in other areas while the airline industry trimmed its fleets and staffs severely. Now those same specialists are the beneficiaries of the Reagan Administration's increases in the defense budget. By the end of the 1980's, some predict, the current state of affairs even in the booming computer field may be reversed, especially if the large numbers of electrical engineers now in training flood the market. As a result, both recent engineering graduates and those in the field for many years are increasingly being advised to protect themselves against fluctuations in the job market by gaining a knowledge of finance and management, areas that many technicians previously shunned. With high-technology manufacturing having grown more complicated and competitive, most employers today look to engineers to provide the kind of analysis about methods of increasing profit margins that was previously the exclusive terrain of upper management and company economists. ''The day of the one-dimensional professional is gone in business,'' said Robert Book, president of R.W. Consultants Inc., an executive-search company that helps many engineers. ''Companies are doing more strategic planning. They are not looking in the managerial area for a specialist.'' Mr. Book adds that most of his clients are looking for ''people with strong planning skills, who can become familiar with a technology and answer questions like, 'Should we manufacture or should we assemble?' '' Compared with many other professions, engineering has suffered little in the current recession. Several experts insist that as soon as interest rates decline enough to permit companies to increase capital investment and to reduce the cost of relocating personnel, the market for engineers of all types will bounce back. Even today, said Donald A. Dowden, president of Dowden and Co., a recruiting and job-analysis group, a strong demand exists for engineers with two to five years of experience. ''They are the most sought after,'' he said, ''because they have the perfect blend of experience and reasonable salary expectations.'' Nonetheless, in an age of increasing specialization there seems to be a special niche in most engineering disciplines for those who can broaden and build upon their technical expertise. ''As the competition looms from Japan, we must be as cost-effective as possible,'' said David A. Lehman, president of Mead Digital Systems in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. Lehman, who has hired hundreds of electrical, chemical and mechanical engineers over the last two years to spur Mead's efforts to capture a substantial portion of the market for ink-jet printers, says that ''To operate effectively, every one of my employees must understand how a profit and a loss is created. That doesn't mean finding the least expensive way to build something, but the least overall cost'' - including the costs of using computer-aided manufacturing techniques, or locating a defect and repairing a piece of high-technology equipment once it has left the factory. Many engineers are welcoming the increase in responsibility that accompanies their expanded role within a company. At M.I.T., Mr. Weatherall reports that both undergraduates and graduate students ''like the idea that they can work for a firm where there is a business opportunity as well as a technical one,'' especially in fast-growing and potentially lucrative fields like biotechnology. At the same time, some engineers who have expanded into the management and financial planning sides of their companies say they find it draws them away from the most satisfying aspects of the profession. Consider the case of Bruce Guthrie, a 33-year-old resident of Somers Point, N.J., and a specialist in industrial engineering. Mr. Guthrie worked for several companies before taking an attractive job in 1979 with General Foods. ''At General Foods I was an engineering 'interface' with the corporate financial people,'' he said. ''I worked with the concept of engineering projects, taking them to the upper-management level to get them approved.'' But once approval was obtained, Mr. Guthrie's involvement in the process would end. ''I was frustrated that I didn't see the final project to completion,'' he recounted recently, noting that many engineers are ''hands-on people.'' In September he decided to leave General Foods for Lenox China, where he has turned his attentions and engineering skills to the manufacturing plant. In many engineering disciplines the much-publicized shortages of qualified personnel are real, and involvement in management and finance is not a prerequisite for success. Ironically, the strong demand for electrical engineers and computer-science specialists has created a shortage of their numbers in the academic field, where engineers are turned out and where jobs are usually scarce. Commercial salaries have been high enough to lure away many college graduates before they have a chance to pursue an advanced degree. The result has been a shortage of graduatestudent instructors and junior faculty, hampering the ability of many institutions to expand their electrical engineering departments sufficiently to meet the new demand. Fear that the engineering profession may be ''eating its own seed corn'' has prompted an increasing number of companies to sponsor fellowships for graduate students or provide funds for colleges to purchase state-of-the-art equipment for their laboratories, according to a recent survey of employers conducted by the Peterson's Guide to Engineering, Science and Computer Jobs, an annual publication. But some of the equipment, such as that required to learn computer-aided design, can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, and companies like Mead Digital report they are already considering the establishment of on-the-job training centers to teach skills that some employees were not able to pick up on the campus.

1267-> SHIITES IN LEBANON SAID TO ATTACK ARMY BARRACKS IN CITY THEY TOOK
Several hundred armed men reportedly attacked a Lebanese Army barracks today in the eastern city of Baalbek and besieged it for two hours before retreating. The Beirut radio quoted the Lebanese Defense Ministry as saying that three of the armed men were killed and several were wounded in the attack by Lebanese Shiite Moslems, who are in the majority in Baalbek. The broadcast said two Lebanese soldiers were wounded. The attack followed a Shiite takeover of Baalbek's town hall and streets on Sunday to prevent the celebration there today of the 39th anniversary of Lebanon's independence from France. The Shiite takeover and attack on the army barracks constituted the first instance of armed protest by Lebanese citizens against the Government of President Amin Gemayel. The Defense Ministry report identified the attackers today as being from the same group that took over the town hall Sunday. That group identified itself as Lebanese Shiite Moslems who oppose the Government of President Gemayel and generally support Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran. The Defense Ministry statement was the Government's first acknowledgement of insurrection in Baalbek. An Earlier Report Earlier in the evening, however, the radio station of the Christian Phalangist Party of Mr. Gemayel said that there were 300 attackers besieging the army barracks, which is a fortresslike, highwalled structure on a hill on the edge of Baalbek. On Sunday at dawn, the insurgents took control of the town hall, overcame a small unit of Lebanese security troops without resistance, and occupied the streets of the city of 25,000 people. The Syrian Army, which occupies the general area, the P.L.O. and the Lebanese Army did not intervene. The insurgents ripped down or defaced Lebanese flags and pictures of President Gemayel and painted anti-Government, anti-Gemayel mottoes in the town hall. Leaders of the insurrection said on Sunday that they favored an Islamic state, similar to that in Iran. Today an arrangement was made under which a Lebanese flag was allowed in the square. The compromise reportedly was the result of negotiations by the Syrian Army, the Lebanese security forces and the leaders of the Lebanese Shiite organization known as Islamic Amal. After today's battle, the Defense Ministry statement said, the Lebanese Army fortified its positions around its barracks and the city of Baalbek was described as calm. ---- 1,200 Reported Killed TEL AVIV, Nov. 22 (AP) - The Israeli newspaper Maariv said today that 1,200 Palestinians were believed to have been killed in recent Lebanese Army sweeps through West Beirut and that 60,000 had been sent to Syrian-controlled Lebanese territory. An Israeli Government source in Jerusalem said that the 1,200 Palestinians were known to have disappeared since the Israelis pulled out of the city at the end of September but that it had not been confirmed that they had been killed. Maariv quoted military sources as saying they believed the 1,200 had been slain. The Israeli Army declined comment. The newspaper said 60,000 Palestinians had been sent to Tripoli in northern Lebanon and to the Bekaa Valley in the east. Their houses were reportedly destroyed.

1268-> EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S INTERVIEW ON RADIO AFTER WEEKLY ADDRESS
Following are excerpts from questions and answers from President Reagan's radio interview after his weekly address in Washington yesterday, as transcribed by The New York Times and the White House: Action on Jobs Bill Q. Mr. President, with the lame duck Congress in rather noisy session, our gaze inevitably falls on Capitol Hill. Technically many government agencies are out of cash today because there's still no stopgap funding authority. Now you threatened to veto the so-called continuing resolution if it contains what you call the pork barrel jobs bill. The fact of the matter is the Senate has voted $1.2 billion to that aim, the House $5.4 billion. The estimate is you'll get a compromise that contains somewhere in the area of about $2 billion. Isn't that the bottom line that you're going to be able to accept? In light of the trouble you've had with this lame duck session, are you going to take Senator Hatfield's suggestion and take the $2 billion and run or are you going to stand and fight? A. Well, obviously I have to wait and see what comes down to me and what's in front of me before I actually say veto or the other way, but I have to tell you this: I cannot sign that bill. I will have to veto if it contains these various amounts that have been suggested, because in truth these aren't job-creating bills. The 5.4, for example, that was introduced in the House, I think that a great many Congressmen, in fact some of them openly admit it, were calling it a free vote in which they could apparently vote for a job bill knowing that I would veto it and that they wouldn't have to live with it. Actually that 5.4 is not a job-creation bill. It is a pork barrel and filled with all sorts of projects, many of which wouldn't create employment at all and many which wouldn't create employment while one particular wouldn't even be effective until 1985. That's not going to help the unemployed today. But also, many of those would - whatever work they would create would be at a tremendous cost. For example, in the Bureau of Reclamation Project that has been included in there, it would cost $49,000 for every job that would be created. In the General Services Administration, the element that's in there, that would be $25,000 per job. And, as I say, there's another one, a billion-dollar program, that wouldn't begin until 1985. So I just think the answer to recovery has to be - or to unemployment I should say, is recovery. And anything that adds to the deficit and delays economic recovery is going to set us back far more than a temporary job. The military bill - the Pentagon asked for less than half of the amount that they've added in this bill in the House for military residence construction, so there's half of that that wouldn't even be spent. Q. Well, now, you seem to have made up your mind already. You say if those figures that I mentioned are the figures that actually reach your desk, you would have to veto. What is there to study then? A. Well, the thing is, if it contains the things that are originally there -if, on the other hand, they come down with some addition to this that is in another area that you look at and say, well, there is a value to this and while I would prefer that if we not increase the budgeting, I would have to look and see does the value offset the risk of adding this to the deficit. But when I was talking here, I was talking of the things that we presently know are there. You know, when a couple of -an orange and an apple went into the conference committee, it might come out a pear. Report on MX Missile Q. Mr. President, the continuing resolution will probably also contain the MX proposal, and you just appointed a commission to look into the basing options for MX. I was wondering, given the complexity of that task, is it realistic to expect them to report by March first or could that date somehow be slipped? A. I think it is, because of all the study, the research, that has gone into this before. This whole thing came about - we asked originally for money to begin the process of building the MX. We don't even have an assembly line for building missiles. That was done away with in the previous Administration. And we asked for the right to put them, the first ones off the line, into MX existing - into Minuteman silos while we continue to study a basing plan. The Congress denied us the right to do this, the ability to do it, and so we continued to study, and the dense pack basing mode - and it may still turn out to be the one that has the least warts. There's something wrong with every system. But I was required to come up by Dec. 1 having selected a basing mode, and this was the best one we had on hand. So there was no opportunity to consult with them or for them to have access to all the study and the research that have gone on. We hope now in these few months that we can present everything, and if some of our scientists come up with a new and improved mode, why, we'll take a good look at that one. Q. Are you willing to accept whatever the commission comes up with? A. Well it would depend on whether there was other agreement with the commission, too, and by that I mean the expertise of our own military people, who are going to have to use these weapons if they're ever used. And let me add here, unless there's misunderstanding of that line, the real purpose of those missiles is to never be used. We're trying to create a deterrent that will prevent there ever being a need for them or a war. Strength of Soviet Forces Q. Mr. President, you have spoken about a window of vulnerability, and you've said that the United States, in terms of defenses, is inferior to the Soviet Union in many areas. My question is, looking at U.S. defenses overall, would you trade American forces for Soviet forces? A. Obviously the answer would be as it's been for many military men. No, because of my faith in America and in the young men and women of America who are in our armed forces. But I still have to say that to continue as we have been in the previous decade and the last several years, leaving those fine young men and women with tools incapable of doing the job, endangering their lives by lack of training because we were denied the fuel through budgetary restrictions to fly airplanes as often as they should. On any given day when we came into office here, only half the airplanes in our Air Force could be flown because of lack of spare parts. Only half the ships could leave harbor, for lack not only of spare parts but of complete crew. So what we're trying to do is make sure, and we have made remarkable progress. There is an esprit d'corps in our military today and a pride in the uniform that I think would bring a glow to every American's heart if they were as aware of it as I of necessity am. And so the answer would be no in that one way. But if you ask me is there still a window of vulnerability, do they have a superiority in firepower and so forth, the answer is an unqualified yes. You can't help but look at the NATO line, with more than 300 triple-warhead missiles, intermediate range, aimed at the targets of all of Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa, and we have not in that theater, is a valid comparison. Q. Mr. President, we also do have submarine missiles in the area which would serve an intermediate missile function. A. And they have submarines and submarine missiles. And a part of the threat is not only what's on hand. It is that at the moment their rate of increase in their weapons compared to ours. In the last 15 years, I think, they added some 60 submarines, nuclear submarines, while we were adding none. Q. Just one last follow-up question. We are adding the Trident submarines, are we not, at this point? A. Yes. And they're adding one that's bigger and carries more missiles. Future of the MX Q. Mr. President, what if this commission you're going to appoint comes back to you and says: The MX may not be such a good idea, after all. Let's have a modification of the Trident or some other variation on the missile. Will you be able to accept that kind of recommendation? A. Well we'd certainly look at it. I would - it would be difficult for me to think that we could, knowing the length of time that it takes to get something researched, tested fully and then into operation. Even with this MX and with all of the work that's been done so far, that system won't begin to be installed until 1986, won't be operational. Q. So for logistical reasons you would be inclined to stand firm on the MX as a system? A. Yes, let me just say though, lest you think I have a closed mind. If a miracle happens and someone came along with something that could be implemented better and sooner, obviously we'd choose that. Role in Boston Quota Case Q. Mr. President, I'd like to move to a different area. In Boston, during the period of budget cutting, the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that white police officers and firefighters be laid off rather than blacks and Hispanics with less seniority. This was done to maintain minority percentages. Why did your Administration ask the Supreme Court to strike down the lower court's order? A. We did it because, number one, in the law itself it says that hiring or firing cannot be on the basis of race, and second, that the Federal courts have no authority to come in with regard to overthrowing seniority. There is a third reason. I'm old enough to remember when quota systems and so forth were used, not to end discrimination, but actually to legitimize it. And the precedent that would be set if this policy, which is embodied in law and all of seniority and layoffs is used in this instance, admittedly to try to keep a better balance, which we're all in favor of in public employment in that area, but if that precedent is set that seniority is meaningless, and that purpose, someday you could find an Administration that wants to turn it around and use it to go back to what we hopefully have gotten rid of in this country, a discrimination against minorities. Q. There could be or there could have been other options. Let's say, for example, some sort of proportional layoff system, which I understand the U.S. Civil Rights Commission had recommended. But why shouldn't affirmative action supporters view this voluntary entry, your Administration's voluntary entry into the case, as an attack on affirmative action? A. Well, maybe some of them will, because an image has been created of me, I know, that I do not support these antidiscrimination measures. The record, on the other hand, proves the reverse. As the Governor of California, I appointed more minority members to executive and policymaking positions in the state government than all the previous governors in the history of California put together. Here we have already - and we haven't been here two years yet - we have 130 members of the black community in top executive positions, beginning with Sam Pierce, a very capable member of our Cabinet, and two assistant Cabinet members, and this includes - and then added to that we're doing the same thing with regard to women, and we're doing the same thing with regard to Hispanics. The most recent Hispanic employee is one I'm very proud of, Everett Alvarez, who has the record of having been held in captivity the longest as a P.O.W. in Vietnam. And he is the Deputy Administrator of the Veteran's Administration. But our record there - but also, if you'll look at the Justice Department and the Legal Employment Opportunities Commission, you will find that we've broken all records in the history of the national government with regards to hearings on violations of civil rights, on trials and on successful convictions of violations of civil rights. So I think our record - and incidentally just yesterday I signed a paper with a group of minority small business people that is going to increase the amount of procurement that the Federal Government buys from minority-owned businesses. Appeal of Presidency Q. I get the impression from afar that the job may have lost some of its appeal, especially for Mrs. Reagan as a result of the assassination attempt. Is that true? A. I know that this was quite a traumatic experience for her. I also know that - you know, the government, for the First Lady gets an employee free. They have her just about as busy as they have me. But, no, she's made no decision either. She and I are together on this. But I have to tell you, frankly, I have enjoyed the opportunity of dealing with the problems that are before us. I think we've made great progress in a definite turn in government and turning away from some of the things that have brought on the very economic crisis we're suffering from. And it has its drawbacks, of course. You either live in a - like a bird in a gilded cage, and I sometimes look out the window at Pennsylvania Avenue and wonder what it would be like to be able to just walk down the street to the corner drugstore and look at the magazines. I can't do that anymore.

1270-> ISRAEL IS SAID TO LINK PULLOUT TALKS WITH NORMALIZING LEBANON TIES
Administration officials said today that Israel had refused to begin talks with Lebanon on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Lebanese territory until the Beirut Government agreed to discuss steps toward political normalization with Israel. The Lebanese Government, under pressure from Arab nations to avoid any political arrangements with Israel, has declined to enter negotiations on normalization. The Lebanese have reportedly appealed to the United States to persuade the Israelis to drop their demand. The demand has led to a delay in the start of negotiations that a senior State Department official said two weeks ago would begin soon. Nicholas A. Veliotes, the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, said today that the United States was disturbed by the loss of momentum in the negotiations on troop withdrawal from Lebanon. Without mentioning Israel by name, Mr. Veliotes said the United States was concerned about parties putting forth conditions ''which keep pushing back the negotiations even further.'' 'The Momentum Is Slowed' ''We're disturbed that the momentum is slowed in getting all the forces out of Lebanon,'' he said. ''We're hopeful that it will occur, but yet, nothing's happened.'' According to Administration officials, the Lebanese Government has agreed to hold direct talks with the Israelis, with the participation of the special American envoy, Morris Draper, on questions dealing with the troop withdrawal. The United States wants the Israelis and the Lebanese to agree on security arrangements in southern Lebanon so that Israel can pull out its estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon. A formula will also have to be worked out with Syria and the Palestine Liberation Organization to provide for the withdrawal of their forces at about the same time, officials said. An Israeli diplomat confirmed the Administration's statement on the status on the talks. He said it was a matter of principle for Israel that the negotiations should cover political relations as well as military matters. Israel Drops a Demand Administration officials, in separate interviews, said the Israelis had dropped for the moment their original demand for a formal peace treaty with Lebanon. In place of a treaty, the officials said, the Israelis want the trappings of normalization. These include open borders between the two countries, trade and tourism, and unofficial missions in Beirut and Jerusalem, according to the officials. The Israeli said his Government wanted a situation analagous to the one that existed in Iran before the fall of the Shah. At that time, Israel and Iran had extensive dealings but no formal relations. So far, the Israeli demands have been made privately and there has been no open discussion of them by the Israeli Government. This has led some State Department officials to believe that there is a chance to get Israel to withdraw them and agree to sit down with the Lebanese without conditions. A 'Tangible' Payment ''The Israelis clearly want to be compensated for withdrawing from Lebanon,'' an Administration official said, ''and they want it to be tangible.'' The American view is that the talks should start promptly and that the longer they are delayed the worse the situation will become. Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel is scheduled to arrive in New York on Thursday for the start of a long trip around the United States that will culminate in a Nov. 19 meeting in Washington with President Reagan. One official said he was concerned that the Begin trip might heighten tensions between the United States and Israel if the Prime Minister used his public appearances in Los Angeles and Dallas, where he is to speak at large rallies, to criticize the Reagan Administration's Middle East policies. Israelis have said that Mr. Begin wants to make the point that Israel should be praised, not criticized, for weakening the P.L.O. by invading Lebanon. The Administration, which is expected to name Philip C. Habib, the special envoy, to a new role in the peace negotiations, wants to impress Mr. Begin with the importance that it attaches to an immediate start of the Lebanon discussions as well as progress in the talks on Palestinian self-rule. To advance the chances of getting Jordan to join the negotiations on self-rule, Administration officials said it was crucial for Israel to agree to at least a temporary freeze in setting up Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Mr. Begin has repeatedly rejected such a freeze as an infringement on the right of Jews to live in land historically part of Israel.

1272-> TRANSCRIPT OF PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS ON NUCLEAR STRATEGY TOWARD SOVIET UNION
Following is a transcript of President Reagan's speech on arms policy tonight, as recorded by The New York Times: The week before last was an especially moving one here in Washington. The Vietnam veterans finally came home once and for all to America's heart. They were welcomed with tears, with pride and with a monument to their great sacrifices. Many of their names, like those of our Republic's greatest citizens, are now engraved in stone in this city that belongs to all of us. On behalf of the nation, let me again thank the Vietnam veterans from the bottom of my heart for their courageous service to America. Seeing those moving scenes, I know mothers of a new generation must have worried about their children and about peace. And that's what I'd like to talk to you about tonight - the future of our children in a world where peace is made uneasy by the presence of nuclear weapons. A year ago I said the time was right to move forward on arms control. I outlined several proposals and said nothing would have a higher priority in this Administration. Now, a year later, I want to report on those proposals and on other efforts we're making to insure the safety of our children's future. The prevention of conflict and the reduction of weapons are the most important public issues of our time. Yet, on no other issue are there more misconceptions and misunderstandings. You, the American people, deserve an explanation from your Government on what our policy is on these issues. Too often the experts have been content to discuss grandiose strategies among themselves, and cloud the public debate in technicalities no one can understand. The result is that many Americans have become frightened and, let me say, fear of the unknown is entirely understandable. Unfortunately, much of the information emerging in this debate bears little semblance to the facts. U.S. After World War II To begin, let's go back to what the world was like at the end of World War II. The United States was the only undamaged industrial power in the world. Our military power was at its peak, and we alone had the atomic weapon. But we didn't use this wealth and this power to bully, we used it to rebuild. We raised up the war-ravaged economies, including the economies of those who had fought against us. At first, the peace of the world was unthreatened, because we alone were left with any real power, and we were using it for the good of our fellow man. Any potential enemy was deterred from aggression because the cost would have far outweighed the gain. As the Soviets' power grew, we still managed to maintain the peace. The U.S. had established a system of alliances with NATO as the centerpiece. In addition, we grew even more respected as a world leader with a strong economy and deeply held moral values. With our commitment to help shape a better world, the U.S. also pursued and always pursued every diplomatic channel for peace. And for at least 30 years after World War II, the United States still continued to possess a large military advantage over the Soviet Union. Our strength deterred -that is, prevented - aggression against us. This nation's military objective has always been to maintain peace by preventing war. This is neither a Democratic nor a Republican policy. It's supported by our allies. And most important of all, it's worked for nearly 40 years. Nuclear Deterrence What do we mean when we speak of nuclear deterrence? Certainly we don't want such weapons for their own sake. We do not desire excessive forces, or what some people have called overkill. Basically, it's a matter of others' knowing that starting a conflict would be more costly to them than anything they might hope to gain. And, yes, it is sadly ironic that in these modern times it still takes weapons to prevent war. I wish it did not. We desire peace, but peace is a goal, not a policy. Lasting peace is what we hope for at the end of our journey; it doesn't describe the steps we must take, nor the paths we should follow to reach that goal. I intend to search for peace along two parallel paths - deterrence and arms reductions. I believe these are the only paths that offer any real hope for an enduring peace. And let me say I believe that if we follow prudent policies, the risk of nuclear conflict will be reduced. Certainly the United States will never use its forces except in response to attack. Through the years, Soviet leaders have also expressed a sober view of nuclear war; and if we maintain a strong deterrent, they are exceedingly unlikely to launch an attack. Now, while the policy of deterrence has stood the test of time, the things we must do in order to maintain deterrence have changed. U.S. and Soviet Arms Spending You often hear that the United States and the Soviet Union are in an arms race. Well, the truth is that while the Soviet Union has raced, we have not. As you can see from this blue U.S. line (See accompanying chart entitled ''Defense Spending''), in constant dollars our defense spending in the 1960's went up because of Vietnam and then it went downward through much of the 1970's. Now, follow the red line, which is Soviet spending. It's gone up and up and up. In spite of a stagnating Soviet economy, Soviet leaders invest 12 to 14 percent of their country's gross national product in military spending, two to three times the level we invest. I might add that the defense share of our United States Federal budget has gone way down, too. Watch the blue line again (See accompanying chart, ''Defense Share of Federal Budget''). In 1962, when John Kennedy was President, 46 percent, almost half of the Federal budget, went to our national defense. In recent years, about one-quarter of our budget has gone to defense, while the share for social programs has nearly doubled. And most of our defense budget is spent on people, not weapons. The combination of the Soviets' spending more and the U.S. spending proportionately less changed the military balance and weakened our deterrent. Today, in virtually every measure of military power the Soviet Union enjoys a decided advantage. This chart (accompanying chart, ''Strategic Missiles and Bombers'') shows the changes in the total number of intercontinental missiles and bombers. You will see that in 1962 and in 1972, the United States forces remained about the same, even dropping some by 1982. But take a look now at the Soviet side. In 1962, at the time of the Cuban missile crisis, the Soviets could not compare with us in terms of strength. In 1972, when we signed the SALT I Treaty, we were nearly equal. But in 1982, well, that red Soviet bar stretching above the blue American bar tells the story. Comparison of ICBM's I could show you chart after chart where there's a great deal of red and a much lesser amount of U.S. blue. For example, the Soviet Union has deployed a third more land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles than we have. Believe it or not, we froze our number in 1965 and have deployed no additional missiles since then. The Soviet Union put to sea 60 new ballistic missile submarines in the last 15 years. Until last year we hadn't commissioned one in that same period. The Soviet Union has built over 200 modern Backfire bombers - and is building 30 more a year. For 20 years, the United States has deployed no new strategic bombers. Many of our B-52 bombers are now older than the pilots who fly them. The Soviet Union now has 600 of the missiles considered most threatening by both sides - the intermediate-range missiles based on land. We have none. The United States withdrew its intermediate-range land-based missiles from Europe almost 20 years ago. The world has also witnessed unprecedented growth in the area of Soviet conventional forces; the Soviets far exceed us in the number of tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft and ships they produce every year. What is more, when I arrived in this office I learned that in our own forces we had planes that couldn't fly and ships that couldn't leave port, mainly for lack of spare parts and crew members. Soviet Arms Buildup The Soviet military buildup must not be ignored. We've recognized the problem and together with our allies we've begun to correct the imbalance. Look at this chart (accompanying chart, ''Projected Defense Spending'') of projected real defense spending for the next several years. Here's the Soviet line. Let us assume the Soviets' rate of spending remains at the level they followed since the 1960's. The blue line is the United States. If my defense proposals are passed, it will still take five years before we come close to the Soviet level. Yet the modernization of our strategic and conventional forces will assure that deterrence works and peace prevails. Our deployed nuclear forces were built before the age of microcircuits. It's not right to ask our young men and women in uniform to maintain and operate such antiques. Many have already given their lives in missile explosions and aircraft accidents caused by the old age of their equipment. We must replace and modernize our forces, and that's why I've decided to proceed with the production and deployment of the new ICBM known as the MX. Three earlier Presidents worked to develop this missile. Based on the best advice I could get, I concluded that the MX is the right missile at the right time. On the other hand, when I arrived in office, I felt the proposal on where and how to base the missile simply cost too much in terms of money, and the impact on our citizens' lives. Closely Based Silos I've concluded, however, it's absolutely essential that we proceed to produce this missile, and that we base it in a series of closely based silos at Warren Air Force Base near Cheyenne, Wyo. This plan requires only half as many missiles as the earlier plan and will fit in an area of only 20 square miles. It is the product of around-the-clock research that has been under way since I directed a search for a better, cheaper way. I urge the members of Congress who must pass this plan to listen and examine the facts, before they come to their own conclusion. Some may question what modernizing our military has to do with peace. Well, as I explained earlier, a secure force keeps others from threatening us and that keeps the peace. And just as important, it also increases the prospects of reaching significant arms reductions with the Soviets, and that's what we really want. The United States wants deep cuts in the world's arsenal of weapons. But unless we demonstrate the will to rebuild our strength and restore the military balance, the Soviets, since they're so far ahead, have little incentive to negotiate with us. Let me repeat that point because it goes to the heart of our policies: Unless we demonstrate the will to rebuild our strength, the Soviets have little incentive to negotiate. If we hadn't begun to modernize, the Soviet negotiators would know we had nothing to bargain with except talk. They would know we were bluffing without a good hand because they know what cards we hold - just as we know what's in their hand. 'One-Sided Arms Control' You may recall that in 1969 the Soviets didn't want to negotiate a treaty banning antiballistic missiles. It was only after our Senate narrowly voted to fund an antiballistic missile program that the Soviets agreed to negotiate. We then reached an agreement. We also know that one-sided arms control doesn't work. We've tried time and time again to set an example by cutting our own forces in the hope that the Soviets will do likewise. The result has always been that they keep building. I believe our strategy for peace will succeed. Never before has the United States proposed such a comprehensive program of nuclear arms control. Never in our history have we engaged in so many negotiations with the Soviets to reduce nuclear arms and to find a stable peace. What we are saying to them is this: We will modernize our military in order to keep the balance for peace, but wouldn't it be better if we both simply reduced our arsenals to a much lower level? Let me begin with the negotiations on the intermediate-range nuclear forces that are currently under way in Geneva. As I said earlier, the most threatening of these forces are the land-based missiles, which the Soviet Union now has aimed at Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Warheads on Soviet Missiles This chart (accompanying chart, ''Missile Warheads'') shows the number of warheads on these Soviet missiles. In 1972 there were 600. The United States was at zero. In 1977 there were 600. The U.S. was still at zero. Then the Soviets began deploying powerful new missiles with three warheads and a reach of thousands of miles - the SS-20. Since then the bar has gone through the roof - the Soviets have added a missile with three warheads every week. Still you see no United States blue on the chart. Although the Soviet leaders earlier this year declared they'd frozen deployment of this dangerous missile, they have in fact continued deployment. Last year, on Nov. 18, I proposed the total, global elimination of all these missiles. I proposed that the U.S. would deploy no comparable missiles, which are scheduled for late 1983, if the Soviet Union would dismantle theirs. We would follow agreement on the landbased missiles with limits on other intermediate-range systems. The European governments strongly support our initiative. The Soviet Union has thus far shown little inclination to take this major step to zero levels. Yet I believe and I'm hoping that, as the talks proceed and as we approach the scheduled placement of our new systems in Europe, the Soviet leaders will see the benefits of such a farreaching agreement. This summer we also began negotiations on strategic arms reductions, the proposal we call Start. Here we're talking about intercontinental missiles - the weapons with a longer range than the intermediate-range ones I was just discussing. We are negotiating on the basis of deep reductions. I proposed in May that we cut the number of warheads on these missiles to an equal number, roughly onethird below current levels. I also proposed that we cut the number of missiles themselves to an equal number, about half the current U.S. level. Our proposals would eliminate some 4,700 warheads and some 2,250 missiles. I think that would be quite a service to mankind. Ballistic Missiles This chart (accompanying chart, ''Strategic Ballistic Missiles'') shows the current level of United States ballistic missiles, both land- and sea-based. This is the Soviet level. We intend to convince the Soviets it would be in their own best interest to reduce these missiles. Look at the reduced numbers both sides would have under our proposal - quite a dramatic change. We also seek to reduce the total destructive power of these missiles and other elements of United States and Soviet strategic forces. In 1977, when the last Administration proposed more limited reductions, the Soviet Union refused even to discuss them. This time their reaction has been quite different. Their opening position is a serious one, and even though it doesn't meet our objective of deep reductions, there's no question we're heading in the right direction. One reason for this change is clear. The Soviet Union knows that we are now serious about our own strategic programs and that they must be prepared to negotiate in earnest. We also have other important arms control efforts under way. In the talks in Vienna on mutual and balanced force reductions, we've proposed cuts in military personnel to a far lower and equal level. And in the 40-nation Committee on Disarmament in Geneva, we're working to develop effective limitations on nuclear testing and chemical weapons. The whole world remains outraged by the Soviets' and their allies' use of biological and chemical weapons against defenseless people in Afghanistan, Cambodia and Laos. This experience makes ironclad verification all the more essential for arms control. There is, of course, much more that needs to be done. In an age when intercontinental missiles can span half the globe in less than half an hour, it's crucial that Soviet and American leaders have a clear understanding of each other's capabilities and intentions. Accident and Misunderstanding Last June in Berlin, and again at the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament, I vowed that the United States would make every effort to reduce the risks of accident and misunderstanding and thus to strengthen mutual confidence between the United States and the Soviet Union. Since then, we've been actively studying detailed measures to implement this Berlin initiative. Today, I would like to announce some of the measures which I've proposed in a special letter just sent to the Soviet leadership and which I've instructed our ambassadors in Geneva to discuss with their Soviet counterparts. They include but also go beyond some of the suggestions I made in Berlin. The first of these measures involves advance notification of all United States and Soviet test launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles. We will also seek Soviet agreement on notification of all sea-launched ballistic missiles as well as intermediate-range landbased ballistic missiles of the type we're currently negotiating. This would remove surprise and uncertainty at the sudden appearance of such missiles on the warning screens of the two countries. In another area of potential misunderstanding, we propose to the Soviets that we provide each other with advance notification of our major military exercises. Here again, our objective is to reduce the surprise and uncertainty surrounding otherwise sudden moves by either side. Exchange of Data These sorts of measures are designed to deal with the immediate issues of miscalcualtion in time of crisis. But there are deeper, longer-term problems as well. In order to clear away some of the mutual ignorance and suspicion between our two countries, I will propose that we both engage in a broad-ranging exchange of basic data about our nuclear forces. I am instructing our ambassadors at the negotiations on both strategic intermediate forces to seek Soviet agreement on an expanded exchange of information. The more one side knows about what the other side is doing, the less room there is for surprise and miscalculation. Probably everyone has heard of the so-called hot line, which enables me to communicate directly with the Soviet leadership in the event of a crisis. The existing hot line is dependable and rapid - with both ground and satellite links. But because it's so important, I've also directed that we carefully examine any possible improvements to the existing hot line system. Now, although we've begun negotiations on these many proposals, this doesn't mean we've exhausted all the initiatives that could help to reduce the risk of accidental conflict. We'll leave no opportunity unexplored, and we'll consult closely with Senators Nunn, Jackson and Warner, and other members of the Congress who've made important suggestions in this field. We are also making strenuous efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. It would be tragic if we succeeded in reducing existing arsenals only to have new threats emerge in other areas of the world. 'Peace Above All Else' Earlier I spoke of America's contributions to peace following World War II, of all we did to promote peace and prosperity for our fellow man. Well, we're still those same people. We still seek peace above all else. I want to remind our own citizens and those around the world of this tradition of American good will because I am concerned about the effects the nuclear fear is having on our people. The most upsetting letters I receive are from schoolchildren who write to me as a class assignment. It's evident they've discussed the most nightmarish aspects of a nuclear holocaust in their classrooms. Their letters are often full of terror. Well, this should not be so. The philosopher Spinoza said, ''Peace is a virtue, a state of mind, a disposition for benevolence, confidence, justice.'' Well, those are the qualities we want our children to inherit, not fear. They must grow up confident if they're to meet the challenges of tomorrow, as we will meet the challenges of today. I began these remarks speaking of our children. I want to close on the same theme. Our children should not grow up frightened. They should not fear the future. We are working to make it peaceful and free. I believe their future can be the brightest, most exciting of any generation. We must reassure them and let them know that their parents and the leaders of this world are seeking above all else to keep them safe, and at peace. I consider this to be a sacred trust. My fellow Americans, on this Thanksgiving, when we have so much to be grateful for, let us give special thanks for our peace, our freedom and our good people. I've always believed that this land was set aside in an uncommon way, that a divine plan placed this great continent between the oceans to be found by a people from every corner of the earth who had a special love of faith, freedom and peace. Let us reaffirm America's destiny of goodness and good will. Let us work for peace, and, as we do, let us remember the lines of the famous old hymn, ''O God of love, O King of peace, make wars throughout the world to cease.'' Thank you, good night, and God bless you.

Mr. Fowler also said that the F.C.C. was taking a close look at its policies to promote black ownership of radio and television stations, and he described some of the policies as ineffective. The commission chairman spoke in a session with reporters that focused on his concept of ''unregulation,'' and particularly a ''Free the Broadcasting 10,000'' speech Monday in North Carolina, in which he argued that many F.C.C. rules violated the First Amendment.

1278-> A 'CLASS REUNION' FOR NATIONAL LAMPOON
''National Lampoon's Class Reunion'' is a crowded, not-very-funny movie with only a few things in its favor. One is that it pokes mild fun at horror movies, which gives it the faintest hint of topical wit. Another is that its oversized cast includes some talented performers, although no one has been given a sizable role. A third is a title song performed by Gary U.S. Bonds, and played at both the beginning and end of the movie. By the latter point, the mad killer has been caught and straitjacketed, and all of his classmates are bopping with their arms wrapped tightly around their own waists, doing a modified pogo dance in his honor. The action is set in Lizzie Borden High School (''A Cut Above the Rest''), which has been abandoned since the Class of '72 graduated and now looks suitably cobwebby and Gothic. There, after Chuck Berry has made a brief appearance at the reunion, a disgruntled nut starts murdering his former classmates. The nut wears a plaid schoolgirl's uniform and a paper bag over his head, which make for some nice touches. He @doesn't really scare anyone. Most of the story revolves around how the various classmates - cowards, dope smokers, goodnatured oafs, one prude, one glamour girl and one woman who's got all of Linda Blair's gifts from ''The Exorcist'' - will fend off the menace. The cast of ''Class Reunion,'' which opened yesterday at the Criterion Center and other theaters, includes Gerrit Graham as an amusingly supersmug class president turned yacht salesman; Shelley Smith as a beauty who has made her reputation selling pantyhose on television; Fred McCarren as a bland fellow who has been forgotten by every last one of his classmates; Marya Small as a deaf, blind and crazy seductress; Zane Buzby as the fire-breathing dragon; and Stephen Furst as the class's most outstanding lout (this is no small distinction). Michael Lerner and Blackie Dammett, who look not the least bit alike, play closely linked characters, though the juxtapostion is neither funny nor easily believed. The screenplay, by John Hughes, is a lot more vulgar and dopey than it is genuinely comic, and most of it is too flat to sustain such a busy lineup of characters. Still, it's reasonably cheerful.

1280-> WEEKENDER GUIDE; Friday; 'VALENTINA,' WITH LOVE
Two suitors pursue a pure-hearted young waitress: a police inspector, who treats her with respect, and a bully, who forces her into an intimate relationship. Pressed to choose between them, she becomes a symbol of courage. It happens in ''Valentina,'' a 1981 film playing today and tomorrow at the start of a two-week festival of new Soviet films at the Carnegie Hall Cinema, Seventh Avenue, near 57th Street. A total of 16 films will be presented. Admission is $5. Information: 757-2131. 'VILLAGE' ANTIQUES SHOW Standing eight inches high, a hand-made altar of silver and gold with precious stones, which is thought to come from Mexico and was used for worship at home, will be one of the unusual items offered at the 39th annual Greenwich Village Antiques Show and Sale. It is on today and tomorrow from 1 to 10 P.M. and Sunday from 1 to 7 at Greenwich House, 27 Barrow Street, one block below Sheridan Square. A wide variety of objects, including jewelry and furniture, will fill three floors of the building, and an expert will appraise heirlooms for $10 each today and tomorrow from 4 to 10 P.M. Admission is $3.50. The event is a benefit for the Greenwich House Settlement. Information: 242-4140. Saturday SHLOMO MINTZ AT 92D ST. Shlomo Mintz, the 24-year-old Russian-born Israeli violinist, who is a protege of Isaac Stern, will play sonatas for violin GOG jump and piano Saturday at 8 P.M. in the Kaufmann Concert Hall at the 92d Street Y on Lexington Avenue. The pianist will be Paul Ostrovsky. They will play the Sonatas in A major by Beethoven (Op. 30, No. 1), No. 3 in D minor by Brahms (Op. 108) and No. 1 in F minor by Prokofiev (Op. 80). Tickets are $9 to $12. Chargit: 944-9300. 'JAMAICA JAMBOREE' Musicians, mimes and clowns will entertain all day Saturday at a free ''Jamaica Jamboree'' in Queens. It will take place at the Jamaica Arts Center, 161-04 Jamaica Avenue, and will celebrate the renovation of the landmark building as well as salute the international community of Jamaica. The event will start at 10 A.M. with a children's parade down Jamaica Avenue. A jump-rope team will demonstrate its skills. Delicacies of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean, as well as American food, will be served free from 12:30 to 1:30 P.M. Performers will include Russell Robertson and his Liberation Ensemble, an Afro-American dance theater group, and Lester Fons Bell, a singer and composer. 'THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT' A bridegroom-to-be is asked by his prospective in-laws to prove his legitimacy by showing his parents' ''ketubah,'' a religious marriage document, in ''The Marriage Contract,'' a Yiddish comedy with music, by the Israeli satirist Ephraim Kishon. Marriages in the early days of the State of Israel, it seems, were not always officially recorded, nor were rabbis always present; the young man's search for the ketubah becomes a spoof on social mores in Israel. The play, which will include narration in English, will open Saturday at 8 P.M. at the Folksbiene Playhouse, 123 East 55th Street. Performances also Sundays at 2 and 5:30 P.M. Tickets are $6 to $10.

1281-> COAST SCHOOL ATHLETES MUST HOLD C AVERAGE
All students will have to maintain a C average to participate in extracurricular activities, including athletics, under a new policy approved by the Los Angeles Board of Education. The board's unanimous approval Monday will end a long-standing policy that has allowed student athletes to get through their course load with D-minus averages. Starting next semester, students must maintain a C average in all classes and have no failing marks to participate in such activities as athletics, cheerleading, drill team and student government. Rita Walters, the board member who sponsored the measure, said the policy would end the ''cruel'' practice of implying that star athletes with D and F grades may succeed in life by getting ''college scholarships and being picked up by the pros.'' Alan Gershman, another member of the board, said, ''We must see that all students are capable of reading, communicating successfully, computing and being critical thinkers.'' Some coaches and principals have questioned the C average requirement, arguing that athletics and other extracurricular activities keep some students in school. Under present rules, established by the California Interscholastic Federation, which governs school athletics statewide, a student is eligible to compete if he got four passing grades in the most recent grading period. That could include four D's and two F's. But the state federation, prompted by the growing concern of high school administrators, has begun a review of its standards and may vote on the issue as early as February for implementation in the 1982-83 school year. ---- Local Policy Outlined Bob Terte, a spokesman for New York City's Board of Education, said the policy in New York public schools was that a student must have passed only three subjects, plus physical education, in the most recent previous semester to be eligible for interscholastic athletic competition. There is no grade-average requirement. Mr. Terte said this policy was set by the Public Schools Athletic League, adding that an individual school within the system may impose standards that are more stringent. The Board of Education, he said, has no academic requirements for participation in other extracurricular activities.

1282-> DEFENSE CHIEF PREPARES TO SUBMIT MX MISSILE PROPOSAL TO PRESIDENT
Amid tight secrecy, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger put the final touches today on his recommendation to President Reagan for basing the MX nuclear missiles, apparently in an array of sunken silos built close together. At the same time, skepticism over the basing plan continued to mount as a key adviser to the Reagan Administration expressed doubts on technical grounds, and influential senators prepared political and legislative blockades. The reason for Mr. Weinberger's insistence on secrecy was something of a puzzle, since Defense Department, Air Force and military industry officials were nearly unanimous in saying that Mr. Weinberger had no choice but to recommend the ''closely spaced basing'' plan, as it is officially known. But a few officials, noting increased opposition to the project, were worried that Mr. Weinberger, who has consistently favored mobility for intercontinental missiles over stationary silos in the ground, might come up with something unexpected. Weinberger Termed 'Wild Card' ''The wild card in this is still Caspar Weinberger,'' an industry official said. ''Everyone is concerned that he might lean back in his chair and put his own twist on this.'' Pentagon officials said Mr. Weinberger did little else today but discuss the MX, which means missile experimental. Pentagon and White House officials refused to say whether he had made a formal recommendation. Military officials said Mr. Weinberger attended meetings this morning at the Pentagon and the White House to discuss the MX missile, and later returned to the White House for a meeting of the National Security Council. At issue is a plan for the deployment of 100 missiles in a narrow array about 14 miles long near a military base in Wyoming, Nevada or New Mexico. Each concrete and steel silo would be hardened to withstand airbursts of powerful Soviet nuclear bombs. Advocates say the key to the plan is that explosions from the first enemy warheads would destroy or deflect those that follow in a salvo. They contend that surviving MX missiles could rise through the heat and debris for a retaliatory strike. Nobel Laureate Is Skeptical But the plan has been viewed skeptically by Charles H. Townes, a physicist at the University of California at Berkeley, who headed an advisory panel on the MX. Mr. Townes, winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize in physics, warns that closely spaced basing would still be vulnerable to Soviet attack, officials said. What effect that may have on Mr. Weinberger's thinking is unclear. But associates of Mr. Weinberger say he has expressed admiration for Mr. Townes. On Capitol Hill, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, planned to make public Wednesday a letter asking fellow senators to support an amendment to delete funds for producing the missiles.

1287-> REAGAN SAYS GLOOM AND FEAR COULD STALL RECOVERY
President Reagan cautioned the nation today that economic recovery could be hindered by political opponents and other ''crepe hangers'' spreading a pervasive ''fear that we're adrift.'' ''Well, that's not true,'' the President insisted in his weekly radio address, which was tailored to the final two weeks of the Congressional campaign season and the issue of the economy. Mr. Reagan went a step beyond previous addresses and focused on the psychological factor that economists say is crucial to recovery. He cited President Franklin D. Roosevelt's statement that ''the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,'' made in the depths of the Depression. 'Grief' and 'Pain' Referred to ''Now I'm not just whistling past the graveyard,'' Mr. Reagan said in reference to the Democrats' emphasis on the fact that the nation was suffering the highest unemployment rates since the Depression. ''Nor am I trying to belittle the grief and the pain of you who through no fault of your own are out of work. I'm saying the downbeat chorus we're being subjected to by so many these days can rob us of our courage.'' Once again, the President laid out the Republican campaign argument that the 10.1 percent national unemployment rate is the only one of five major economic problems that the Administration has failed to dent. The rates of Federal spending growth and taxation have been reduced along with inflation and bank lending rates, he said. In quick response, the Democrats counterattacked, contending that the fall in interest rates and in inflation actually reflected a stalled economy that has added three million more people to the unemployment lines since passage of the Reagan economic program. ''Businesses are failing at the fastest rate in 50 years,'' said the Democratic spokesman, Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. ''Over 30 percent of our nation's productive capacity lies idle.'' But Mr. Reagan insisted that once interest rates are driven down to single digits, the unemployment rate, too, would be pushed to single digits and ''We will have delivered a knockout blow to this bitter recession.'' He advised the unemployed to ''hang in there'' and consider the 49-year-old cautioning of Roosevelt against the damaging effects of ''fear itself.'' ''Our No. 1 problem may be fear,'' Mr. Reagan said, ''fear that we're adrift, that there is no plan, that no one is doing anything to make things better.'' Such regular citations of Roosevelt, Mr. Reagan's model as a rhetorician, never fail to gall Democrats who argue that the Reagan Administration has compounded recession problems by cutting social spending programs. Senator Bradley contended that the cuts increased the pain of the jobless without easing Federal budgetary problems. ''Not only has the President been unable to make good on his promise of a balanced budget,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''but if we took all the Federal deficits of every Democratic President going back to President Truman and added them all together, they wouldn't be as high as the deficits Ronald Reagan will give us.'' In delivering the eighth of his Saturday radio addresses, Mr. Reagan spoke from his weekend retreat at Camp David, Md. White House officials have no precise count of the stations that broadcast the talks nor of the audience size. But they say the broadcasts reach a sizable attentive minority of the nation, including those who listen to ''all news'' stations as they drive on Saturday errands. Strategists concede that the addresses are also aimed at dominating the Sunday newspapers and the following week's political agenda. The President's advisers feel they now have their strongest arguments in place as they face the mid-term elections and attempt to reduce House losses and preserve the President's coalition. Today the President repeated one of his contentions from Wednesday's television address on the economy. ''At my age I didn't come to Washington to play politics as usual or sweep problems under the rug,'' said the 71-year-old Mr. Reagan. ''I came here to solve problems.''

Seton Hall Prep evened its record at 2-2 with a 24-0 victory against East Orange (1-3) in South Orange. Semos Gardner led the way with touchdown runs of 6 and 2 yards in the first half. John Stephens, a junior quarterback, took over in the second half with touchdown passes of 35 and 40 yards to Ray Guzzi. Stephens completed 6 of 9 passes for 150 yards as Seton Hall had a total offense of 300 yards. Columbia (3-1) showed a balanced offense as three players scored touchdowns in 21-8 victory over Roxbury (1-3) in Maplewood. Ron Downey, a senior halfback, who rushed for 170 yards, scored on a 42-yard run and Dave Sherwood passed to Darren Rice for the 2-point conversion as Columbia grabbed an 8-0 lead in the second quarter. Sherwood completed a 17-yard touchdown pass to Bill Coyle in the third quarter and Steve Peniston scored on a 67-yard run in the fourth quarter for Columbia. Roxbury got its touchdown in the third period when Pete Bartek passed 29 yards to Bruce Campbell. Columbia had 361 yards total offense and held Roxbury to 67 yards. Summit (3-0) extended its winning streak to 14 games with a 7-0 victory over Summit (3-1) in West Caldwell. The touchdown came in the opening period with a 13-play, 71-yard drive that was bapped by Jeff Tino's 4-yard run. Silvio Bonvini added the extra point for Caldwell, the 1981 North Jersey Section 2 Group 3 state champion. It was the fifth time Caldwell has beaten Summit in regular-season play. Reason Smith led a strong, second-half running attack with two touchdowns and paced Snyder (5-0) to a 26-7 victory against Hoboken (0-4) in Hoboken. Smith scored on a 5-yard run and returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown in the second half for Snyder. Greg Stevens, who rushed for 105 yards, scored on a 6-yard run in the fourth quarter. After a scoreless first half, the teams traded third-quarter touchdowns. Rod Galarza of Hoboken grabbed a 15-yard touchdown pass from Steve Azzoline. Rob Grafton of Snyder caught an 18-yarder from Larry Rodgers. Mike Ritchie, a fullback, scored two touchdowns on runs and another on a pass as Park Ridge (4-0) defeated Harrison (2-2), 38-0, in Harrison. Ritchie, who ran 16 times for 164 yards and caught two passes for 54 yards, scored on a 22-yard run in the first quarter, a 40-yard run in the second quarter and received a 30-yard pass from Alex Pirsos in the third quarter.

EXCERPTS FROM ANDROPOV'S SPEECH TO THE SOVIET PARTY'S CENTRAL; COMMITTEE MOSCOW, Nov. 22 (AP) - Following are excerpts from a speech by the Soviet Communist Party leader, Yuri V. Andropov, to the party's Central Committee today, as translated and distributed by the Soviet press agency Tass: MOSCOW, Nov. 22 (AP) - Following are excerpts from a speech by the Soviet Communist Party leader, Yuri V. Andropov, to the party's Central Committee today, as translated and distributed by the Soviet press agency Tass: The Political Bureau has considered and considers it compulsory, particularly in the present-day international situation, to provide the army and the navy with everything necessary. The draft budget insures the financing of the economy and sociocultural development. The chief indicator of the economy's efficiency - labor productivity -grows at a rate that cannot satisfy us. Conditions, both economic and organizational, should be provided to encourage quality and productive work, initiative and enterprise. A good deal has been said lately about the need to extend the independence of amalgamations, enterprises and collective and state farms. The time seems to have come to tackle this problem in practice. The Politbureau has instructed the Council of Ministers and the State Planning Committee on this score. It is necessary to conduct experiments if need be, to make appraisals and to take account of the experience of fraternal countries. It is necessary to create a situation in which those who boldly introduce new technology do not find themselves at a disadvantage. Soviet Foreign Policy The death of Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev caused abroad a lot of conjecture concerning the future policy of the C.P.S.U. and the Soviet state in international affairs. Just think how many attempts have been made in recent years to ascribe to the Soviet Union all kinds of sinister intentions, to portray our policy as an aggressive one jeopardizing the security of now one state, now another. But now it turns out that they worry lest this policy might be changed. The continuation of this policy is seen as an important precondition for peace and tranquility in the international arena. We think that the difficulties and tension characteristic of the present international situation can and must be overcome. Mankind cannot endlessly put up with the arms race and with wars unless it wants to put its future at stake. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union does not want the dispute of ideas to grow into a confrontation between states and peoples, it does not want arms and the readiness to use them to become a gauge of the potentials of the social system. The aggressive designs of imperialism compel us, together with the fraternal socialist states, to show concern, and in earnest at that, for maintaining our defense capability at a proper level. But, as was stressed by Leonid Ilyich more than once, military rivalry is not our choice. The ideal of socialism is a world without arms. The primary concern of our party will continue to be the strengthening of the socialist community. In unity lies our strength. Ties With Other Nations The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state sincerely wish for the development and improvement of relations with all socialist countries. Mutual good will, respect for each other's legitimate interests and common concern for the interests of socialism and peace should prompt correct solutions also there, where appropriate trust and mutual understanding are still lacking for various reasons. This also refers to our great neighbor, the People's Republic of China. The ideas formulated by Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev in his speeches in Tashkent and Baku, the emphasis he put on common sense, on the need to overcome the inertia of prejudices, expressed the conviction of all our party, its desire to look ahead. We pay great attention to every positive response to this from the Chinese side. The importance of the group of states that created the nonaligned movement is growing in international life. With many of them the Soviet Union has all-round friendly ties that benefit both sides and make for greater stability in the world. One example of this is the Soviet Union's relations with India. Solidarity with the states which have gained freedom from colonial oppression, with the peoples who are upholding their independence, has been and remains one of the fundamental principles of Soviet foreign policy. Since the early days of Soviet power our state has been invariably expressing readiness for open, honest cooperation with all countries that reciprocate these sentiments. Differences in the social systems must be no obstacle to this, and they are no obstacle where there is good will on both sides. This is borne out convincingly by the marked progress in the development of the Soviet Union's peaceful cooperation with many West European countries. Policy of Detente We are deeply convinced that the 70's, characterized by detente, were not - as is asserted today by certain imperialist leaders - a chance episode in the difficult history of mankind. No, the policy of detente is by no means a past stage. The future belongs to this policy. All are equally interested in preserving peace and detente. Therefore, statements in which the readiness for normalizing relations is linked with the demand that the Soviet Union pay for this with some sort of preliminary concessions in different fields do not sound serious, to say the least. We shall not agree to this and, properly speaking, we have nothing to cancel. We did not introduce sanctions against anyone, we did not denounce treaties and agreements that were signed, and we did not interrupt talks that were started. I should like to stress once more that the Soviet Union stands for accord, but this should be sought on the basis of reciprocity and equality. In our opinion the point of talks with the U.S.A. and other Western countries, primarily on questions of restraining the arms race, does not lie in the statement of differences. For us, talks are a way of joining efforts by different states in order to achieve results useful to all sides. The problems will not disappear by themselves if the talks are held for the sake of talks, as it unfortunately happens not infrequently. We are for the search of a healthy basis, acceptable to the sides concerned, for a settlement of most complicated problems, especially, of course, the problems of curbing the arms race, involving both nuclear and conventional arms. But let no one expect a unilateral disarmament from us. We are not naive people. We do not demand unilateral disarmament from the West. We are for equality, for consideration for the interests of both sides, for honest agreement. We are ready for this. Nuclear Arms Freeze As to the nuclear strategic arms possessed by the U.S.S.R and the U.S.A., the Soviet Union, as is known, agrees that the two sides should, as the first step on the way to a future agreement, freeze their arsenals and thus create more favorable conditions for the continuation of talks on the mutual reduction of these weapons. Generally speaking, the Soviet Union rejects the viewpoint of those who are trying to impress on people the idea that force, arms, decide and will always decide everything. Today as never before the peoples come to the forefront of history. They have gained the right to have their say, and their voice will not be muffled by anyone. They are capable of removing, by vigorous and purposeful actions, the threat of nuclear war, safeguarding peace and hence life on this planet. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Soviet state, will do everything possible that this should be so.

1292-> CONCERT: URSULA OPPENS WITH PAUL ZUKOFSKY
The standard 19th-century repertory can often sound quite standard indeed. While two generations ago, a wide variety of musical styles could be heard, today, most players play most music quite similarly, and compositions have accumulated a century of received performance manners. Partly in reaction to this situation, the pianist Ursula Oppens and the violinist Paul Zukofsky decided to re-examine the Beethoven Violin Sonatas in a series of three concerts at Symphony Space, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday nights. The two instrumentalists, who are accustomed to challenging the mainstream through their distinguished interpretations of contemporary works, also mean to challenge the performance tradition with their reinterpretations of Beethoven. They share, then, with the ''authenticity'' movement, an opposition to received wisdom and an assertion that there is a source for new understanding - the text itself. By considering Beethoven's metronome markings in the symphonies, the string quartets and the ''Hammerklavier'' Sonata, and by studying his phrase markings in the manuscript - some of which differ substantially even from those in ''Urtext'' editions - the players decided that accepted tempos were too slow. As they explain in their notes, a slow tempo can make the dynamics more exaggerated; it can distend a phrase so it becomes unclear; it can even enforce regularity on the music, minimizing the effect of irregular 5-, 3- or 1-bar breaths. At an appropriate tempo, the players assert, the phrase markings can even be used to define violin bowings; musical gestures and instrumental gestures could coincide. And in fact, the familiar lugubrious tempos for Beethoven Adagios, with all their ''sensitive'' swells and rubatos, do indeed cloud Beethoven's structural drama. But the case in sound, on Tuesday night, was only intermittently convincing. Thus, the Sonata in A (Op. 12, No. 2) was cleaned of standard introspection; it was scaled down, controlled in dynamics, with phrases clearly marked, sounding almost Pointillistic. The opening movement of the ''Kreutzer'' Sonata, showed the two artists at their best, scrupulous with detail, yet furious with an almost stringent determination. Yet the players' case was almost undermined by dedication to the idea. The ''Adagio molto espressivo'' of the Opus 30, No. 1 sonata was almost a strolling andante, full of fine effects; but its figuration was too light, too quivering, for the twists of the modulations and melody. And the variations of the ''Kreutzer'' instead of accumulating detail and force, were often breathless and pressured. Too much harmonic and melodic detail unfolded too quickly. That made a listener wish the players had less of a case to make. But when made by two of our most intelligent and insightful players, even failures provoke reconsideration of the music. Given today's standard performances of standard repertory, that, in itself, must be considered a success. Edward Rothstein

1293-> News Summary; TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 23, 1982
International A ''dense pack'' deployment of the MX intercontinental missile was urged by President Reagan to modernize American nuclear forces, but he said he was also committed to seeking sharp reductions in strategic arms by mutual agreement with Moscow. Mr. Reagan presented his plan in a nationally televised speech six hours after his Administration announced it planned to base the proposed MX missile next to an Air Force base outside Cheyenne, Wyo. (Page A1, Column 6.) President Reagan urged Congress to give sympathetic consideration to his proposed MX missile basing plan, but it is certain to face substantial Congressional opposition. The immediate reaction in Congress ranged from skepticism by conservatives to opposition by liberals. (A1:4-5.)

1294-> SALVADOR REBELS SEEM TO BE COORDINATING ATTACKS
The increased level of fighting this week in El Salvador's civil war may be an indication that this country's guerrilla factions are acting with greater coordination than they have in months, some military officials here believe. Guerrilla actions have been reported this week in at least half of this country's 14 provinces, and leftists continued today to hold several small towns despite efforts by the military to dislodge them. A number of bombings Friday night disrupted electricity in parts of San Salvador for several hours, and there were reports of minor clashes between guerrillas and civil defense forces on the outskirts of the capital. The ultimate goal of this new wave of attacks is unclear. But while no one is sure how long the guerrillas can sustain their assault, their actions tend to cast doubt on an assessment earlier this week by the Defense Minister, Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia, that the leftists were in their ''death throes.'' Third Anniversary of Coup The new wave of guerrilla attacks began last Tuesday, after months of relative quiet. They were apparently timed to coincide with the third anniversary of the Oct. 15, 1979, coup that toppled the military Government of Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero and replaced it with a military-civilian junta. While the leftists have thus far failed to capture any of the country's major cities, and there is no material evidence to link the recent assaults, the renewed and widespread attacks are seen as a sign that at least some of the guerrilla factions have improved their level of coordination. ''It would appear they have their act together better than before,'' a military analyst said here this week. For example, major guerrilla operations are under way in both Chalatenango Province in the north and Morazan Province in the east of the country. Leftist action in Chalatenango has traditionally been the domain of the People's Liberation Forces, and in Morazan that of the People's Revolutionary Army, two factions that have had differing views of how to conduct the guerrilla war. It has been rare in the past for fighting to flare in these two areas at the same time. Guerrillas Apparently Resupplied During last March's elections, when leftists promised nationwide disruptions of the voting process, Morazan was plagued by guerrilla action while Chalatenango remained relatively quiet. But this week Government forces have been drawn into battles in both places with the guerrilla forces, which have apparently been resupplied since their setbacks earlier this year. There have been reports of casualties on both sides, but reliable figures are difficult obtain here. Government troops were reported to be trying to eject the guerrillas from Perquin, Torola and San Fernando, three towns in northwestern Morazan taken by the leftists earlier this week. Another detachment of 5,000 Government troops was sent into Chalatenango, where guerrillas were reported to be holding the towns of Las Vueltas and El Jicaro. They were withdrawn Friday, and were expected to make another attempt to retake the captured areas in the next few days. Attacks on 2 Major Highways In addition, leftist raids were reported in the province of Cabanas, and guerrillas have been staging scattered attacks on the Pan American Highway and the coastal highway, the two major roads linking the southeastern agricultural districts to the capital. These could become of increasing importance as the time for harvest of El Salvador's major crops - coffee, sugar cane and cotton - approaches. The leftists, through their clandestine radio station, Radio Venceremos, have been calling for negotiations with the Government. But the Government, callng the huge turnout in last March's elections a repudiation of the left, has been demanding that they halt hostilities. This demand was repeated Friday by the interim President, Alvaro Magana.

1296-> LAWMAKERS CHALLENGE PLANNED MEDICARE SHIFT
Members of Congress made it clear today that they wanted to make substantial changes in the Reagan Administration's proposal to pay hospitals a set fee for treating all Medicare patients who have the same ailment. The lawmakers, members of the health subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, praised the Administration for its step toward controlling hospital costs, but criticized the proposal as inflexible and perhaps inequitable. The proposal received public scrutiny for the first time at a hearing of the committee. Alice M. Rivlin, director of the Congressional Budget Office, as well as spokesmen for the elderly and for public hospitals expressed similar concerns. They said the Administration proposal did not go far enough because it would limit charges only for Medicare patients, thus permitting hospitals to shift costs to patients covered by Blue Cross or commercial insurance. Medicare finances health care for 26 million elderly and three million disabled Americans. The cost this year is expected to exceed $55 billion. Over the last three years the amount spent by the program on hospital services has increased by 19 percent a year, according to Federal officials. Under current Medicare rules, hospitals are generally reimbursed for all reasonable costs they incur, with no limit on procedures and tests related to a particular ailment. U.S. Move Called Justified Carolyne K. Davis, head of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said the Government was justified in setting Medicare payment levels because it wanted to be a ''prudent buyer'' and had a legal responsibility for the hospital insurance trust fund, from which Medicare pays hospitals. She said there was no such justification for the Federal Government to audit and regulate spending by private insurers at this time. Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, chairman of the health subcommittee, said he was concerned that the Reagan Administration proposal would move the country toward ''a two-track system of health care, one for the elderly and poor; one for the rest of the nation.'' He said the result might be ''second-class medicine for public patients.'' Mr. Waxman said Medicare and Medicaid were established 17 years ago in the hope of giving the elderly and the poor access to standard, ''mainstream'' medical care. Mrs. Rivlin said that if the plan is adopted, hospitals might tend to specialize in serving either private patients, most of whom are well-insured, or Medicare and Medicaid patients. In that case, she said, the public patients ''could end up with access only to a less expensive, possibly inferior, style of care.'' By contrast, she said, when the same reimbursement limits are applied to private and public patients, it is possible to ''spread the costs of delivering care to the indigent across a wider range of payers.'' 467 Payment Groups Proposed The Administration proposal would classify each patient into one of 467 ''diagnosis-related groups.'' The Government would pay hospitals virtually the same amount for any patient with a particular diagnosis, regardless of how long he or she remained under care. Federal officials have said this system will give hospitals strong new incentives to control costs because a hospital would be able to keep any surplus payment, but would have to bear any expense that exceeded the Government reimbursement. Representative Ronald L. Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said he was concerned that such an approach would ''encourage hospitals to turn away less desirable patients who need costly or long-term care.'' He added that he wanted to give the local authorities discretion to try other payment systems that might save as much money as the Administration's proposal. ''I am concerned that if there is only one uniform reporting system for the entire country, state and local concerns will not be addressed,'' Mr. Wyden said. Under the Administration proposal, hospitals could not bill patients for the difference between their normal charges and the standard Medicare payments. Jack Owen, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said hospitals should have ''the option'' to do so.

1297-> AROUND THE WORLD
The State Department said today that a new education tax Rumania has imposed on applicants for visas to emigrate could ''gravely jeopardize'' the preferential tariff treatment Rumania receives on its exports to the United States. ''The education tax appears to be a burden that will run into the tens of thousands of dollars in hard currency for those Rumanian citizens who have received free education through the secondary, university and graduate school levels,'' said John Hughes, the State Department spokesman.

1298-> THE REGION; Turnpike Tokens For Connecticut
Connecticut Turnpike commuters began using tokens for the first time today at the eight toll plazas between New York and Rhode Island. The tokens will allow the use of more automatic lanes to speed traffic. ''Things are moving beautifully,'' said William Scholl, assistant toll operations manager at the West Haven toll booths. He noted that many commuters were still using the present commuter tickets that must be collected by hand. The new tokens cost 17.5 cents each, half the usual 35-cent charge. Mr. Scholl said about 800,000 tokens were sold in advance. They can be used at any time and at all toll stations. But the tokens are not good on the Merritt and Wilbur Cross Parkways or the three Hartfordarea toll bridges.

1299-> COMPUTER SYSTEM PAYING OFF FOR JERSEY HOSPITALS
New Jersey hospital officials say that a new way of paying hospitals for patient care has reduced waste and increased efficiency by shortening patients' hospital stays. The new system being tested in New Jersey pays hospitals a fixed price for each case rather than an average daily rate for all patients. It is part of a three-year federally sponsored demonstration project. The project is the prototype of a new system proposed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Richard W. Schweiker, to pay hospitals for elderly patients under the Federal Medicare program. New Jersey health officials and institutions such as Morristown Memorial Hospital report that the experiment has already demonstrated that reimbursement based on specific illnesses and procedures and then paid in advance has produced significant improvements. Measures Intensity of Care ''It may not be a perfect system,'' said Donald Bradley, the hospital's president. ''But it promises to contain health care costs, while insuring quality, more than any other system we have seen. This is because the payment mechanism measures and rewards the intensity of care, and not how much time it takes.'' ''It offers us the opportunity to study a specific disease in terms of how it is managed, the cost of its management, and the utilization of health resources resulting from that management,'' he said. For example, surgery for removing a gall bladder used to require from 10 to 14 days of hospitilzation, and an appendectomy, a five- to seven-day stay. Since the hospital is now receiving a flat rate for either procedure, care has been intensified and the average length of stay has been cut by a full day. Hospitals also will know what they will be paid a year in advance. This means that they have no further incentive to escalate their costs to generate more income. If hospitals reduce costs, the new system will reward them by allowing them to keep what they save. Hospital Stays Reduced Hospital costs in New Jersey rose last year by 13.8 percent, compared with the national increase of 18.7 percent. State health officials also say the system saved millions of dollars in its first year by reducing the average length of hospital stays to seven days from 7.9. While the new system has created controversy and confusion among hospital administrators and physicians, most patients have no idea it exists. This is because government insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid and private ones like Blue Cross pay most hospital bills for patients they cover and the new system is simply a computerized bookkeeping mechanism they employ. Under the demonstration project, New Jersey's 100 or so hospitals are receiving a specific payment for each illness - so much for an appendectomy, or so much for the medical care involved in a heart attack. The new system replaces a far more conventional system under which hospitals were paid a uniform daily rate based on the average cost of all the patients they care for. Paid on Piecework Basis In other words, New Jersey hospitals are now being paid on a piecework basis - a precise amount for the care they provide for each specific case - and not according to the length of time a patient is hospitalized. ''The new system,'' said Thomas J. Foley, the president of Overlook Hospital in nearby Summit, ''encourages physicians to stop keeping patients hospitalized longer than they should because the financial incentives have been removed.'' While many New Jersey hospitals initially resisted the new system, hospitals such as Morristown Memorial embraced it. For one thing, officials of the Morristown hospital said, the system has helped transform traditional patient medical charts into financial statements that have wide medical and economic implications. For example, Mr. Bradley said printouts from the system's computer identify physicians who are keeping patients hospitalized longer than they should, as well as doctors who are ordering unnecessary tests and prescribing too many drugs. Printouts Trace Costs ''Doctors have never been trained to save money,'' said Dr. Robert Ambrose, the hospital's medical director. ''In fact, they're taught the opposite in the name of doing everything for the patient.'' ''With these printouts,'' he said, ''I can go to a doctor and show him that he is spending $1,000 more than every other doctor for a particular procedure. Doctors now know what everyone else spends and can react accordingly.'' At Morristown, the system has lowered the average length of stay of 7.3 days in 1980 to 6.8 days in July. This has enabled the hospital to increase its revenues by intensifying its services. Charles P. Teasenfitz, a State Health Department economist, said that, sooner or later, most hospitals would be required to use computers and that New Jersey's smaller hospitals that could not afford one of their own could join others in sharing one. Under the new system, health planners have devised 467 ''diagnostic related groups'' that pigeonhole just about every conceivable surgical procedure and illness. The price tag for each group, which officials call a D.R.G., represents the average predicted cost of treating the particular illness at every hospital in New Jersey. However, each hospital receives a D.R.G. payment that reflects its own level of sophistication. A teaching hospital such as Morristown, for example, receives a higher D.R.G. payment to reflect the added costs of its education programs. Caused Quite a Stir But the hospital's administrators concede that their high technology was not enough to justify receiving $6,313.20 to fix a broken finger shortly after the new system was installed two years ago. The payment was for inserting a pin into a patient's broken finger, a minor surgical procedure that usually costs about $800. Subsequent modifications in the system have virtually eliminated such overpayments. But it did cause quite a stir at the time, and hospital insurers still believe they could be financially victimized again. According to Mr. Bradley, the high charge resulted when the case was fed into the hospital's D.R.G computer. Because there is no D.R.G. category for placing a pin in a broken finger, the computer automatically placed the case into the D.R.G. group of ''fracture, with major surgery'' - with a price tag of $4,931.20. The price did not include physician fees of $1,382. Such fees continue to be paid separately and are not included in D.R.G. payments. To avoid these kinds of aberrations in the future, the programming was changed so that cases such as the broken finger are automatically ''kicked out'' by the computer. About 20 percent of all cases fall out of the D.R.G. categories in this way and they are paid by insurers on the much simpler basis of the hospital submitting a bill for each case. For example, a patient is treated for tendonitis, a D.R.G. group that pays Morristown $1,480.37. The projected length of stay for cases of tendonitis is 5.5 days. But if there is a major complication and the patient stays more than 11 days, or if the case is uncommonly easy and requires only two days of hospitalization, it is rejected as a D.R.G. case, and the bill is paid conventionally by insurers.

1300-> SPORTS OF THE TIMES; TWO OLD TOWNS WITH NEW FACES
THE embers from Friday night's tailgate party had barely burned out when the next wave of Brewer fans squirted lighter fluid on the bricquets yesterday morning. The fans were just as resilient as the players. They have raised the standards of tailgate parties in the major leagues, just as their team has set a high standard for rallies. The Brewers roared back from a two-game deficit in the American League championship series, and yesterday they roared back from a 5-2 deficit to tie this refreshing Midwestern World Series with a 7-5 victory. They showed good taste in their brunch tailgate parties yesterday. We're not talking hamburgers and hot dogs; we're talking china dishes, roses in vases, fresh crudites and marinated beef and fresh country sausages. Their taste was just as good in the ball park, where they never turned sour on their team, even when the Cardinals took a four-run lead into the seventh inning. The loyalty re-enforced the impression of a Series hearty in aromas and good humor, a homecoming week for two grand old baseball towns in the first Midwestern Series since Detroit beat St. Louis in 1968. Bowie Kuhn, who may be presiding over his last Series a few weeks before the daggers are unsheathed by a minority of owners, pronounced this beer-city matchup ''good for baseball.'' And he was right. It is certainly refreshing to have a Series away from the Clockwork Orange atmosphere of Yankee Stadium. It is also refreshing to have new heroes emerge: Willie McGee escaping from the Yankees' Kollege of Klubhouse Knowledge to hit two home runs and steal an enemy home run as he did in the Cardinals' 6-2 victory Friday night; Gorman Thomas slashing the game-winning hit yesterday. ''I think it's just great that we've got some new blood,'' says Cecil Cooper, who hit a two-run homer for the Brewers Friday night and tied yesterday's game with an infield single. ''Every year we get the Dodgers and the Yankees. It's good to have some players people don't see much.'' Even overlooking Cooper's five games with the Red Sox in the 1975 Series, he is absolutely right. There is nothing against Reggie Jackson, Steve Garvey, Pete Rose and the other heroes of recent Octobers, but Joaquin Andujar's tense expressions and Mike Caldwell's unshaven mug are refreshing in America's most traditional sporting event. The networks and their ratings people might groan about the absence of the New York-Los Angeles connection, but a St. Louis-Milwaukee matchup seemed just about perfect here yesterday in a nippy, sunny 47 degrees, with haunting fall colors on the hill behind right field and an American Gothic cupola of a Veterans Administration hospital towering above the trees. Even the managers are perfect for a Midwestern Series. Harvey Kuenn is a native son of Milwaukee - people still talk about his 52-yard dropkicked field goal for Lutheran High - who lives behind his wife's family bar. Kuenn may not be the most activist manager in the business. What in the world was Pete Vuckovich doing wearing down his arm Friday night, and does the Designated-Hitter League have any rule against managers and coaches coming out to steady a shaky pitcher like Moose Haas early yesterday? Nevertheless, Kuenn has enough courage for an entire division of ball teams, and he did get this city into its first Series since the Braves moved south. Milwaukee has been fortunate in having Kuenn and George Bamberger manage during baseball's renaissance here. They have been perfect men to pilot a team in this pleasant dell a few miles west of downtown. Walking through the tailgate parties this morning, hearing the sizzle of steaks and the popping of beer cans, one could picture Bamberger strolling from tailgate to tailgate, and growling, ''Well, who would you have pitched, huh?'' St. Louis also has a son of the Midwest, Whitey Herzog, born in New Athens, Ill., and now residing in Independence, Mo. It seems fitting for Tom Sawyer Country that Herzog frequently rises before dawn and goes fishing when the Cardinals are home. The two cities have responded to the Series in character. Busch Stadium, located smack in downtown St. Louis, does not lend itself to tailgate parties, but it is nice to see fans in red jackets and caps surging across city streets below the Arch. St. Louis is a great old baseball town, where journalists still write entire Series columns on the Gashouse Gang and Harry (the Cat) Brecheen, and make it seem almost relevant to the current gang wearing the bright redbird on their uniform fronts. The conservatism of the city was reflected by fans who were silent in the 10-0, firstgame loss and came to life only when the team rallied to win the second game. There was also something exciting about the team of Clydesdales pacing round the stadium with Gussie Busch sitting on the top seat of the elegant carriage. This was no fuzzy, pesty television-age mascot, but a real team of horses from Busch's Grant Farm. St. Louis had its share of bright red banners, but Milwaukee seems to have more blue-and-gold Brewer banners. The handsome, old Art Museum in Forest Park had no indication of the Series held downtown (even though a trustee, Ted Simmons, was catching for the Brewers), but the contemporary Milwaukee Museum of Art alongside Lake Michigan displayed a graphic banner that said: ''Artists on the Field: Go Brewers.'' A tailgate party at County Stadium Thursday night, when there was not even a game, drew 25,000 fans, and the management had to turn out the lights in the parking lot before people even considered going home. Only the palimony suit against the native-son Liberace (born in West Allis, Wis.) vied with the Series for front-page space here. After their elaborate tailgate meals, Brewer fans are thoroughly fueled for the games. Yesterday they never lost heart after the home team had fallen behind. The roar at Paul Molitor's walk and Robin Yount's checked-swing single in the seventh must have had some influence on the Cardinal wobbles. And the nicest thing was that no owners had thrown punches in an elevator or issued grubby apologies to their fans in trying to live up to some grandiose Big Apple expectations. It was a baseball game in the sunlight in the Midwest, and it was lovely.

1302-> Maid Service Is Ended On Williams Campus
Maid service has been discontinued at Williams College, leaving students to vacuum and dust their own dormitory rooms. Wendy Hopkins, the student housing director, said the service was stopped this fall, ending a two-year reduction of the program that once hired 19 matrons to clean student rooms once a week. ''The students have been most understanding and realize it's a cost-saving move,'' she said. ''They don't seem to mind doing their own cleaning, and we're working out a program to provide access to vacuum cleaners.'' But the student newspaper, The Williams Record, said not all were happy. ''I hate it,'' complained Alison Ashley, a sophomore. ''It made the school unique. Not many people here have the time to clean there rooms. It made me feel good to walk into my room after a hard day of classes and lab and find it tidy.'' Jeff Mook, a senior, did not mind. ''Not having them saves money, and it is just as easy to clean your room yourself if there is an accessible vacuum cleaner,'' he said. ''Besides, they used to come at inopportune times.''

1303-> NOISE POSES A GROWING THREAT, AFFECTING HEARING AND BEHAVIOR
IN trying to track a suspected Soviet submarine last month, the Swedish Navy had difficulty finding sailors who could hear well enough to operate the listening devices. The hearing of vast numbers of young people, a Navy captain said, apparently has been permanently damaged by years of listening to loud rock music. Whether or not music is the culprit in Sweden, similar hearing losses have been noted among American high school and college students who are rock music aficionados or frequent discotheques, and hearing loss resulting from abusive noise has become a matter of pressing concern in this country, too. For example, Dr. David Lipscomb, head of the noise laboratory at the University of Tennessee, recently found that more than 60 percent of 1,410 college freshmen had significant hearing loss in the high-frequency range, a deficit he believes is increasing at an alarming rate. Just one year earlier he had found high-frequency hearing loss in 33 percent of the freshmen tested. He described the students as ''two or three decades ahead of themselves in hearing deterioration.'' A Japanese survey this year of 4,500 students revealed unexplained hearing difficulties in 29, 21 of whom were described as ''headphone addicts.'' These 21 students listened to stereo headphones (Sony Walkmans and the like) for more than 24 hours a week at volumes that averaged 88 decibels, the approximate noise level of rush-hour traffic. While noisy work environments have long been the focus of research and regulatory efforts, in recent years avocational noise has been attracting more attention. The explosive rise of noisy equipment in and out of American homes - ranging from snowmobiles, rock bands and chain saws to hair dryers, food processors and stereo headphones - has made nearly every American potentially vulnerable to noise damage. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated in 1978 that 10 million Americans are exposed to harmful levels of noise off the job. Other experts say this is a highly conservative figure. In addition to those who voluntarily expose themselves to high noise levels, such unwitting victims as premature infants in incubators, residents who live near airports and students whose classrooms abut train tracks may suffer noise damage. And the damage incurred may involve far more than hearing acuity. Though more and better research is needed to define precisely the nonacoustical harm caused by noise, studies thus far suggest that noise stress can result in high blood pressure, cardiovascular injury, ulcers, and possibly even increased susceptibility to infection and reproductive problems. Other studies have pointed to noise-related learning difficulties, irritability, fatigue, reduced work efficiency, increased accidents and errors and socially undesirable behavior. One series of experiments showed, for example, that passers-by were much less likely to help a stranger who had dropped his books if there was a power lawn mower operating nearby than if the lawn mower's motor was turned off. In another experiment, angered subjects acted more aggressively after being exposed to noise that they could not control. Such findings raise important questions about the possible contribution of noise to illness, antisocial behavior and interpersonal conflicts at a time when noise levels are increasing for millions of Americans. However, one leading investigator, Dr. Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, says ''there's very little research on the effects of noise being done in this country right now because the Administration has no interest in it.'' Effects of Noise Stress Last year, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences said that existing studies of the effects of noise on health suggested serious harm, especially to the cardiovascular system, and called for more careful investigation. The committee noted that the stress of noise ''might alter the organism's capacity to withstand insults from other physical agents or environmental contaminants.'' A number of findings have already been fairly well documented, including these: - Among at least 40 studies linking noise exposure to increases in blood pressure, Dr. Ernest A. Peterson and colleagues at the University of Miami School of Medicine showed that monkeys developed sustained high blood pressure after being exposed for nine months to patterns and levels of noise that are frequently encountered by people.The noise levels studied were below those that can damage hearing. - Dr. Cohen and his former colleagues at the University of Oregon showed that children whose schools were along the flight path of Los Angeles International Airport had higher blood pressure than similar children attending quiet schools. The noise-affected children also had more difficulty solving puzzles and math problems and were quicker to give up in frustration. Furthermore, as time passed, no improvement was seen in the noise-related effects on the children's abilities. - High levels of noise in the home, from television sets, radios and other sources, were shown to disrupt the development of sensory and motor skills of children during the first two years of life. Babies living in noisy homes were slower to imitate adult actions and persisted in infantile habits longer than babies in quieter homes. Noise also delayed verbal development and exploratory behavior. The researcher, Dr. Theodore D. Wachs, a psychologist at Purdue University, believes that noise stress prompts babies to retreat into their own inner space. - A University of Wisconsin study showed that noise produced in the home by arguing, shouting, vent fans, garbage disposals, electric mixers, knife sharpeners and running faucets produced a state of heightened body arousal and general nervous tension. Dr. Jack C. Westman, a Wisconsin psychiatrist, believes that home noise contributes to noise-related health damage and to conflicts between family members. A series of European studies indicated that workers exposed to noise were more likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms, balance disturbances, circulatory ailments and ulcers. The workers complained more often of fatigue and irritability, and they reported more social conflicts on the job and at home. Studies in Britain and the United States suggested that people living in noisy areas, such as in airport flight paths, suffered more emotional disturbances and required medical treatment more often than those living in quieter areas. But according to Dr. Cohen and others, all these studies suffer from methodological problems, primarily the failure to take into account other factors, such as age, socioeconomic status and various on-the-job stresses, that could have influenced the effects attributed to noise. Sound is measured in decibels, a scale that increases logarithmically. Zero decibels is the lowest level of sound that a young, healthy human ear can detect. A level of 140 decibels (a shotgun blast or jet takeoff) can be extremely painful. A rise of 10 decibels is perceived by the human ear as a doubling of loudness. The most frequently used decibel scale, called dBA, measures perceived loudness by giving more weight to high-frequency sounds, which seem louder to people than the same intensity of low-frequency sounds. Injury Without Discomfort Thus, the 100 dB sound of a power lawn mower or snowmobile is twice as loud as the 90 dB sound of a train roaring into a subway station. Dr. Maurice H. Miller, professor of audiology at New York University and chief audiological consultant at Lenox Hill Hospital and the New York City Department of Health, points out that noise well below the level of discomfort or pain can damage hearing. Hearing loss will occur in 20 to 25 percent of workers exposed to the allowable limit of 90 decibels for eight hours a day (the loudness of street traffic or a heavy-duty truck). Under the newest Federal regulations, employers must establish hearing conservation programs for all workers regularly exposed to noise levels of 85 decibels or more. Repeated exposure to loud noise destroys the delicate hair cells in the Organ of Corti, a part of the cochlea in the inner ear. These cells are responsible for picking up sound-induced pressure waves and transmitting them to nerve cells, which in turn carry them to the brain. Fight-or-Flight Evoked Sounds follow two paths into the brain. One path carries sound to the auditory center where it is perceived and interpreted. The other goes to an activating-regulating center in the brain called the reticular formation and then on to the brain centers that turn on the autonomic nervous system. The latter path is responsible for the wide range of nonaural effects of noise because it calls into play the classic fight-or-flight response to stress: arousal, increased heart rate and blood pressure, constriction of small blood vessels in the extremities, redirection of blood flow away from the skin and digestive organs and to the brain and muscles, muscular contraction, release of stress-related hormones from the adrenal glands, dry mouth, dilated pupils and subjective feelings of tension, excitement and anxiety. This stress reaction to sound is believed to be an evolutionary holdover from preindustrial times when loud sounds usually meant trouble - a roaring lion, falling rock or injured kinsman. The stress response enabled people to survive the danger by helping them either to run away or fight. Noise researchers have found that most people get used to a sound that they hear often and know is not a cause for alarm, but their internal stress reaction continues unabated. Thus, if you live near train tracks, after a week or so you may no longer be awakened by passing trains. But internal reactions to the noise still occur and may eventually accumulate to cause bodily damage. Dr. Miller suggested that people who never become habituated to noise ''may be better off because they tend to avoid noisy environments.''

1304-> OBSERVER; Back Off A Little, Kiddies
Speaking as one who looks forward to many years of happiness on Social Security, I want to urge the increasingly surly youth of America to stop whining about their obligation to finance me through old age and start thinking about what they must do to make their own future happy. A young whippersnapper writing in The Washington Monthly complains that we senior citizens, having squandered the nation's prodigious wealth in our salad days, now want to force his generation to submit to soul-crushing taxation so that we may continue our profligate ways. Rot and balderdash. Of course we squandered the nation's wealth prodigiously during America's golden age of plenty. One of the things we squandered it on was college educations for whippersnappers so they could learn to write well enough to flail away in high dudgeon in magazines like The Washington Monthly. He doesn't mention that, of course. If he had studied the history of science, he might have written more coolly about the Social Security system's breaking down. Our sending him to college had nothing to do with it. The reason we are in the present pickle is that science, never willing to let well enough alone, wrecked the actuarial tables on which the Social Security system was built. In the 1930's when it was set up, both penicillin and the birthcontrol pill were undreamed of. If science hadn't dreamed them up years later, the robust death and birth rates on which the system was based would still be holding down the number of people eligible for Social Security while grinding out the multitudes of young taxpayers needed to finance the program at very low tax rates. Is it our fault that science plunged on to penicillin and birthcontrol pills without consulting the manager of the Social Security program? If today's young people are really interested in their own future with Social Security, they ought to quit writing magazine articles about spendthrift grandparents and start agitating for sensible adjustments in the system. These adjustments should aim at undoing the mischief caused by penicillin and birth-control technology. It isn't hard to see what has to be done. First, the law has to be revised to say that every young person entering the work force is entitled to Social Security when he reaches 65, but only if he promises never to use penicillin - or any of its newer antibiotic cousins - to get there. If he weakens along the way and gasps, ''Give me the penicillin, doc,'' very well, he can have penicillin. The law must not be Draconian. When he take it, though, his name will be instantly stricken from the rolls of those eligible for Social Security at 65. Instead he will be entitled to receive a form letter saying, ''Sorry, old-timer, but you settled for penicillin security years ago.'' If he has the strength of character to abstain from antibiotics throughout his lifetime, thus preserving the actuarial probabilities on which the system was built in 1935, there is a lively chance that he will not need Social Security at 65, nor security of any other kind. Thus the program's cost will be reduced by reducing the number of elderly recipients. Now, I trust no American youth will be so callow as to suggest that the ''no penicillin'' principle be applied to those who have been in the program from its infancy. We, remember, were given the nation's promise that Social Security would be waiting for us, and not a word was said about having to give up penicillin if we wanted to get the money. What's more, we have a tougher lobby than whippersnappers have, and we wouldn't want to have to use it on America's youth. The second legal revision must deal with the birth-control pill. This economic monstrosity created by science has severely reduced the production of new taxpayers required to keep the Social Security tax within reasonable bounds. Does today's typical American whippersnapper want to spend his old age wallowing in luxury while somebody's grandchild coughs up 80 percent of his paycheck to pay for it? I think better of American youth than that, but still, it never hurts to reinforce good intentions with good law. Thus, new people entering the Social Security system should be notified that use of the pill or intimate relations with any user thereof will mean forfeiting entitlement to benefits at 65. Alternatively, people who chose to use the pill might still collect benefits if they agreed to pay a Social Security tax 10 times the rate levied on nonusers. This would make up for the revenue they deny the program by their failure to create five new taxpayers. In closing, let me remind our country's splendid youth that whiners never win and urge them never to forget who sent them to college.

1305-> MUSIC: HANDEL 'THEODORA'
''THEODORA'' is one of Handel's late masterpieces: a grave, elevated plea for religious tolerance. It tells the story of two young lovers who are condemned to death by the Roman emperor Diocletian for their Christian faith. Completed in 1749, ''Theodora'' was one of the composer's final oratorios, and his own personal favorite among them. Yet it has never been a popular success. Audiences in Handel's time found ''Theodora'' too solemn, too didactic; and preferred the showier grandeur of works such as ''Judas Maccabaeus'' to the subtle and rarified beauties of the later score. New York was given its first chance in almost 20 years to hear ''Theodora'' when Harry Saltzman led the Sine Nomine Singers and Baroque Orchestra through a virtually complete performance in the Abraham Goodman House Sunday. Although the orchestra seemed underrehearsed and played slightly out of tune much of the time, for the most part this was a praiseworthy production of a great work. The soloists were exceptionally well chosen. Bernadette Fiorella brought an ecstatic and commit ed sweetness to the title role. As Didimus, Jeffrey Dooley revealed a lovely countertenor voice, with none of the bleating quality that one often encounters in this range. Jan Opalach, Constantine Cassolas and Marianna Busching made strong contributions as well. And the Sine Nomine Singers, although small in number, presented the various choral selections with focused enthusiasm. Tim Page

1307-> THE REGION; Woman, 65, Slain; Teen-Ager Held
A teen-ager was arrested today and charged with the slaying of a 65-year-old woman in her home here, the Nassau County police said. An autopsy disclosed that the victim, Stella Kolakowski, had been killed by ''manual strangulation,'' the police said. She also had several broken ribs and had been stabbed. The suspect, John Frederick Bulmer, 17, of 1522 North Thompson Avenue, Bay Shore, was charged with second-degree murder. Mrs. Kolakowski, a widow, lived alone at 238 Washington Avenue. Her body was found last Saturday on the floor of an upstairs bedroom by her daughter, Mary Liotti, 37, of Albertson.

1308-> CRIME
In the seven years or so since "Fletch" first appeared, Gregory Mcdonald has won a great deal of acclaim - two Edgars, lots of sales, enthusiastic reviews all over the place. Obviously Mr. Mcdonald touched osme kind of nerve with his mod, irreverent, truth-seeking Fletch, he of the courtly speech, icy intelligence and wry humor. So it is always good news when a new Fletch mystery has arrived, and here is FLETCH'S MOXIE (Warner, paper, $2.95). Now Fletch is among actors and actresses, with Key West the main locale. "Fletch's Moxie" is the most orthodox of hte series to date, in that it has a neat mystery. How could a man be stabbed to death on camera, with many people around, without anybody knowing how it was done, much less who did it? Mr. Mcdonald introduces a famous, alcoholic old actor, something on the order of a latter-day John Barrymore, and his actress daughter. She is in bad trouble with the I.R.S. Her theatrical agent, the man who has been murdered, has diddled with her account, and she is in debt to the Government for millions. Other types, bitchy and egocentric, enter the picture. We all know actors. Fletch has come a long way since his days as an impecunious reporter. He now has so much money he does not have to work unless he wants to, and he does things with a grand hand. "Fletch's Moxie" is sharp, sophisticated and fast-moving. Mr. Mcdonald, it is pleasant to note, has not lost any of his alertness, and he can write circles around most of his competitors. Gordon Williams's POMEROY (Arbor House, $12.95) is enjoyable and almost a very good book. It falls down toward the end, where the author, obviously having run out of steam, gathers things together in a rather perfunctory manner. "Pomeroy" is a historical mystery - or, rather, espionage novel - set in the London of 1903. The hero, John Stockley Pomeroy, is the disreputable son of a good family in Tennessee. He is smart, full of charm, unethical and a card sharp. But even he can get into trouble, and when the American Government picks him up and offers him a spy job, or else, he has no option. Mr. Williams has gleefully researched the period, and the book is a catalogue of The Good Old Days. There are some effective thumbnail sketches, especially one of Theodore Roosevelt. Mr. Williams has fun with Teddy, making him a sharp fathead (if those two opposing elements can be juxtaposed), and yet curiously endearing. Pomeroy has to deal with a dumb American Ambassador in London, a heel-clicking German aristocrat who is a master spy, assorted crooks, toffs and hoods. One rather looks forward to Pomeroy's next adventur. For a competent British cop story, there is BERGERAC by Michael Hardwick (St. Martin's, $9.95). The action takes place on the Channel island of Jersey and features Det. Sgt. Jim Bergerac, a rehabilitated alcoholic. When a fellow officer and friend gets killed, Bergerac puts himself in the middle of a drug connection. There is nothing in the least original here, but the book is smoothly written and fleshed out with some exotic detail. You can't say that MAZE by A. H. Garnet (Ticknor & Fields, $14.50) doesn't start with a shocker. A skirt-chasing university professor, a pillar of the community, is found cooked in the oven of the university kitchen. Two more murders follow, without apparent pattern. Working with the police is a professor of English who writes juvenile mysteries. The working-out is logical, and one can even summon up some sympathy for the tortured murderer. "Maze" is well written, in a sauve and relaxed manner, with some highly sophisticated banter. There are much worse ways to spend an evening.

1309-> Clemson Is Said To Face Sanction
The Atlantic Coast Conference's apparent decision to impose sanctions against Clemson for recruiting violations was viewed by some league officials today as an attempt to soften probation that is likely to be imposed by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. Conference officers refused to confirm or deny a report in today's issue of The Washington Post that A.C.C. faculty representatives had voted in secret to put Clemson on two years' probation and take away $1 million in television revenues. The report of the vote followed an 18-month inquiry by the conference into Clemson football recruiting.

1311-> 'Armies of Occupation' Must Go, Reagan Says
President Reagan said today that the most pressing need in the Middle East ''is to get what now constitute armies of occupation'' out of Lebanon so that sovereignty can be restored to the Government. ''No longer are we talking about a peace plan,'' the President declared in a radio interview, emphasizing a need for urgency. ''We are now talking about action - a plan for action.'' Mr. Reagan denied reports that the United States, in seeking to end the deadlock over troop withdrtawals from Lebanon, had offered to guarantee the departure of all foreign forces by the end of February. He said this was not true and there was no proposed deadline. But he added: ''Let's get it done and let's get the forces withdrawn so that we can proceed with the other steps.'' Mr. Reagan spoke before King Hussein of Jordan arrived here for a six-day visit that will include talks at the White House on Tuesday. Asked about the chances that the King would act as the ''linchpin'' in Mr. Reagan's proposed peace initiative and Palestinian settlement, the President did not answer directly, but praised the King as ''very sincerely desirous of peace.''

1315-> SCOUTING; Runners Warned
According to Rich Bunch, who studies such things, about two-thirds of the 16,000 runners in tomorrow's New York City Marathon will suffer foot, leg or knee injuries during their careers. If they know certain ground rules, said Mr. Bunch, they may avoid many of those injuries. Mr. Bunch is a biomechanic specialist for Converse, the sportinggoods and running-shoe manufacturer in Wilmington, Mass. He is involved in the design, testing and evaluation of running shoes. ''Most running injuries,'' he said, ''have to do with impact or stability. ''The impact comes from the pounding of the feet, and it can lead to stress fractures. Those injuries are often caused by inadequate cushioning from running shoes or a harsh running style or running on a hard surface after training on soft ground or grass. ''The stability injuries - really nonstability - are related to how the foot strikes the ground. It's natural for the foot to roll inward, but if it rolls too much it can lead to knee injuries.''

1316-> CHAMBER: BAKELS'S ENSEMBLE
The Netherlands Chamber Orchestra presented a tasteful, stylish, but ultimately tedious program Thursday at Carnegie Hall. The ensemble under the direction of Kees Bakels was in New York as part of Carnegie Hall's Celebration of Chamber Orchestras. Many of the problems could be attributed to poor programming. The first half of the concert was devoted to one of Mozart's lesser Divertimentos - D (K. 251) - and C.P.E. Bach's routine Concerto for Cello, Strings, and Basso Continuo in A, (Wtq. 172). The orchestra played attentatively for Mr. Bakels, although the cellist Herre-Jan Stegenga's intonation was often sour and his approach rather stiff. While both of these works are often charming, they are also eminently forgettable - competent note-spinning and little more. As a result, the effect was something similar to a meal made only of airy desserts. After intermission, Mr. Bakels led a rendition of Lex Van Delden's ''Prittico per Orchestra da Camera.'' This proved a mildly dissonant bit of Neo-Classicism, carefully made and unprepossessing. Mr. Van Delden's work featured some fine passages for solo viola, played with feeling by Yuko Inoue. The evening closed with a humdrum run-through of Haydn's Symphony No. 44 in E minor. Here, as earlier, the strings often overwhelmed the vitally important passages for winds and horns, and in this prosaic performance, Haydn's powerful symphony ended up sounding just as superficial and formulaic as the earlier Bach and Mozart works.

1317-> KNICKS LOSE BY 108-100
Before the Knicks made their first choice in the college draft last June, the sixth selection over all, fans at Madison Square Garden's Felt Forum chanted: ''Kellogg, Kellogg.'' They were trying to influence the Knicks to select Clark Kellogg of Ohio State, a 6-foot-7-inch power forward. But the Knicks instead chose Trent Tucker, the Minnesota guard, and the Indiana Pacers, with the eighth selection, chose Kellogg. Tonight, Kellogg scored 22 points, grabbed 12 rebounds and had one of the Pacers' 11 blocked shots in a 108-100 victory over the Knicks. Tucker, struggling to fit into the Knicks' offense, scored 7 points. Herb Williams, who played two years at Ohio State with Kellogg, had six blocked shots in the game at Market Square Arena, which seats 17,092 but had only 2,873 of them filled. The Knicks, who shot 44 percent from the field for the game, had their offense functioning with some consistently only in the opening quarter as Bill Cartwright, the center, made six of his eight shots. With the Knicks ahead by 21-20, Bernard King ran off 7 consecutive points for a 28-22 lead at the end of the quarter. But the Knicks shot only 9 for 19, and the Pacers outscored them by 31-20, including a 26-8 stretch, for a 53-48 halftime lead. The lead grew to 18 points midway through the fourth quarter. 26 Turnovers and 41 Fouls In losing their fourth game in the last five, the Knicks committed 26 turnovers and 41 fouls. ''Indiana has to be credited for playing an aggressive, physical game which forced us into numerous errors, fouls and secondary actions,'' said Coach Hubie Brown of the Knicks. ''They deserved to win because of our lackluster efforts. When you come into the arena expecting to give less than your best, that forces you into errors, fouls and bad decisions. They outplayed us, just whipped us.'' The Knicks got 24 points from King, 23 from Cartwright and 20 from Ed Sherod, the rookie point guard. But the other two starters, Len (Truck) Robinson and Tucker, had a total of 11 points. ''Kellogg hasn't reached the stage where he is awesome,'' said Jack McKinney, the coach of the Pacers. ''He has a lot of talent. It will take some time for that talent to blend in with the N.B.A. style of play. But at times he was awesome tonight, especially with some of his 12 strong rebounds.'' Kellogg credited Williams, a teammate at Ohio State for two seasons, with helping him become familiar with the N.B.A. ''Herb has been my guide since the draft,'' Kellogg said this afternoon. Kellogg, averaging almost 18 points a game, is one of the few 1982 first-round selections who have become a starter. ''I'm doing pretty good,'' said Kellogg, who left Ohio State after his junior year. If the Knicks had taken me, I probably would have signed for more money, but I don't know if I would have been in the same situation with the Knicks or anyone else. I have been a starter since the first exhibition game, I was kind of hoping I would be drafted by a team that would allow me to do that.''

1318-> SALVADOR NAMES 7 TO RIGHTS PANEL
Alvaro Magana, the provisional President, today named the director of the national police, a Roman Catholic priest, a young peasant leader, an engineer and three lawyers to form the Government's Commission on Human Rights. The purpose of the panel, as outlined in a multiparty pact signed in August, will be to ''accomplish the complete operation of the inalienable human rights of individuals'' and guarantee ''physical security'' for Salvadorans. Officials and members of the new panel said today that the methods by which the commission will try to fulfill this mandate had not yet been determined. The announcement of the panel's formation came a day before Mr. Magana was to meet in Costa Rica with President Reagan, whose Administration has been facing tough questions from members of Congress on the rights situation in El Salvador. The continuation of military aid to this country depends on the Administration's ability to certify that progress is being made on human rights. Not Designed 'to Win Points' But President Magana, in a ceremony installing the panel, said it would ''not constitute a mere propaganda action, designed to win points in foreign public opinion and before foreign governments.'' Other officials here said that the creation of the panel had been planned since late September and that the timing was a coincidence. ''The Government that does not respect human rights as they are universally accepted,'' the President said, ''contradicts its own reason for being, creates a negative international image and runs the permanent risk of being destabilized.'' The Salvadoran President said that, as another step in its efforts to seek peace, the Government was preparing a ''law of amnesty and citizen rehabilitation'' for leftist guerrillas ready to lay down their arms and would name a Commission on Peace within the next few days. An Enormous Task The task facing the commission is enormous in this war-shattered country of five million people, where lawlessness is an everyday fact of life and where, according to the United States Ambassador, Deane R. Hinton, ''perhaps as many as 30,000 Salvadorans have been murdered, not killed in battle, murdered,'' since 1979. Speaking After the ceremony, Mr. Hinton said the new panel ''ought to be more balanced than the one that exists, and since it has Government power behind it it ought to be able to do more.'' He called the creation of the new panel ''a progressive step.'' The current human rights commission, which is affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, has often sparred with the Salvadoran Government over its responsibility for rights abuses here. The only Government member of the panel is the director of the national police, Col. Reynaldo Lopez Nuila. His selection was seen as somewhat surprising, since the security forces' performance on rights issues has generally been regarded as less than progressive. The other members of the panel are Msgr. Freddy Delgado of the Diocese of San Salvador; Cristobal Aleman Alas, a member of the Popular Democratic Union, a peasant labor group; Jorge Ernesto Campos, a construction engineer; Mario Ruiz Belasco, a lawyer and financier; Flor de Maria Villacorta de Hasbun, a lawyer, and Manuel La Ines Mendez, a lawyer.

1319-> A GRANDE DAME RETURNS AS WHITE QUEEN
It is exceedingly rare for an actor or an actress to return to a role 50 years after first playing it, rarer still when the role calls for the character to fly across the stage. Such is the case with the ageless Eva Le Gallienne, who returns to Broadway this week, one month before her 84th birthday. She opens Thursday at the Virginia (formerly the ANTA) in ''Alice,'' a new version of her Civic Repertory Theater production of ''Alice in Wonderland.'' Miss Le Gallienne is recreating her role as the White Queen (Kate Burton is playing Alice), and is also re-staging the play, with John Strasberg as co-director. Sitting in a dressing room during a recent rehearsal, she said that the revival would be close to the original, except that, with a budget of $2 million, it will ''cost 2,000 times more.'' As in 1932 and in the 1947 revival, she is using the adaptation she wrote in collaboration with Florida Friebus, which dramatizes ''the most dearly loved scenes'' from both ''Through the Looking Glass'' and ''Alice in Wonderland.'' '' 'Alice' was one of the things I was most proud of,'' she said. ''The production was ahead of its time and I don't think it dates at all. Classics don't date.'' In her second memoir, ''With a Quiet Heart,'' she wrote that her success in ''Alice'' was ''entirely due to my masters, the Fratellinis.'' As a young woman in France, she briefly joined a circus to be close to this troupe of clowns in order to study their technique. In memory of the Fratellinis, ''most of whom have joined the feathered choir,'' her White Queen is, she said, ''a clown, an eccentric old girl, very disorderly.'' She is playing her just as she did before, and ''in white clown makeup - from a distance, you can't see much difference.'' She casually passed off her airborne appearance as a fact of a working actor's life. ''The flight is rather tame,'' she explained. ''The queen is blown in by the wind, and then she does short little hopping-flying. I don't mind it. Why can't they fly me to the balcony? After all, I'm an old Peter Panner.'' The reference was to her most daring stage flight, in ''Peter Pan'' in 1928. ''I thought it would be awful if Peter came out and simply took a bow,'' she said. At the Civic Rep, we had a crew called the Schultzes who had flown a great deal at the Hippodrome. I said, 'I'd like to fly to the balcony and back when I take my bow.' It was easy for them to rig it up. I flew over the audience. The children tried to touch me; they loved it.'' In this production, she noted, ''everything will be done by machinery rather than by manpower.'' Her own preference is for manpower, because if ''one man fails, another can jump in.'' So far, she said, there have been no mechanical difficulties. When it was suggested, politely, that she was a bit younger then, she said, with a sigh, ''Ah, yes, but I don't feel old. I never think about age. I just don't believe it.'' And she laughed. One thing that keeps her feeling perpetually youthful in the theater is the thought of George Abbott, who is 95 and is in production with a revival of ''On Your Toes.'' ''I was awfully cheered when I saw he was 11 years older than I,'' she said, and added, ''I've never met him.'' As she reminisced about her long life in the theater, it seemed as if Mr. Abbott were the only major theater figure she had not met. Her romance with the theater began in 1906 when, at the age of 7, she first saw Sarah Bernhardt. It was in Paris and Miss Le Gallienne's mother took her to a performance of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' in which Bernhardt played Prince Charming. Mrs. Le Gallienne had some trepidation about her daughter seeing a onelegged sexagenarian play Prince Charming, but innocence prevailed. ''I was completely convinced that she was the prince,'' recalled Miss Le Gallienne. ''It never occurred to me that she was anything else.'' She still retains her belief in the transforming powers of theater. ''Years ago, when I was young, Lee Shubert said, 'Miss Le Gallienne, you should create a personality for yourself. When people go to see Elsie Ferguson, they all know exactly what they're going to see.' He said that was the way to be successful, and he was right. But that would bore me. I wanted to play lots of different people. To play outside myself - that's what I like about acting.'' Keeping her vow, she has played a gallery of disparate characters -Ibsen and Chekhov heroines, as well as Juliet, Camille, Anna Karenina, Queen Elizabeth, Fanny Cavendish in ''The Royal Family'' and scores of others. She also found time to form two classic American repertory companies - the Civic Repertory Theater and, with Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, the American Repertory Theater. In addition, she translated a dozen Ibsen prose plays and wrote two memoirs and a book about Eleanora Duse. When she talks about acting, the conversation naturally begins with Bernhardt and Duse. ''Bernhardt was a great, great actress,'' she said, ''what the French called cabotine de genie, which could be translated as 'a ham actress of genius.' She was enormously theatrical, creating more excitement and electricity. I remember one of her last performances in New York. Something happened I've never seen any other time. The audience didn't just stand up at the end, they stood on their seats.'' Her mother preferred Bernhardt, but her own favorite was Duse. ''She is the greatest artist I've ever seen in the theater,'' she said, and when asked why, she answered, ''She was.'' Pressed, she offered this explanation: ''The Method people talk about how one should be real and true and simple - and they aren't, but Duse was. She would sit on the stage and would seem to be doing nothing. Yet you knew everything she was thinking, everything she was feeling. There was something that seemed like a ray that came from her and captured the house. I saw all of her performances at the Century Theater and most of her plays twice. Her technique was so extraordinary that people would say she didn't have any - people who didn't know about acting.'' Miss Le Gallienne said that Duse and Bernhardt were poles apart, and as an actress as well as a theatergoer she was drawn to Duse. ''I don't think I'm capable of being a ham actress. In fact, I'm not a very theatrical person. I'm always surprised I became an actress. It was a compulsion.'' When she was asked if there were actresses since Duse and Bernhardt who would be in their class, she said, ''A great many.'' While one half-expected that she would talk about Colleen Dewhurst or Meryl Streep or other contemporaries, she remained firmly historical. ''I thought Mrs. Fiske was a great actress - and Ethel Barrymore,'' she said. ''The greatest actor we ever had was Jack Barrymore. I saw him four times in 'Hamlet.' I always say to young people, 'Don't listen to those terrible recordings because he did them when he had a terrible hangover and was making fun of himself.' His 'Hamlet' wasn't a bit like that. He was extraordinarily simple, and he played the whole range of the character. One performance I saw, he was doing a soliloquy - it may have been 'Oh what a rogue and peasant slave am I' - and a cat came on stage. Usually that means that people are going to scream with laughter. As he was speaking, Jack looked at the cat, went over, picked it up, held it in his arms, stroked it and went on with the soliloquy.'' The effect, she said, was as if Shakespeare had written the cat into ''Hamlet.'' In 1937, at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Mass., Miss Le Gallienne played Hamlet. Asked to assess her performance, she said, ''It wasn't bad. I played it as a boy. I was then in my thirties. The reason I didn't come to New York with it - Lee Shubert wanted me to - was that at the time John Gielgud and Leslie Howard played it on Broadway. I didn't mind facing the public with my performance - I wasn't ashamed of my work - but I had visions of newspaper headlines, 'Little Eva Tackles the Dane.' '' From her position as a Broadway star, she created the Civic Repertory Theater. ''I've always been hipped on the subject of popular prices,'' she said. ''What I wanted was the sort of theater I had lived with as a child in France, theaters such as the Royal Theater in Copenhagen and the Comedie Fran,caise, which were subsidized by the government. When I started the Civic, there were no foundations and no government interest in the arts. I had to arrange the money myself. I had a great selling point. I would go to rich people and say, 'I have nothing and I'm willing to give up ninetenths of my salary for this venture. You have millions. You can give me $50,000.'' The Civic Rep opened in 1926 with four plays, Benavente's ''Saturday Night,'' Chekhov's ''The Three Sisters'' and Ibsen's ''The Master Builder'' and ''John Gabriel Borkman,'' and kept adding plays to the repertory until there were 30. ''On Ibsen's 100th anniversary,'' she recalled, ''in the morning we played 'The Master Builder,' in the afternoon, 'Hedda Gabler,' and in the evening, 'John Gabriel Borkman.' '' Miss Le Gallienne played a leading role in all three. Among her achievements were her productions of Chekhov. ''Before we attacked 'The Three Sisters' we took over a little farmhouse in Weston, Conn., and the entire company lived there for three weeks,'' she said. ''None of us had ever played Chekhov before. We would go for walks and sit around on the grass and talk and suddenly I would shoot them a line from the play. We would begin talking in the dialogue. We felt as if we were living the play, especially after we played it for seven years.'' The Civic Rep's Chekhov was preceded by a visit to America of the Moscow Art Theater, with a company headed by Stanislavsky and Chekhov's widow, Olga Knipper. ''I saw them,'' Miss Le Gallienne said, and then offered her judgment: ''The ensemble quality of their Chekhov was wonderful, but with playwrights such as Goldoni they were actively bad. They were heavy and ponderous. I don't think any of them were really great actors. The thing that made the organization great was that they worked together.'' Miss Le Gallienne prides herself on knowing her limitations, and she has turned down a number of roles because she thought they were unsuitable. ''It's like having a glass of white wine - which would be me - when you want a glass of burgundy. I don't think I'm very burgundyish.'' Under the red wine label, she categorized Medea and Lady Macbeth, adding that with Basil Rathbone, she had played scenes from ''Macbeth,'' but did not do it ''as a burgundy lady.'' Her performance was, in the manner of Mrs. Siddons, as ''a very feminine woman who did it all to help her husband.'' At the Civic Rep, two of her most durable successes were ''Peter Pan'' and ''Alice,'' with ''Peter'' often done at matinees for children and ''Alice'' in the evening for adults. Explaining that scheduling, she said, ''When I was a child, I didn't like 'Alice' very much. But when I grew up I started to see all the wit and the wisdom and the mad logic of it. 'Peter' doesn't have all the things that 'Alice' has - all those verbal gymnastics and fun. '''Alice' was ahead of its time. I love some of the lines - when Alice says, we've been running very fast and why haven't we gotten somewhere else, and the Red Queen says, 'Why, we have to run ten times faster than that to get anywhere else.' Well that certainly is true today. I love the White Queen's line - 'Jam tomorrow, jam yesterday, but never jam today.'' Asked how she felt about that as a philosophy, she said, ''You think I've had a lot of jam in my life? Leonardo said, 'The great tragedy for an artist is when theory outstrips performance.' This is always true. No matter what your vision is, it never gives you the jam that you think it's going to give you.'' Perhaps her major disappointment is that America has not been able to sustain a repertory theater. Her last involvement in an attempt was during the days of the founding of the Vivian Beaumont Theater in Lincoln Center. She was on an early committee but quit after two meetings because she couldn't stand the ''arglebargle.'' ''They said they had all the money for the building. I said, 'Do you have enough money to run it once you open?' They said, 'We can easily get it.' The building is the least part of the company.'' As America's foremost proponent of repertory, she would have seemed a logical choice to head the Beaumont. ''It never occurred to them to ask me. I don't think they wanted a woman. Maybe they thought I was too old, though I wasn't so damned old then.'' She is still adamant about the need for a popular - and a popularly priced - theater. ''People who really love it, who long for it, can't afford it,'' she said. ''The other day I came across some old programs I had saved from the Civic. On one, I found this statement I had signed, 'Theater should be an instrument for giving, not a machinery for getting.' When I read that, I almost wept.'' Though she has been working in the theater for 68 years, she has not saved much money. Much of what she has earned has been spent on her house in Weston, Conn., where she has lived for 54 years. Looking around, she can spot signs of her labors. ''The bay window - that's a radio job. One room was built by the play, 'L'Aiglon.' My roles built the house. It's me - part of my life.'' The organic nature of the house could be regarded as emblematic of her art, which has never stopped growing. Looking for jam tomorrow, she said, ''I wish there were more parts for old women.'' She enjoyed acting in the Ellen Burstyn movie, ''Resurrection,'' and would like to do more films. When it was suggested that Katharine Hepburn was cornering that market, she said, ''Well, she's much younger!''

1321-> THE CITY; Fumes Overcome 40 at Queens Plant
Forty people were overcome by toxic fumes yesterday after a barrel of poisonous chemicals spilled at an automotive parts plant in Woodside, Queens. Fourteen of the victims required hospital treatment. A police officer, Frank Bluszoz, and an ambulance driver, Vinclent Santoiemma, said the company, Allomatic Industries, at 30-30 60th Street, had at first refused to evacuate the 300 employees. ''We were fully cooperative,'' said Geoffrey Nadler, a company vice president. ''At no time did I ever attempt to keep people in here against their will.'' Ten of the 14 people taken to the City Hospital Center at Elmhurst were released after treatment. Among the four detained was Mr. Santoiemma, 21 years old, who passed out moments after parking his vehicle. Andrew McCarthy, a spokesman for the city's Environmental Protection Department, said preliminary tests had identified the spilled chemical, which is used to remove grease from transmission parts, as either trichloroethene or trichloroethylene.

1322-> Topics; Extravagant Charges; Pot and Kettle
You could hardly see for flying mud at the trial under way in Manhattan to settle responsibility for the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island. General Public Utilities, the operator of the reactor, is suing its builder, Babcock & Wilcox, for $4 billion in damages. The attorneys for each side have minced reputations, not words. G.P.U. accused the manufacturer of a ''frightening episode of corporate misconduct.'' Babcock & Wilcox chided the utility for ''deliberate and willful misconduct'' and for not merely engaging but actually ''indulging'' in recklessness. Beneath the bombast lie serious charges. G.P.U. claims that an earlier accident, similar to that at Three Mile Island, occurred at a Babcock-built plant in Ohio. The manufacturer took steps to correct it but neglected to inform utilities nationwide, G.P.U. alleges, lest it hurt sales. Babcock & Wilcox responds that G.P.U. had all the information it needed to prevent the accident but was too inept to use it. Also too cheap; the manufacturer asserts that in order to save money, G.P.U. neglected to close down the reactor earlier for repair of leaking steam valves. A verdict is not expected for many months. In the meantime, the public will have to live with the awesome possibility that both members of the nuclear establishment may be correct in their opinion of the other.

1323-> Advertising; Anheuser's Interest In Cable
Anheuser-Busch, the country's largest brewery, has given up hope of a settlement of the football strike, according to Thomas Sharbaugh, group marketing manager and a panelist today at the Association of National Advertisers meeting here at the Breakers Hotel. He made his remark as a session on commercials for cable TV broke up. He was asked if the maker of Budweiser and other brews is transferring some of the big bundle of dollars committed to National Football League telecasts to cable, where the company has been an early and active participant. But he would only say that there ''is clearly a possibility'' that cable will get some of the money. Very little of the money from football so far has gone into cable. But from what Mr. Sharbaugh was saying about cable and the cable commercials he showed, it would seem more probable than possible. Few advertisers, and certainly no other brewer, know more about the cable medium than Anheuser-Busch. In its quest of the 18- to 49-year-old male, especially the drinker of two six-packs a week and more, the Bud boys have long been on the ESPN and USA cable networks and the superstations. It also uses cable to zero in on black consumers on Black Entertainment Television and to reach the 18- to 24-year-olds who watch Music Television Network. The young people are not only forming brand loyalties but are heavy consumers. Music Television provides an audience of young rock fans, an elusive population segment since they are light readers and equally light television viewers. And as Anheuser does with most of its promotions, it tailors its advertising to the rockers. ''The beauty of MTV,'' Mr. Sharbaugh said after showing a far-out example of its commercials, ''is that there's nobody tuned in that doesn't understand it.'' Nodding in agreement was a fellow panelist, James R. Blocki, vice president and director of advertising and creative services of Kraft's Retail Food Group. His company, producers for generations of those wholesome Ed Herlihy food-filled spots, has done a couple of avant-garde ads for the MTV set. The Anheuser-Busch and Kraft representatives showed the most polished creative work of the four panelists on ''Cable Commercial Showcase.'' The other speakers were Robert (Buck) Buchanan, executive vice president and domestic media director of J. Walter Thompson, and Malcolm D. Gray, director of advertising services of Scott Paper. Mr. Buchanan, as a matter of fact, was proud of the low cost of making the commercials he showed - 12 minutes for some $60,000. But his spots were not for the larger audiences available on cable networks, but rather for Thompson's own experimental system in Massachusetts, the Cable Shop, or for the Westminster Kennel Club show that marked the first electronic advertising for Ken-L-Ration Biskits. Robert Alter, president of the Cable Advertising Bureau, indicated that the bureau has a library of commercials made for cable and is happy to make them available to advertisers and agencies. The cable panel was one of four concurrent sessions that kept people out of the newly arrived hot sun. Another was on the provocative subject of greater advertising productivity. The six-man panel was composed of two teams, each made up of a consultant, an agency man and a client. Dart & Kraft and Richardson-Vicks were the clients. Vicks and its agency, Benton & Bowles, using a system devised by Thomas K. Myers, a consultant, studied the productivity of the people working on the Clearasil account. Here, according to Roy J. Bostock, executive vice president of the agency, are the four main problem areas, which probably can be found throughout adland: - Too much time was spent collecting competitive data - 20 percent of the product manager's time and 40 percent of the account executive's -mainly because of ''organizational inertia.'' - Too many media plan revisions were required ''in an overzealous drive'' by the agency ''for perfection every time a budget number changed.'' - ''An arduous, almost tortuous legal aproval process at Richardson-Vicks for copy.'' This ''bottom-up'' study also found that too few key decision makers attended the meetings they needed to attend. You know how they are.

1325-> A WINE CRITIC'S FEAST
People with a passionate devotion to wine are inclined to focus their entertaining on their favorite beverage, and I am no exception. Instead of cocktail parties, I give wine tastings, and planning for my dinner parties begins with deciding which wines I will serve. Because I managed to establish a cellar back in the 1960's, when the best wines were inexpensive and easy to find, I now have a fairly extensive supply of fully mature bottles that I do not hesitate to uncork under the right circumstances. So my planning involves creating the right circumstances. At the same time, I plan for relatively simple food, for I do virtually all of my own cooking and have no desire to prepare anything that will either separate me from my guests for long intervals or interfere with the fine wines that I am likely to serve. My favorite, most special dinner parties always take place at my home in the northern reaches of the Adirondack Mountains of New York State. The area is rugged and wild, with cool nights even in summer, so there is nearly always a fire burning in the fireplace. The fuel for my fires is hardwood logs from the birch, ash, poplar and maple trees felled on my land, and it creates an extraordinary medium for grilling meats of all kinds. In common with many other oenophiles, I have a favorite grilled meat, and it is lamb. No other readily available meat complements red wines as nicely as lamb, and I am convinced that no lamb could taste better than when it is cooked over hardwood logs in my Adirondack fireplace. The smoky flavor imparted by the wood provides a superb counterpoint to the gamy pungency of the meat, and all that is then needed is a mature red Burgundy from a great vintage. I recently decided to uncork one of my last remaining bottles of Volnay-Santenots 1959 Hospices de Beaune Cuvee Jehan de Massol, and the feast that was interwoven with the consumption of this wine was splendid - not because I had prepared it, but because it was elegantly relaxed and featured food that would have been special no matter who cooked it. My guests arrived from across the lake by boat and were handed glasses of icy Taittinger Comtes de Champagne 1973 on my front porch as the evening sun highlighted the leaves that were already taking on the colors of autumn on the opposite shore. The Taittinger is one of several special Champagnes that I serve, and at other times I have used Dom Perignon, the Perrier-Jouet Fleur de France, Mumm's Rene Lalou and Louis Roederer Cristal, among others. No wine launches a festive occasion as perfectly as Champagne, and on this occasion I served fresh caviar as the hors d'oeuvre, a food that not only goes very well with Champagne, but that also is capable of enhancing the atmosphere by its mere presence. I also prefer caviar because it is not filling and will not satiate the palate prior to the meal. After uncorking another bottle of Taittinger for my guests, I disappeared into the kitchen briefly to begin cooking the fish course, smallmouth bass from the lake. I cannot recall ever being served smallmouth bass in a restaurant, and I know that it will be a rarity for most of my guests. I normally poach the bass in a court bouillon in a large aluminum fish poacher, and this time I had timed the poaching fluid so that it would be reduced to the proper point just after my guests' arrival. The poaching takes only a few minutes, but I do not believe in long preambles before wine-oriented feasts. The greatest conviviality occurs around the dining table, where the best wines are served, and the sooner I can get my guests there, the better. Moreover, they are in better condition to enjoy the meal and each other if the cocktail period is kept brief. On this occasion I was serving two California chardonnays with the bass - a Stony Hill 1979 and a Dry Creek 1980 Vintner's Reserve. Both are fairly full-bodied and were superb with the bass, a flavorful fish that is enhanced by a good poaching fluid. By now the fire in the fireplace had created a bed of crimson embers, and I added two fresh logs, one at the back of the fireplace and one at the front. The two logs serve as props for the heavy wire grilling basket in which I cook the lamb. I usually buy about a seven-pound leg and ask the butcher to butterfly it, or remove the bone while leaving the meat intact. A butterflied lamb spreads out flat, but is always of uneven thickness. I consider the unevenness a plus factor; it enables me to serve the meat both rare and well done at the same time. I and most of my guests prefer rare lamb, but many Americans do not, and the butterflying process assures there will be varying degrees of doneness. I often marinate the lamb in a mixture of vinegar, garlic, basil, pepper and Beaujolais for several hours prior to cooking. This creates a more complex flavor and removes some of the pungency that is normally present in lamb. The cooking time will vary according to the size of the butterfly and the intensity of the fire. I have cooked butterflied lamb in as little as 10 minutes and as much as 20. The normal time is 12 to 15 minutes in my fireplace, but I have no way of knowing whether this is typical. While the lamb is cooking, I uncork the red wine - in this case the 1959 Volnay plus a 1964, also from the Hospices de Beaune, for the sake of comparison. Earlier, I had decanted a bottle of Bacigalupi pinot noir 1979, a California wine made from the same grape as the two Volnays. Comparing California pinot noirs with French Burgundies is not always fair, for the pinot noir is less successful in California than some other French grape varieties. But such comparisons are fun, if not totally valid, and they certainly make for plenty of lively conversation around the table. This time the Bacigalupi was excellent, although immature, but it could scarcely match the elegant richness of the Volnays. Surprisingly, the 1959 was the biggest, most intensely flavored wine at the table, although it was the oldest. I was reminded of how difficult it is to find Burgundies of that quality any more. The butterflied lamb came out of the fire precisely on schedule and was transferred to a large, thick wooden carving board. The meat was scorched on the outside and mostly reddish pink on the inside. With the meat still sizzling from the fire, I carved vertical slices off the butterfly and was able to satisfy everybody at the table both in quantity and degree of doneness. (There was also plenty left over for lamb sandwiches the next day.) With the lamb I served fresh zucchini, cut lengthwise and broiled with a coating of butter and grated Parmesan cheese. I usually serve whatever green vegetable looks freshest and most interesting at the local market, and zucchini happened to be the one for this occasion. Sometimes I will also serve potatoes, especially if new potatoes with their transparent pink skins are available or if the so-called salt potatoes, some as tiny as a thumbnail, can be found in the market. I broil them whole in a saucepan with a shallow layer of butter and herbs. By this point, everybody's calorie quota has usually been surpassed, but I often fail to resist the urge to serve a dessert, especially if I have a luscious Sauternes or riesling to go with it. This year, the raspberry and blueberry crops in the mountains were abundant, and I simply served a mixture of the two types of berries. In the absence of fresh fruit, I will often resort to cheesecake, for it is also an ideal dessert with a sweet wine. On this occasion I uncorked a Wehlener Sonnenuhr 1976 beerenauslese from Prum, a delicious Mosel, with the berries. The fire was still crackling in the fireplace, taking the chill out of the Adirondack night, as my guests climbed back into their boats. No doubt it was a warm and pleasant voyage across the lake.

1327-> U.S. EXPANDS FIGHT ON TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY
Services for pregnant teen-agers and programs of sex education will soon be significantly expanded with about $8.5 million in Federal money, officials with schools, hospitals and government agencies around the country said this week. The Federal Department of Health and Human Services is distributing the money to 50 organizations in 38 states. It is the first installment of grants generated by Title XX of the Public Health Service Act, passed in 1981. The adolescent family life program, under which the money is being distributed, represents a broadly expanded effort to help communities grapple with the problem of teen-age pregnancy. Each year pregnancies, most of them unwanted, are reported among about 10 percent of the girls 10 to 19 years old in the United States, according to department officials. Donald Underwood, grants management officer with the department's Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, said: ''The program will emphasize counseling about adoption as an alternative to abortion. Probably none of our money could be used for abortion counseling. Abortion would definitely not be encouraged.'' Grants of $50,000 to $446,000 However, a number of officials around the nation said they believed they had been given wide latitude in determining how to spend the grants, which range from $50,000 to $446,000. The largest grant is going to St. Margaret's Hospital in Dorchester, Mass. ''The main emphasis will shift from services to pregnant women to preventive education,'' said Dr. George Halpin, director of parent and child health services for the New Jersey Department of Health. The Camden County Department of Health in New Jersey received the second-largest grant, $420,000, to expand its present 35-member staff, which provides care and counseling to teen-age mothers. In Amarillo, Tex., where Katie McDonough is the director of the Catholic Family Service, one of every nine girls 15 to 19 years old became pregnant in 1980. She said 19,569 babies were born that year in Texas to girls 17 and under. The service got a grant of $250,957. ''We've spoken year after year about how prevention should be included in our budget, but we just haven't been able to do it,'' said Mrs. McDonough. Program in Connecticut In New Haven, Conn., the Hill Health Corporation, with a 135-member staff, already has a large prevention program. Cornell Scott, the corporation's director, said it would use most of its $165,000 grant to care for pregnant teen-agers. In addition to the $8.5 million for counseling and services, the Department of Health and Human Services is distributing about $1.5 million to 12 schools and research groups for studies on the ''the influences of family, religion, school and peers'' and other factors related to adolescent sexuality. The total of $10 million represents the first installment of $16 million that Congress has appropriated for the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs in the fiscal year 1982 under the Public Health Service Act. Congress established general guidelines calling for $90 million to be spent for the program but will have to appropriate that money year by year. The awarding of the $10 million represents another chapter in the history of legislation that has united liberals and conservatives on the otherwise unharmonious Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. Senator Jeremiah Denton, the Alabama Republican who was a prime sponsor of the legislation, was able to persuade Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, to be a co-sponsor by toning down the emphasis on adoption counseling. ''It is the only thing they have agreed on,'' said a committee staff member. The staff member said that, although the legislation reflected an interest in helping teen-agers place babies for adoption, it was not regarded as having implications for the debate over abortion. Customarily, Federal money to fight teen-age pregnancy has excluded money for abortion counseling.

1330-> AS WORLD TURNS FOR ISLAND ACTRESS
EVERY now and then, Marilyn Raphael walks out the door of her ranch-style home in Merrick, hops on her bicycle (equipped with two baskets) and pedals off to the supermarket. And every now and then, while she shops, someone walks up to her and says, ''Aren't you on 'As the World Turns?' '' The answer is, of course, yes, because for nearly a year now, Miss Raphael (though married, she uses her maiden name in her career) has been playing the role of Madame Koster, a psychic medium, on the popular CBS network soap opera. And when Miss Raphael says yes in that Merrick supermarket, the next question is likely to be, ''What are you doing here?'' The rest of the dialogue goes something like this: ''I live here and I shop here.'' ''You do? I can't believe it.'' Miss Raphael says, ''They all believe we live some glamorous life in New York.'' Though she has been an actress since her childhood in Brooklyn, Miss Raphael, who is 50, has been living in Merrick since 1959 with her husband, a corporation president, and she has spent much of that time raising a family of two girls and a boy, who are all now in their 20's. Still, during the years since her graduation in 1950 from Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School, which awarded her a gold medal for dramatic art, she has managed to appear in a variety of roles in a variety of mediums. She has worked in theater, radio, television and film - and in theater, for example, in roles in scripts by such playwrights as Tennessee Williams, Moliere and Neil Simon. ''I've never been a leading lady,'' says Miss Raphael. ''I've never been an ingenue. I've always done heavy roles.'' It was one of these heavy roles -the mentally disturbed overprotective mother of a retarded boy - that Miss Raphael was enacting in a play called ''Imperceptible Grief'' in New York City at the Actors Theater of America last autumn when she was spotted by casting directors for ''As the World Turns.'' Not long afterward, as she was preparing to take a vacation in Florida, Miss Raphael received a telephone call from CBS asking if she were available for the role of a psychic medium on ''As the World Turns.'' ''Originally, it was, as far as I know, a one-shot, but I've been extended for 10 months,'' she says. ''The writers developed my story line. I have been turned into a villainess. The audience doesn't know whether I am a genuine psychic or a phony.'' Some fans, she notes, have asked if she really is a medium. ''That means they believe what I'm doing,'' says Miss Raphael. ''That means I've done my homework.'' When it comes to acting, Miss Raphael, who has trained others in workshops all over the Island, says: ''I have my own method, because I've studied so many different techniques and because I teach as well. I go for the truth of the character. I do research. If I am playing a widow, I will talk to heads of widow groups, because I'm not a widow. I will talk to widows, if it's not too painful for them. I will read books about widowhood. I try to be truthful. You owe the audience the truest chartacter you can bring them.'' Miss Raphael describes performing in soap operas on television (she's also appeared in ''All My Children'' and ''One Life to Live'') as ''probably the most pressured acting job there is, because in one day you're turning out one hour. Usually you start work at 7 in the morning, so your day can be from 7 A.M. to 7 P.M. and sometimes 10 o'clock at night.'' Still, it is clear that she regards the experience as satisfying. In the meantime, says Marilyn Raphael, ''I'm just a normal suburban housewife who happens to be on network television.''

1331-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
Park Ave. Lights Are Dark T he lighting of the trees on the Park Avenue malls did not take place last night as scheduled to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah and the coming of Christmas. Margaret Ternes, executive director of the Park Avenue malls planting project, spent the day on the telephone trying to reach contributors up and down the avenue to tell them not to go to their windows at 4:30 P.M. expecting to see the lighting. There had been a labor dispute, she told them, but everything was being worked out. She said she hoped the lights would be on sometime during the weekend. The plan is for trees on every other block between 54th and 96th Streets to be lit with small white lights every evening from 5 P.M. to midnight until Twelfth Night, which is Jan. 6. The lights are strung on cherry trees as well as balsams. Financing for the project has come from private contributors and the Parks Department. ''The Brick Church ceremony for the war dead is Sunday at 6 P.M., and we'll have the trees lit for that even if I have to hold the wires together myself,'' Mrs. Ternes said.

1332-> Required Reading; Balance of Power
Martin F. Herz, director of studies at the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy and former career diplomat, in an article in the Foreign Service Journal. October 1982: The longest periods of peace in recent memory have been periods when there existed an effective balance of power. Yet, balance of power has a distasteful ring to it because it sometimes requires alliances with uncongenial people for the sake of offsetting a power advantage of a potential or actual adversary. Thus Churchill had to swallow hard when Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941 and Great Britain suddenly found itself a comrade-in-arms of the brutal Soviet dictatorship. For the sake of the war, Churchill said at the time, if Hitler were to invade hell, he would at least make a favorable reference to the devil in Parliament.

1333-> THEATER; RICH 'DESERT SONG' RESOUNDS IN DARIEN
time operetta house. With ''The Desert Song,'' it is operating on all cylinders. There are operettas and there are operettas. Those of the classical and classy style, a la Lehar and Offenbach, are usually found in opera houses. Others, unbounded by time, from ''Showboat'' to ''Candide'' to ''A Little Night Music,'' are more comfortably classified in the higher realms of musical theater; Broadway, not the opera house, is their birthright. Then there are the strictly stock, period pieces with dumb, convoluted plots, silly lyrics and a handful of lingering melodies - such as ''The Desert Song.'' This is the one about the Robin Hood of the desert (''The Red Shadow'') -he has to defy his own father, a general - and his enamorita, Margot, who dreams of romance and then doesn't and then does again. There are also a rejected hootchy-kootchy dancer, assorted Riffs, soldiers of the French Foreign Legion and harem girls. How to deal with such foolishness? When the Sigmund Romberg, Otto Harback, Oscar Hammerstein 2d, Frank Mandel operetta was revived on Broadway in 1973, it barely survived for two weeks. The production was provincial, the casting was mostly careless and one would have thought ''The Desert Song,'' circa 1926, had finally been done to death. Yet, here we have a real revival. Robert Johanson's staging doesn't mock the musical (how tempting that would be), but it isn't being done straight either. Nothing about this ''Desert Song'' is overly reverential or needlessly affectionate, and an occasional dollop of camp seems, somehow, apt - and it's always understated. The priority is the singing - and it's a grand night for it at Darien. In the ''One Alone'' reprise (Act II, Scene 3), voices pour out from different parts of the theater, with the soprano solo soaring on stage. The production works at full vocal strength, and the singers look terrific, too. In Norman A. Large (''The Red Shadow,'' ''the only romantic and adventurous figure in Morocco, unbeatable in single combat,'' alias the ''milksop,'' Pierre Birabeau, which is somewhat like the Superman-Clark Kent identity split) and in Judith McCauley (as Margot), it has a pair of ardent, lovely lovers whose voices and presences would honor any operetta of any vintage or value. ''I heard you call for romance,'' Mr. Large declares, when he appears. Mr. Large is an adept silent-screen poseur when he announces, ''Here is my heart,'' on bended knee, while baring his chest ever so slightly and suggestively. Miss McCauley drops her pistol at that point - there's that touch of camp, and Miss McCauley swoons divinely. As the captain, the leader against the Riffs, who is, understandably, in love with Miss McCauley, Richard White is a resounding baritone. The sight and sound of Ira Hawkins as Ali Ben Ali, head of the Riff tribe and ally to the Red Shadow, are spectacular. Taylor Reed and Estelle Harris are a couple of obnoxious American tourists. Miss Harris's part can, as likely, be played by an ingenue type. The actress's amplitude and screechy voice - it is familiar to those who've heard radio and television soap pad commercials - work to considerable comic advantage and whatever silliness is required of Mr. Reed, he does sportingly. With ''The Student Prince'' (1979), ''Showboat'' (1980), ''New Moon'' (1981), and an occasional nod to Gilbert and Sullivan, the Darien Dinner Theater has established a cornerstone in the operetta repertory, to which a richly sung ''Desert Song'' can now be added. --------------------------------------------------------------------- ''The Desert Song'' at The Darien Dinner Theater, 65 Tokeneke Road.

1334-> ADVERTISING; Stone & Adler In New York
Stone & Adler, based in Chicago and one of two direct-marketing subsidaries of Young & Rubicam, plans to open a full-service office in New York around Feb.1. The office space hasn't been picked. According to Gerald Wood, the president, the move is being made initially to provide better service to East Coast clients, specifically at the moment, American Telephone and Telegraph's Long Lines division in Bedminister, N.J., and the Stauffer Chemical Company in Westport, Conn. Mr. Wood said he expected his billings to rise to $55 million in 1982 from last year's $40 million. He also predicted that the New York office should increase to $20 million in billings by the end of 1983 and employ 30 to 40 people. In effect, the agency had a New York office from 1971 to 1976 when it was united with Rapp & Collins (now a subsidiary of Doyle Dane Bernbach) to form Rapp, Collins, Stone & Adler.

1336-> THE DELOREAN: VALUE DEBATED
When John Z. DeLorean decided in the 1970's to produce a hot new sports car, his intention was to build an ''ethical'' auto. By that, Mr. DeLorean said, he meant one that did not disintegrate five years after it rolled off the showroom floor. There seems little question that Mr. DeLorean's creation will be seen on the road in the months ahead, auto experts say. What is at issue is the true worth of the stainless-steel car - its original listed price was $25,000 - and whether it will become a collector's item as a result of the closing of the DeLorean factory in Northern Ireland and Mr. DeLorean's arrest on drug charges in Los Angeles. Demand for the DeLorean sports car, somewhat laggard in its lifetime, grew this week, sparked by speculative interest. Some estimates put the number of DeLoreans in the United States at 4,000, and there were additional cars in Britain awaiting shipment. ''Everybody is telling me the car is a collector's item,'' said Al Burns, editor of Insider, a newsletter for automobile dealers. ''I was talking to one dealer and he said he wished he had half a dozen of them.'' 'Tremendous Interest' Al Hanley, owner of Dayton Ford in South Brunswick, N.J., has five DeLoreans in stock and he said that the week's news had provoked ''tremendous interest,'' although the cars remained unsold yesterday. ''This story broke on Tuesday night,'' he said, ''and we had three calls before 9 o'clock Wednesday morning. Since then, the phone has been ringing off the wall and people keep coming in, full of curiosity.'' Mr. Hanley has been one of the country's 345 DeLorean dealers since July 1981, when the car came to market, and he said he had sold more than 40. His current stock, Mr. Hanley said, consists of both '81 and '82 models, and the sticker prices, respectively, are $26,175 and $29,825. ''Prior to this week,'' he said, ''we were actually asking $18,500 for the 81's and $21,900 for the 82's.'' Parts and service are no problem for a buyer, he added, because the DeLorean carries a fiveyear, 50,000-mile warranty, backed by an outside insurance company, and the existing supply of parts is sizable. Mr. Hanley added that he has liked the car from the beginning, although ''it has had a few faults with the electrical system.'' The early DeLoreans were lacking in quality, some car experts say, and the car was roundly criticized in some of the auto trade magazines. The gull-wing doors, weighing 90 pounds apiece, were said to fit badly. The fiberglass body structure creaked beneath the silver steel skin. Knobs, buttons and other pieces fell off regularly. In fact, one of the early functions of Mr. DeLorean's public relations staff was to keep the cars out of the hands of an eager press. Quality did improve dramatically, though, and there was no question that the DeLorean's stainless-steel skin would keep its surface young for years. The shape of the skin was quite another matter. The design - created by an Italian stylist, Giorgio Giugiaro, in 1974 - was seven years old before the first customer ever slid into the standard leather buckets, and reviews regularly struggled to be kind by calling the new car's styling ''not quite dated.'' Peformance was another area that attracted criticism, since the DeLorean's Renault V-6 generated only 130 horsepower, hardly enough to make a rocket of any 3,100-pound vehicle. But styling rather than performance or price remained the car's biggest problem, according to the company's former president, J. Bruce McWilliams. Image a Selling Point Writing in this month's issue of Car and Driver magazine, Mr. McWilliams - who had served as marketing vice president before assuming the top post - said buyers tended to be older, with a primary interest in image, and many had swapped Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles for the two-seaters. ''But,'' he said, ''even for its target group, the car does not deliver in any ultimate sense. It lacks the glitter and luster that chrome and high-gloss painted finishes provide. It fails to be elegant in a flashy kind of way.'' Another of the problems with the stainless-steel skin was that it showed every fingerprint, every speck of dirt, and needed constant cleaning. In addition, repair was difficult. In New York, for instance, Martin Motors last week advertised a 1981 model for only $6,900, noting that its body ''needed restoration.'' The complexity of the body's assembly - thin steel applied over an injection-molded plastic base - was also reflected in a much higher price than the $12,000 originally projected. John Gunnell, technical editor of Old Cars magazine, which publishes a price guide for collectors, said a wide range of opinion exists among the experts, but that he thinks the DeLorean is a collector's item and will become more so. 'A Special Car' ''A lot has to do with the number made,'' he said, ''and I think 4,000 is low enough, particularly since it was really a special car right from the beginning.'' He said, however, that he did not think that growth in value would come quickly. ''I think it is going to be like the '78 Corvettes that were replicas of the Indy pace car,'' he said. ''They were going for $30,000 to $50,000 shortly after they came out, but you can buy a very nice one now for about $12,000 - about the price they sold for new. The car hasn't picked up yet, but it still has the potential.''

1337-> SPORTS PEOPLE; 5th N.H.L. Suspension
The National Hockey League, which imposed a total of nine suspensions all of last season for violence on the ice, has already meted out five since the 1982-83 season began two and a half weeks ago. The fifth was announced yesterday by Brian O'Neill, the league official in charge of disciplinary proceedings, and it will keep Dave (Tiger) Williams of the Vancouver Canucks out of action for six more games beginning next Friday, or sooner if Williams and the Canucks waive their right to appeal. The suspension of Williams, who had already been required to sit out one game while awaiting a hearing before O'Neill on Thursday, resulted from the two-handed swing with which he landed his stick on the helmet of the Islander goaltender Billy Smith in a game at Nassau Coliseum last Tuesday. ... Gary Laskoski, the surprisingly effective rookie goaltender from St. Lawrence University who had been paid on a per-game basis, has now agreed to a multiyear contract with the Los Angeles Kings. Laskoski has a 3-0-1 record so far this season, with a 3.1 goals-against average.

1339-> CENTER FOCUSES ON GLOBAL POTENTIAL FOR SOUTH
Former Secretaries of State Dean Rusk and Cyrus R. Vance are meeting here with an audience of Southerners for a few hours of weekend ''off-the-record'' conversation on topics that span the globe. Their appearance is part of an effort to widen the South's horizons in leadership and thinking as the region's economy becomes increasingly linked to foreign economies. The force behind the effort is the Southern Center for International Studies, a privately financed, nonpartisan organization started here in 1977 as an outgrowth of the Southern Council on International Public Affairs. The original group, headed by Mr. Rusk, was meant to stir Georgians' interest in topics of international concern. The center, its successor, has sought to develop a regionwide following. Pragmatism at the Core ''It's intellectual, but highly pragmatic,'' said Peter C. White, 47 years old, the president of the center, speaking of the organization's objectives and foreign investment in the South in recent years. Mr. White, who draws a parallel between the center today and the formative years of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, said enhanced awarness of global affairs was essential for the South to survive at a time of global competition. ''And right now,'' he said, ''there's no one trying to build interest in foreign affairs on a regionwide basis. We have some good people around the South in some fields, but no major institutions.'' After California, he said, the South is the hub of Japanese investment in the United States. A survey by the center of 600 accredited colleges and universities in the region found that as late as 1980, only 13 people were teaching subjects directly related to the Japanese. So, last year, the center presented a study series for academicians, people in advertising, news publishing and broadcasting, business, industry and religion, and state government officials on ''Japan in the 1980's.'' Foreign Ownership Cited Mr. White said, ''Miami is not just a worn-out tourist town - it's becoming the financial capital of Latin America. And look at A.&P. food stores and other grocery chains, major pieces of downtown property and banks in Atlanta, and you'll find they are owned by foreign interests. There's an interrelationship now.'' In the spring the center sponsored a forum on the issue of Palestinians. Next month the center has scheduled a discussion on ''Energy Issues: Impact on the Southern States.'' In addition to its forums, the center publishes a periodical, Global Review, which discusses current international issues and offers articles by contributors. Although Mr. White concedes that the center is patterned somewhat on the Council on Foreign Affairs, he hastens to add that it ''is not a council of high priests.'' He said his center stressed an appeal to a broad base of constituents beyond its membership of about 800. Going to the Schools Each year since 1979 the center has selected 50 holders of doctorates from Southern institutions to come to Atlanta nine times for discussions of foreign affairs with people like Mr. Rusk and Mr. Vance. ''The forums help get the people from the colleges interested in foreign affairs and bring them up to speed,'' Mr. White said, adding that there was a hunger in this region for academic depth in foreign affairs. ''And it's not just catering to Vanderbilt, Emory and Tulane,'' he went on, speaking of major Southern schools. ''It's the Fort Valleys, too, where we have found excellent people who may be at these schools for other reasons, such as dedication.'' Fort Valley is a historically black state college in southern Georgia that, like many other such colleges, does not enjoy widespread public recognition. In addition to the contributions the center receives from its members, the rest of its annual budget of nearly $500,000 is from foundation grants.

1340-> CRITICS' CHOICES
DANCE Japanese court dance is different from the classical dance forms associated with more popular entertainment such as Kabuki and that difference should be made clear in the Bugaku, or Japanese court dance concert at Japan House Monday and Tuesday at 8 P.M. The performance will be led by Suenobi Togi, whose family has been involved with the art for generations. The music will be provided by a Gagaku ensemble or court music group from U.C.L.A. and the University of Texas, Austin. Mr. Togi, who was trained at the Japanese Imperial Court Music School, has been teaching at U.C.L.A. The program promises to be varied, with a comic snake-hunting episode and two more symbolic pieces. Paul Sanasardo is modern-dance's poet for the age of anxiety. After an absence of several years from New York, he returned with a new company and some suprises last season. This consisted of some plotless, even gentle works. Strong emotions, however, are more typical of Mr. Sanasardo's work and Monday through Thursday at 8 P.M., the company will present four revivals. Among the pieces at the New York University Theater, 35 West 4th Street, is the well-known ''Metallics,'' a sharply-faceted study in jealousy danced to a mesmerizing score.

Without fanfare, Edwin H. Mosler Jr. of New York, who died last March, helped many of the world's best amateur figure skaters meet their expenses. He also raised money for the United States Olympic Committee. He created and oversaw the Vitalis/Olympic Invitational indoor track meet, whose 14th annual running is scheduled for Feb. 12 at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena. He created and oversaw Superskates, whose ninth annual edition is scheduled for Nov. 15 at Madison Square Garden. Both events raise money for the Olympic Committee. This edition of Superskates will include performances by Scott Hamilton and Elaine Zayak, the world champions, and such past and present national champions as Toller Cranston, Janet Lynn, Rosalynn Sumners, Jo Jo Starbuck and Ken Shelley, and the championship teams of Kitty and Peter Carruthers and Judy Blumberg and Michael Siebert.

1342-> U.N. AGAIN URGES HANOI TO PULL OUT OF CAMBODIA
By an overwhelming vote, the General Assembly called on Vietnam today to remove its 180,000 troops from Cambodia and permit Cambodians to choose their own government. For the first time in the four years that the Assembly has issued this appeal, the number of nations in support rose over the 100 mark to 105. Only 23, mostly from the Soviet bloc and its allies, were opposed, and 20 abstained. The vote against Vietnam started at 91 in 1979 and has climbed year by year. The larger vote this year is credited to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler, who has agreed to head an opposition coalition that includes the forces of the deposed Pol Pot. In the past some nations held back in fear that the only alternative to Heng Samrin was Pol Pot, accused of killing up to three million of his countrymen. Mr. Heng Samrin was installed as Cambodia's ruler by Vietnam in January, 1979. Some Southeast Asian envoys, the main architects of the Cambodian drive here, believe the expression of hostility by most of the world will in time make Vietnam more flexible and ready to negotiate. However, one Asian diplomat whose country has dealt with Hanoi doubted that Vietnam would be moved by anything except force. Total of 60,000 Guerrillas He argued that the anti-Vietnamese coalition would have to inflict more punishment before Hanoi is moved. Mr. Pol Pot has about 40,000 guerrillas in western Cambodia. The coalition partners, Prince Sihanouk and Son Sann, his former Prime Minister, command perhaps another 20,000. Vietnam's Foreign Minister, Nguyen Co Thach, has already visited Singapore, Malyasia and Thailand - three of the five members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - and is due for talks with the other two, the Philippines and Indonesia. But after his talks, diplomats found little flexibility in Hanoi's position, that the authority of Mr. Heng Samrin is, in the phrase of the Soviet Union, an ''irreversible fact.'' Today's resolution, strongly supported by the United States and China, does not mention Vietnam by name but calls for ''the withdrawal of all foreign forces.'' This is the formula the world body invariably applies to invading troops from the Soviet Union and its allies, although Israel, South Africa and others are named when they are accused of aggression. Opening the Cambodian debate, Le Kim Chung of Vietnam charged that China was behind the resistance to the regime in Phnom Penh and that Peking's aim was to weaken Vietnam in pursuit of ''hegemonist policies.'' Hanoi's delegate said that peace would come to the area if Peking stopped arming Mr. Pol Pot's guerrillas and signed a treaty of nonaggression and nonintervention. Closing the discussion, Tommy T.B. Koh of Singapore warned that unless Vietnam pulled out, ''it will begin to cast an avaricious eye on the other states of Southeast Asia.'' He urged Hanoi to negotiate and reminded Vietnam that the occupation and war had left its ''economy in shambles.''

1343-> TV SPORTS; A COSTLY HEADACHE FOR THE NETWORKS
P eople who watch professional football on television have been forced to find something else to do on Sunday afternoons and Monday nights, which have become a $100 million headache for the networks. That sum - about one-quarter of the $400 million that CBS, NBC and ABC had hoped to generate from advertisers of N.F.L. games - already has been lost and may be washed away forever. And the numbers will grow if the strike continues. The money can be salvaged only partly and only if the season resumes. N.F.L. officials are talking to the networks about squeezing in still another minute of commercial time into the remaining games. They had already gone to 24 minutes a game this season from 23 a year ago. Consider that over the course of the seven Sundays of the strike, only one show, a ''CBS SportsSunday,'' attracted as much as half the viewers of a pro football game. Some events -such as a Division III football game -lured only a third as many viewers. And the ratings for NBC's experiment with Canadian football sometimes dropped to a fourth of the N.F.L.'s. Meanwhile, ABC's ''Monday Night Football'' became, instead, ''Monday Night Films''. To the network's dismay, it has lost almost 40 percent of its football audience. To put these numbers in perspective, this is what is happening across America on Sundays and Mondays: - CBS: averages 14.8 million viewers - compared with 28.5 million last year. - NBC: averages 8 million viewers - compared with 20 million last year. - ABC: Its prime-time replacement averages 25 million viewers - compared with 39 million last year. The 30 network football games (including Thursday and Sunday prime-times) that have been lost in seven weeks would have produced about $150 million in advertising revenue. Instead, say network sources, alternative programming has generated only about $50 million. CBS has seen its rate for a half-minute on Sundays dwindle to $40,000 from $120,000, and ABC's rate for 30 seconds is $90,000 instead of $150,000. The reason is ratings. The higher the rating, the more the advertisers pay. And millions of Americans are doing other things on Sundays and on Monday nights, instead of watching television. Perhaps sociologists will discern a changing birth rate by next summer, or a lowered (or increased) crime rate, or more divorces or marriages. Are more people playing Scrabble or picking apples? Has the family's weekend way of life changed? I t is clear that because so many Americans have switched off their television sets, they have drastically affected the television economy in ways that are significant but are difficult to calculate. According to Paul Isacsson, the vice president of network sales for CBS, ''Most advertisers stayed with the alternate programming that we offered. But it's perhaps at a third of the money.'' There is going to be a multi-million-dollar morass to sort out when all this is over - how much would pro football still owe the networks? How will this money be paid? What impact has the strike had on the regular advertisers? ''The automotive advertisers were hurt,'' contends Mr. Isacsson. ''They feel the affluent male is their prospect, and he's found in N.F.L. football.'' Other advertisers, perhaps a quarter of the total, switched to other shows. And some advertisers simply pulled their money out. Much of the advertising industry spends its money on a calendar-year basis. If the money isn't spent by Dec. 31, it is returned to the company. And if pro football does resume, and the season is extended into January, what good does it do all the car companies that wanted to introduce their 1983 lines last September? These problems have prompted the three ranking network sports officials to warn the N.F.L. of the extreme difficulties in extending the sports season. In a hand-written memo to the N.F.L. commissioner, Pete Rozelle, the head of ABC Sports, Roone Arledge, said in part, ''It is really getting serious.'' He attached the following one-paragraph synopsis of the network's weekly sales meeting: ''Advertisers are starting to become concerned about replacement weight and do not want to wait out the strike anymore. We can offer them no position in Sports that would warrant them not recapturing their dollars at this point in time. Low interest for post-Christmas N.F.L. continues to be a prevailing theme.'' B ut while advertisers are unhappy over the lost games, they would be unhappy if they had to pump money into games that may be made up in January or February. And network officials complain that if the season resumed, and the Super Bowl were pushed back, the problems would be profound. ''We have firm, fixed contracts to televise 12 college basketball games after the football season,'' Arthur Watson, president of NBC Sports, said. ''It's very, very important for them - for the alumni, for exposure, for recruiting.'' And Neal Pilson, the president of CBS Sports, says, ''It's impossible to generate the profit dollars that football does.'' Meanwhile, over at N.F.L. headquarters, the league's director of broadcasting, Val Pinchbeck Jr., is mapping scenarios the way war games are discussed at Government-sponsored think tanks. The key to his strategy is that the Super Bowl remains in place - Jan. 30, 1983, at Pasadena, Calif. ''If we resume, we're working on a plan that would have each team pick up its schedule and play to the conclusion of the regular season - Dec. 27,'' says Mr. Pinchbeck. But from there, the league could take one of two steps: make up two lost games by substituting a game on the wild-card weekend and the open weekend before the Super Bowl. Or it could decide simply to make up one lost game and keep the wild-card playoff. In either case, the made-up games are likely to be between division or conference rivals. But these games may be pitted against Grand Prix tennis on CBS, or the Bob Hope Desert Classic - a highly rated golf tournament. Mr. Pinchbeck calls the various scenarios a ''logistical nightmare.'' Its long-term effects are impossible to predict.

1344-> Market Place; A Bellwether In Name Only
THE 10 3/8's of 2012 - those numbers may not convey the ring of poetry, but they now designate the United States Treasury bond with the longest maturity. ''This means that the 10 3/8's have assumed the role of the Government market's bellwether bond,'' said Robert A. Schwartz, senior financial economist at Merrill Lynch. There is no mystery as to how this 30-year bond - which carries a coupon interest rate of 10 3/8 percent and falls due in the year 2012 - assumed its current importance. Sold on Nov. 9 as part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding operation, it automatically became the Government bond with the longest maturity, replacing the 14's of 2011. The 10 3/8's also entered the record books since the $3 billion size constituted the largest single bond auction ever conducted by the Treasury. (Any Treasury security of longer than 10 years' duration is called a bond. Treasury notes run from one to 10 years.) Furthermore, the November sale marked the first auction of Treasury bonds since last February. As the nation's debt manager, the Treasury was unable to sell 30-year bonds in its May and August refinancings because Congressional authorization was lacking. Normally the 30-year Treasury bond with the maturity date that is farthest away provides the largest return to investors. However, the 10 3/8's of 2012 yield less than the 14's of 2011. Yesterday afternoon the 10 3/8's were being offered at a price of 98 24/32, to yield 10.50 percent. The 14's were offered at 126 26/32, for a return of 10.85 percent. Following the release of the latest money supply figures after 4 P.M., prices gave ground as yields rose even higher for both issues. The reason why the latest 30-year bond is not offering the highest yield centers on the spectacular rally that began around mid-1982, a rally that sent prices shooting higher and yields falling correspondingly lower. When the 10 3/8's were auctioned this month, their average yield was 10.46 percent. The Treasury's previous bond auction in February saw an average yield of 14.56 percent. This meant an astonishing drop of more than 400 basis points, or four full percentage points, between the two sales. In February the Treasury ''reopened'' the 14 percent bond that originally came out in November 1981 by selling $2.5 billion more of this issue. ''Investors in the Government bond market prefer to own issues selling close to par, or 100,'' noted Richard S. Davis, head of fixed-income research at the First Boston Corporation. ''Psychology plays a role here, and many people simply are reluctant to pay a high premium.'' But, thanks to this year's rally in the bond market, the 14's of 2011 became a premium bond, one with a price that had climbed well above its original-issue price. ''What you saw was portfolio managers switching to the issue with the lower coupon, in anticipation that potential profits from owning the 10 3/8's were greater than in the 14's,'' Mr. Schwartz said. As demand built for a preference to owning the bond with the lower coupon, the price of the 10 3/8's rose and its yield fell below that of the previously sold 14 percent bond. In hindsight, investors missed a superb opportunity by not buying the 14's of 2011 several months ago. On June 30, for example, this issue traded at about 100. Earlier this month, the price of the bond had climbed to a peak around 130, a level at which it yielded 10.63 percent. This meant that between mid-1982 and early November the owner of the bond could have made 30 percent on his money - plus interest meanwhile. At the same time, owners would have possessed the ''safest''bond available, since all Treasury issues are backed by the good faith and credit of the Government. Moreover, interest on Treasury bonds is exempt from state and local income taxes. (The interest is subject to Federal income tax, however.) Back in February of this year the 14's of 2011, it is now apparent, were even more of a bargain. At that time, the price fell as low as 94 5/8, a level that meant a yield of 14.80 percent. For investors with a historical bent, Treasury bonds some seven or eight years ago yielded 8 percent or a shade more. But that was in a period when price swings in the Government securities market were far less volatile than today, thanks to a lower inflation rate and other factors. Treasury bonds, according to Mr. Davis, offer certain distinctive features in relation to corporate bonds. A 30-year Treasury bond typically carries call protection until the last five years of its life. This means that the Treasury, in the event of declining interest rates, cannot call the bond away from its owner. By comparison, the average long-term industrial bond offers call protection for only the first 10 years, and the typical long-term utility bond carries only five years of call protection.

1345-> AROUND THE NATION; Testers Find Strong Acid In a Bottle of Eye Drops
The eye drop solution from a bottle of Visine A.C. purchased in the Washington area was replaced entirely with a solution of ''rather strong'' hydrochloric acid, causing temporary eye damage to a suburban woman, the Food and Drug Administration said tonight. However, the police chief supervising the investigation said he had ''grave reservations'' about the case. Fairfax Conty Police Chief Carroll Buracker said that the victim, Dbra Hill, 30 years old, of Reston, Va., had refused to take a polygraph test in the case and that she had had a previous conflict with the drugstore where she said she bought the drops. A spokesman for the F.D.A., Bill Grigg, said tests done on other bottles taken from the shelf of the Herndon, Va., drug store where the contaminated bottle was purchased showed no other signs of tampering. Earlier in October, the authorities said a man in Grand Junction, Colo., suffered minor burns when he used eye drops laced with hydrochloric acid. In August, three southern Californians were injured by eye and nose drops contaminated with sulfuric acid.

1346-> ALTERNATIVES SOUGHT TO LOUD FIRE SIRENS
DEMAREST THE quality of life in this Bergen County bedroom community of 4,500 residents is being measured these days not in annual family income but, instead, in decibels. A few weeks ago, the State Superior Court ruled in favor of Dr. William Pecoraro, a dentist whose home and office on Hardenburgh Avenue are near a utility pole to which a fire siren is attached. Dr. Pecoraro called the siren a public nuisance, and the court ordered the Mayor and Borough Council to seek a solution to the problem, one that affects many municipalities throughout New Jersey and in nearby states. The problem, legislators and public-health officials say, may take years to resolve. Here in Demarest, the siren near Dr. Pecoraro's home, like two others across town and above the firehouse, emits a signal that tops 120 decibels, as measured by local and state health officials. That level violates state and Federal noise-control regulations and is considered damaging to those exposed to it over an extended period. According to the state's Office of Noise Control, an arm of the Department of Environmental Protection, the agency has neither the funds nor the manpower to enforce existing regulations or draft new ones. ''I'm worried about my family's safety, and my neighbors have that same concern for their own families,'' said Dr. Pecoraro, who has been battling Demarest officials since 1970. Last year, he formed a coalition representing people from 180 New Jersey municipalities faced with similar noise problems. The organization - RULES, an acronym for Removal of Unreasonably Loud Emergency Signals - is gaining momentum and drawing legislative attention. ''This thing is 30 feet away from my bedroom window,'' Dr. Pecoraro said. ''When it goes off in the middle of the night, you're not just awakened, but forced into a state of shock.'' When his three children were infants, Dr. Pecoraro said, ''their arms and legs would flail about and they'd cry'' when the siren went off, and he and his wife would ''have to stand there and hold our hands over their ears, and hope the siren wouldn't go off again in the middle of the night.'' According to Dr. Pecoraro, the Borough Council refused to entertain complaints from him and his neighbors until legal action was taken. Since 1977, proposals to relieve the problem have been rejected by the Council, which has spent nearly $30,000 in legal and research fees. To ease the problem, the Demarest Fire Department, a volunteer organization, has curtailed the siren-testing schedule from six days a week to two, has shortened the time in which the town's three sirens blare and has eliminated their use in alerting volunteers to brush fires and nonemergency situations, such as parades and fundraising events. Its other options included shifting the siren near Dr. Pecoraro's home to a higher utility pole and reducing its decibel level; relocating sirens to less-populous areas, such as public parks; eliminating the sirens and buying radio pocket pagers for the 50-man department or using a combination of low-pitch sirens and pagers. More and more fire departments in the New Jersey-New York-Connecticut area are using the radio pagers or a combination siren-radio pager system. But fire and noise-control experts stress that each community has its own special needs and that no one system can apply everywhere. ''For years now, we've been using a combination, and complaints are very minimal,'' said John Goldsmith, chief of the volunteer Fire Department in the Rockland County (N.Y.) community of Stony Point. According to Chief Goldsmith, there are now fewer sirens in the more-populated areas, but he stressed that two systems (sirens and radio pagers) were needed in case one failed. Mr. Goldsmith, a trustee of the New York and New Jersey Volunteer Firefighters Association, said that all 26 fire departments in Rockland County relied on sirens and pagers. ''I can only speak for this department,'' said Fire Chief Anthony A. Aiellos of Hackensack, ''but we find that radio alerts are more effective and reach more men. If one of our men is in a movie house or at a shopping mall, chances are he's not going to hear a siren. However, with a pocket pager, he'll know something's up.'' ''Ultimately, we would be satisfied only if the sirens were removed,'' Dr. Pecoraro said, but be added that a compromise might be in order, such as removing sirens from residential streets (but keeping the one atop the firehouse) and notifying firefighters by pocket pagers. ''Our job is fighting fires and saving lives and property,'' said Theodore Palbos, Demarest's Fire Chief. ''To do this job and what we've all volunteered for, we have to depend on a foolproof system that alerts our people to an emergency and can be heard no matter where you are in town.'' Department administrators contend that the pocket pagers are clumsy to carry and susceptible to interference. ''That doesn't happen with a siren,'' said Chief Palbos, adding that his department had tested a half-dozen pagers with limited success. Flaws include mechanical failures and the inability to use the devices while they are being recharged. Buying pagers for the department's 50 volunteers, Chief Palbos said, would cost about $40,000. He called such an expense unfair to the borough. ''It costs this department just over $150 a year to operate and maintain those sirens, and that's a big difference,'' he said. In nearby Paramus, the volunteer Fire Department has been using radio pagers instead of sirens since May, and officials there say the borough's 28,000 residents face no mounting safety risk. ''It's worked just fine, and it's a more-effective system,'' said Fire Chief William Comery. ''The pagers have improved our response time. However, what's good for us might not necessarily work for other towns.'' Dr. Pecoraro and his neighbors contend that volunteer firefighters in Demarest are blocking the siren ban because it would diminish the department's presence and possibly curtail private donations. However, fire officials vehemently insist that public safety is the only issue. ''From the publicity we've got recently, we're being made out to sound like the bad guys,'' said Michael Lendino, a former Demarest Fire Chief. ''That's not the case here. We have a system that works and, unless we're provided with a system that's equal to or better than that, we have to rely on the sirens.'' According to Jordan Corwin, an assistant environmental engineer with the state's Office of Noise Control, the primary complaint his office receives is from residents angered over piercing fire sirens. ''It is our top complaint,'' Mr. Corwin said, ''but because of budgetary problems and the lack of resources on our part, there's nothing much that we can do about it.'' Officials of the Department of Environmental Protection are empowered to enforce the state's 10-year-old Noise Control Act, but budget cuts affecting the Office of Noise Control (the 1980 budget of $75,000 was cut to $45,000 this year) are said to make enforcement all but impossible. ''Ideally, there should be tighter and more-enforceable regulations for sirens,'' Mr. Corwin said, ''but for that we need money for lengthy research, and it's just not available.''

1347-> SOUTH AFRICA PUTS NEW 3-YEAR BAN ON AN AFRIKANER FOE OF APARTHEID
The Rev. Beyers Naude, a dissident Afrikaner churchman who broke with his church and people in order to make common cause with blacks in opposition to apartheid, was placed under a new three-year ban today that makes it a crime for him to attend meetings, write for publication or be quoted anywhere in South Africa. The notification was delivered to him this morning at his home in Johannesburg, just three days before the expiration of a five-year ban that he received when the Government clamped down on white as well as black opposition in 1977 after the death in detention of the prominent black nationalist Steve Biko. An interracial organization that Dr. Naude founded and headed, the Christian Institute, which was designed to mobilize opposition to the racial system within South African churches, was declared illegal at that time. Silenced for Five Years At 67 Dr. Naude is considered to be the most significant opponent of apartheid to have emerged among Afrikaners, the dominant white group. Although he has been silenced for five years, his influence has continued to be felt in church circles, especially in the segregated nonwhite branches of the Dutch Reformed Church, of which Dr. Naude was a prominent leader. This month a synod of the Sendingkerk, or mission church, which serves the people of mixed race who are known as coloreds, accused its white mother church of heresy and idolatry for its rigid adherence to racial separation in the churches and society at large. Both by example and personal counseling, Dr. Naude is known to have been a major influence on the young clergymen, white as well as colored, who have brought the mission church to the verge of a break with the white church. The theological and political challenge that this represents has encouraged a debate within the white church itself and, although conservative elements in the church managed to close ranks and reassert their authority at a synod that ended last week, there seems little doubt that the debate is likely to intensify in the coming months. Naude Doubted Ban Would Expire In the light of these developments, Dr. Naude was known to regard it as unlikely that the authorities would let him exert an active influence on the course of the debate by allowing his ban to expire this week. But friends continued to nurse the hope that his prestige in international religious circles would have some bearing on the Government of Prime Minister P.W. Botha when it made its decision. Dr. Naude's father was a founding member of the Broederbond, the secret society that has been regarded as a controlling influence in church affairs. For 23 years he was a member of the society, until he decided he could no longer square its practices with his Christian convictions. Finally he decided that the only morally supportable position for a white who sought change in South Africa was to support black initiatives for change. ''Beyers Naude is a thorn in the flesh of many concerned white South Africans,'' wrote a Methodist theologian in a volume of essays in homage to Dr. Naude that was recently published here. ''He is a living example of what it may cost to take the Christian message seriously in a land like this.''

BALLESTEROS DEFEATS WADKINS VIRGINIA WATER, England, Oct. 16 (AP) - Severiano Ballesteros of Spain and Sandy Lyle of Britain scored semifinal victories over Americans today in the $215,000 Suntory world match play golf championship. Ballesteros won, 3 and 1, from Lanny Wadkins, who lost a two-hole lead in the scheduled 36-hole match on Wentworth's 6,945-yard, par-72, tree-lined course. Lyle defeated Tom Kite, 8 and 7. Ballesteros and Lyle will meet in the final Sunday for a first prize of $60,000. Lyle is trying to be the first Briton to win the title. The course played long in the rain and the wind. Wadkins played the best golf in his morning round against Ballesteros. He finished the first 18 holes in 69, three under par, and was 2 up. Ballesteros Moves Ahead Ballesteros pulled even after five holes in the afternoon. Wadkins was all even and still in contention with 10 holes to play, but then he faded. Ballesteros won the 27th and was 1 up. Of the last six holes played, the American managed only one in par figures. Ballesteros could not pull further ahead until the 34th, where Wadkins conceded after hitting into the trees. Wadkins conceded again at the next hole after taking 4 to reach the green, with Ballesteros having shot a 3. ''How to play badly in match play and win,'' Ballesteros said at a news conference later. He said Wadkins drove straight and played well in the morning and for the first 11 holes in the afternoon. ''Then he started hitting all over the place,'' Ballesteros said. ''I don't know why. It was very difficult out there. I think we were both tired, with no feeling in our hands because of the cold.'' Kite won only two of the 29 holes he played. He began with three bogeys and was 3 down after three holes. He was 6 down at the end of the morning round. Lyle was then two under par and Kite was four over. Kite Takes an 8 on a Par 4 Kite won his two holes at the start of the afternoon and was then only 4 down. But at the 21st he had a bizarre turn of luck and took 8 for the par-4 hole. The approach to the green is uphill. Kite tried three times, with an 8-iron, a 7-iron and a 6-iron, and each time the ball got to the top of the hill and rolled down again. Kite tried with his 6-iron again. This time he got over the hill but was through the green. Lyle was then leading by five holes. He went 6 up at the 25th with a par 4, and 7 up with a 20-foot birdie putt at the 26th. Lyle rolled in a putt from 20 feet for another birdie at the 29th, and the match was over. ---- Taiwanese Leads by 8 Shots GOTEMBA, Japan, Oct. 16 (AP) -Hsieh Min Nan, a 42-year-old Taiwanese professional seeking his second victory in a week, shot a 65 today and extended his lead to eight strokes after the third round of the $113,207 Golf Digest tournament. Hsieh, who won the Tokai Golf Classic last week, finished the day with a 54-hole total of 199, 17 under par, on the 6,897-yard, par-72 Tomei Country Club course near Mount Fuji, south of Tokyo. He had birdies and no bogeys for the third straight day. Bruce Lietzke, winner of this year's Canadian Open, was tied for second with the Japanese veteran Kikuo Arai at 207, nine under par. Lietzke carded a five-under-par 67.

1349-> MATTEL STOCK BUFFETED BY VIDEO GAME SCARE
The video game stock scare claimed two more victims yesterday. Mattel Inc. lost nearly a third of its market value in heavy trading. And Imagic Inc., a game cartridge company that had been planning to make its first public common stock offering in the middle of this month, said it was postponing its offering until early next year because of ''unsettled market conditions.'' But shares of most other stocks hurt in Thursday's scare over the profits of video game manufacturers generally dropped only a little or even recovered a bit yesterday. Second Most Active Issue Mattel, which did not trade on Thursday, dropped 7 1/4, to 16 3/4 yesterday, and was the second most active issue on the New York exchange, with more than 2.6 million shares traded. The company had said Thursday that it expects a loss in its current fiscal quarter because of increased competition in video games and the general slump in the retail industry. Warner Communications, whose Atari unit is also experiencing disappointing game sales, fell 1 1/4, to 34 3/4, after falling 16 3/4 points the day before. It was the most active issue on the New York exchange. Yesterday, Moody's said that because of the new outlook in the video game business, it was lowering its rating on Warner's senior debt to AA3 from AA2 and on its subordinated debt to A1 from AA3. Offering Set for 1983 Imagic, a fast-growing maker of game cartridges whose offering had been eagerly anticipated, said that it would make its offering next year, when market conditions had been clarified and its new products introduced. It has said the industry as a whole is healthy and that Atari was merely losing market share. Other stocks that had dropped sharply Thursday recovered some ground yesterday. They included Coleco Industries, a video game maker; Toys ''R'' Us, a retailer; Tandy Corporation, a retailer and home computer maker; and Commodore International, a home computer manufacturer. But Texas Instruments, which also makes home computers, continued its plunge, as did General Instrument, which supplies electronic chips to game makers.

1350-> RIGHT TO LIFE PARTY OFFERING FULL TICKET FOR STATE OFFICES
Four years ago, the Right to Life organization surprised many major-party politicians when its candidate for governor, Mary Jane Tobin, got more votes than Governor Carey received on the Liberal Party's line. The result established the organization as one of five official parties in New York State and placed it fourth on ballots, behind the Democrats, Republicans and Conservatives. Before the election, Right to Life candidates had been required to gather nominating petitions to qualify for the ballot. This year, the party is running a full ticket for statewide offices. It has also endorsed candidates for Congress, the Legislature and judgeships in almost all districts. ''Our goal is the 50,000 votes to stay a party,'' said Mrs. Tobin, the party's first state chairman. Shift in Leadership Mrs. Tobin was succeeded recently as the party's state leader by another Nassau County resident, Ellen McCormack, the Right to Life candidate for President in 1976 and 1980. The party has three Long Islanders and a Brooklynite on its ticket for statewide offices. It has also endorsed Assemblywoman Florence M. Sullivan of Brooklyn for United States Senate. Mrs. Sullivan is also the nominee of the Republicans and Conservatives. Following are the candidates who make up the Right to Life Party's state ticket: - Governor: Robert J. Bohner, 47 years old, of Garden City, L.I., a lawyer in Queens. - Lieutenant Governor: Paul F. Callahan, 61, of Garden City, a lawyer in Brooklyn. - Comptroller: John Boyle of Hempstead, L.I., a retired utility worker. - Attorney General: Kevin P. McGovern, 49, of Brooklyn, a former Conservative Party official who said he was leaving that party because of ''its soft position on abortion.'' His wife, Bernadette, a former Conservative district leader, has also abandoned the Conservatives and is running on the Right to Life line for Assembly. Mr. McGovern says he is the only ''professional politician'' among the four. 'Defend the Unborn Child' Mr. Bohner, the gubernatorial candidate, said, ''The basic reason for my candidacy is to defend the unborn child, which is being destroyed at the rate of one and a half million a year.'' He denounces ''the new culture of expediency,'' which, he said, approves of ''the elimination of life that is burdensome.'' Such thinking, he said, leads to child abuse and euthanasia. He favors a constitutional amendment to ban abortions. On other issues, Mr. Bohner said he supported capital punishment, stricter enforcement of drunken-driving laws, tuition tax credits for parents of private-school students, stricter bail procedures, a shift in the burden of proof of insanity to the defendants in criminal cases and tax incentives for business. The candidates have little money and campaign sporadically, mostly at rallies of supporters. They complain that they have been ''blacked out'' by the news media. The candidates have been relying on a network of supporters who produced 130,193 votes for governor in 1978. In 1980, 24,159 votes were cast for Mrs. McCormack in the presidential race. In addition, 152,470 votes were cast on the Right to Life line for Alfonse M. D'Amato in the Senate race.

1351-> NOTES ON FASHION
THERE are 260 duchesses in the world and 320 of them were in town l ast week, their titles attached to what sounded like mostly m ythical kingdoms. Could anyone, except perhaps for its Duchess, e xactly recall the location of Feria and whether or not it is really b igger than a limousine? No matter. Like some huge, honking migration of chic geese, the Europeans reclaimed their New York nesting ground as if it belonged to them alone. There were Swedish dinners. A Spanish ball. One Greek brunch. The Infanta at the opera. And there, shining bright beside a camera crew at Bergdorf Goodman, was Countess Donina Cicogna, blond and wiry in top-to-toe black sequins at an evening showing of Gianfranco Ferre's spring collection. ''Last year, Gianfranco said, 'Paillettes, paillettes, paillettes,' '' the Countess said, rolling her eyes. ''Actually, I gave him the idea. So here I am pailletted to death and no one else is wearing them.'' Nary a paillette was to be found in Mr. Ferre's new collection. But the clothing dazzled. There were toast-colored pants suits, white trousers with only one continuous seam, this running on the inside of the legs. The black, sleeveless, calf-length dresses showed that long lengths for spring look considerably more modern than shorter skirts. And nothing was better than a white one-button draped jacket worn with a black, partly pleated skirt, slit to midthigh, with a hem that did a glissando from below the model's left knee to just below her right calf. That was fashion. MEANWHILE, at an informal showing at Giorgio Armani's showroom, the m ost directional new spring style was not his cropped jacket suits, n ot the colorful skirts with pieced hip yokes and not the double b elts. No. Gabriella Forte saved the best for last. ''For spring,'' s he said, ''we believe in this.'' There it was, nothing more than a l ittle shirt dress in a pique fabric with a button-down collar and a b elt that can be used to give the whole thing some muscle. After all t he suits predicted, that little dress looked like fashion too. ALTHOUGH the same four hundred people saw one another on almost e very night of the week, at no point was there any danger of c onversation rising above ''How good you look tonight,'' except, thati s, at the Erte evening, where Halston decided to take a shot at his f ellow American fashion designers. ''American designers need a good s lap in the face,'' he said. ''They've always shamelessly copied the E uropeans, but now they're doing it more than ever, and hiring E uropeans from Paris to do the same clothes here.'' THEN Pauline Trigere was on the phone in full voice. ''What do you m ean you didn't receive the invitation?'' she said. ''Well, then, I 'll tell you. On Nov. 24th I am being given the Medaille de Vermeil o f the city of Paris by the Mayor. Why? Can I boast a bit? It's beingg iven to me because I've been a very good girl and because I was borni n Paris and have made good in another part of the world. I got the s ilver medal 10 years ago. It's not the Legion d'Honneur, of course, b ut I'm still thrilled. So I'm going to get it over Thanksgiving. I c an have turkey any time.'' DURING the past few seasons, Ugo Correani has established his reputation in Europe by designing a ccessories for Karl Lagerfeld and Versace. For fall, he has designeda collection of obviously fake but arrestingly beautiful black Art D eco plastic cuffs, studded with rhinestones, that are currently a vailable at Macy's for prices starting at $125. On Friday, though, h e sat in his showroom surrounded by his new spring accessories and s aid: ''I love this one, and this one, and this one, too. All my c ollections are different. It's too boring to do only one thing. Thatw ould be sad.'' The objects of his affection were collections that were by turns Byzantine, Egyptian and 50's modern. Amid these, one stood out, primarily because it did not pretend to be costly jewelry. It offers long, wonderfully weighted necklaces of round and nugget-shaped opalescent beads, earrings shaped like nuggets or large round buttons, and cuffs. All of it shimmers with the new pastel direction for spring colors, which include aquas, pale pink and banana yellow. THE French have established a new retail beachhead at 325 Fifth A venue, at 32d Street, and proved that Europeans do not dream only ofs equins. The store, incongrously called Satin, is aimed directly at t he working woman, and offers a wide variety of spotlessly sensible s uits, including black-and-white checked suits for $140, silk blousest hat start at $65, gun check blazers for $175 and colorfully printed d resses that start at $140. BY week's end the Countess Cicogna had changed her clothes. The o ccasion was her dinner dance at Joanna on 18th Street and everyone h ad been instructed that dress was informal. But the women wore satind resses, sequined tops, heavy jewelry; the men, dark suits. Only t hree women wore pants: the Countess, Pat Buckley and Carolina H errera. What, then, does informal mean? ''It's simple,'' said Mrs. Herrera. ''In New York informal means you don't wear a ball gown.''

1352-> 16 MAJOR PAINTINGS TO BE SOLD
Sixteen Impressionist paintings collected at the turn of the century by the Henry O. Havemeyers and not seen publicly for a halfcentury will be auctioned in May at Sotheby Parke Bernet. The house values the works at more than $10 million. The collection was described by John L. Marion, Sotheby's chairman, as the most important to come up for public sale since the Jakob Goldschmidt auction of seven Impressionist works by Sotheby's in London in 1958. The sale includes two by Degas and one each by Cezanne, Manet and Monet, each of which is valued conservatively at $1 million or more. There are also five others by Degas, two by Monet and one each by Cezanne, Manet, Corot and Renoir. The collection formed by Henry O. and Louisine Elder Havemeyer, who made their fortune in sugar refining and were benefactors of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was left at Mrs. Havemeyer's death in 1929 to Horace, their only son. 2 Favorites by Degas It was Mrs. Havemeyer, a widow since 1907, who bequeathed to the Met the Havemeyer's Old Master and Impressionist paintings, including El Greco's ''View of Toledo,'' which have been described as a keystone of the museum's holdings and one of the most important bequests ever given to an American museum. Other works include Bronzino's ''Portrait of a Young Man,'' Rembrandt's ''The Gilder,'' Coubet's ''Woman With a Parrot'' and Manet's ''Boating.'' The five most important works for sale include two by Degas that were favorites of Mrs. Havemeyer - ''Le Cafe Concert: La Chanson Chien,'' showing a woman singing to a festive audience in a brilliantly lighted cafe, a gouache and pastel from the late 1870's, and ''L'Attente,'' a pastel on paper from 1882 depicting a young ballerina and her female companion awaiting an audition. Two other Degas paintings originally in the collection, which went to the Havemeyers' daughter Electra Webb, were sold last week by their grandaughter Electra Webb Bostwick. The sale at Christie's was of ''Dancers Resting,'' which went for $1.3 million, and ''Dancers at the Bar,'' which sold for $1 million. Enhanced by Additions The three other major paintings in the coming sale are a Cezanne still life, ''Vase de Fleurs'' from 1885, Manet's ''Le Port de Calais'' from 1881 and Monet's ''La Zaan Zaandam,'' a brilliantly colored work of two people in a red boat on a canal in the Netherlands. In addition, there are a Manet floral still life from 1883, one of very few of this subject in private hands; Corot's ''L'Algerienne'' from 1870, a painting of an Algerian woman; a Cezanne landscape from 1874, and two works by Monet. The assemblage, dramatically enlarged by additions made by Horace Havemeyer, numbered more than 2,000 works and enriched many of the Met's departments of art and the decorative arts; but it was strongest in Old Master and Impressionist paintings. According to Mrs. Havemeyer's will and later accounts, Horace Havemeyer was empowered to choose which works would be given to the museum and which would be retained by him and other family members. His mother's bequest was valued at $311,711. After Mr. Havemeyer made the additions, the gift was valued at $3.4 million. More Private Life Both major Degas works were described by Mrs. Havemeyer in ''16 to 60, Memoirs of a Collector,'' which was privately printed in 1961. She wrote of the cafe scene, ''The dazzling lights are there, the gay crowd is suggested, but you cannot fail to see the crass banality of the scene.'' In contrast to the H.O. Havemeyers who entertained lavishly and shared their art collection with others, their son and his wife, Doris Dick, led a more private life - one reason why the collection was unknown until Doris Havemeyer's death in September. The collection has been consigned by her estate; her husband died in 1956. Among the few works added by the younger couple is Renoir's ''Portrait of a Young Girl,'' a pastel from 1879. Negotiations for the collection began in late September, and competition was reportedly heated between Sotheby's and Christie's. According to Mr. Marion, the family ''decided that auction was their only course.'' Agreement was reached Monday night, when some of the papers were signed. Others were completed yesterday morning, and the paintings were moved to Sotheby's. Many Bought From Artists Commenting on the small size of the works, the largest of which is Manet's harbor scene, measuring 31 by 39 inches, Mr. Wilson stressed the view Louisine Havemeyer had of small paintings. ''She was a great one in believing that size did not figure in the importance of an art work,'' he said. In reviewing how the Havemeyers purchased art, Mr. Marion and Mr. Wilson said that the couple purchased paintings directly from the artists -especially Degas and Manet. ''There was one entire room in their Fifth Avenue home filled with Degas paintings,'' Mr. Marion said. The works not purchased directly from the artists were bought from their agents in the artist's lifetime. Sotheby's will exhibit selections from the collection in Houston and London next spring before the gaveling in May. The remains of the original collection, numbering close to 3,000 offerings, were dispersed in a 10-day series of auctions at the Havemeyers' residence in April 1930, a sale that totaled $327,616.

1353-> SCOUTING; Montana Winter
Before long, Flathead Lake will be freezing over and the first snow will fall, covering the landscape until spring. So it's time to stack the wood and await ''the dreaded beast,'' as Phil Jackson describes winter. ''I'm putting the finishing touches on the house now,'' Jackson said from his home just outside Kalispell, Mont. ''We'll have some heavy snow by Thanksgiving, and we'll all be ready to ski. It's a big change in life-style.'' Jackson has spent previous winters playing for the Knicks, then the Nets. He also was an assistant coach for the Nets and last season was the team's television analyst. Now he and his wife have opened a sports and physical fitness center in Kalispell called The Second Wind. ''We're preaching the gospel of fitness,'' said Jackson, the son of a minister. Jackson also hopes to resume his broadcasting career by doing games for cable television. Mostly, though, he will work at the center and contemplate at the foot of Flathead Lake. ''It's pretty big, looks like an ocean,'' he said. ''I wracked up my boat this summer on the lake. It's nice, though. Someday, I want to get back into basketball in some capacity, but right now, this is what we want to do.'' Frank Litsky Peter Alfano

1356-> Defendants Must Have Counsel, Strike or No
To the Editor: The current strike by Legal Aid attorneys throughout New York City has created an enormous strain on the criminal-justice system and places an additional burden on responsible government officials to act to insure that the rights of criminal defendants are protected. In this regard, a Nov. 5 news story reporting that 150 criminal defendants were arraigned in Queens Criminal Court without attorneys was extremely troubling. The article quotes John Keenan, Mayor Koch's coordinator for criminal justice, as saying that it is legal to arraign defendants without counsel ''if there are no lawyers available.'' Unfortunately, Mr. Keenan's comments misstate the applicable law, for the practice of arraigning defendants without counsel is clearly illegal under both New York State law and the United States Constitution. The right to counsel does not diminish simply because it happens to be administratively inconvenient for the government. The state's Criminal Procedure Law provides that every defendant ''has a right to the aid of counsel at the arraignment and at every subsequent stage of the action ... '' It goes on to say that any defendant appearing at arraignment without counsel has the right ''to have counsel assigned by the court in any case where he is financially unable to obtain the same.'' These statutory provisions reflect fundamental constitutional values. In the landmark case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court recognized that ''the noble ideal'' of fair and impartial trials cannot be realized if the poor man charged with a crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer. Any arraignment at which a plea can be taken has been deemed by the Court to be a ''critical stage'' of the criminal proceeding at which counsel must be present. Moreover, the Court has refused to engage in a case-by-case analysis of whether prejudice has occurred, instead adopting the general view that the presence of counsel at the arraignment is essential to enable the accused to know all the defenses available to him and to plead intelligently. It is improper for Mr. Keenan to suggest that any defendant insisting upon his or her right to counsel at arraignment will likely spend more time in jail because of that insistence. The inevitable effect of such a statement is to encourage defendants to waive their rights, which is hardly an appropriate or constructive role for the government to be playing. Over all, the Legal Aid strike presents a challenge for the city which will require bold and principled leadership by those charged with overseeing the administration of the criminal-justice system.

1358-> SPORTS PEOPLE; A Tough Man
Randy Wright, the Wisconsin quarterback, worked out yesterday and said he felt fine. In last Saturday's 20-17 loss to Indiana, Wright was injured with four minutes left in the first half. His limbs were temporarily paralyzed, and he said he was told later that he had been unconscious between 45 seconds and two minutes. He was removed by ambulance to the university hospital, but he returned to the game on the first play of the fourth quarter. After the game, he had amnesia and experienced difficulty answering questions. Dr. William Clancy, the team physician who allowed him to return, said he would do it again. Though Wright had suffered a ''very mild concussion,'' Dr. Clancy said, X-rays and examinations by neurosurgeons at the hospital were negative.

1359-> AROUND THE WORLD; Yemen Lists Needs For Quake Recovery
Yemen, one of the world's poorest countries, needs hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild areas devastated by Monday's earthquake, which left 400,000 people homeless, officials said today. The earthquake, in a densely populated, mountainous region around Dhamar southwest of the capital, killed at least 1,507 people and injured 1,538, according to latest official figures. More bodies were still to be dug from the ruins of 274 villages and hamlets. Rescuers found 49 more survivors Friday but were pessimistic about finding others still alive under the debris.

1360-> FROM TAIWAN, THE SIMPLE AND SUBLIME
ON a recent trip to the Orient, a good friend whose taste in Chinese food I have always trusted dined at the home of Yuan Chen Min Lih in Taipei, Taiwan. He declared that hers was by far the finest home cooking he sampled during his travels. So when I learned that Mrs. Yuan, the mother of two and the wife of Yuan Keng, a film producer, was scheduled to visit New York, I invited her to come into my kitchen to display her taste and technique and to discuss the differences and likenesses of home-style versus professional cooking in her homeland. She arrived, her arms burdened with many of the ingredients that she would employ during the course of the day - presoaked shark's fin for soup; a fresh ham shank that would be cooked to a state of chopstick tenderness (a chopstick rather than a fork was inserted into the shank to determine its exact state of doneness); flank steak to be converted into beef with scallions; fish to be steamed with black beans, and the dish that amused me most - Chinese meat balls with glutinous rice. As she pulled the tender, translucent, stringlike strands from the shark's fins, Mrs. Yuan stated that she had designed a menu that would run the gamut of home-style dishes. It would range from one of the least expensive foods, bean curd, to a long-simmered dish such as the pork shank seasoned with star anise to the shark's fin, which is considered by many Chinese, because of its cost and refined flavor, to be one of the greatest luxuries. ''I was born to a not-very-wealthy middle-class family in Taiwan,'' Mrs. Yuan said in Chinese, while David Keh, the Manhattan restaurateur, interpreted. ''In my childhood I had never dined on shark's fin. It was far too expensive to be thought of as family fare.'' Later she married Yuan Keng, who was born into far less modest circumstances (his uncle was at one time mayor of Keelung, the island's leading port), and it was then that she became acquainted with shark's fin, an almost essential dish for special meals in well-to-do homes. Mrs. Yuan said that she had always enjoyed cooking and had learned from her mother, starting at the age of 8. ''If you travel about my country,'' she said, ''you will find that the food varies from province to province, from city to city and town to town. Thirty miles to us seems like a great distance, and the ingredients that are available to you vary from place to place. ''But home cooking everywhere is simpler, it has fewer ingredients and is more personal. There is a lot less waste than you find in restaurants, where some sauces are prepared days in advance to be used as necessary.'' She added that her family comes together at meal times. Her children are 10 and 22 years old, and the average day begins with a breakfast of congee, a rice porridge, served with several side dishes, including Chinese pickles, salted cucumber and bean curd with soy sauce. The family's midday meal generally consists of two or more stirfried dishes, which may be meat, vegetable or fish plus a soup. When asked about dinner, Mrs. Yuan sighed and smiled. ''Our evening meals,'' she said, ''may range from the entire family to 10 to 20 guests, depending on my husband's gregarious nature.'' The foods that Mrs. Yuan prepared demonstrated remarkable versatility in taste and texture, and only two of them required an uncommon length of time in their preparation: the shark's fin, which had to be soaked overnight before being shredded and added to a rich broth of chicken, and the pork shank, which demanded about four hours of marinating and simmering. The dish that amused me was that eminently edible platter of steamed meatballs with glutinous rice. When I was a child in Mississippi, one of my favorite foods was known as porcupine meatballs (out of curiosity, during Mrs. Yuan's visit, I found the almost-forgotten recipe in Irma Rombauer's ''Joy of Cooking''). The similarities are quite evident, except that chopped water chestnuts and chopped peanuts are used in Mrs. Yuan's version, and the balls are rolled in glutinous rather than regular rice as in the American version. Chinese Meatballs With Glutinous Rice 1/4 pound glutinous rice, about 1/2 cup, available in Chinese markets 3/4 pound fairly lean ground pork 6 water chestnuts, sliced into quarter-inchthick rounds and finely chopped, about 1/2 cup 1/4 cup whole salted or unsalted peanuts, finely chopped 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon salt, if desired 1/2 teaspoon sugar 1 teaspoon cornstarch. 1. Put the rice into a small bowl, and add cold water to cover to a depth of about half an inch above the top of the rice. Set aside. 2. Put the meat into a bowl and add the water chestnuts, peanuts, egg, salt and sugar. Blend well, preferably with a pair of chopsticks. 3. Drain the rice, and put it in a shallow dish. Add the cornstarch and blend well. 4. Divide the meat into about 24 portions of equal size. Shape each portion into a round ball. Roll the balls in the rice, pressing lightly until each ball is coated. Set aside. 5. Arrange the meatballs close together in a utensil that will fit neatly in the top of a metal or other steamer. 6. Bring a quantity of water to a boil in the bottom of the steamer. Set the utensil containing the meatballs on the top of the steamer over the boiling water, and let steam 35 to 45 minutes. Yield: 6 or more servings. Beef With Scallions 3/4 pound well-trimmed flank steak 1 tablespoon light soy sauce 1 tablespoon Shaoxing or dry Sherry wine 3/4 teaspoon sugar 5 tablespoons corn, peanut or vegetable oil 4 large cloves garlic, cut into the thinnest possible lengthwise slices 1/4 cup fresh ginger cut into fine shreds, each about 2 inches in length 1/4 teaspoon salt, if desired 8 scallions, trimmed and cut crosswise into 1 1/2-inch lengths, about 1 cup. 1. Cut the flank steak crosswise in half, and place each half on a flat surface. Holding a knife or cleaver parallel to the center of the meat, cut the steak in half. Stack the halves and cut the meat crosswise into very thin shreds. 2. Put the meat into a mixing bowl. Blend the soy sauce, wine and sugar, and pour the mixture over the meat. Blend with the fingers. 3. Heat half of the oil in a wok or skillet, and when it is very hot, add the beef mixture, garlic, ginger and salt. Cook about 30 seconds over very high heat, stirring constantly. Spoon the mixture into a serving dish. 4. Heat the remaining oil in a wok or skillet, and add the scallions. Cook, stirring rapidly, about 20 seconds. Scatter the scallions over the beef and serve. Yield: 6 or more servings. Pork Shank With Star Anise 1 3-pound shank end of pork with bone and rind included 3/4 cup light soy sauce 3 cups plus 2 tablespoons corn, peanut or vegetable oil 1 ounce, about 20 pieces, rock crystal sugar 2 tablespoons Shaoxing or dry Sherry wine 6 star anise 10 cups water, approximately 1 pound bulk spinach, picked over to remove all tough stems, or 1 10-ounce package spinach in cellophane. 1. Put the pork into a mixing bowl, and pour the soy sauce over it. Turn the meat in the soy sauce and let it stand at least one hour. 2. Heat the 3 cups of oil in a wok or skillet over high heat and add the meat. Set the soy sauce aside. Cook the meat, turning in the oil and spooning the oil over, about 3 or 4 minutes until nicely browned. 3. Transfer the meat to a heat-proof casserole, preferably one made of clay or earthenware. Pour over it the reserved soy sauce, and add the sugar, wine, star anise and 6 cups of the water. Cover tightly and bring to a boil. Cook over moderately high heat about 1 1/2 hours. Turn the pork often as it cooks. Lift the lid of the pot and partly cover. 4. Continue cooking about 30 minutes, and add about 4 more cups of water. Partly cover and continue cooking about 1 1/2 hours. To test for doneness, insert a chopstick inside the meaty part of the shank. If it pierces evenly, the meat is done. Otherwise, continue cooking up to 30 minutes longer or until done. 5. If the spinach is sandy, rinse well and drain. 6. Heat remaining two tablespoons of oil in a wok or skillet and add the spinach. Cook, stirring, about 90 seconds, turning the spinach over and over until totally wilted. 7. Arrange the spinach on a serving dish. Arrange the pork shank on top in the center. Spoon the sauce over. Cut the meat into individual portions and serve. Yield: 12 or more servings. Steamed Fish With Black Beans 4 large black dried Chinese mushrooms 3 ounces lean, boneless pork in one piece 1 large pomfret or butterfish, about 1 1/4 pounds cleaned weight 1 teaspoon salt, if desired 1 tablespoon Shaoxing or dry Sherry wine 2 tablespoons dried salted black beans 2 thick pieces chicken fat taken from the cavity of a chicken 2 scallions, trimmed, cut lengthwise in half 6 very thin slices fresh ginger. 1. Soak the mushrooms in hot water for 30 minutes or longer. 2. Cut the pork into thin slices. Stack the slices and cut the pork into fine shreds. There should be about 1/3 cup tightly packed. Set aside. 3. Scrape the fish all over, but do not remove the skin. Rinse well and pat dry. Use a knife or cleaver, and cut two deep parallel gashes on the diagonal on both sides of the fish. 4. Arrange the fish on a small platter that will fit neatly in the top of a metal or other steamer. Sprinkle the fish with salt and wine. Drain and squeeze the mushrooms dry, and cut them into quarters. Scatter the pieces over the fish. Scatter the pork shreds and black beans over all. Top with the chicken fat. Arrange the scallions and ginger slices over all. 5. Bring a quantity of water to a boil in the bottom of a steamer. Set the fish platter on top of the steamer over the boiling water and let steam 10 minutes. 6. Transfer the fish with its top garnishes to a serving dish. Pour the liquid from the platter over all and serve. Yield: 6 or more servings.

1361-> JERSEY DEMOCRATS GAIN A SEAT IN U.S. HOUSE; AS ALL INCUMBENTS BUT ONE WIN
Democrats gained one seat in New Jersey's 14-member Congressional delegation yesterday as all but one incumbent easily won re-election. The only Representative to lose was Harold C. Hollenbeck, a Republican. A 31-year-old political newcomer, Robert G. Torricelli, turned aside Mr. Hollenbeck's bid for a fourth term in Bergen County's Ninth District. Mr. Torricelli, a campaign manager for former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne and later counsel to Vice President Walter Mondale during Jimmy Carter's Presidency, mounted an intense campaign beginning last February. He concentrated his attack on Mr. Hollenbeck's support of President Reagan's three-year-tax-cut program, his backing of nuclear power plants and his opposition to gun control. Complete but unofficial returns showed Mr. Torricelli winning 54 percent of the vote to 46 percent for Mr. Hollenbeck. 9 of 14 Seats to Democrats The victory gave Democrats nine of the 14 seats in New Jersey's new and disputed Congressional Districts. Currently, they hold an 8-to-6 margin. Most of the incumbents won re-election by wide margins, some of them approaching landslide proportions. For instance, the dean of the delegation, 73-year-old Peter W. Rodino, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, swept to an 18th term by winning nearly 90 percent of the vote in the 10th District in and around his hometown of Newark. Some of the closest races occurred in three districts where the opposing party made concerted efforts to unseat incumbents. But all the incumbents survived. In the new Third District, along the Atlantic Coast of Monmouth County, Republicans had high hopes that Assemblywoman Marie S. Muhler, an energetic 45-year-old G.O.P. campaigner, would unseat James J. Howard, a nine-term Democrat and Chairman of the House Committee on Public Works and Transportation. Two years ago, Mrs. Muhler came within about 2,000 votes of beating Mr. Howard. But with 70 percent of the vote in last night, she was trailing by 62 to 38 percent. Mrs. Muhler appeared to be a victim of the state's Congressional reapportionment plan, which was drawn early this year by the Democratic controlled Legislature. Several predominantly Republican towns were scratched from the district, stripping her of support she enjoyed in the 1980 race. Districting Held a Factor Mr. Hollenbeck, the defeated incumbent in Bergen, also appeared to suffer from the reapportionment. In his first three terms, his district was strongly Republican. His new district, the Ninth, included the traditional Democratic strongholds of Fair Lawn and Teaneck. Registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans in the new Ninth by about 94,000 to 67,000. Soon after the new districts were drawn last January, the state's Republican Representatives accused the Democratic legislators of engaging in blatant gerrymandering. Their challenge that the new districts are an unconstitutional violations of the one-man, one-vote doctrine is now pending in the United States Supreme Court. In two districts in particular, the reapportionment was widely regarded as a Democratic attempt to smooth the way for recapture of them from the Republicans. But those incumbents prevailed. One, Matthew J. Rinaldo, captured a sixth term by defeating Adam K. Levin, the state's Director of Consumer Affairs during the Byrne Administration, in the new Seventh District. Mr. Levin, a 33-year-old lawyer and scion of a wealthy real estate family, reportedly spent about $1 million on his campaign. But Mr. Levin lost by 56 percent to 44 percent. Merlino vs. Smith The other district targeted by the Democrats was the new Fourth in and around Trenton, the state capital. There, a former president of the State Senate, Joseph P. Merlino, was pitted against a 29-yearold freshman Republican Representative, Christopher H. Smith, who in 1980 unseated Frank Thompson, a longtime fixture in the New Jersey Congressional delegation until his conviction in the Abscam scandal. In complete but unofficial returns, Mr. Smith captured 56 percent of the vote to 44 percent for Mr. Merlino. Mr. Merlino was thought to have been financially strapped during the campaign because of a costly campaign in last June's primary. The Rinaldo and Smith margins of victory were the narrowest registered by all the victorious incumbents. For instance, Democrats Frank J. Guarini, of Jersey City, and Joseph G. Minish, of West Orange, won with about 77 and 60 percent of the vote, respectively, in the 14th and 11th Districts. In the Eighth District in and around Paterson, Robert A. Roe, another deeply-entrenced Democrat, won an eighth term with about 70 percent of the vote. Three Republican incumbents jumped to strong early leads and won re-election easily. Six-Termer Wins Again They were incumbent Edwin B. Forsythe, a 66-year-old, six-term member of the House of Representatives from Moorsetown, in the 13th District in Ocean and Burlington Counties; Jim Courter, a 40-year-old lawyer and staunch conservative in the 12th District, and Marge Roukema, 51, of Ridgewood. She scored easily over a young lawyer, Fritz Cammerzell, in the Fifth District. Some well-entrenched Democratic Representatives also scored easy triumphs. Florio Is Victorious In the First District, around Camden and in the Philadelphia suburbs, James J. Florio, a four-term incumbent who lost last year's gubernatorial election by less than 1 percent of the vote, turned aside John A. Dramesi, a retired Air Force colonel, who campaigned with a tattered United States flag he fashioned from rags during six years in a North Vietnamese prison. In the Second District, in the southern part of the state, William J. Hughes, a 50-year-old Democrat, also won a fifth term, defeating John R. Mahoney. He had nearly 70 percent of the total vote with 62 percent of all election district reporting. A freshman Democrat, Bernard J. Dwyer, a 61-year-old former insurance broker of Clifton, also won nearly 70 percent of the vote in defeating Bertram Buckley, of East Brunswick, in the Sixth District. Before the polls closed, James Maloney, the Democratic State Chairman, said Democratic leaders were expecting the party to be victorious in nine contests. Last January, a 10-4 split favoring the Democrats was the conventional political wisdom around the Statehouse in Trenton after thee Democratic-controlled State Legislature reapportionment.

1362-> BOGUS PAMPHLET DISTRIBUTED TO TIMES NEWSDEALERS
Thousands of copies of a pamphlet apparently designed to look like a section of The New York Times were distributed to newsstand dealers last night, and several dealers said they had been asked to insert the pamphlet into the newspaper. The Times said the pamphlet was bogus and confiscated at least 6,000 copies. The pamphlet contained articles attacking Roy M. Cohn, the lawyer, Mayor Koch and Lewis E. Lehrman, the Republican-Conservative candidate for Governor. Leonard R. Harris, director of corporate relations for The Times, said: ''An unknown person or organization is distributing an unauthorized pamphlet to retail newsdealers asking them to insert it as if it were a regular part of The New York Times. ''It has been designed and printed to look like a section of The Times and it is titled, 'Profiles of the Times.' It is an attack on Roy Cohn, Ed Koch and Lew Lehrman, among others. ''Some issues of The Sunday Times may contain such a section. The Times is not associated in any way with this section. The Times will make all information it gathers available to the authorities.'' One newsdealer, on 86th Street and Broadway, said the pamphlets had been delivered by a man in a dark green or black van. The man dropped off 10 or 12 bundles containing between 1,200 and 1,500 pamphlets, and gave instructions that they were from The Times and were to be inserted in the newspaper, the dealer said.. Employees of The Times then began checking newsstands through the city. By early this morning, the pamphlets had been found at newsstands on the East and West Sides of Manhattan. Mr. Cohn, whose name appeared in every article in the pamphlet, called it a ''forgery'' and condemned what he said were ''outrageous and false statements.'' ''It is a total lie from start to finish,'' he said. The pamphlet also included advertisements that had apparently been reproduced from other publications. One advertiser, when contacted, said the advertisement had been used without his knowledge. The pamphlet also contained what purported to be an interview by Barbara Walters with Mr. Cohn. Both Mr. Cohn and Miss Walters denied that such an interview had taken place. Spokesman for the campaigns of both Mr. Lehrman and his Democratic-Liberal opponent, Lieut. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, also said they had no knowledge of the pamphlet.

1363-> OWNERS AND UNION HOLD MEETING
Representatives of the National Football League owners and striking players met face to face last night for the first time in nine days. Management put forth a modified version of its last contract proposal, but the two sides appeared no closer to an agreement than they were before the meeting began. The result was that the strike continued through a 56th day yesterday, leaving little hope that a settlement could be reached in time to save this weekend's games. This latest development occurred during a meeting last night at the St. Regis Hotel, where two Management Council lawyers delivered to union officials a proposal that Ed Garvey, the executive director of the players association, said was a ''reduced offer'' from the one management made before negotiations broke off Nov. 6. ''Sargent Karch offered us something that took away things from the previous offer,'' Garvey said, referring to a lawyer for the Management Council. He cited as examples, a decrease in the money available for older players, reduced bonus money and severance pay and the elimination of incentive bonuses, which the owners had only recently agreed to include in a new collective bargaining agreement. Jim Miller, the council spokesman, said Karch and Dennis Curran were delivering a modification of the owners' previous proposal ''which addressed some of their concerns. And the union had been told that this was our bottom line proposal.'' Part of the ''repackaging'' process, Miller added, was moving money around. The modified proposal included a $20,000 severance payment to players with three years of experience, but to fund those potential payouts, the council eliminated the incentive plan, which rewarded players based on the percentage of plays in which they participated. ''In order to get money for one area, we had to take it from somewhere else,'' Miller said. ''We had told them we would rearrange the proposal, not add to it.'' snag is they are not bargaining enough.'' Late last night, Garvey met at the Loews Summit hotel with the team representatives for most of the league's 28 clubs, some of whom had recently returned to New York in case they would be called upon to consider a proposal that might be a basis for settlement. The presence of the representatives, and the meeting at the St. Regis had created an air of optimism earlier in the day and fueled speculation that a settlement could occur in time to save this weekend's games. In previous weeks during the strike the league has decided on Tuesday whether the following weekend's games would be played. The meeting between Garvey and the Management Council lawyers had been arranged by Paul Martha, a former player who later served as an N.F.L. grievance arbitrator and who is now vice president and general counsel for the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team. He has been serving as an intermediary in the dispute since Saturday, when his help was sought by Garvey. Jack Donlan, the executive director of the Management Council, did not attend the meeting at the St. Regis. But earlier in the day he told the union, through Martha, that the owners might soon withdraw the bonus money offer of $60 million for 1982, if the union did not indicate a willingness to negotiate a settlement based on management's latest offer. Management says the offer is worth $1.313 billion over four years, starting in 1983. Only such a willingness, Donlan said, can bring about an end to the player strike and the resumption of games by the weekend. ''When we made that offer, it was based on them playing at least a 12-game season,'' Donlan said of the bonus money. ''Now we're way past that point, and it would not be economically prudent for us to keep that money out there. I am sure the executive committee will recommend that we take it back.'' Meanwhile, other points of contention arose yesterday. Garvey labeled as ''a management plant'' a report that the union's executive committee had voted, 4 to 3, Sunday night to accept the management offer ''in principle,'' despite the fact that a union source yesterday confirmed the results of such a vote. Garvey also said that management had known ''early'' a decision made public yesterday by the National Labor Relations Board: It turned down a request by William Lubbers, the board's general counsel, for authority to seek in Federal District Court in New York a preliminary injunction that would have forced the Management Council to change its bargaining position. That decision left the union only one chance to prove its contention that the league has not been bargaining in good faith. A hearing before Ben Schlesinger, an administrative law judge, has been scheduled for Nov. 29. ''Once management knew about the decision,'' Gene Upshaw, the union president said, ''their offer was reduced accordingly.'' Donlan said that management's bargaining position has, essentially, not changed since Nov. 6. It was then, after eight days of talks at the Loews Summit, that Sam Kagel, the private mediator, recessed the talks, citing significant differences that still exist between the sides. Although Kagel has been in frequent contact with Garvey and Donlan during the recess, league sources said yesterday that his return to the dispute is doubtful. That point was apparently underscored last weekend by Garvey, as well, when he contacted Kay McMurray, the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service in Washington, and later, Martha. ''He keeps reaching out,'' Donlan said of Garvey. ''At some point he is going to have to come back to us, and we have told him, if he has something for us to consider, he better type it up and initial it.'' negotiations is needed. In a meeting Sunday night at Clifton, N.J., the players voted by 37-1 to reject the N.F.L. Management Council's proposal as it stands, and 23-15 to reject the basic package with minor changes. They were split 19-19 when asked whether they would prefer to negotiate down from the N.F.L. Players Association position or up from management's offer. The tallies were supplied by Beasley Reece, the player representative, today and confirmed by other players who attended the meeting. The Jets have met to discuss the proposal but have not voted on it because Marvin Powell, the player representative, said he had polled the players by phone. ''I think there should be a compromise made because you have a position where certain players are better off financially than others and better able to go on with this than younger players with families and homes they need to contribute to,'' Brad Benson, a fourth-year Giants tackle, said today. ''Basically, we want them to do more negotiating,'' said Bill Currier, a sixth-year safety. ''We're willing to give in, but we're not willing to accept what they've offered.''

1364-> McRae To Remain A Royal
Hal McRae, the designated hitter who led the major leagues in runs batted in last season, agreed today to a three-year contract that will keep him with the Kansas City Royals. Terms of the contract were not announced, but McRae had reportedly been seeking a three-year pact worth $2 million. John Schuerholz, the Royals' general manager, and McRae's agent, Tony Pace, reached the agreement late this afternoon after telephone negotiations, said Will Rudd, a spokesman for the American League club. McRae, 36 years old, was at his home in Bradenton, Fla., and could not be reached for comment. In 1982, he drove in 133 runs, hit 27 homers and compiled a .308 batting average. ---- A's to Sign Burgmeier The Oakland A's will announce today that they have signed Tom Burgmeier, one of the left-handed pitchers in last week's free-agent draft, sources close to the negotiations said last night. Burgmeier, a 39-year-old reliever, who had a 7-0 record with Boston this year, was selected by 10 teams in the draft. A 15-year major leaguer, he spent the last five seasons with the Red Sox, with whom he signed in 1978 in his first try at free agency.

1365-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY; T, as in Torn, Shirt
Torn T-shirts - the artfully deliberate kind - have been around for a while, especially among devotees of punk, who like to rend their garments in provocative spots. Now they turned upwardly mobile from street peddlers and novelty merchandising. Saks Fifth Avenue is about to offer, in the oxymoronic vein of designer jeans, designertorn T-shirts. The designer-tearer is Chico Ross, brother of the singer, Diana Ross. The prices are $47 to $57, apparently depending on the number of holes.

1366-> SCOUTING; Grooms Lose Plea
Does a horse's groom qualify as a ''sports participant,'' under the law? Four defendants in a Federal Court trial in Uniondale, L.I., argued no. In fact, on the strength of that argument, they asked the court to kill an indictment that charged them with conspiracy to fix six races at Yonkers and Roosevelt Raceways in 1978. They were accused of trying to inject certain horses with tranquilizers. They also were accused of trying to bribe horse grooms as part of the plan. But the four defendants argued that the law against bribing ''sports participants'' could not apply because grooms do not participate in horse races. They said that a groom was no more associated with a horse race ''than a hairdresser at the ballet, the cleaner of football teams' uniforms or the supplier of basketballs.'' The issue was far from academic. If convicted, the defendants could face maximum prison terms of 20 years. The question was put to Judge Jacob Mishler, who reviewed the history of the state law on sports bribery. It was passed in 1921, and defined a ''sports participant'' as ''a player, contestant or member of a team, or a coach, manager, trainer or other person directly associated with a player, etc.'' The law was amended in 1941 to add various racing types like ''jockey, driver, groom or any other person participating in any horse race.'' But when the Legislature rewrote the law in 1965, it omitted the reference to ''groom.'' But, Judge Mishler said in a ruling filed yesterday, the Legislature did not intend to eliminate anything but excess words when it rewrote the law. And, he added: ''As one who feeds, washes and exercises horses, the groom is an essential part of a horse racing contest.'' He denied the motion, and set trial for the week of Dec. 13.

1367-> Richard Ashley, Ex-President Of Allied Chemical Company
Richard C. Ashley, who resigned a week ago yesterday as president of the Allied Chemical Company and as a group vice president of its parent concern, the Allied Corporation, was killed Sunday in a car crash in Pulaski County, Va. He was 55 years old and had lived in Darien, Conn., for many years. Mr. Ashley was scheduled to become chairman and chief executive officer of Economics Laboratory Inc., a White Plains manufacturer of chemical products for cleaning and sanitation. Mr. Ashley had been with Allied since 1951 and was named president in 1979, when the parent concern was restructured into three operating companies. Mr. Ashley is survived by a son, Richard C. Ashley Jr. of San Francisco; three daughters, Rachael Vose of Charlottesville, Va.; Robin, of Southport, N.Y., and Randall, of Darien, and three sisters, Joan, of Providence, R.I., Barbara, of San Antonio, Tex., and Anne Files of Greenville, N.C.

1368-> SPORTS PEOPLE; The Pinch of a Strike
The 57-day strike of the National Football League Players Association had bitter financial consequences for many people, but Harvey Martin of the Dallas Cowboys appears to be one of the hardest hit. The defensive end has filed for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. Martin contended that the strike was a large factor in the action. ''When it came down, it just became too much for me,'' he said. Martin's petition lists six major creditors to whom he owes more than $211,500. A list of Martin's assets totaled from $245,000 to $270,000, according to Harold C. Abramson, his attorney, who said the player sought protection partly because of potential lawsuits that are distracting him from football.

1369-> News Summary; FRIDAY, DECEMBER 3, 1982
International Ways to avert an accidental war proposed by President Reagan and made public in his Nov. 22 speech have evoked interest on the part of the Soviet leadership, according to Administration officials. They said the Kremlin had sent Mr. Reagan a message asking where the United States wanted to discuss the proposals in detail and were told that the Administration wished to pursue the subject at the arms control talks in Geneva. (Page A1, Column 4.) American aid for Lebanon's Army over the next year has been pledged by the Reagan Administration. United States officials said that American forces would train and help rebuild the Lebanese Army so that it could eventually maintain the country's internal security. (A12:3-4.) The President decried protectionism in a speech to United States and Brazilian business leaders in Sao Paulo. In his second and final full day in Brazil, Mr. Reagan warned that the global trend toward trade barriers would lead to ''economic contraction and eventually dangerous instability'' in the Western Hemisphere and the developing world. (A1:1.) A papal ultimatum to Nicaragua was delivered to the coordinator of the junta in Managua. Church officials there said that Pope John Paul II had demanded that Roman Catholic priests resign from the positions they hold in the Sandinist Government as a condition for his visiting Nicaragua early next year.

The members of the commission, which will also seek to guarantee ''physical security'' for Salvadorans, are the director of the national police, a Roman Catholic priest, a young peasant leader, an engineer and three lawyers. (A9:1.) National The MX missile program survived a key vote in the House Appropriations Committee by a 26 to 26 tie. At the same time, the panel voted to withhold funds for producing and deploying the experimental intercontinental missile until March 15 to give Congress time to consider President Reagan's newly proposed closely spaced basing system. (A1:6.) A permanent artificial heart to replace a dying human heart was implanted by surgeons for the first time. The operation, which lasted seven and a half hours, was performed in Salt Lake City by a team headed by Dr. William C. DeVries. The patient, Dr. Barney B.

Rare bipartisan cooperation was evident as the House Ways and Means Committee formally adopted legislation to increase the Federal tax on gasoline by 5 cents a gallon, effective April 1. The tax increase would provide $5.5 billion a year to finance President Reagan's proposed five-year, $32.9 billion highway rehabilitation program. (A1:5.) A national nuclear waste policy would be established for the first time under legislation approved by the House.

1370-> Producer Of Tylenol Is Cleared
The Food and Drug Administration today officially cleared the subsidiary of the Johnson & Johnson Company that makes Tylenol of any responsibility for the contamination of pain-relief capsules that killed seven residents of the Chicago area. A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, parent of the McNeil Consumer Products Company, said the company had received a letter from the F.D.A. confirming that the cyanide contamination had not occurred at the company's plants in Fort Washington, Pa., or Round Rock, Tex. Joseph P. Hile, associate commissioner for regulatory affairs at the F.D.A., said in the letter, ''We conclude that the contamination did not occur at either plant and was the result of tampering after the capsules had been shipped to distribution points, and most likely after they reached the retail shelves.'' A criminal investigation into the killings, which occurred three weeks ago, has been based on the theory that the capsules were poisoned after they reached retail stores. News of the poisonings had depressed Johnson & Johnson stock. Today it fell 62 1/2 cents, to $43.625, $2.50 above its level in early October. In New Brunswick, N.J., the headquarters of Johnson & Johnson, a spokesman said the company would begin 60-second television messages Sunday evening with their medical director discussing the Tylenol contamination. Dr. Thomas N. Gates, medical director for McNeil, will appear in spots on the three major networks telling the public, ''We want you to continue to trust Tylenol.'' Dr. Gates says in the message that the company urges consumers to use Tylenol in tablet form until it ''reintroduces capsules in tamper-resistant containers.'' Manufacture of the capsules was halted earlier this month. Lawrence G. Foster, vice president of public relations, said no final decision had been made on the new packaging.

1371-> 9-Digit ZIP Is Delayed
The board of governors of the United States Postal Service postponed action today on a nine-digit ZIP code because of a highly critical unpublished report on the innovation by the General Accounting Office. The report by the Congressional investigative agency, due to be made public next month, says that the Postal Service is proceeding with nine digits from the current five-digit system with inadequate planning and with excessive hopes for a financial payoff. Moreover, the report says, the Postal Service has tested only models of the processing equipment to be used, and not the production gear.

1374-> FOR CUOMO, A TIME TO FIDGET
Mario M. Cuomo, who does not have to run for governor anymore but soon must become the Governor, was standing in a hallway near the wood-paneled State Senate chamber the other day. The television lights were glaring in his eyes and the reporters were blaring questions at him. Why was there a deadlock between Republicans and Democrats? Would the subway fare go up? Would he support taxes to close the state defecit? The Governor-elect spoke: ''As I have said a hundred times in this campaign...'' He went on to stress his theme of moderation and reasonableness. Only after several sentences, and the murmuring of onlookers, did Mr. Cuomo amend his remarks. ''As I have said during the campaign and since,'' he said. Transition, it seems, is not an easy thing. But here in Albany these days, it is often the only thing - a dominant subject of conversation, a prime matter of concern. There are jobs to be filled and to be emptied. When Mr. Carey was elected Governor, he took over after 16 years of Republican rule. The way it is remembered these days, most everyone simply packed up and left. But this time, the transition is from Democrat to Democrat, and many of the 2,400 state officials who serve at the pleasure of the Governor harbor hope that they will be asked to stay on. There is general agreement that this is much harder on the nerves than knowing, for sure, that you are out the door. Some officials have been asked to stay. For example, when Michael Finnerty attends meetings these days, he is there as the secretary to the outgoing Governor. But he is also the budget director for the incoming Governor. ''It hasn't been a problem,'' Mr Finnerty said. His first duty, he added, is to Mr. Carey until Jan. 1. But in any case, Mr. Finnerty said, the Governor and the Governor-elect ''have happened to be on the same side of the issues, thank heavens.'' There is an activity in Albany called a ''leaders' meeting,'' which brings the Governor and the leaders of the State Senate and Assembly together. One thing has been noticed by people at these meetings in the last couple of weeks. No one calls the Governor anything but ''Governor.'' Hugh would simply be out of place. But no one calls Mario M. Cuomo, who has been attending the meetings, anything but ''Mario.'' Governor, it seems, would be out of place. At least so far. Bringing good people into government is the challenge of any newly elected official. There is one person Mr. Cuomo thinks highly of, but has been reluctant to appoint. This is his 25-year-old son, Andrew. For months, Mr. Cuomo has said he would prefer it if Andrew, who played a key role in Mr. Cuomo's victory, took the bar examination and went off to practice law. Now, however, Andrew says it is likely that he will be coming to Albany. ''If I can do it without causing any embarrasement, I will,'' he said. The ''hook,'' as Andrew puts it, may be to take a state job but to accept only a portion of the salary. Negotiations, Andrew says, are continuing. ''This is a father-son thing,'' he adds. Mr. Cuomo's major concession, so far, was his announcement that he would like to hang on to the apartment he has kept while Lieutenant Governor. It is in the Wellington Hotel, down the hill from the Capitol. Why will he need an apartment when he has the executive mansion? Maybe, he says, it will be for Andrew. ''So I can keep an eye on him,'' Mr. Cuomo said. While most of the limelight has been focused on the executive chamber, there has been a significant transition in the State Assembly. The Democrats won a considerable electoral victory in Assembly races, taking 98 of 150 seats, although one Democrat, Gail S. Shaffer, will not take her seat because she was named Secretary of State. This is the largest number of Democrats in the Assembly since 1913, when Alfred E. Smith presided as Speaker over 104 Democrats. However, this is not an unmixed blessing. Having such a large majority is creating internal problems for the Democratic leadership. Because there are so few Republicans, and many of them are new, several freshman Republican Assembly members are going to be designated as ranking minority members on legislative committees. This is not just an honor. The post carries at least a $6,500 increase in pay, known in Albany parlance as a ''lulu.'' As a result, Democrats with six or seven years in the Assembly will get nothing, while newer counterparts across the aisle collect their lulus. This led Assembly member Daniel B. Walsh, the majority leader, to say of the 98 seats under Democratic control: ''Eighty-six would have been a better number.'' Mr. Cuomo has told reporters, editors and broadcasters across the state that he could not have been elected without them. Mr. Cuomo noted that he was outspent by his opponents in both the primary and the general election. ''Were it not for a strong, vigorous free press in the state, my campaign would have stood no chance of success,'' he said. He assured the journalists, however, that while they helped to elect him, ''that will not make you responsible for any errors committed by the next administration.'' The thank you came in a form letter mailed on Mr. Cuomo's Lieutenant Governor's stationary to 100 journalists. Mr. Cuomo's Republican gubenatorial opponent, Lewis E. Lehrman, sent out handwritten thank you notes to about 40 reporters and editors, according to his spokesman. One of these notes from Mr. Lehrman said: ''Would that we could have spent more time together. There was a certain joy in your demeanor that I found refreshing. You held Mario and me to a very high standard. Above all was your fairness.'' Various present and former state officials paid $50 apiece to attend a ''salute'' to Governor Carey here on Wednesday. They were entitled to know something about his future plans, Mr. Carey told the assembled admirers. ''Teddy's out of the way,'' Mr. Carey declared. The crowd burst into applause at what they presumed was a reference to the decision by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, not to seek the Presidency in 1984. ''You always mistake my meaning,'' Mr. Carey chided. I meant Theodore Roosevelt.'' The crowd groaned.

1375-> Nation Had Good Water Year, U.S. Geological Survey Finds
The United States completed a ''generally good'' water year on a wet note last month, the United States Geological Survey has reported. The flow of the nation's five largest rivers averaged 617 billion gallons a day in September, 33 percent above normal for the month, the survey said Monday. And for the water year that ended Sept. 30, the five averaged 12 percent above normal, a welcome contrast to 1981, the driest year in five years.

1376-> EUROPEANS AGREE TO FURTHER TALKS ON FARM SUBSIDIES
The United States and the European Common Market agreed today on steps to defuse a crisis over agricultural exports that has threatened to undermine the Atlantic alliance. After the unusual high-level meeting, both sides sought to give the impression that although differences remained, they could be settled in follow-up meetings set for early next year. A five-man United States Cabinet delegation led by Secretary of State George P. Shultz conferred with five senior officials of the Common Market led by Gaston Thorn, president of the European Commission, which is the executive section of the European Economic Community. Progress at Monetary Meetings Progress was also reported at separate monetary meetings held Thursday and today in Paris and in Kronberg, West Germany. The major industrial nations agreed to make available to poorer nations more than $36 billion to help the recipients repay the tens of billions of dollars in debt that they have accumulated. (Page 42.) Secretary of Agriculture John R. Block, the most outspoken of the American officials in criticizing the Europeans, summed up the farm talks here at a joint news conference by saying, ''First of all, there will not be an agricultural trade war.'' American officials had threatened to ''dump'' surplus products on the world market, touching off a trade war, if the European Economic Community continued a policy under which its 10 members subsidize farm exports. Mr. Thorn, of Luxembourg, said the talks here were held in ''an economic and political situation that is very delicate, the most difficult since the war.'' He said the Americans and Europeans ''did not talk about the past but got on with the problems for the future, and tried to define strategies to see where we could cooperate.'' ''Actions speak louder than words,'' he said, speaking in French. The United States argues that the farm export subsidies give Common Market countries an unfair price advantage over American exporters. The dispute became acute last month at the conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, when Washington expressed dissatisfaction at the lack of progress on the issue. Stress on Continuing Talks Mr. Block said today that agreement had been reached here on ''concrete action.'' The most important, he said, was that ''we sit down and in specific terms review what can be done to resolve our trade frictions.'' Meetings will be held next month and in March, he said, stressing that there was some urgency attached to them. Secretary Shultz, who has been trying to ease problems within the alliance since he took office five months ago, seemed pleased by the apparent ability of the allies to agree to surmount a longstanding problem that, he said, had begun to be seen as potentially explosive. Today, the NATO nations also ended their winter meeting on a harmonious note, and there was a strong desire by Mr. Shultz to gain similar results in the economic sphere. The United States and the Common Market together account for onethird of world trade, Mr. Thorn said, and it is therefore crucial for them to resolve their disputes. Whether or not the meetings in January and March will produce a lasting solution was uncertain. The Common Market has emphasized domestic subsidies for its farmers, and the Reagan Administration has tried - often against opposition in Congress - to reduce price supports because they are costly and create large surpluses that depress world prices. Block Keeps Options Open Secretary Block, who did most of the talking at the news conference for the American side, said that although he believed there would not be a trade war, he refused to rule out future retaliation. But he said he had made no commitment not to dump surplus goods if an accord cannot be reached. Dumping, in trade terms, means selling goods abroad for less than they cost to produce. Nevertheless, the thrust of Mr. Block's comments seemed to suggest that the Administration did not expect to take such retaliatory action in coming months. There had been speculation in Washington that there would be some sort of action by the end of this month if the meeting today did not prove satisfactory. Mr. Thorn said that during the talks, which were continued after the news conference during a working dinner, the two sides also discussed East-West trade relations and the economic and financial systems ''as seen from both sides of the Atlantic.'' NATO Talks on East-West Trade East-West trade was also a subject at the NATO meeting. Essentially, the United States and its key allies agreed to complete studies on alternatives within Europe to supplies of Soviet natural gas, and on tightening the supply of credit and technology to Moscow. The studies are to be completed by June, when the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization hold their spring meeting in Paris. Earlier, it had been thought that the studies would be made known at the economic summit meeting in May in Williamsburg, Va., but as a gesture to France, Washington agreed that the studies would be presented at the Paris meeting. Several Europeans had expressed concern here that the United States was seeking to dismantle their agricultural policy. But both Mr. Block and Mr. Thorn denied this. Mr. Block said, ''Our quarrel is with the spillover in the world market which causes us problems'' - and not with the policy itself. Mr. Thorn said the Americans had said they were not declaring war on the Common Market policy but wanted to solve specific problems on specific commodities and prices. Earlier, American officials had told reporters that they hoped to ''lower the rhetoric'' in the dispute. This appeared to be an easy task, in part because the participants were senior Cabinet-level officers and professional leaders of the Common Market, not representatives of specific countries, such as France, that have been at odds with the United States.

1377-> RECITAL: SANTIAGO RODRIGUEZ AT THE PIANO
It seemed at times as if there were two different pianists playing during Santiago Rodriguez's piano recital in Alice Tully Hall Tuesday night. The first played like a competition winner, having won the silver medal in the sixth Van Cliburn Competition. He displayed great fluency, perfect technical control, an elegance of manner, and not very much original to say. Bach's Second Partita, for example, was flaccid and routine. Even the New York premiere of Ginastera's Sonata No. 2 was, in its framing movements, little more than percussive patter, with the composer's sometimes imaginative cross rhythms and echoes of Argentine folk music lacking coloration and intensity. But in two Brahms Intermezzi, in the three Rachmaninoff Etudes and in the lilting, poised ''Spanish Dance No. 2'' by Granados, there was an entirely different pianist at work - a subtle and careful musician with a broad tonal palette, one who approached these more introspective works with both nobility and insight. This pianist undoubtedly could be a major artist, if there were some way to resolve the musical contradictions he shares with his less sensitive alter ego. Edward Rothstein

1378-> DICK MERRILL, PILOT, IS DEAD AT 88; HELD SEVERAL RECORDS IN AVIATION
Henry Tindall (Dick) Merrill, a pioneer aviator who in 1936 made the first trans-Atlantic round-trip flight in an airplane, died Sunday at his summer home in Lake Elsinore, Calif. He was 88 years old. Mr. Merrill set several commercial flying records, including the first commercial trans-Atlantic flight in a plane in 1937. The trip attracted added attention because he returned with photographs of the coronation of King George VI and set a record for the fastest picture delivery by a photo syndicate in newspaper history. Mr. Merrill was a pilot for Eastern Airlines for 33 years, most often assigned to the New York to Miami trip. Many passengers, attracted by his safety record as well as his reputation for skill and luck, refused to fly with any other pilot and canceled their travel plans when he was temporarily reassigned. Flew Special Missions In the 1930's and 40's, Mr. Merrill was frequently detached from his regular route for special missions. In 1935, for instance, he flew 8,200 miles from Kansas City to the southern tip of Chile to help in the successful search for Lincoln Ellsworth and Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, the explorers, who were then missing in Antarctica. Jim Ashlock, a spokesman for the Miami-based carrier who was a friend of Mr. Merrill, recalled that after one such mission the pilot approached Capt. Edward V. Rickenbacker, general manager of Eastern, and said, ''You know, there are better pilots flying for this airline.'' ''That may be true,'' Captain Rickenbacker replied, ''but none as lucky.'' Mr. Merrill's record for flying without injuring himself or a passenger ended in 1936 after two million miles when his Newark-bound plane crashed in a storm into a wooded hilltop eight miles northwest of Port Jervis. Although his jaw and ankle were broken, only three of the 10 other people on board were injured, none seriously. Five Years in the Sky Mr. Merrill, who refused several offers of a desk job with Eastern, retired in 1961 at the age of 67. He officially logged more than eight million miles and 41,709 hours of flying, the equivalent of nearly five years in the sky, in his 41 years as a pilot, which spanned the history of modern aviation. After learning to fly in the early 1920's, Mr. Merrill, who was born in Iuka, Miss., spent about seven years barnstorming in the South and Southwest. On May 1, 1928, he joined Pitcairn Aviation Inc., Eastern's predecessor, as a airmail clerk. Mr. Merrill received several awards for his flying exploits. He won the Harmon trophy, awarded annually for promoting general aviation, for the first commercial trans-Atlantic flight, and the International Federation of Aeronautics School Gold Medal for logging more flying time than any other pilot. Married to Toby Wing Mr. Merrill captured the public's imagination when he was photographed in the cockpit of his plane with one of his pet squirrels sitting on his flying helmet. He liked to tell the story about running into a storm on a flight from Richmond to Newark. The turbulence caused the plane to pitch and roll and Alcibiades, one of his favorite squirrels, was tossed about. ''You will pardon me, squirrel,'' said Mr. Merrill, who was unable to catch the animal, ''but at a time like this it's every man for himself.'' The plane landed safely and Alcibiades, the aviator said, was uninjured. Although he eschewed alcohol and tobacco, he was a frequent patron of nightclubs and racetracks and a friend of movie stars and celebrities. His co-pilot on the 1936 trans-Atlantic flight was Harry Richman, the Broadway entertainer. In 1966, he and Arthur Godfrey, the entertainer, flew a corporate jet around the world, setting 21 world speed records. In 1937 Mr. Merrill was secretly married in Mexico to Toby Wing, the actress and Mack Sennett bathing beauty. Three years later their infant son, Henry, was smothered to death in his crib in 1940. Mr. Merrill's only other child, Richard Wing Merrill, died earlier this year in Miami. Mr. Merrill was widely known as ''Dick'' after the fictitious ''Dick Meriwell,'' whose fame as a fictional hero was widespread in the 1910's and '20s. He was given the nickname by teammates on a New Orleans semiprofessional baseball team for which he pitched both right- and left-handed. Mr. Merrill is survived by his wife and two granddaughters, Anna Wing Merrill and Simone Wing Merrill, both of Lake Elsinore.

1379-> DOW RISES BY 16.38, TO 1,022.08
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.38 points yesterday, to 1,022.08, as trading volume soared above 100 million shares. Wall Street analysts said this buoyant performance reflected investor expectations that yesterday's election results would not materially change the economy's direction toward lower inflation and interest rates. Among the blue chips, Procter & Gamble jumped 4 7/8 points, to 113 1/8, after reporting higher quarterly earnings than some followers had expected. Volume expanded to 104.8 million shares from 73.5 million on Monday, when the industrial average ran ahead nearly 14 points. At its highest level yesterday, the Dow was ahead 26 1/2 points, shortly before the Commerce Department reported a 23 percent increase in new-home sales for September. As a result, savings-andloan and other housing-related issues moved ahead. Meanwhile, there were signs that individual investors returned to the market in large numbers. Many institutions enjoyed a holiday, since banks were closed and there was no trading in Treasury securities. ''The goals of both political parties are moving closer together, since their common desire is to dampen both inflation and interest rates,'' said Martin D. Sass, who heads a firm managing $700 million for institutional accounts. ''Also, the realization is growing that the economy is now on a path that has a decent probability of sustaining a moderate recovery.'' Newton D. Zinder of E.F. Hutton & Company played down the significance of yesterday's election outcome. ''Elections, particularly midterm ones, rarely have more than a transitory impact and the market soon resumes doing what it was going to do even without the election,'' he said. ''Other factors - such as interest rates - affect the market much more than whether one party gains or loses a few Congressional seats.'' The Interest Rate Front On the interest rate front, the consensus in Wall Street is that the Federal Reserve will soon cut the discount rate, now at 9 1/2 percent, in what would be construed as a confirming signal of monetary policy that is designed to revive the economy. The discount rate is the charge made by the Fed on loans to financial institutions. Utility stocks, which often serve as a leading indicator for the general market, showed gains. These issues are sensitive to interest rate developments. In the forefront of the advance were defense, semiconductor, brokerage, bank, and other blue-chip issues. Grumman rose 2 1/2, to 46 1/4, after announcing higher profits and predicting improved year-end results. Also gaining more than 2 points each were Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and Litton Industries. Johnson Controls climbed 2 1/4, to 32 3/4. It rose 1 1/4 on Monday after an investor group announced it had acquired 15.1 percent of the stock. The Manville Corporation moved up 1 7/8, to 9. The company, now operating under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, recently reported higher quarterly earnings. Elsewhere, Loews Corporation jumped 7 1/2 points, to 147, while Raychem rose 4 1/4, to 68 1/4. ''Retail customers are accounting for a greater share of the volume than was the case when the market rally began in mid-August,'' said Laszlo Birinyi Jr. of Salomon Brothers. Underscoring this increased participation by individual investors, the American Stock Exchange reported that volume climbed to 11.8 million shares - its largest turnover this year - from Monday's 8.1 million. Meanwhile, the Amex market value index rose 6.89, to 328.62. Gross Telecasting rose 4 3/4, to 31 5/8. The company received license renewals for its television and radio stations from the Federal Communications Commission. Volume in the over-the-counter market swelled to 56.9 million shares, the third-highest daily turnover in Nasdaq history. The Nasdaq composite index gained 3.13, to 217.65.

1380-> THE STRUGGLE TO SPEND BILLIONS ON SYNTHETIC FUELS
Question: What creature of Government has been handed $15 billion or so to parcel out to its constituents but has yet to find a single one worthy of its largesse? Hint: It is neither the Department of Defense nor the Department of Education. The answer is a singular phenomenon called the United States Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a two-year-old body distinguished both by its extraordinarily deep pockets and its inability to spend money in the way Washington has become accustomed. But Darwin's first rule of bureaucracy, spend it or lose it, is now being invoked. The fuels corporation is at last on the verge of writing its first check in behalf of America's energy security. ''I don't believe in spending anything unless you get value for it,'' said Victor A. Schroeder, the Atlanta real estate developer who receives $135,000 a year as president of the corporation. ''My guess,'' he added, ''is we will have more than two recommendations'' for project assistance to be presented at the corporation's Dec. 2 board meeting. Ever since the corporation was established in 1980 to act as a catalyst in developing a commercial synthetic fuels industry, it has been a Government stepchild that has fallen victim to falling world oil prices and a diverse group of political opponents. Recruitment Problems President Reagan came to office with little enthusiasm for the corporation and promptly discharged the chairman and other board members appointed by President Carter. Eventually, he picked his own seven men, but the chairman, Edward E. Noble, and Mr. Schroeder made no effort to disguise their skepticism about the Federal role as a promoter of synthetic fuels. There have also been recruitment problems for senior staff posts, persistent sniping in Congress about high salaries and perquisites, complaints by the General Accounting Office about administrative procedures and widespread opposition to synthetic fuels by environmentalists. Nobody was surprised when, at a time of soaring budget deficits, legislation was introduced to abolish the corporation and use its money for housing. Meanwhile, dozens of project sponsors lost interest in synthetic fuels as the oil market moved into surplus and prices declined to the point where their multibillion-dollar ventures would not be economical even with aid from the corporation in the form of loan or price guarantees. With all these handicaps, plus continued inflation and changes in this year's tax law, it is perhaps not surprising that the corporation has not found any projects qualifying for aid. 'They've Had Chances' Some, however, think it hasn't tried hard enough. ''They've had chances,'' said William Rankin, editor of The Synfuels Report, a newsletter. ''They've complained that projects are not mature, but if they would have awarded some pre-construction money or gotten some smaller projects on line, industry interest would have perked up.'' Sponsors would have seen that the corporation ''was serious'' had it thrown out a little bait, Mr. Rankin said. Actually, Mr. Noble and Mr. Schroeder have now largely overcome their initial reservations, based mainly on a preference for the workings of the marketplace, and have embraced the main national security-based argument for an American capacity to produce synthetic fuels. They also seem to have become persuaded that a demonstrated capability in synthetic fuels could act as a price restraint on OPEC producers. Prodded now by some impatient directors and the knowledge that covetous eyes are being cast on its unused checkbook, the synthetic fuels corporation has sought to become as visible to its friends as it has long been to opponents. Mr. Schroeder, for example, left the other day for West Germany and Japan to try to revive foreign interest in American projects and Mr. Noble will join him in Japan this week. Some Proponents Encouraged More talk is heard of the possibility that the corporation may lend money to projects directly; so far its plans have dealt mainly with guarantees of private capital. And it is even possible that the corporation may decide it must build and operate its own plants. James R. Bowden, the corporation's executive vice president, said that it must consider Government companies, known as ''go-co's,'' ''very shortly.'' All this encourages some proponents of synthetic fuels, such as Elihu Bergman, head of Americans for Energy Independence, a political interest group. ''It's good to see these guys pulling their heads out of the sand,'' Mr. Bergman said, because otherwise ''Congress is going to zap them.'' Corporation officials accept some blame for the slow start. Mr. Bowden, for example, said, ''We have not communicated very well.'' But it may be that falling oil prices have been an almost insurmountable obstacle. ''It's really not so much their fault as the market environment that has kept the private sector somewhat at bay,'' said Mitchell F. Keamy Jr., chief executive of the Hampshire Energy Project. The project, a venture to produce gasoline from Wyoming coal, had been expected to be one of the first beneficiaries of the synthetic fuels corporation, but suffered a major setback last month when the Standard Oil Company (Ohio) withdrew its support from the consortium. Seeking Comfort in History Meanwhile, Mr. Schroeder has been seeking comfort in history. He asserts that the lessons of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and the purchase of Alaska in 1867 were examples of how visionary leaders acted in the face of opposition and ridicule. When asked what the American taxpayer has gotten in return for the $18.2 million the corporation has spent so far on administration, an amount that nearly matches that spent on the Louisiana and Alaska purchases together, Mr. Schroeder replied: ''One heck of a lot of information and education and understanding of what it's going to require to do what we need to do. We have a foundation built for this industry now.'' But time is growing short. ''With the industry on its back, the corporation is without any kind of program that is believable,'' said Michael S. Koleda, president of the National Council on Synthetic Fuels Production, a trade group. And, noting that the Administration was now drafting the Federal budget for next year, Mr. Koleda said, ''The boys in the White House are sharpening their knives.''

1382-> COMPANY NEWS; WHITTAKER BUYS 8.3% OF SMITH INC.
The Whittaker Corporation, stymied for now in its goal to buy a major health care company, said today that it had acquired 8.3 percent of Smith International Inc., a large oilfield services company, in a series of recent stock purchases valued at $49 million. Joseph F. Alibrandi, president and chief executive, added that Whittaker planned to buy more Smith International shares on the open market, but would not exceed a 23 percent stake in the company's voting securities. Whittaker's interest is for ''investment purposes only,'' the company said. Smith International is the leading domestic supplier of drill bits for petroleum and mining companies. That and other oilfield service businesses operated by Smith have been hurt this year by falling prices attributed to the world oil glut. Its shares, which closed at $23.75, up 50 cents, in trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, are down from a 52-week high of $48.875. In a report filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Whittaker said it accumulated 1,873,300 shares from Oct. 25 through Dec. 7 at prices from $20 to $31.25. The average cost was $26.16 a share. Whittaker considers the oilfield services industry ''undervalued,'' and Smith International ''the standard of quality in the industry,'' Mr. Alibrandi said.

1383-> ATTORNEY GENERAL AIDE INDICTED
An assistant state attorney general was indicted yesterday on a charge of promoting prostitution by operating a midtown theater in which women performed sexual acts with customers. The official - Frederick P. Cincotti, 47 years old, of Manhattan - pleaded not guilty and was released on $10,000 bail after his arraignment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. According to Attorney General Robert Abrams's office, Mr. Cincotti had been employed there for 18 1/2 years but was discharged after his arrest Thursday night. He was one of nine lawyers assigned to Mr. Abrams's labor bureau and handled workmen's compensation and other labor-law cases in Bronx, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam and Greene Counties. His annual salary was $40,767. An Owner of Burlesque Theater The indictment, announced by District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, charged that since January 1981, Mr. Cincotti has been an owner and operator of the Melody Burlesque Theater, at 205 West 48th Street, and had ''knowingly advanced and profited from prostitution by managing, supervising, controlling and owning a house of prostitution.'' He faces up to seven years in prison if convicted. Mr. Cincotti and an unidentified co-owner made $20,000 a week from the operation, according to Mr. Morgenthau, who added that he expected the co-owner to be arrested by next week. Timothy Gilles, a spokesman for Mr. Abrams, said that Mr. Cincotti was the seventh assistant attorney general since 1966 to be indicted and that three were convicted. The others were charged with offenses that included perjury and receiving bribes. Mr. Morgenthau also announced the indictment of Alfred Williams of Manhattan on charges of promoting child prostitution and child pornography. The defendant is being held without bail.

1384-> C. NORMAN STABLER
C. Norman Stabler, who as business and financial editor of the old New York Herald Tribune had covered the 1929 Wall Street crash and the subsequent Depression, died Thursday at his home in Keene, N.H. He was 81 years old. He began his career as a reporter for The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin and, in New York, for The Associated Press and The New York Journal of Commerce. He became financial editor of The Herald Tribune in 1929 and left the newspaper in 1960. He later became a columnist for the Weekly Bond Buyer. He retired in the late 1970's. He is survived by five sons: Charles Jr., of Rocky Hill, N.J.; Griffin, of Winchester, N.H.; Edward, of Syracuse; John, of Atlanta, and Richard, of Oxford, Pa.; two sisters, Eleanor Clark and Sarah Stabler, both of Kennett Square, Pa., and 11 grandchildren.

1385-> DOCTOR CONFIRMS EXCESS OF CYANIDE
The doctor treating a San Jose woman believed to be a victim of poisoning by cyanide-laced capsules of Anacin-3 informed the police today that tests had confirmed she had 10 times the acceptable level of cyanide in her body when she was admitted for treatment. Meanwhile, the woman's husband, Richard Bowen, told The San Jose Mercury that he had sought help and had been rebuffed by 10 public agencies and private laboratories when he suspected the capsules might be tainted. Police Chief Joseph D. McNamara of San Jose said that Mr. Bowen had given a full statement to the authorities. He first offered, then later declined to take, a polygraph test today. Mr. Bowen's wife, Susan, a 30-year-old mother of two, became ill Nov. 26 and was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in critical condition. She was treated as a stroke victim, but this week doctors began to suspect poisoning. Dr. John Smith, the cardiologist who confirmed the presence of cyanide in Mrs. Bowen's body, offered no further details about the case. Some Brain Damage Reported Mrs. Bowen has been pronounced ready to be discharged, but she will need therapy for ''residual brain stem damage,'' which has created difficulty in speaking and swallowing. In the newspaper interview, Mr. Bowen, 29, a district manager in the newspaper's circulation department, said he purchased the capsules at a Long's Drugstore near his home Nov. 24. He said he became suspicious when hospital tests showed an unidentified drug in his wife's blood and urine. He said he noticed a strong odor from the capsules and began trying to get them. However, he told The Mercury, ''Everyone kissed it off. I'm more frustrated at the system than anything else.'' Record of Call to Police Chief McNamara said that a review of tape recordings of calls to the police confirmed that Mr. Bowen called at 6 P.M. Nov. 27 seeking an immediate analysis of the capsules. He was referred to two agencies but replied that they had failed to offer him help. Chief McNamara said the procedure for handling poisoning reports had been to wait until medical authorities confirmed the poisoning before taking action. He said his department would now begin filling out a report on each suspected poisoning. Chain drugstores in the San Francisco Bay area have removed all Maximum Strength Anacin-3 from their shelves. Barbara Dalrymple, acting district director of the Federal Food and Drug Administration office here, said that tests so far had been negative on samples of capsules from stores within a five-mile radius of the store where Mr. Bowen purchased his bottle. The spokesman said the agency's telephone log had no record of a call from Mr. Bowen. ---- Manufacturer's Stock Rises In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, prices rose for shares of the American Home Products Company, which makes Anacin. The stock rose 2 1/8 points, closing at 44 1/4. Trading resumed yesterday in the stock of the Bristol-Myers Company, which produces Bufferin, Excedrin and other nonprescription products that compete with Anacin. The exchange had halted trading in the Bristol-Myers stock Thursday because of ''a surge of orders caused by a news development.'' Yesterday Bristol-Meyers gained 1/4 point, closing at 67 3/8.

1386-> CUOMO FAVORS GAS-TAX AID FOR BUFFALO
Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo said today that he would consider directing a large share of revenue from a proposed Federal gasoline tax increase to Buffalo and the Southern Tier because of high unemployment in both areas. He said he would also propose a bond issue to subsidize a state program to create jobs. Mr. Cuomo did not specify, however, when he wanted to put such a bond issue before the voters, how much money would be required to finance it or how many jobs he would want to create. The Governor-elect was questioned by reporters for an hour at a news conference held here to announce the nomination of Assemblywoman Gail S. Shaffer, Democrat of North Blenhein, as his Secretary of State - a position Mr. Cuomo held before he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1978. Miss Shaffer, who must be confirmed by the State Senate, is to preside at the inauguration of Mr. Cuomo on Jan. 1. 'Buffalo Is Beyond Recession' In discussing ways to distribute revenue from the proposed 5-cent increase in the gas tax, the Governor-elect said: ''Buffalo is the Midwest when it comes to unemployment. Buffalo is beyond recession.'' Unemployment there was reported at 13.6 percent earlier this month. The tax increase proposal - which would finance repair of highways, bridges and mass transit - was passed by the House and is being considered by the Senate. Mr. Cuomo said he was uncertain how much money New York State would receive under the plan. State officials said the Federal legislation had not yet resolved what authority governors would have in allocating the funds. Mr. Cuomo said Bufalo and the Southern Tier had the most serious unemployment problem in the state. In announcing the nomination of Miss Shaffer, the Governor-elect said he would ask her to assume the duties of ombudsman, a role Mr. Cuomo created for himself to handle citizen complaints about government when he served as Lieutenant Governor. Miss Shaffer, who is 34 and lives with her parents on a farm in the Schoharie Valley, would give up her seat from the predominantly Republican 105th Assembly District. She became the second commissioner and second woman to be named to the Cabinet this week, following the selection of Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich as Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. Mr. Cuomo also named a woman, Alice G. Daniel, as counsel to the Governor.

1387-> Confirm the New Judges
In the teeth of resistance by Warren Anderson, the New York State Senate Republican leader, Governor Carey has submitted 11 nominations for new judgeships on the Court of Claims. The nominations will expire unless acted on by the end of the month. The Governor has also nominated four people for vacancies on the court and proposed reappointing four other judges. He has promised to nominate eight more candidates of Senator Anderson's choosing for other vacancies, provided only that a bipartisan screening committee finds them well qualified. The list of 19 Carey nominees is excellent, but Senator Anderson is unmoved. Still miffed that the committee rejected his preferred candidates, he vows to block confirmation of all but the four reappointees and spurns the invitation to pick the last eight. Since most of the claims judges would be assigned to Supreme Court criminal trials in New York City, the city stands to lose badly needed judicial strength and its fair share of a statewide deal for 98 new judges. It also stands to lose judicial quality. Some of the finest Criminal Court judges, unable to reach the State Supreme Court bench through elective politics, would be denied their deserved promotions. Senator Anderson's charge that Governor Carey's screeners stacked the deck against his favorites gains nothing from repetition. Why would a bipartisan committee, which approved 112 lawyers and judges of both parties, disapprove on political grounds only the majority leader's choices? And why, if partisanship had triumphed over quality, would Governor Carey's nominees include at least three Republicans and three lower court judges who have run for office on the Republican line? If Senator Anderson will not cooperate in rounding out a bipartisan list of judges, it remains for the Senate Judiciary Committee to do its duty by promptly considering the nominations on the merits. The caliber and professional service of the nominees should make the confirmation task easy next week. Mr. Anderson wants to take his ball and go home. He would deny good government for everyone else.

1388-> GIFTS TO THE NEEDIEST HERALD BIRTHS AND HONOR THE DEAD
The celebration of the arrival of new family members and the memory of departed loved ones equally inspire contributions to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Welcoming a grandson, Peter H. Kaufmann of Great Neck, L.I., donated $1,000 in honor of Mr. and Mrs. Howard Tooter of Stamford, Conn., ''on the occasion of the birth of their first-born son, Scott Tooter.'' Mrs. Tooter, Mr. Kaufmann's daughter, said in a telephone conversation that Scott was born on Nov. 24 and that she was not surprised by her father's donation. ''He's very generous,'' she said. She added that she and her husband also gave regularly to the Neediest Cases Fund. Gift Honors Parents Among contributors to the fund honoring the memory of beloved family members was Ralph K. Heyman of Scarsdale, who on behalf of the Ruth and Ralph Heyman Foundation donated $100 ''in loving memory of Rosalie K. and Oscar Heyman,'' his parents. The fund, he said in a note, was ''one of their favorite charities.'' Joseph and Gertrude Simons of Great Neck, L.I., donated $1,000 in memory of Harriet Simons. Anita Guterman of Manhattan sent a check for $500 ''in memory of my beloved mother, Hilda Lederer, who died on Nov. 15, 1982.'' Janet C. Quint of Manhattan gave $66 in memory of her father, Howard H. Quint, who would have been 66 years old on Jan. 3.

1389-> CONNECTICUT COMMISSION REJECTS A TAX ON INCOMES
A bipartisan commission completing a nine-month study today rejected a state income tax for Connecticut and recommended that the state expand its existing tax structure to solve its fiscal problems. Setting the stage for what is expected to be a long fight over higher taxes in the General Assembly session that convenes Jan. 5, the commission urged the elimination of a several exemptions in the state's current 7.5 percent sales tax. The vote was 15 to 10. The 27-member panel, whose official name is the Bipartisan Comission on State Tax Revenue and Related Fiscal Policy, recommended applying the sales tax at varying rates to such things as gasoline, home heating oil, personal and professional services, newspaper and magazine subscriptions, children's clothing and meals costing less than $1. All these are now exempt from the sales tax. The panel also endorsed the concept of a commuter tax on out-ofstate residents who work in Connecticut, with the proceeds to be used for highway and mass-transit improvements. Framework for Legislation By a vote of 13 to 11, the commission rejected a tax on personal income that would have been coupled with limits on state spending and reductions in existing taxes. The General Assembly is unlikely to approve all the proposals recommended by the commission, according to some legislative leaders, but the panel's work is expected to be the framework for legislative consideration of new or higher state taxes. According to preliminary budget estimates, the state faces a gap of almost $300 million between anticipated revenues and expenditures in the fiscal year that started July 1. The commission's proposals to eliminate exemptions in the sales tax would yield an estimated $446 million if all were enacted. Governor Withholds Comment ''This has been an excellent forerunner of what we're going to see in the General Assembly,'' said Richard F. Schneller, the commission chairman, who is also the Democratic majority leader of the State Senate. But he added, ''Admittedly, these sales tax exemptions are not going to be easy for the General Assembly.'' Governor William A. O'Neill said through a spokesman that he wanted to review the commission's final report before commenting. That report is to be drafted next week. Mr. O'Neill's chief budget adviser, Anthony V. Milano, was a member of the commission, and some commission members speculated that the Governor might embrace some of the panel's proposals when he submits his budget proposal to the legislature in February. Others to Propose Income Tax The commission was created last year by the legislature. Its members, who included legislators and business and labor officials, were appointed by the Governor and the legislative leaders. Some legislators initially had viewed the commission as a vehicle to promote an income tax. But the Governor vowed repeatedly during his recent election campaign that he would veto such a levy, and the votes today showed that a majority of the commission preferred other measures. Nevertheless, proponents of an income tax, who included most Democratic legislators on the commission, said they would still offer an income tax measure to the legislature, although they acknowledged that it would be difficult to pass. While the commission endorsed the idea of a commuter tax on out-ofstate residents who work in the state, it did not specify a rate or a potential yield. The Governor vetoed a commuter tax earlier this year that would have applied only to New Yorkers. The largest single proposal, a sales tax on the wholesale price of motor fuels, would bring in $107 million and would raise the price of gasoline by about 8 cents a gallon. Enactment of that proposal is expected to be difficult, some legislators said, because Connecticut already imposes a tax of 11 cents a gallon on gasoline and a 5-centper-gallon increase in the Federal tax is pending in Congress. A 3.5 percent sales tax on professional services, such as those by physicians, lawyers and accountants, and on personal services, such as those by barbers, beauticians and plumbers, could yield a total of $143 million. A 5 percent sales tax on heating oil and a 7.5 percent sales tax on new machinery would yield about $65 million each, according to the commission.

1390-> OUTDOORS; STATE HUNTERS FACE RECORD DEER SEASON
Deer hunting is already under way in portions of New York State. In Suffolk and Westchester Counties, it will not end until Dec. 31. Once, hunters of white-tailed deer simply waited for the season to open, plucked off the wall whatever firearm their fathers or grandfathers had bequeathed them and disappeared into the woods. They didn't have to worry about wearing blaze orange so other hunters wouldn't shoot them; there were few restrictions on the caliber or the gauge of the weapon. They were not restricted to shooting only bucks with antlers of specified length, nor did they have to deal with different seasons in different zones. But as deer populations declined, it became apparent that more sophisticated management techniques were needed to bring herds up to optimum levels. This need - plus social and political considerations and the desire of some hunters to use such primitive weapons as the bow and arrow and the muzzle-loading rifle - resulted in the creation of the various zones and seasons and the establishment of areas in which modern firearms, and sometimes all firearms, are banned. However complicated they may appear, the new management procedures have provided more animals for more people to hunt. Last year, deer hunters in New York State had a record kill, 166,027 animals, making it one of the top deer-hunting states in the country. The 1980 kill, also a record, was 136,255. T his year's kill, according to Nate Dickinson, Big Game Unit leader for the Department of Environmental Conservation, may approach 200,000. The goal, after deer populations have leveled off, is a kill of 120,000 animals annually. The various management tools include restrictions on the length of season, the sex of the animals that may be legally shot and the culling of additional deer in areas where they have overpopulated their habitat. The overpopulation problem is alleviated through the so-called party-permit system in which groups of hunters may shoot one additional deer of either sex in addition to the one to which each hunter is legally entitled. Last year, 85,121 deer were taken in this manner in New York State. This is the only situation in which a hunter may legally shoot more than one deer in the state. Except under the party-permit arrangement, hunters using firearms are limited to bucks with antlers at least three inches long. In New York State's southern zone, roughly the lower half of the state, there are two archery seasons. The first opened Oct. 14 and closes Nov. 20 and the second is Dec. 15-19. The modern-firearms season in the southern zone is Nov. 22-Dec. 14 and the muzzleloading season Dec. 15-21. Only bow-and-arrow hunting is allowed in Westchester (Nov. 1-Dec. 31) and Suffolk (Dec. 6-31) counties. Portions of Albany and Monroe counties are also limited to bow-andarrow hunting during the regular-firearms season. Elsewhere in the southern zone, there is a large area where all legal weapons may be used and another where the modern rifle is excluded. In both these areas, except where only bow-and-arrow hunting is permitted, a pistol may also be used. In some places, the pistol must be .35 caliber or more with a barrel no less than four inches long. In others, the only restriction on a pistol - and this applies throughout the northern zone - is that it not be a rimfire. In the northern zone, the bow-and-arrow and muzzle-loading seasons ended Oct. 21, and the modern-firearms season runs from Oct. 23-Dec. 5. I n addition to the limitations on the pistols, there are regulations involving rifles, shotguns and bows and arrows. No rifle using rimfire ammunition can be used for deer hunting; shotguns must be 20 gauge or larger and loaded with a single round ball or rifled slug. An auto-loading rifle or shotgun holding more than six rounds is illegal. A bow must be capable of casting a legal hunting arrow at least 105 yards. The muzzle-loading weapon must have rifling in its barrel and must be .44 caliber or larger and loaded with a round, patched ball. A socalled Minie ball - a projectile shaped like a conventional bullet - is also used in muzzle-loading rifles, one advantage being that it needs no cloth patch. One can hunt with bow and arrow or muzzle-loading rifle during the modern-firearms seasons. During those periods a Minie ball or similar projectile is legal. During the three archery-only seasons in the state's two zones, archers may shoot deer of either sex. The same is true in the special archery seasons in Suffolk and Westchester Counties.

1393-> BANKING MERGERS FLOURISH
A major change in Pennsylvania's banking code has created a banking free-for-all in this state. A wave of mergers and acquisitions among the state's 350 banks has followed the move last March to allow statewide banking. In addition, there has been substantial interest by investors in the stocks of small, profitable banks in growth markets within the state. The price of stock in such banks, which are considered eventual takeover candidates by larger banks in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, began rising last October, when the statewide banking amendment was first introduced by Pennsylvania's Secretary of Banking. Before the change, banks in Pennsylvania, one of the last states to adopt some form of statewide banking, were permitted to operate only in counties contiguous to their headquarters counties. Now, banks may operate in a much broader range. And the former bank code prohibited multibank holding companies. Now, Pennsylvania bank holding companies are permitted to acquire banks under an assigned schedule that one banking analyst said ''looks like the National Football League's draft choices.'' Under terms of that schedule, a bank holding company can acquire four banks in the first four years, four more in the second four years, and after the initial eight-year period there is no restriction on the number of banks it can acquire. 'First Wave' of Mergers There have been 13 bank mergers in Pennsylvania since the new law took effect. Those mergers constitute what state bankers are referring to as the ''first wave,'' those in which the banking powers in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia chose their initial partners. On April 19, the Pittsburgh National Corporation became the first to take advantage of the new banking law when it announced its intention to consolidate with Philadelphia's Provident National Corporation and create a unit with $10.3 billion in assets. This was followed by the announcement that the Mellon Bank, the state's largest banking institution, would join with the Girard Company of Philadelphia, a bank one-fourth its size, to create a banking power with $23.6 billion in assets. Brian McShane, a banking analyst with the brokerage firm of Butcher & Singer Inc., explained that because of their size, Mellon and Pittsburgh National, the two largest banks in the state, were able to make the first move on other Pennsylvania banks, and thus set the stage for a banking system with fewer banks and redistributed markets. ''The first round was extremely important to see where the Pittsburgh banks were going in Philadelphia,'' he said. Because the Philadelphia banks were smaller and thus not in a position to make the first move, ''Philadelphia banks couldn't go into Pittsburgh, so they were at a decided disadvantage,'' he said. The move by Pittsburgh's two largest banks left Philadelphia National, whose $5.1 billion in assets makes it Philadelphia's largest bank, to seek a partner that would expand its regional market instead of making it a statewide banking power. The partner was announced in early September, when Philadelphia National said it would acquire the National Central Financial Corporation, a holding company for Hamilton Bank. Hamilton Bank operates primarily in the Lancaster area, which abuts Philadelphia National's market. Fewer but Larger Banks First Pennsylvania Bank of Philadelphia and Equibank of Pittsburgh, two of the state's half-dozen largest banks, are effectively out of the merger race because of their troubled conditions. Both are involved in the process of recovering from serious losses and lack the capital needed to acquire smaller banks. After Philadelphia National announced its acquisition of National Central on Sept. 10, a raft of smaller Philadelphia banks, one by one, went public with their partners. Central Penn National Bank, a $904 million Philadelphia institution, was acquired by the $2 billion American Bank Corporation of Reading. Fidelcor Inc., with $3 billion in assets, joined with the $700 million Southeast National Bankshares of Pennsylvania, which operates in Philadelphia's suburbs. And the $2 billion Continental Bank said it would merge with the $560 million York Bank and Trust Company, which operates in the south-central Pennsylvania industrial city of York. With the first wave of mergers essentially complete, Pennsylvania has begun the process of altering its banking system: creating fewer but larger institutions. The larger banks will have the financial strength to compete against such nonbank competitors as brokerage houses and insurance companies. Also, many of them are poised for expansion beyond the state's borders - into such markets as New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware - if Federal law is changed to permit interstate banking. Attractive Small Banks The next move expected by Pennsylvania bankers is the ''second wave'' of acquisitions, the ones in which banks of $1 billion or less will find merger partners. In anticipation of this round of mergers, stock speculators began purchasing stock in small Pennsylvania banks as early as a year ago. According to Richard Wines, president of Ryan Beck Pennsylvania Inc., an investment banking firm, the stock prices of such banks as Commonwealth Financial Corporation, a $1.1 billion organization, and Dawson Deposit Corporaion, a $826 million institution, both in Harrisburg, rose sharply last fall after it was announced that Pennsylvania was considering statewide banking.

1395-> Market Place; Oil and Gas Income Funds
OIL and gas properties, decidedly out of favor as tax shelters, may offer investors satisfactory income prospects even so. That's the argument put forth by companies that specialize in limited partnerships - groups that buy producing oil properties for income purposes. Petro Lewis and Damson are the leaders in oil and gas income plans, and Morgan Petroleum Inc. is a relative newcomer. Morgan Petroleum's Garry E. Stelow, president of the general partner behind the Morgan income funds, reasons that large, older companies have concentrated on large properties. He thinks competition for these properties has left smaller ones in a pricing trough. Morgan and some other new funds, including its rivals HCW, Geovest and Quinoco, mostly buy properties priced at less than $10 million - some as low as $3 million. Until recently, there was been relatively little action in this sector of the market and the properties were relatively cheap. Mr. Stelow argues that these factors work to the advantage of limited partners. He spoke of a general need for capital among owners of oil properties. ''The owner typically needs working capital,'' he said. ''He has a choice. He can sell or he can borrow against his properties at the bank. If he sells to us he has no repayment obligations and that's important to most.'' Mr. Stelow added: ''We buy properties with proven production for our partnerships and pay a price that reflects the present value of the oil we expect to recover. Engineers have been 90 to 95 percent accurate in estimating total oil recoverable and 80 to 85 percent accurate concerning the amounts we'll recover each year.'' For these reasons, Mr. Stelow believes income partnerships can offer predictable income. Morgan has been in the business since 1979, but believes its experienced employees, who include two former executives of a major rival, are the equal of their peers in older companies. Moreover, there are relatively few staff workers at Morgan and other new companies, so that management costs are kept under control. Maybe so, but the cost for limited partners is fairly stiff at Morgan, as it is elsewhere. At Morgan the minimum investment is $2,500. That gives the buyer a participating interest in the jointly held properties of the limited partnership. But to simplify an example, consider costs experienced by an investor who puts up $10,000. First a $792 sales commission is paid to the retail broker. Then $198 is paid to the wholesaler for brokerage expenses. Another $260 is paid to reimburse the general partner for organization expenses and costs associated with the creation of the fund. After a small management fee, the investor would have about $8,738 left in the fund, and that's used to purchase properties. Despite these costs, most limited partners can expect a 10 percent to 12 percent return on the $10,000 in the example, according to Mr. Stelow, who adds that 50 percent to 70 percent of the distributions are regarded as returns of capital and not subject to tax: ''If the money went into the bank instead, the investor would pay a tax on the interest without any offsets under the 1982 law that eliminates a small interest deduction.'' What's more, Mr. Stelow said, the value of oil can be expected to rise with the general level of prices, while money in the bank erodes in an inflationary environment. Morgan expects the inflation rate to rise somewhat above current levels, which would be an additional advantage for its limited partners, Mr. Stelow said. ''Treasury bills at 9 percent would lose about 8 percent through inflation by our estimate over the next several years,'' he said. Like its rivals, Morgan seeks diversification. Its limited partnerships invest in a minimum of 5 properties and a maximum of 10 per limited partnership. Each partnership is capitalized at about $1 million. It is clear, then, that the individual partnership doesn't take any one of the $3 million to $10 million oil properties in its entirety. Sometimes Morgan will buy the entire property and divide it among a number of limited partnerships. Mr. Stelow notes that income funds are gaining in popularity, with volume of $786 million in 1981. Investment Search Inc., a New Jersey firm that reviews oil and gas operations, estimates that the 1982 figure will be slightly more than $1 billion. In the meantime, drilling funds are growing less popular. These funds raised about $2 billion in 1981 according to the same source but will raise about half that in 1982. The income funds are said to be popular with employee benefit plans and for people who would otherwise invest in real estate, timed certificates of deposit and other income-oriented investments. There is no guarantee, of course, that the investor will earn the indicated 10 percent to 12 percent, although past returns have done even better in a rising market for oil. On the other hand, oil prices have weakened over the past 18 months and remain weak today. If they weaken further, the investor might earn even less.

1396-> SERVING MR. DONUT AND THE COMMUNITY
OSAKA, Japan IT can be argued that anyone who opens a Mister Donut franchise in Japan really wants to. On the first day of management training, the future entrepreneurs are sent by bus to a Kyoto residential district, where they go from house to house, knocking on doors and politely asking permission to scrub the family toilet. According to members of the company, it is an exercise intended to instill a sense of community service. After that, all franchise owners and shop managers enroll in the company's ''Donut University,'' a five-week training course covering everything from quality control to fire prevention. Meals, which are included, consist almost solely of doughnuts and coffee. ''Unless they can live with doughnuts for five weeks, we feel they cannot serve doughnuts with pride,'' says Keji Chiba, general manager and director of food industries for the Duskin Company, the privately owned concern that franchises Mister Donut in Japan. Indeed, it is Mr. Chiba who is given credit for making Mister Donut into one of Japan's biggest fast-food businesses and by far its biggest doughnut operation. With 346 stores, Mr. Donut now ranks 13th among Japan's fast-food companies, and third among foreignbegun fast-food companies, following McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken. It has effectively blunted efforts here by its American arch-rival, Dunkin' Donuts, a company that dwarfs Mister Donut in America but has had only middling success in Japan. Last year, Mister Donut posted sales of $122.4 million here, a 20 percent increase over the previous year. ''Every success story of an American business here in Japan has a Chiba,'' said Kenichi Ohmae, managing director of McKinsey & Company in Tokyo. ''Everyone talks of the importance of the group, but I don't think a group can create a business. It's the result of one or two men using principles of Japanese management.'' In a land that systematically dissuades entrepreneurs, such businessmen tend to be mavericks. And by Japanese standards, the 42-year-old Mr. Chiba is one of those mavericks. Born on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu, he never attended college and he became a sailor right out of high school. An illness forced him to drop that calling, and on a visit to Osaka, he was offered a job by Seiichi Suzuki, founder and president of Duskin, a franchising company specializing in industrial linen businesses. Mr. Suzuki, who died in 1980, was something of a maverick himself. At age 27, he quit his job with an Osaka wax company to join a religious community devoted to Ittoen, a distant 19th-century cousin of Buddhism that stresses service to the community. He subsequently started several businesses, including Duskin, running all of them by the principles of his religion. In 1969, shortly after Dunkin' Donuts arrived in Japan, Harry Winokur, founder of Mister Donut in America, asked Mr. Suzuki to start some Japanese Mister Donut franchises. A year later, Mr. Suzuki agreed. Mr. Chiba, who was then 29 years old, was put in charge. Mister Donut in Japan, according to Mr. Chiba, has the same philosophy as its American parent: to serve the customer and provide a pleasant environment. But the approach here has been distinctly different, and has so far proved successful. Indeed, some analysts credit the company with creating the doughnut business in Japan. According to its contract, Mister Donut in Japan was to be a carbon copy of the American company. But Mr. Chiba had his doubts. To test his market, he had a full-size replica of a typical Mister Donut coffee shop built inside a gigantic Duskin warehouse. To keep his project confidential, he used Duskin sales people and staff to sample the cuisine and comment on the surroundings. ''They didn't like it at all,'' recalls Mr. Chiba, an active, slender man who speaks with animation. ''They said that the counters were too high, the chairs were too wide, the coffee cups were too heavy and the doughnuts were too large.'' The doughnuts also tasted funny - too much nutmeg for the Japanese palate. But by the time the first Mister Donut shop opened in 1971 in Minoo, a town of 30,000 outside Osaka, Mr. Chiba felt he knew what the venture needed. ''Today all we use from the American company is the logo,'' he says. The Minoo debut site was also deliberate. Dunkin' Donuts had opened its first store in Tokyo's bustling Ginza district. ''There were hundreds of suburban towns like Minoo all over Japan, but only one Ginza,'' says Mr. Chiba. ''If Minoo was a success, I knew people would think, 'I know a place where I can do even better,' and they would want to open franchises.'' THE company also set out to glamorize the doughnut. Doughnuts were i ntroduced here about a century ago when Japan began to again trade w ith the West, but they were widely regarded as a child's snack. The c ompany didn't want doughnuts to become the blue-collar favorite theya re in America, either. So it tried to fashion an image of a h ighclass snack. Priced between 32 and 57 cents, they were affordableb ut more expensive than the earlier models, which sold for as little a s 4 cents. Last year Mister Donut operated 346 stores here, each with average sales of about $326,530. The company has also paid off handsomely for its American parent, which receives an annual 2.5 percent royalty - about $2.9 million. In contrast, Dunkin' Donuts's 43 outlets each averaged sales of about $261,248, with total sales of $11.2 million. Market analysts here cite Mister Donut as a first-class example of a fairly common phenomenon: a lower-ranked American company that outperforms its top-ranked American competition in Japan. This is a country where Schick outsells Gillette and Delmonte ketchup is more popular than Heinz. ''Being No.1 in the States can sometimes be a weakness in Japan,'' says Hiroshi Ebihara, an independent management consultant in Tokyo. ''The No.2 company is likely to be more open to suggestions about what will succeed in Japan.'' Indeed, analysts emphasize that the most successful foreign-begun enterprises here team up with a strong Japanese business partner and specially tailor their products and marketing techniques to Japanese tastes. They also follow the strong Japanese business tradition of downplaying personal achievements and crediting successes to the company. In the case of Mister Donut, for example, Mr. Chiba speaks in terms of ''we the company'' instead of his role, even when asked about it directly. Mister Donut plans further growth, according to Duskin president Shigeharu Komai. The company will have about 425 shops by the close of the fiscal year 1983, in March. (Sales for this year are projected to be between $142.9 million and $163.3 million.) An additional 70 shops are scheduled to open next year, about half of them run by people who already have franchises. To date, only about 3 or 4 percent of the stores have failed, says Mr. Komai, a rate he credits, in part, to the company's careful choice of franchisees. Today Duskin includes eight franchising companies and nearly 3,000 franchise outlets overseas. Last year it posted aftertax earnings of $9.8 million on sales of $489.8 million. It owns just 48 doughnut shops. The company's goal is 1,000 doughnut shops in Japan by 1990. Yet some analysts see problems with such rapid expansion of a narrow-based fast-food enterprise. Unlike America, Japan has not yet confronted a widespread health boom, which could dampen sales of socalled junk food. Mr. Chiba says he is aware of the problem. ''I don't think we'll be able to carry on as we've done in the past,'' he says. ''We're giving a lot of thought to this.'' Some also wonder if the company will be able to command the same dogged loyalty and participation from franchisees and employees, especially if attitudes toward work change among Japanese. But Mr. Komai is confident. ''Our franchisees know they can expect a good profit,'' he says. Most stores show 27 percent before-tax profit. Duskin takes 7 percent of that, passing on 2.5 percent to the American parent and plowing back 4 percent into company activities. ''Mr. Suzuki started the Mister Donut business as a means of thanking those who had made his Duskin businesses so profitable,'' says Mr. Chiba. ''With Mister Donut, the philosophy is 'Profit follows - If you want to make the franchise a success, let the franchisee make a profit.' '' The spirit of thanksgiving is not dead in the Mister Donut operation today - and it also pinpoints the difference between Japan's Mister Donut and its American counterpart. Each year on Jan. 27, the day it was decided to introduce Mister Donut in Japan, every shop manager, sales person and baker in the Japanese operation is dispatched to clean a public washroom in the spirit of ''self-reflection and gratitude,'' as a company leaflet describes it. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Terry Trucco is a writer who lives in Tokyo.

1399-> Home Advantage Can Fail, Too
To the Sports Editor: At the end of Charles Einstein's article (''The Best World Series Games? Take These Three, The New York Times, Oct. 10), it was pointed out that in each instance the winner was the home team. I was thumbing through a pro football encyclopedia recently to see that the 73-0 defeat of the Washington Redskins by the Chicago Bears in the 1940 National Football League championship game took place, of all places, in Washington. Perhaps the ''friendly crowds contribution'' cited in the article changed to unfriendly after the ball was dropped by a Redskin receiver in the Bear end zone in the first quarter when the score was 0-0. It has been reported that after the game, Sammy Baugh, the Redskin quarterback, was asked if a completed rather than incomplete pass at this juncture might have made a difference. His reply: ''Yeah, it would have been 73-7.'' FRANK NUGENT Bronx

1400-> MUSIC VIEW; FLEISHER, 'CANDIDE' AND A 'COSI' RESONATE IN THE MEMORY
Looking back is not generally a healthy or useful exercise. Even if you do not acquire a severe crick in the neck from peering over your shoulder, there is the great danger of coming down with an even more serious ailment: yesteritis. The affliction seems to strike older members of the musical public, while generally sparing the young. Its symptoms are easy to recognize. The eyes begin to tear ever so slightly at the mention of any soprano above the age of 50. The fingers move convulsively, as if shuffling through yellowed concert programs. The heart beats calmly at the prospect of hearing the latest sensational young pianist or computerized composer, but begins to thump dangerously at the mere thought of names such as Rubinstein or Schubert. There is no known cure. Occasionally, however, it helps the afflicted one simply to give in to yesteritis - to embrace it in the way a person with a cold sometimes decides to stop fighting and climb into bed with a bottle of aspirin. Let us, then, abandon shame and look back over the last 12 months for musical high points to become nostalgic about. By tradition there must be 10 such events and, lo, that is precisely how many I have found. Looming above all other events for me was the electrifying concert in Baltimore at which Leon Fleisher reappeared in public as a twohanded pianist, performing Franck's ''Symphonic Variations.'' A mysterious neurological problem had stiffened his right-hand fingers 18 years before and confined him to conducting and to the meager left-hand repertory. When the problem yielded to treatment after many frustrating years, he courageously decided to risk a comeback. To appreciate the situation fully, it helped to have been around in the years when Leon Fleisher was the favorite son of American music, the natural heir to the demanding audience that worshiped his teacher Artur Schnabel and a chosen recording partner of the fearsome perfectionist George Szell. Mr. Fleisher's 10-fingered performance with the Baltimore Symphony is the only one he has attempted so far, but there must be chapters in the story yet to come. Joan Sutherland's return to the Metropolitan Opera in ''Lucia di Lammermoor'' also must rank as a comeback of sorts. She had been away from the company for four years as a result of a quarrel over repertory and when she did return it was in an old production and one of her most famous roles. It was thrilling to hear, however, how brilliantly the 56-year-old soprano could still handle the coloratura rigors of Lucia. In fact, she sounded remarkably like the Joan Sutherland of 20 years before, a testimonial not only to her native gift and disciplined training but to the care with which she has guarded that rare talent. While on the subject of the Metropolitan, I certainly must include the two new productions that gave me the most pleasure this year: ''The Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Idomeneo.'' The Offenbach opera was especially clever and witty in the ''Olympia'' act, but a strong cast, coupled to Otto Schenk's inventive staging and Gunther Schneider-Siemssen's richly detailed sets, lifted the entire production to a level that no opera company can often achieve. Of course, I am talking only about the first performance, last March, when Placido Domingo was wonderful as a Hoffmann driven to drink by his romantic fantasies. When ''Hoffmann'' returns to the Met stage next month, it will be without Domingo, which should test the production's power to survive important cast changes. ''Idomeneo'' arrived at the Metropolitan exactly 201 years after its premiere in Munich, which seems astonishing when you consider that the composer was Mozart. The City Opera had prepared the ground with a welcome but inadequate production six years before, but the opera-seria genre of ''Idomeneo'' is not one that Metropolitan audiences would be expected to appreciate. Luciano Pavarotti seemed a questionable choice, at least, for the title role. Moreover, anyone who remembered the disastrous ''Flying Dutchman'' that Jean-Pierre Ponnelle staged for the Metropolitan some years ago had to be apprehensive about his choice as director. A reading of the entrails before opening night provided no auspicious signs for this ''Idomeneo.'' And yet, once Mr. Ponnelle's stylistically mixed but aptly Baroque approach to Mozart could be accepted as valid, the production turned out to be a gripping experience. How ''Idomeneo'' will fare if it is brought back with lesser singers than Mr. Pavarotti, Hildegard Behrens, Ileana Cotrubas and Frederica von Stade is a question we will probably be forced in due time to consider. Is ''Idomeneo,'' in other words, a strong enough work to survive cast changes of the kind the Metropolitan has recently been offering its public? Is any opera that strong? In the vocal category, there were a number of outstanding candidates, such as a glorious recital by Teresa Berganza and a pair of bel canto demonstrations by Marilyn Horne in Rossini's ''La Donna del Lago,'' one in a staged version at the Houston Opera, the other in concert form at Carnegie Hall. However, I finally must come down on the side of Eva Marton, who emerged as a Wagnerian soprano in the Metropolitan Opera's ''Tannhauser.'' A powerful Elisabeth now, she could be the next Isolde if she continues to mature at her current rate. Elsewhere at Lincoln Center, the successful acoustical facelifting of the State Theater brought relieved applause. Although verdicts varied somewhat depending on where the jury members sat, many regular listeners reported improvements in clarity, focus and definition. I found that more of the singers's words than before made their way to my ear, a particularly important point for a company that gives so many performances in the language its audience understands best. That clearer projection of the text probably contributed heavily to the City Opera's most surprising achievement this year: the transplanting of Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide'' to the opera stage. I had reservations about changes made in the text, which lost some of its Voltairean trenchancy, and about the Hal Prince staging, which relied too much on worn ideas perhaps left over from his own Broadway successes. Nevertheless, it was exciting to see ''Candide'' pleasing a large new audience and taking one more step toward recognition as a classic of the American musical stage. In the same framework, I was delighted by the high-flying coloratura and gamin charm of Erie Mills, who made her City Opera debut in ''Candide.'' Miss Mills, who had aroused admiration a couple of months earlier during the Mostly Mozart Festival, gave us an irresistibly roguish Cunegonde. She must be rated as this year's ''new voice.'' In retrospect, however, I find that no opera production I saw this year stays in memory quite as firmly as the ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' that Jonathan Miller directed last summer for Opera Theater of St. Louis. The singers, an uncommonly smart and malleable quintet, became wholly caught up in Mr. Miller's vision of Mozart's saddest comedy. The director dealt with the opera as if it were a study in comparative morals conducted by an 18th-century rationalist, which was a striking idea and yet one that did not exploit the opera for the greater glory of the director, as so many productions nowadays do. Mr. Miller says he is retiring from the theater and going back to medicine, the profession for which he trained, which seems too bad: there are so many opera directors whose retirement would be more welcome. Unfortunately, my memories of this St. Louis performance are painfully mixed because its talented conductor, Calvin Simmons, drowned not long afterward. The only other production that I saw achieve similar homogeneity of ensemble was the ''Falstaff'' that Carlo Maria Giulini put together in Los Angeles. The lack of a great comic actor in the title role as well as Mr. Giulini's insistence on the serious side of Verdi's seriocomic masterpiece, kept this performance from being the ''Falstaff'' of a lifetime. It was, nonetheless, a lesson in what opera can be when an entire production is funneled through one great interpreter's mind. That leaves only one achievement to look back at. Was it, perhaps, Herbert von Karajan's triumphant return to New York with the Berlin Philharmonic? A plausible candidate, to be sure. But let us strike our final memorial plaque to Mr. Karajan's Berliners for another, more historic, reason: for the first time in its 100-year history the Berlin Philharmonic has accepted a woman musician into its manly ranks. Senza Sordino, the periodical of the International Conference of Symphony and Opera Musicians, reports that Madeline Karusso, 26, won out over 12 males in an audition for a first-violin position. Now that's achievement.

1401-> RECITAL: PETER ORTH, PIANIST, AT THE Y
PETER ORTH'S piano recital at the 92d Street Y on Sunday operated for most of the afternoon on a steady level of muscular integrity, determined clarity and musical good sense. When he turned to Liszt, however, Mr. Orth rose higher. The ''Benediction de Dieu dans la Solitude,'' offered an impressive sincerity, power and momentum that his Schumann and Debussy pieces only hinted at. Mr. Orth's reticent pedal effects rendered Schumann's ''Waldscenen'' - especially ''The Bird as Prophet'' - admirably clear but somewhat starved of romance and mystery. The story was much the same in Debussy's Etude ''Pour les Agrements.'' But here, and in the Schumann G minor Sonata, Mr. Orth attacked his music with earnest intensity and fearless enthusiasm. Three Preludes and Fugues by Shostakovich were also on the program. Bernard Holland

1402-> NEW YORK DAY BY DAY
The Sad Lot Of a Literary Landmark W ith some eclat one day last January, a band of scholars trooped to an office building of no great distinction and placed on its facade a plaque noting that Herman Melville had once lived on the site. Well, Melville's old brick house has long been gone from 104 East 26th Street. Now the plaque is, too. Someone has yanked it from its moorings, leaving behind gray space and a dull ache in the hearts of the Melville Society. ''It's sort of a sad comment about literary landmarks,'' said Donald Yannella of the University of Southern Mississippi, the society's secretary-treasurer. Not that the plaque was worth much - $170 brand-new. Still, it represented a sliver of the city's past. Melville lived on 26th Street from 1863 until his death in 1891, and it was there that he wrote ''Billy Budd,'' his long poem ''Clarel'' and other works. Most likely, a new plaque will be put up, Professor Yannella said yesterday. The society will look for a way to make it theft proof - a hunt, he acknowledged, that could prove more difficult than the one for the White Whale.

1403-> Your Money; Bond Swaps As Tax Aids
EVERY year around this time, tax swapping reaches a crescendo. For December is the month when thousands of holders of securities - generally bonds rather than stocks - use this device to create paper losses that will shelter part of their income from taxes. In a typical tax swap, a portfolio is inspected to pull out fixedincome securities whose market prices are lower than their original cost. The investor's goal is to sell these bonds and then use the proceeds to buy securities - normally those with a similar maturity date, coupon value or credit rating - that have comparable or improved investment quality. What are the benefits of a swap? The investor has the same relative securities position, but a tax loss has been established. And this loss has a value because it is deductible on Federal income tax returns. The rule is that capital losses in excess of capital gains are deductible to a limited extent. First, such losses can be used to offset any capital gains received during the year. Next, up to $3,000 in ordinary income can also be offset with capital losses annually. Any excess loss can be carried over and deducted until it is exhausted. On bonds with a short-term loss - those held for a year or less - losses offset income on a dollar-for-dollar basis. But for securities held for more than a year for a long-term loss, $2 of losses are needed to offset $1 of ordinary income. Thus, with a net long-term loss of $6,000, an investor can deduct the annual maximum of $3,000 from ordinary income. ''The economy has been weak and this is the time to upgrade,'' said Alan W. Leeds, partner in charge of the retail municipal bond department at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, who does many tax swaps for his firm's clients. ''People should review their financial holdings and hone in on what has been happening research-wise.'' A reason for tax swapping this year, instead of waiting until 1983, was cited by Lawrence Morris, first vice president of Butcher & Singer, a Philadelphia-based brokerage firm. ''Tax losses are better in 1982 than they will be next year, when another 10 percent Federal tax reduction goes into effect,'' he said. But putting a crimp in tax swapping these days, however, is the rise in the bond market in recent months. Reflecting the sharp decline in interest rates, prices of many fixed-income securities have shown increases of two or three percentage points over the same date last year. For instance, the Bond Buyer index of yields for long-term A-rated general obligation bonds was 10.05 percent for the week ended Thursday. In contrast, this key indicator stood at 13 percent a year ago. With interest rates down and bond prices up, there are currently fewer opportunities for profitable swaps of securities that have generated losses than there were last December. Nevertheless, many situations still exist in which this technique might pay off. Here's an example of one such swap, provided by Mr. Leeds of L.F. Rothschild: An investor previously bought 25 New York State Housing Finance Agency-State University bonds with a 7 percent coupon at par, for $25,000. The price of these bonds, due on Nov. 1, 1992, and rated A by Moody's and A+ by Standard & Poor's, is now 82.94, giving the investor a total market value of $20,735. With annual income of $1,750, the current yield - or ratio of interest to the current market price stated as a percentage - is 8.44 percent. This investor could sell those bonds and buy 25 New York State Housing Finance Agency-Mental Hygiene bonds with a 7.3 percent coupon for 84.52. The total price for the new bonds, due on Nov. 1, 1994, and with the same ratings by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, is $21,129 and the annual income is $1,825. In this case the current yield is 8.63 percent. By swapping, the investor can take a deductible tax loss of $4,265 - the original $25,000 purchase price minus the sale price of $20,735. In addition, the quality of the bonds has been maintained, the maturity has been lengthened by two years and, by paying an additional $394, the annual income has been increased by $75. There are points worth remembering about tax swaps: you can reinvest the proceeds from a sale in identical securities only by waiting 31 days. Otherwise the wash-sale regulations do not permit the losses to be recognized for tax purposes. Furthermore, it is usually better to spread your swapping activities throughout the year than to wait until the final month, because the pressure to reinvest immediately is reduced and more advantageous market prices can often be found over a longer period. You cannot do anything about that now, but you may be able to take advantage of this financial fact of life in the future.

1404-> MRS. GORSUCH AS A CRUSADING TIGER? CRITICS WONDER WHY
As Anne M. Gorsuch tells it, the bell that tolls this Friday at midnight will be for communities throughout the nation that have failed to meet the air quality standards set by the Clean Air Act. Mrs. Gorsuch, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has been criticized by environmentalists and Democrats in Congress, who say she has eased up on environmental law enforcement to make life easier for industry. But at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve, according to Mrs. Gorsuch, she will become an avenging angel, calling down Federal curses on the malefactors' heads. She says she has no choice. Congress did not reauthorize the law and extend the compliance deadlines, so its dictates must be followed, Mrs. Gorsuch contends. That means imposing the sanctions required by statute, including banning new construction in ''nonattainment areas,'' withholding Federal highway funds to states and localities and withholding Federal grants to the states for implementing the clean air law. At a news conference last week Mrs. Gorsuch said the imposition of sanctions would be ''an unhealthy, regressive step'' that would cause economic and environmental harm. ''But I always said I will fulfill my oath of office,'' Mrs. Gorsuch observed, ''and the law requires that all sources and all areas be in attainment by Dec.31, 1982, and where they are not, that I impose a broad variety of sanctions.'' Her critics don't see it that way. They say Mrs. Gorsuch is interpreting the law in deliberately rigid fashion for the benefit of industry. The threat of immediate sanctions, they believe, is meant to prod Congress into reworking the Clean Air Act soon after the new session begins the first week in January. What Mrs. Gorsuch and the Reagan Administration want are sweeping changes in the clean air regulations: Among them, a delay in compliance deadlines; an easing and simplification of rules protecting air in areas where it is clean; for automobile manufacturers, a loosening of standards requiring reductions in carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides emitted from tailpipes. The Administration argues that existing regulations are unnecessarily burdensome to industry. ''The agency is trying to paint the law as dark as it can be painted,'' said David Hawkins, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council and the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for air issues in the Carter Administration. The law, he said, ''is not designed to bring down a dark curtain overnight, but to apply gradual pressures'' to bring areas into compliance with national clean air standards. ''We want the agency to enforce the law as it is written,'' said Mr. Hawkins, who is also an officer of the National Clean Air Coalition, a group of environmental and public health organizations seeking to block changes that would weaken the act. But the law, he said, gives the environmental agency considerable flexibility and time for wielding the sanctions weapon. More important, according to Mr. Hawkins, ''The law does not say the agency must impose sanctions on areas that have not attained the standards.'' In fact, the law is confusing. It does say sanctions ''shall'' be imposed ''if'' certain conditions - such as non-attainment of clean air standards -obtain. But it offers pages of mediating conditions under which sanctions need not be imposed. It seems likely that the courts will have to untangle the law's meaning and its intent. Two Senators who helped write the Clean Air Act sent a letter to Mrs. Gorsuch earlier this month to point out what they saw as its niceties. Senator Robert T. Stafford, Republican of Vermont and chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said sanctions were not automatic. Moreover, they were meant to apply only to states that had no approved plans for carrying out the requirements of the act and to states or localities that were not trying to implement the plans they did have. As Curtis Moore, an aide to Senator Stafford, put it, the sanctions were authorized ''for those who refused to play the game, not for those who failed while trying to play.'' How many areas would be subject to punishment, and when it would be exacted, is not known. ''We are entering the twilight zone of the Clean Air Act,'' said Kathleen M. Bennett, the agency's assistant administrator for air issues. There are believed to be between 400 and 500 counties, in every state except North Dakota, listed as ''in non-attainment of at least one thing,'' said Mrs.Bennett. But she said additional facts, such as current air monitoring data for various regions, are needed before the list is considered up-to-date and complete. Moving Targets Mr. Hawkins said information obtained from E.P.A. sources indicated that the agency had targeted 139 counties as having failed to attain the Clean Air Act standards for particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides. Of these, he said, 38 counties were already under restrictions because they had no approved plans for carrying out the law. Sixty-six others are liable to sanctions under Mrs. Gorsuch's interpretation of the law, he said. By Mr. Hawkins's calculations, then, only 35 counties should be subject to the penalties that come with the Dec.31 deadline. Even where sanctions are imposed, the process will be gradual. Mrs.Bennett noted that the agency must publish rules on the proposed actions in the Federal Register and must then await public comment. Mr.Hawkins noted that while the agency is preparing, say, rules for banning new construction, companies can still apply for construction permits and that these permits can be granted even after the ban is in place. It would take at least two years for the sanctions to have an effect, he said. By that time, Congress could reauthorize the Clean Air Act and make the necessary adjustments for communities that need more time. Mrs. Bennett said the agency could not take action before April or May, but would not wait much longer. ''We are portrayed as being Draconian. We are not,'' she said. ''But we are not going to let the process string out forever. The law says the (E.P.A.) administrator shall impose sanctions, not may impose sanctions.'' Environmentalists consider it a self-imposed obligation, the Reagan Administration's latest move in a high-stakes game of chicken.

1405-> Big Men, Big Money, Big Matchup
When Georgetown and Virginia meet tomorrow night at the Capital Centre all 19,035 people in the arena and millions viewing the telecast will be watching every move by Ralph Sampson, the 7-4 Virginia senior, and Patrick Ewing, the 7-0 Georgetown sophomore. To most fans that is what this basketball game is all about - an updated version of Wilt Chamberlain vs. Bill Russell. The game between these two undefeated powers will be telecast by the Turner Broadcasting System at 8:30 P.M., New York time, and will be seen on cable or free-access stations, depending upon who purchased rights in a given area. WOR, Channel 9, will televise the game in the New York area. The television rights and gate receipts will bring in $1.25 million, which the schools will share. Terry Holland, Virginia's coach, said: ''It is a classic matchup. Everyone wants to know how they will fare against each other. I'm like everyone else. I'm interested in seeing what will happen between Ralph and Pat Ewing but also in what's going to happen between the two teams.'' But if either team's players and coaches get trapped in the frenzy of giant-watching, that team may pay for it by losing. Trying to Play Normally Othell Wilson, a junior Virginia guard, said: ''One of the most important things is for the other players not to get caught up in the Sampson-Ewing thing and not to just stand around looking. We have to play like we do in any other game. Without that it will be difficult.'' John Thompson, Georgetown's coach, said, ''I don't think Patrick can have success if it is a one-on-one game.'' The game will be played without either a shot clock or a 3-point circle although each team is in a conference that uses a shot clock this season. The Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia's league, also uses a 3-point circle. Georgetown is a member of the Big East Conference. Thus, familiar tactics may be employed if a coach so desires, such as stalling with a lead to prevent the opponent's big man from getting his hands on the ball. And the offense may be patient against zone defenses. But if each coach sticks to his pregame word that he must have his team do what it does best in any other game, it could be a fast-paced contest. Georgetown, ranked No.3 in the nation this week, will undoubtedly use the full-court press, one of Thompson's favorite tactics. Virginia, ranked No.1, will try to break that and get up court in a hurry to feed Sampson more easily. Other Players Important Ewing is rated highly for his defense and shot-blocking ability although he does not usually score as much as Sampson. The Virginia center has a magnificent light-touch hook shot that may be his answer to scoring over Ewing. And Sampson easily blocks inside shots by shorter men. The issue, however, may be settled by the supporting casts. The team that can get the ball inside to its big man or the team that can run the transition off the big man's rebounds better than the other might be the winner. Georgetown has a slight disadvantage because of inexperience. This is not the same team that lost to North Carolina, 63-62, in the final of the N.C.A.A. championship last March. Ewing is the only member of the starting lineup against Virginia who also started against North Carolina. Eric Floyd, the all-America guard; Eric Smith and Mike Hancock have been graduated. Fred Brown, the other starting guard against North Carolina and the one who made a crucial errant pass in the closing moments of the title game, is sidelined with a sore right knee. Ed Spriggs, the strong sixth man of the title game last March, has also been graduated. Georgetown a Younger Team Georgetown is now about the youngest team Thompson has had in his 11 seasons with the school. He will start three sophomores in the forecourt - Ewing, Bill Martin, and Anthony Jones - and two freshmen at guard - Michael Jackson and David Wingate. Martin and Jones played in the N.C.A.A. championship. Virginia, which lost by 2 points to Alabama-Birmingham in the Mideast regional semifinals of the N.C.A.A. tournament last March, is more experienced than Georgetown. And Wilson is probably the third-best player entering the game. The Cavaliers start two seniors and a sophomore up front - Sampson, Craig Robinson and Tim Mullen - and two juniors at guard - Wilson and Rick Carlisle. Carlisle is a transfer from Maine who sat out last season. Thompson said he was concerned about how his freshmen would handle themselves under such a spotlight of attention. But he said he was not worried, that the game was ''just a learning thing for them and me to see how they do.''

1406-> Merger Defense
To the Business Editor: In his article, ''The Vanity of the Takeover Game'' (Oct.3), William Nordhaus lumps the recent Bendix mess, ''conglomerate'' mergers and ''major'' mergers, together in one big counterproductive heap. Neglecting any and all benefits of mergers, he hastens toward his inevitable call for legal restrictions on mergers. Lest his indiscriminate analysis cast suspicion on mergers in general, we would like to set the merger record straight. Because there is no significant antitrust overlap in ''specific markets,'' Mr. Nordhaus reasons that the Bendix merger is a pure ''conglomerate'' merger. All pure conglomerate mergers fall outside antitrust overlap areas. But it does not follow that all mergers that fall outside such areas are pure conglomerate mergers. By making this argument, Mr. Nordhaus effectively ignores the thousands of mergers every year that neither achieve significant gain in market concentration nor fall within the pure conglomerate category. Indeed, both conglomeration and increased concentration - two extreme ends of the merger spectrum - have become virtually passe as acquisition strategies. In a 1980 study for the Federal Trade Commission, the research firm of Arthur D. Little polled merger decision makers and found 29 current merger synergies sought in addition to these two: new markets for present products, economies of scale, patents or contracts, skills to position for the future, and so on. Because the merger is a ''pure conglomerate'' type, Mr. Nordhaus said, it is devoid of synergy. Few of the recent major mergers could be called pure conglomerate acquisitions, but even those which have conglomerate characteristics sought to create synergy in some of the ways mentioned above. Because the Bendix merger lacks synergy, it must be relying on increased managerial efficiency (the ''dumbo theory''). But, he continues, increased managerial efficiency is not a usual merger outcome, because on the whole, conglomerate and major acquirer stocks drop following acquisitions (as indicated by the fictitious ''Vulture Fund''). Actually, increased managerial efficiency is itself a type of synergy - one of many. The relatively poor performance of acquisition-oriented stocks in comparison to the stock market averages does not in and of itself prove that this particular synergy among others was lacking. In fact the drop in Allied's stock was caused by the many tactical errors which led to a four-way battle, not by any lack of initial deal synergy. Since this and other such mergers possess neither managerial efficiency nor synergy, major mergers, Mr. Nordhaus concludes, are economically neutral or harmful, and should be restricted, preferably by mandatory stockholder approval. Mr. Nordhaus seems to equate Bendix and all major mergers with conglomerate mergers. As stated above, they are not the same. Indeed, because most major merger ideas are conceived with some synergistic purpose, they often appeal to major stockholders, who expect long-term increase as a result. Mr. Nordhaus' conclusion merits rebuttal in itself. Given the importance of timing in the merger arena, coupled with the complex structuring of corporate ownership today, the ''town meeting'' idea of assembling stockholders would seem most unwieldy. But before evaluating this solution, we need a far better definition of the problem than that advanced by Mr. Nordhaus. ALEXANDRA REED LAJOUX Editor Mergers and Acquisition Philadelphia, Oct.6, 1982

1408-> 'Monolithos'
To the Editor: I think it's unfortunate that what could have been a review of Jack Gilbert's book of poems ''Monolithos'' by Richard Tillinghast (Sept. 12) amounts to little more than a peevish, hasty dismissal. At the outset, the case is stacked against the book by the declaration: ''Mr. Gilbert has lived abroad for at least 20 years; his poems present him as a traveler, a loner, a pilgrim in the quest for Eros.'' Then, slighting the sketch he has just drawn, the reviewer concludes: ''As might be expected from this description, the poems too often simply report, stopping short of the work of transformation that turns an experience into a poem.'' Frankly, I don't see how ''As might be expected from this description,'' it follows that ''the poems too often simply report, stopping short of the work etc.'' In fact, it is the reviewer who stops short; for when he comes to give an example of what he considers to be ''The raw material - incidents and names of persons and places - is asked to do poetic duty,'' he quotes, out of context, only the first three lines of the last stanza from the poem titled ''All the Way From There to Here,'' choosing to omit what precedes and follows those three lines: v. hat I remember of my nine- story fall down through the great fir is the rush of green. And the softness of my regret in the ambulance going to my nearby death, looking out at the trees leaving me. What I remember of my crushed spine is seeing Linda faint again and again, sliding down the white X-ray room wall as my sweet body flailed on the steel table unable to manage the bulk of pain. That and waiting in the years after for the burning in my fingertips, which would announce, the doctors said, the beginning of paralysis. What I remember best of the four years of watching in Greece and Denmark and London and Greece is Linda making lunch. Her blondness and ivory coming up out of the blue Aegean. Linda walking with me daily across the island from Monoli- thos to Thira and back. That's what I remember most of death: the gentleness of us in that bare Greek Eden, the beauty as the marriage steadily failed. Finally, it seems to me to be stingy and unwarranted to ignore the strong qualities in Jack Gilbert's work: the richness of feeling, the exquisite tension sustained between passion and precision, the often beautiful, haunting phrasing in a music both stately and austere.

1409-> NETS MAY PURSUE RICHARDSON
As the Nets trimmed their roster to the 12-player maximum for Friday night's season opener by placing Mike O'Koren on the injured-reserve list today, talk persisted at practice about the possibility of adding Michael Ray Richardson to the team. O'Koren's right hip was bruised last Tuesday night in the Hall of Fame exhibition game at Springfield, Mass., and he must miss at least five games. Richardson, the former all-star for the Knicks, was traded to the Golden State Warriors for Bernard King last Friday, but Richardson said he will not report until the team agrees to renegotiate his contract. One day before the opener against the Chicago Bulls at Byrne Meadowlands Arena, some members of the Nets' front office remained concerned about the lack of a strong, muscular guard. Ray Williams provided that muscle last season, which is absent in the current guards - Phil Ford, Otis Birdsong, Darwin Cook, Eric Floyd and Foots Walker. Nets Deny Discussions Bob MacKinnon, the general manager of the Nets, denied that there had been any recent discussions between the Nets and the Warriors, but he did admit that the Nets had inquired about Richardson's status not long after he was obtained from the Knicks. ''From what I understand, the Warriors have been saying that he'll either play for them or for no one,'' MacKinnon said today. ''And as far as I know, they still mean it.'' When a front-office official, who did not wish to be identified, was asked why the Nets, with many talented guards, would consider acquiring Richardson, the official said: ''Because coaches are greedy about talent. No one is satisfied with what they have. It's like nuclear warheads.'' Another official expressed a wait-and-see attitude, preferring to gauge the current team by its success during the first weeks of the season before making another move. Extra Player Could Fit in Deal Coach Larry Brown's primary concern involving major trades has always been what his team will have to give up in order to complete the acquisition. It is unlikely that he would be willing to part with any members of the team's core - Buck Williams, Darryl Dawkins and Albert King -but the injury to O'Koren will provide time to consider any package deals that might also solve the Nets' problem of having 13 players when O'Koren returns. ''I don't know what they're going to do with him,'' Brown said, referring to the Warriors and Richardson. ''I have to talk to everybody here and determine what our options are. All I want is for Michael Ray to get straightened out. He's a great player and we need him in the league.'' O'Koren, who was being used as King's backup at small forward, suffered a contusion of the buttocks and sciatic nerve, according to Dr. Bruce Levy, the team physician. O'Koren received the injury during a collision with Joe Cooper, the backup center for the Los Angeles Lakers. Both players were going after a loose ball. Cooper is 6 feet 11 inches and weighs 230 pounds. O'Koren is 6-7 and 215. Eddie Phillps, a rookie, will assume O'Koren's duties. A player who is placed on the injured-reserved list is required to miss five games. The earliest O'Koren can return is Nov. 7, against the Boston Celtics. Until then, the Nets will try to find jobs for James Bailey or Foots Walker, one of whom will be excess when O'Koren returns. Brown Wants Stable Start ''All I want is for us to get settled,'' Brown said. ''It's nothing against these individual guys, but we're not allowed to carry 13 players. And I think we owe something to them to help them find a place to play.'' Despite their concerns, the Nets are far ahead of where they were at this juncture last season. They are stronger at center and on the bench, which were the two priorities during the offseason. But there is another pivotal difference in the team that finished with a 44-38 record and made the playoffs. It concerns confidence. ''At this time last year, we had a lot of injuries,'' said Birdsong. ''I was hurt. Albert was hurt. And we had so many new faces. On the outside we thought we could win, but deep down inside we didn't really know if we could compete and win. Now we know we can compete and play with anybody.''

1410-> 2 Watershed Vandals Get Year's Probation
Two 20-year-old Pequannock men were sentenced today to probation and community service for their parts in vandalism that caused $2 million in damage to Newark's water system in July 1981. The two, James Conn and Christopher Legiec, were sentenced by Judge Kenneth C. MacKenzie in Superior Court here three days after the conviction of a third man, Stephen Black, on charges of reckless criminal mischief and conspiracy in the case. Mr. Conn and Mr. Legiec pleaded guilty on Oct. 5 to disorderlypersons charges and testified against Mr. Black at his trial. Mr. Conn and Mr. Legiec were placed on one year's probation. Mr. Conn was ordered to spend 300 hours in community service at College Hospital of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark, pay $750 in restitution to Newark and $25 to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board, and to submit to alcoholism evaluation. Mr. Legiec was ordered to spend 400 hours in service at the hospital, to pay $1,000 to Newark and $25 to the compensation board, and to submit to alcoholism evaluation.

1411-> NOTES ON FASHION
THE outstanding presentation of the recently concluded American s pring collections seemed to be that of a Japanese designer who had a lready shown his collection in Paris and who had come here merely tom ake a guest appearance. The designer is Issey Miyake, who presented h is spring collection Thursday night and, in so doing, beat the A mericans at their own sportswear game - aboard, no less, the A merican aircraft carrier Intrepid. It was spectacle of the highest sort: the hull of the museum ship washed with coral light, 2,000 in attendance, klieg lights slicing the sky. For a change the late hour and the exotic setting were justified. Here was no second-rate talent presenting forgettable chiffons in a theater at 9 o'clock. No, here was a fully formed talent that showed enough ideas for 75 collections: oversize trench coats with large cuffs, some pullover in style; low-slung biege linen dresses that wrapped around the body, held in place with rope; leather gladiator sandals; voluminous knit dresses in fresh cottons; hand-squeezed linens jumping with pleats; fabrics dyed as many as five times for a dazzling depth of color; jackets with removable sleeves held in place with three buttons; rain helmets made of recycled egg cartons, and a group of unisex trousers, shirts and loose jackets in a group called Plantation. That was true craft and imagination at work. THE word ''revolutionary'' was used with such frequency during the s pring collections of the past two weeks that one was compelled to l ook for evidence of a real revolution of some sort. Or at least somen ews. But can the re-emergence of little tailored suits really be c alled revolutionary? Hardly. Indeed, looking back at the two weeks, only the collections of Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Bill Blass and Fernando Sanchez stand out as being as fully conceptualized and executed as Miyake's. While Mr. Klein's recently acquired Old World style may not be everyone's glass of Armagnac, he did discover the beat of fashion, and not a minute too late. Mr. Ellis did what he always does: he turned the sportswear concept on its head and scared everyone in the process. In a highly detailed collection in which exaggeration was key, his loose and easy doublebreasted linen trench coats were unforgettable, as were the long, flowing skirts, with oversize welts for hems, the sweaters with trompe l'oeil bracelets on the arms, and such details as oversize box pleats on the backs of jackets. True to form, Mr. Ellis created clothing that will most likely be appreciated six months from now. Blass simply went back to the sportswear he knows best. As for the trend to European fit, the surprise winner was Fernando Sanchez, who, with barely 30 pieces, showed that there is no substitute for expertise. There were no constricting jackets in this collection. No simply straight skirts. His clothing was molded, the straight skirts rounded, the jackets soft as unconstructed garments but immaculately fitted to the body, and finished as completely inside as out. While the spring collections are traditionally never terribly important in the fashion cycle, the Americans have not exhibited such disarray in recent memory. Perhaps that is necessary for a thrust in a new direction. AS if in celebration of Europe, New York's fashionable women gave dinners for designers from other c ountries: Tina Chow for Mr. Miyake, Arianna Stassinopoulos for J ean-Louis Orrier and Suzi Frankfurt for Gianni Versace. Mrs. Frankfurt's party, given at her town house, which she describes as Pompeii Coney Island, was diverting indeed. In one corner Tina and Michael Chow, Andre Talley and Fran Lebowitz sat talking about Miss Lebowitz's feet until Sisi Cahan of the Metropolitan Museum sat down and changed the subject. ''We want your doors,'' she said to Mr. Chow, meaning the lalique doors of his restaurant, Mr. Chow. ''They'd be just perfect in the museum.'' Mr. Chow only raised an eyebrow in response but, of all that was suggested over the past two weeks, Mrs. Cahan's idea seemed to make more sense than anything else. John Duka

1413-> ABSENCE OF BLACKS ON JURY IS UPHELD
A sharply divided Court of Appeals has ruled that a black defendant could not contend that he had been denied a fair trial because the prosecution in the case had excluded all black and Hispanic people from the jury that convicted him. In a 4-to-3 opinion, New York's highest court upheld a longstanding rule that prosecutors and defense attorneys are entitled to a certain number of peremptory challenges, which can be used to exclude jurors without explanation. The ruling affirmed an earlier decision in the Appellate Division. The court held last week that a case of discrimination could be made only if it could be shown that prosecutors had systematically excluded particular classes of jurors over a period of time. The appeal was brought by Michael McCray, a black man convicted of robbing a Pratt Institute student in Brooklyn in November 1978. Mr. McCray contended that during jury selection, prosecutors from the Brooklyn District Attorney's office used eight peremptory challenges to exclude all seven black people and one Hispanic person who had been drawn as prospective jurors. During Gold's Tenure The McCray prosecution occurred while Eugene Gold was District Attorney. His successor, Elizabeth Holtzman, took over the case when it reached the Court of Appeals and argued that no systematic exclusion of jurors had taken place in the case. Miss Holtzman has issued a directive to her staff that prohibits the use of peremptory challenges on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin. Miss Holtzman said she was pleased to have won the case but disappointed that the court had declined to prohibit the use of peremptory challenges in particular cases. She said Mr. Gold's office had barred the potential jurors for reasons other than race and she pointed out that three white potential jurors had been dismissed. ''The notion that jurors will be automatically unfair in cases involving defendants of the same race, sex or religion is simply wrong,'' she said in a statement. ''It is also wrong to try to fight prejudice on the part of jurors with prejudice on the part of lawyers.'' The majority opinion, written by Judge Domenick Gabrielli, was based primarily on a 1965 United States Supreme Court case that held that a prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges cannot be scrutinized simply because of defense claims that the jurors are being struck on the basis of their race. Since that time, state courts in California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Louisiana and Illinois have held that excluding jurors in this manner violates a defendant's right to a trial by jury under their own state constitutions. Judge Bernard S. Meyer, along with Judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg and Judge Hugh R. Jones, dissented in the McCray case. Sixth Amendment Guarantee ''In my view,'' Judge Meyer wrote, ''the use by a prosecutor of peremptory challenges systematically and without apparent reason to exclude all blacks on the panel from the jury before which is to be tried a black defendant charged with robbing a white victim violates the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a fair trial by an impartial jury.'' To hold otherwise, he said, ''is to sanction under the guise of fairness or tradition, or both, deliberate discrimination by a state official.'' In the majority opinion, Judge Gabrielli wrote that the Federal and State Constitutions required only that the jury pool be selected from a cross section of the community. Once that pool is constituted, he said, individual jurors can be excused either for admitted bias - in court parlance, ''for cause'' - or, in a certain number of instances, for no reason at all. Under New York law, each side is given 15 such peremptory challenges. Peremptory challenges, he wrote, permit ''an experienced attorney to eliminate a juror who he believes might be biased against his case in instances where the potential bias cannot be disclosed or articulated to the degree necessary to establish a challenge for cause.'' Possibility of Delays It would defeat this purpose, Judge Gabrielli wrote, to require, as Mr. McCray sought, that prosecutors must explain their use of peremptory challenges where there is evidence of racial motivation. It would also, the judge maintained, ''invite delays at trial which our justice system can ill afford.'' In his dissent, Judge Meyer contended that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees defendants a jury ''representative of a cross section of the community.'' ''The fair cross section-impartiality requirement is meaningless if in any case involving a defendant of a given race the prosecutor can intentionally and systematically exclude all members of that race without cause,'' he wrote. ''Peremptory challenges are intended to permit elimination from the jury of persons whose bias is suspect and cannot be proven. But that does not provide carte blanche to exclude all blacks for that reason alone.'' Judge Meyer said the majority's fears of administrative difficulties were ''exaggerated.'' Under the policy followed by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, a party said to have used peremptory challenges to strike jurors on the basis of race would be asked to offer the court a ''plausible'' alternative explanation for his actions. Miss Holtzman said this policy would be continued. Judge Gabrielli was joined in his opinion by Judges Sol Wachtler and Matthew J. Jasen. Chief Judge Lawrence H. Cooke filed a separate concurring opinion.

1414-> GULF FIGHT: 2 QUESTIONS ABOUT IRAQ; Military Analysis
Since Iraq's forces are well organized and trained, deploy thousands of tanks, guns and missiles and are superior in the air, why are they not winning the war with Iran? Why are Iraq's frontiers threatened by an Iranian army that includes thousands of untrained boys and whose air support is negligible? These questions arise after 10 days of discussions with foreign diplomats here and of carefully supervised visits to various fronts, all inactive or nearly so. Some answers can be found in parts of the military situation. Since Iraqi troops retreated from Iranian territory in the southern oil-producing province of Khuzistan earlier this year, the army and its leaders have emphasized a defensive strategy. One consequence is that field commanders concentrate on what they will do when the Iranians attack. Rapid response in the form of a major counterattack to take advantage of any setback to the enemy appears to receive little attention. Stalemate Seems to Be Sought Another consequence is that every position is developed for defense. Little or no time appears to be devoted to planning and training for the offensive. The Iraqis' priority appears to be the achievement of a stalemate. Their hope appears to be that the stalemate will be broken by the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian revolutionary leader, who is 82 years old. Western military attaches and diplomats in Baghdad say they believe they have discovered another answer to the two questions. In words that are measured and diplomatic, they convey the idea that neither the Iraqi Army nor Air Force appears to have much stomach for offensive operations. The infantry is said to be sluggish in attack or, instead of atttacking, to wait too long and too often for the application of overwhelming artillery firepower on small enemy units. The result, one seasoned soldier said, is that the Iranians have time either to reinforce or to withdraw with light losses. Yet the Iraqi infantry and, indeed, all the ground forces are clearly well trained and well led. Their basic equipment is Soviet, simple and abundant. The army's heavy weapons, including the Soviet T-72 tanks now being deployed on the central front, are well kept, and the supply and maintenance services appear adequate. The Iraqi Army's slow reaction time, some analysts say, may also be caused by the strain that large operations have placed on a rather rudimentary command, communications and control system. Air Force Is a Mystery Another mystery is the inffectiveness of an air force that now outnumbers the Iranians in combat aircraft by anywhere from 4-to-1 to 6-to-1. Unless the air force is being restrained by some undisclosed high-level directive, there appears to be no reason for its comparative inactivity in both tactical and strategic roles. The daily communiques seldom mention air activity over the front. One source said he thought this was because Iraqi pilots respect, perhaps too highly, the accuracy and determination of Iranian air defense guns and missiles. Iraqi political leaders complain that Iran is obtaining cash to continue the war by selling oil. Analysts here agree that they have a remedy at hand in the Soviet MIG's and French Mirages of the Iraqi Air Force. The daily communiques seem to contribute to the Iraqi lethargy by exaggerating minor gains. The effectiveness of the army may also be limited by the frequent visits of President Saddam Hussein to various fronts. While the President has no known military experience, he is said to advise local commanders on tactics or propose changes in general strategy. The Iraqi Army and Air Force are silent, but political explanations for the military stagnation abound. Iraq, it is said, is back defending its own territory because it seeks no territorial gains. The enemy, it is said, is benefiting from military shipments from powers ranging from the Soviet Union to Portugal, with the United States turning a blind eye to American transfers by private enterprise.

1415-> News Summary; SATURDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1982
International A change in Soviet intelligence chiefs appeared to be linked to moves by Yuri V. Andropov, the new Communist Party leader, to step up a Kremlin campaign against corruption and crime, two major reponsibilities of the Internal Affairs Ministry. Vitaly V. Fedorchuk, who had been head of the K.G.B. security and intelligence organization for the last seven months, was appointed Internal Affairs Minister. He was succeeded at the K.G.B. by one of his top deputies, Viktor M. Chebrikov. (Page 1, Columns 3-4.) A further drop in oil prices is a possibility in 1983, industry experts say, as the OPEC ministers gather in Vienna to discuss how to reverse the recent decline. Predictions of a continuing fall below OPEC's basic $34 a barrel price have raised fears that a decline could so reduce revenues for such exporting countries as Mexico and Nigeria by so much that they could not repay their foreign debts, placing the strained international banking system under further stress. (1:1-2.) Lech Walesa will continue to fight for his outlawed trade union Solidarity, ''but only by peaceful means,'' he told foreign journalists after his detention Thursday, which prevented him from addressing a rally in Gdansk. (7:1-3.) Three men who are wanted in Italy in connection with the shooting of the Pope were presented by Bulgarian authorities at a news conference in Sofia. All three denied any involvement in the attack. Bulgaria's prosecutor general invited an Italian magistrate to come to Sofia to question the three men. (10:3-6.) Allegations of a Bulgarian connection in the attempted assassination of the Pope last year were treated skeptically by Israeli and West German intelligence and security sources. Intelligence agencies in both countries, however, regard Bulgaria and other Soviet bloc countries, as important links in a terrorist network. (10:3-6.) National In further debate on MX missiles, the Senate adopted a compromise endorsed by President Reagan that would give him the money to purchase the missiles, but prevent him from spending it until Congress approved. The Senate also accepted the President's stipulation that would force Congress to forgo a prolonged debate and vote on the missile system this spring. (1:1.) Anne M. Gorsuch's citation of contempt of Congress is being fought by the Reagan Administration. The House cited Mrs. Gorsuch, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, for refusing, at President Reagan's direction, to turn over subpoenaed documents about her agency's efforts to enforce a law requiring the cleanup of hazardous waste dumps. Leaders of the House warned that the Administration was advocating obstruction of justice and setting the stage for a constitutional crisis. An Assistant Attorney General said the Justice Department filed a suit challenging the House directive. (1:5.) Crime in the Sun Belt has begun to rival the North in the level of sophistication. Drug trafficking, organized car theft, prostitution, pornography rings and complex fraud and money-laundering operations are among the growing number of criminal activities that confront law enforcement officials in the South. (1:3-5.) Chrysler employees ratified, by a 79.5 percent margin, a contract that will give them a pay increase and restore cost-of-living increases, providing more than $2,200 to each worker in its 11-month term. Chrysler's Canadian employees approved a similar agreement by a 90 percent margin Sunday, ending a five-week strike. (12:1-2.) Fallout from nuclear weapons tests in Utah contributed to a high incidence of cancer deaths and illnesses, attorneys for a group of residents who lived near the testing grounds concluded in closing arguments in Salt Lake City's Federal District Court. In rebuttal, a Justice Department lawyer said that defense attorneys had produced some ''inspiring rhetoric'' but little hard evidence that the atomic testing had resulted in death and illness. (12:1-3.) Metropolitan Plans to lay off 3,300 city workers to compensate for $300 million in state aid that may not be forthcoming, were announced by Mayor Koch. His administraiton will also not fill about 5,300 job openings expected in the next 18 months. Officials said that several thousand additional layoffs were likely, and could affect the Board of Education and the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Layoff notices are scheduled to be sent out in April, with dismissals effective in June. (1:6.) The Indian Point emergency plans were ''not feasible'' because of two ''significant deficiencies,'' according to the Federal agency charged with evaluating preparedness for an accident at the Indian Point Nuclear Power Station. (29:6.) Ridership on buses and subways would drop by 6 percent, or 63 million people a year, if the fare is increased to $1, according to John D. Simpson, president of the New York City Transit Authority. The $1 fare is expected if there is no new Federal or state aid by early next week. (30:1-2.) Efforts to extend tax abatement for certain New York City housing renovations collapsed in the Legislature. The Koch administration, which is seeking the extension, and critics of the abatement program, known as J-51, could not overcome major differences to reach a compromise.Both sides said they still hoped to get the measure passed in this legislative session.

1416-> NEW FEDERAL RULE ON FOOD ADVERTISING IS REJECTED
As a result of a tie vote today, the Federal Trade Commission will not issue regulations restricting advertising claims about low-calorie, low-cholesterol, low-fat and ''natural'' foods. The regulations would have restricted the use of the word ''natural'' to products that are minimally processed and contain no artificial ingredients unless the advertiser disclosed the limited addition of artificial ingredients or extra processing. The rule would have required disclosure of the number of calories in ''low-calorie'' or ''high-energy'' foods and would have required disclosure of information about fat content if assertions about fat or cholesterol were made. Ostensibly, the commission met today to review a final staff draft of the rule, which the commission approved in principle in 1980. But when the Reagan Administration took office, the philosophy of the Federal regulatory agency that polices the marketplace changed. Staff Reversed Recommendation The new staff reconsidered the food advertising rule and recommended that it not be issued. The staff said that there was insufficient evidence that deception in food advertising was a widespread problem and that it would be more effective to work on individual cases of deceptive advertising. The commission chairman, James C. Miller 3d, and David Clanton, a Repubican commissioner, voted not to issue the rule. Mr. Clanton, who voted for the rule in 1980, explained his reversal by saying, ''The broadly based rule may not go as far as we would go in individual cases and may provide information that is not all that meaningful to consumers.'' Patricia P. Bailey, a Republican, and Michael Pertschuk, a Democrat, voted to issue the rule. As a result of the commission's decision, Mr. Pertschuk said, ''We can anticipate more ads like the ones for avocados which healthfully proclaim 'no cholesterol,' even though avovados are high in fat. Or claims for cooking oils 'high in polyunsaturates' that reach creative heights to avoid discussing the fact that polyunsaturates are still 100 percent fat.'' ''Advertisers,'' he continued, ''will continue to spend fortunes to promote high-fat foods as healthful, highly processed foods as natural, and high-caloric foods as dietetic or as miracle energy tonic.''

The exchange offer will be contingent on the tender of 60 percent of the McDermott common stock.

1419-> OWNERS, PLAYERS STAND FAST
With both sides continuing to cling publicly to positions that have been largely unchanged through eight months of intermittent bargaining and a five-week-old player strike, the pro football talks are set to resume in New York tomorrow after a one-week break. Representatives of each side contended privately yesterday that the other was ready to make concessions. But the National Football League Management Council, the bargaining arm for the owners, insisted that it was prepared to submit only its earlier proposals, and the stance of the N.F.L. Players Association was much the same. There has been tentative agreement on only a few issues, mostly on medical rights of players, none on money, since the talks began last February. And the closest that anyone came yesterday to indicating that there might be some movement was a remark by Jack Donlan, the Management Council's executive director, after he had met in Washington with William Lubbers, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board. ''Hopefully,'' Mr. Donlan said of the union's negotiators, ''they can see their way clear to make some kind of adjustments, which would allow us to make some kind of adjustments.'' Mr. Donlan's meeting with Mr. Lubbers was reported to have dealt in part with whether the general counsel would seek authority from the full, five-member N.L.R.B. to ask a Federal court for an injunction that would force the owners to bargain with the union over its demand for a wage scale. The meeting followed by a day the issuance of a complaint against the league by the board's regional office in New York, which charged management with refusing to bargain in good faith. A hearing on the complaint before an administrative law judge is scheduled for Nov. 15, although it may never take place if the board finds that the two sides are making progress by then. Explaining the Other Side Mr. Donlan took several lawyers to his meeting with Mr. Lubbers, including Betty Murphy, a former N.L.R.B. chairman who has been retained by management for dealings with the board. Mrs. Murphy was also an adviser to the major league baseball owners last year when they were confronted by a player strike. ''The meeting,'' Mr. Donlan said afterward, ''was to give us an opportunity to give our side of the story concerning the complaint. I think Mr. Lubbers learned a lot of things he didn't know.'' But, at least from the football fans' point of view, the more important meeting is tomorrow, and Jim Miller, a spokesman for the Management Council, said that the package that the owners have already placed on the table would be placed there once again: $1.6 billion over the term of a five-year collective bargaining agreement. Major features of this offer are $10,000 in bonuses to each current player for every year he was in the league from 1977 through 1982; $10,000 a year in severance pay for each year played from 1983 through 1986, and a revision of the free-agent system to make it easier for a player to change teams. At the same time, Dick Berthelsen, a lawyer for the players association, contended that the union's five major points would be set forth again: immediate and substantial wage increases; protection for older players against being cut for financial reasons; performance bonuses; elimination of wage inequities, and a guaranteed share of future television revenues. All this has translated into the major issue in the talks: the union's demand for a wage scale and a central fund from which salaries would be paid. Owners Discussed 17 Ideas There were also reports yesterday that various team owners had recommended alternatives to management's position, but none of them seemed to have had much success. Chuck Sullivan, the chairman of the Management Council's executive committee, said that the council had discussed a total of 17 proposals submitted by various owners during the eight months since the talks began. Two recent proposals came from Al Davis, the managing general partner of the Los Angeles Raiders, an owner with whom league headquarters has frequently been at odds. ''Al Davis's plans have been rejected totally,'' said Jim Kensil, a member of the Management Council's executive committee and the president of the Jets. Mr. Davis refused comment yesterday on the proposals, but sources close to him said that among them had been career adjustment pay, upon retirement, of from $10,000 to $60,000 a player, depending on length of service; a doubling of player pensions, and incentive bonuses for players on a team finishing second or third within a division.

1420-> SCOUTING; Football Job Hunt
That was a strange scene at Giants Stadium over the weekend: no football game because of the strike, but a field packed with football players. They were there by invitation of the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League, which opens its first season next March, and they were trying out for jobs. The Generals called the mass workout because they had been bombarded by letters and phone calls. Everybody wanted to become a pro football player, or knew somebody who did. So, Coach Chuck Fairbanks scheduled the tryout camp to test the candidates on speed and agility: 125 showed up on Saturday, 325 on Sunday and 16 were invited back for another look. ''When I was coaching the New England Patriots,'' Fairbanks said, ''I can remember only one guy who got a job from a tryout, and he was a kicker, John Smith.'' ''To work, it has to be your day,'' said Rick Buffington, a scout. ''You have to be in the right place at the right time.''

1424-> E.P.A.'s Chief Is Cited For Contempt by Panel
A House subcommittee voted today to cite Anne M. Gorsuch, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, for contempt of Congress for witholding documents on President Reagan's orders. The 9-to-2 vote by the House Public Works investigations subcommittee came after Mrs. Gorsuch invoked executive privilege in withholding the documents dealing with E.P.A.'s program to clean up toxic wastes. The subcommittee had subpoenaed an estimated 787,000 items to examine how the agency manages the $1.6 billion cleanup program. Mrs. Gorsuch, appearing before the panel in response to the subpoena, said the ''vast majority'' of documents would be shipped to the subcommittee, But she said that ''sensitive documents found in open law enforcement files'' would be withheld on the President's orders. The subcommittee said it could not permit the Administration to make a unilateral decision on what was appropriate for Congress to review. Mrs. Gorsuch said after the vote: ''I don't think the majority of the members were interested in the information. I think they were interested in making an issue.'' The contempt citation against Mrs. Gorsuch now goes to the full Public Works Committee. If approved there, it would be up to the full House to act.

1425-> PLAYERS; A ROOKIE FINDS NO PLACE TO GO
Willie Sydnor has decided that it is time to go out into the real world and look for work. Like many others in the college class of 1982, he is not expecting to find a job that relates to his major in psychology. He cannot be so choosy. ''Odds and ends,'' he said. ''Anything. I don't know what I'm doing. I have no idea.'' Unlike most members of the class of 1982, however, Sydnor has long been accustomed to changing direction because of circumstances beyond his control. In the last seven autumns, he has worn five different football uniforms. He is 23 years old, with no promises for next autumn. More than seven weeks ago, on the second Sunday of the National Football League season, Sydnor was a rookie wide receiver and special-teams player with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He thought he had found a place to learn and to develop his talents. He had thought the same thing as a freshman at Northwestern University, and as a sophomore at Villanova, and as a senior at Syracuse. Five times in six years, Sydnor has been in the position of having to look for another football team in a new place. He can still laugh at his never-ending search, and that he may lead the N.F.L. in invitations to homecoming weekend parties. But there are other, more sobering facts. Two days after his pro debut, he was on strike. His chances of earning another Steeler paycheck in the near future seem less likely with each day. There are car payments to make immediately, and plans for a wedding have had to be put off. ''That's definitely postponed,'' he said. ''I have to be financially fit before that happens.'' He can still list his occupation as professional football player, although it has not been too lucrative. ''A game check and a couple of bonuses don't last too long if you don't have any other income,'' he said. He was cut near the end of training camp, after having signed with Pittsburgh as a free agent, but a series of injuries to veterans quickly created a need for the team and a job for a rookie. Sydnor was a Steeler for four days. ''And fifty-something days off,'' he said. It has been an unpaid vacation. ''That is the problem,'' he said. The rookie has been caught in the strike. While his friends at home look at their paychecks and wonder if the players' demands are unreasonable, Sydnor has moved back to his parents' home in Rosemont, Pa., outside Philadelphia, to save money. ''It's weird when you read something about what the players want,'' he said. ''And then, if someone comes up to me, they say: 'Don't you think that's a lot? We make $20,000, or $16,000.' It's hard to explain. You always get a lot of questions that are very hard to answer.'' His odyssey began in 1977, as a senior at Radnor (Pa.) High School, when he chose to enroll at Northwestern. The coach was replaced at the end of his freshman season, and while the old staff had allowed him to play football and run for the track team, the new staff was not bound to that agreement. ''I was being pressured not to run track,'' he said. ''I had been promised I could do both.'' So he transferred to Villanova, where his father had been a worldclass sprinter in the mid-1950's. Sydnor competed in both sports. He joked that his job on Villanova's championship distance-medley relay team was just to stay close enough for Sydney Maree to make up the difference. But in April 1981, in the middle of the night in the spring of his junior year, the news broke that football was being dropped. He called home at 7 o'clock that morning to tell his mother he would have to leave Villanova if he wanted to play pro football. The phone calls from recruiters began that night. Within four days, he had heard from more than a dozen schools. Within a week, recruiters were milling around the Villanova fieldhouse, handing out brochures and studying films. A teammate that day called the scene a going-out-of-business sale. ''A madhouse,'' Sydnor remembered. Again he moved on. There was a new coach at Syracuse. Sydnor had a chance to play and complete his degree requirements within a year. He caught 29 passes last fall for 418 yards and two touchdowns, and he was graduated last spring. He shopped around before signing with the Steelers, and after having been cut near the end of camp, he was considering the Canadian Football League and the United States Football League when the Steelers called him back. Now, who knows? Ironically, the 1974 strike gave nonstriking rookies an opportunity when veterans stayed out of training camps. This strike may cost rookies a chance to develop before a new group competes for their jobs next year. ''It will be just starting over when I go back, if there's no season this year.'' Sydnor said. He laughed and added, ''I don't even know if I'll still be considered a rookie or not. I hope not.'' His hope is based on economic reasons and simpler issues. ''Not being hassled for being a rookie,'' the rookie said.

1431-> TAX BENEFIT CARRIES CHRYSLER TO A PROFIT
The Chrysler Corporation, as expected, reported today that it earned a small profit of $9.4 million, or 3 cents a share, in the third quarter, giving it three consecutive profitable quarters for the first time since 1977. However, the No. 3 auto maker had an operating loss of $11.3 million in the period; and its earnings were generated by an extraordinary tax loss carryforward of $20.7 million. A company spokesman, Baron K. Bates, said the operating loss was the result of the effect of the devaluation of the peso on the company's Mexican operations, an important Chrysler market. He said Chrysler had operating earnings in the United States in exess of $20 million, but would not specify the exact amount. The company's tax payment of $21.3 million, however, suggests domestic earnings of about $45 million. The earnings report came just two days after union workers at Chrysler voted against striking for an immediate pay increase, and to resume negotiations on a new contract after the beginning of next year. Chrysler has said it cannot afford a pay increase unless it is tied to profitability. Profit-Sharing Payment Foregone Under the terms of the tentative contract reached in September, but rejected by the membership of the United Automobile Workers Union earlier this month, workers would have received a pay increase out of the third quarter profit, since payments were to have been based on profits in the United States. The contract had called for $4 million, or about $85 per worker, to be distributed among union members when a quarterly profit was between $20 million and $50 million. Analysts had been predicting that Chrysler would be close to the break-even level for the quarter, traditionally the weakest for automobile companies because of the costs of new model introduction. The General Motors Corporation earlier this week reported a quarterly profit of $129.4 million, which came mainly on nonautomotive operations, while the Ford Motor Company reported a loss of $325.4 million. The American Motors Corporation, the smallest domestic auto maker, has yet to report. Sales Rise to $2.46 Billion Chrysler's small profit, which came on sales of $2.46 billion, compares to a loss of $140.1 million on sales of $2.31 billion in the third quarter of last year. It was the company's first third-quarter profit since it earned $33.7 million in 1977. In a statement accompanying the report, the chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, said, ''Chrysler has now earned $266.2 million during the first nine months of 1982. In the process, the company has generated substantial momentum, and has earned the growing confidence of customers, lenders and the general public.'' The company was on the verge of bankruptcy between 1979 and 1981, and survived only with the aid of its lenders, suppliers, workers and various governments. The money and givebacks it received will have to be repaid in coming years. Mr. Iacocca also said the company had increased its share of the United States passenger-car market during the quarter to 10.3 percent, from 9.5 percent in the third quarter of 1981, and its truck-market share to 9.7 percent, from 7.4 percent. Nevertheless, the weak market for cars in the United States saw total car sales in this country decline to 196,082 units in the quarter, from 208,125 a year earlier. Worldwide Sales Lower Chrylser's worldwide unit sales in the quarter declined 2.3 percent, to 284,601, from 291,403. For the nine months, Chrysler said, worldwide sales rose to $7.8 billion, from $7.4 billion, although unit sales dipped to 926,152, from 981,938. Chrysler also reported that it paid $119.1 million to repurchase the properties formerly owned by the Chrysler Realty Corporation. The properties, largely car dealerships and parts facilities, had been sold to ABKO Realty in October 1979 for $195 million. A Chrysler spokesman said the company was buying back only about 330 of the 800 properties that had formerly been in Chrysler Realty.

1432-> NATIONAL COUNCIL OF CHURCHES FACES NEW TYPE OF CRITIC
The National Council of Churches has taken extraordinary steps to counter magazine and broadcast reports that its leaders say have unfairly linked the group to leftist political and social programs. The nation's largest ecumenical organization, long a favorite target of the religious and political right, also faces new criticism from another front: a small but well-organized coalition of theologians and others who consider themselves political centrists. These new critics say they feel that statements by the council on social issues show a lack of appreciation for American democracy. Some of the criticism echoes earlier allegations that national church organizations have adopted a thoroughgoing leftist political stance and abandoned the Bible as the authority for Christian life. But while these charges came from the religious and political right, the new attacks come from people who disavow connections with extremist views. Officials of the National Council of Churches, including its president, James Armstrong, a United Methodist Bishop, say they are taking the critiques seriously, but they are angry at how the organization is portrayed. They say the articles and broadcast interviews characterize the council as more interested in Marxist political theory than in preaching the Gospel. Described as Myths Before this week's meeting of the council's 180-member governing board, the organization of 32 Protestant and Orthodox church bodies issued a special issue of its tabloid newspaper in an effort to dispel what it calls myths about the agency that have resurfaced in recent months. The council's office of news and information has also distributed a background memorandum telling supporters how to respond to criticisms that appeared in a Reader's Digest article on the World Council of Churches and a recent television program of the Public Broadcasting System. Heads of several denominations who are members of the world council wrote to their members in July to repudiate the information in the Reader's Digest article. Church leaders also expect a forthcoming article in Reader's Digest to be unfavorable to the National Council of Churches and have written the magazine to complain about the writer, Rael Jean Isaac, and how research for the article was handled. A spokesman for Reader's Digest said this week that the magazine believed the article on the world council ''had been carefully researched.'' Charles Pintchman, deputy director of corporate affairs for the magazine, said he was unaware of the letter about the forthcoming magazine article. Bishop Armstrong appeared on ''Firing Line,'' a widely syndicated PBS program, where William F. Buckley Jr., the host, chastised him for the council's opposition to the Vietnam War and its current views on nuclear disarmament. The CBS News television program ''60 Minutes'' is preparing a segment on the national council that church officials expect to be critical of their activities. In an interview taped for the program, Bishop Armstrong is asked to explain church involvement in aid to liberation movements in Africa. In a pastoral letter, Bishop Armstrong said his interview with Morley Safer, a CBS News reporter, was ''disturbing'' because questions put to him seemed like ''judgmental editorial sentences.'' The Indiana Bishop said, ''It appears to me that the thrust of the program has been determined before the cameras did their selective work at the North Indiana conference or before Mr. Safer came to our home.'' A spokesman for CBS News, Ari Marabel said it was the network's policy not to comment on programs in preparation. Focus of New Criticism Much of the increased criticism of the council comes from the Institute for Religion and Democracy, headed by the Rev. Ed Robb, a United Methodist evangelist who has been a frequent critic of his own denomination and its involvement in the council. The institute, based in Washington, has only about 800 members, but it has collected more than $350,000 in grants from foundations and individuals to pursue its critique of liberal religion. Mr. Robb says CBS News consulted him in preparing the segment to be broadcast on ''60 Minutes'' later this year. ''We are a threat to the N.C.C. because we are a centrist organization, and they are not accustomed to having criticism from people of this background,'' Mr. Robb asserted. He said liberal church leaders showed a ''lack of appreciation for democratic values.'' Council officials discount the impact of the institute and similar groups, but at least one public debate was held last year between council supporters and institute members. ''I don't think the critiques have had much direct effect on us,'' said Dr. Arie Brouwer, a member of the council's governing board, who is general secretary of the Reformed Church in America. But Dr. Brouwer said, ''The sentiments they represent may be becoming more visible among our people.'' He said he perceived a ''more cautious approach to social concerns, along with a certain turning away from them in order to focus more on spiritual matters.''

1433-> A BAN ON KEROSENE HEATERS URGED BY SOME FIRE OFFICIALS
Fire officials from 17 communities, including some from Albany and Washington, contend that the sale and use of portable kerosene heaters should be banned. Despite contentions by the kerosene-heater industry that the devices are safe, the storage of the combustible liquid in the home and the hazardous pollutants that are emitted by the heaters pose a serious threat to users, the officials said. The officials said at a news conference this week that although statistics on the number of injuries and fatalities connected with the heaters were still very sketchy, they feared that the numbers would skyrocket as the machines grew older and people misused them. The group's concern was prompted by the burgeoning sales of the devices, which use kerosene as fuel. Official Cites 'Media Blitz' ''There are millions and millions of them in use already, and there is a multimillion-dollar media blitz trying to get more people to buy them,'' said State Senator John P. Caufield, who is also Fire Director for this city. ''While some of the heaters that are on the market today are safer than in the past, they are inherently hazardous. By introducing a combustible liquid into the home, they are resuscitating an old enemy, one we thought was dead.'' He said he would introduce legislation in Trenton to ban the sale of the devices in the state. They are already banned in many places, including Newark and New York City, but are available a short distance from these communities. Sgt. Carl Jardine of the District of Columbia Fire Department said that despite a ban on the sale and use of the heaters in Washington, a number of fires had recently been attributed to the devices. 18 Fires in Philadephia Capt. Harold Walsh of the Philadelphia Fire Department said that in the 1940's and 50's there were ''a lot of deaths, a lot of injuries and a lot of fires,'' and that fire departments across the country got together to ban the heaters. He said that during the 1981 heating season, when there was a resurgence in the use of the heaters, there were 18 fires in Philadelphia in which kerosene heaters were involved. ''So far this year, we have already had 18 kerosene-related fires in the City of Philadelphia,'' Captain Walsh said. He added that although there had not been any fatalities this year, there had been a 40 percent increase in the number of children treated at hospitals for burns resulting from contact with a heater. Officials of Kero-Sun, one of the major marketers of portable kerosene heaters in the country, said that the machines sold today were far safer than those on which the fire officials had based their opinions. ''I feel they are very safe,'' said Robert K. Adikes, a senior vice president and general counsel of the company in Kent, Conn. ''I have four or five that I use in my own home. They have a lot of safety features that the models sold 30 years ago didn't.'' 5 Million Newer Units Mr. Adikes said that the newer units shut off automatically if they were jarred and that they had a very low center of gravity, so that they could not be tipped over easily. He said that the newer units - about five million are in use in the United States - also had battery-powered ignition systems and had been tested and approved by the Underwriters Laboratory. He added that the units had been widely used in Japan for the last 25 years and that their safety record was ''very, very good.'' Mr. Adikes said that statistics showed that in the United States during 1980, there were 600 fires connected with the use of liquidfuel heaters and 112,000 fires from solid-fuel heaters, such as woodand coal-burning stoves. He added that seven of nine states, including New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Ohio and Maryland, that prohibited the use of kerosene heaters had in the last two years changed their laws. Only Massachusetts and California still ban the heaters, he said.

1434-> OLDER WOMEN AND MALE MYTHS
Male fantasies about women over the age of 40 can be harmful to women's self-image, according to a Manhattan psychotherapist who has devoted a good part of her career to studying the so-called older woman. The myths, according to Dr. Rita M. Ransohoff, include the notion that an older woman is sexually voracious; that she loses interest in nurturing and becomes a "battle-ax": that she is not able to please her husband sexually after she has had children, and that, after menopause, she is so longer worthy of the reverence she received when she was capable of giving birth. "These are images many middleaged women have internalized, with profound effects on their self-esteem," Dr. Ransohoff said last week at a session entitled "Women and Work," the fourth annual Women in Crisis conference, which drew 550 people to the Sheraton Center for three days. Old Cultural Attitudes Dr. Ransohoff, who was the main speaker in a panel discussion called "Venus After 40," apologized to her largely female audience for "the unpleasant things, the cultural attitudes, you are about to see and hear." Saying many were rooted in classical literature, she referred to the Furies, the avengers of murder in Greek tragedy; to Demeter, who, disguised as an old witch, caused the crops to wither and brought famine to the land, and to the Wicked Witch of the West in "The Wizard of Oz." Such negative views of older women continue in current literature, Dr. Ransohoff said. She read a passage from Joseph Heller's novel "Something Happened": "She'd be older than I am now and probably a pest; she would be stout and wrinkled and suffer from constipation, gallstones, menopausal disturbances and bunioned feet, and I, more than likely, would not wish to see her." Dr. Ranshohoff said that the "old bag" images were compounded in contemporary cartoons and jokes, of which, she said, many more are about older women than older men. She included several of the cartoons in a slide show, most of which showed middle-aged and older women as fat, unattractive and domineering. "After menopause," she added, "there is no distinction in male fantasy between a middle-aged woman and an old woman." An Unpleasant Reminder Dr. Ransohoff, who is an adjunct assistant professor at the New York University School of Social Work and a faculty member and supervisor at the New York School for Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, said that one reason many men held negative attitudes about the older woman was that she reminds them that their own sexual powers may be diminishing and she makes them think about their mortality. "In male fantasies," Dr. Ransohoff said, "a man never loses his power as a man and he has the power to impregnate forever." She said that men in their 40's and 50's, unlike most women of that age, were considered to be attractive and desirable human beings and that such men as Casals and Picasso were thought of that way even into their 80's and 90's. In a discussion period a woman in her mid-40's told of feeling invisible because of her age. "Men don't look at me on the street anymore." she said, "and I don't even let my gray hair show. My contemporaries want a much younger woman, and the younger men don't want me either." Several other women said they were currently dating younger men. One of these women, a 43-year-old city employee, said she was seeing a younger man "because he's more open, more in touch with his feelings and less trapped in his attitudes" than were men her age. Discussing the experience of aging, Donna Smith, a middle-aged social worker from Boulder, Colo., described the burst of energy she felt after her menopause. "I can do twice as much as I used to do," she said."It's so much different from the old mythic idea that you drift into some kind of haze." Dr. Ransohoff, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on cultural attitudes toward older women and is planning a book on the subject, appeared to be middle-aged herself. She declined to give her age, she said, "as long as women are treated the way they are." She urged her audience to try to understand men, many of whom, she said, face a historical lag of about 100 to 200 years in their thinking about the capabilities of older women. "Some people have accused me of being a closet housewife for saying we should try to understand men," she said. "But 100 to 200 years ago women of 40 were old, worn out and often died early because of childbirth. Men's fantasies have just not kept up with the new historical realities."

1435-> QUICK ACTION VOWED ON AMERASIANS
Attorney General William French Smith said here today that the Reagan Administration would act ''just as quickly as we can'' to carry out a new law that permits the Asian children of American fathers to go live in the United States. After a visit Wednesday to two of Thailand's camps for Indochinese refugees, Mr. Smith also said he would speed up and expand the local operations of the Immigration and Naturalization Service so that it could determine faster which refugees were eligible for admission to the United States, and could then get them there sooner. Thailand's Prime Minister, Gen. Prem Tinsulanonda, and other officials have said publicly that the United States and other Western governments are falling behind in their promises to take more refugees off Thailand's hands. Mr. Smith added, however, that public resistance in America to accepting countless refugees had grown stronger. And he said he had talked today with General Prem about making ''a major effort'' to return unsettled refugees to their countries of origin, ''including Vietnam if possible.'' 23-Day Asian Trip In an interview, the Attorney General also said that ''it is a very nice question'' what ''repatriation'' means in a place like Cambodia, where thousands of people have been encouraged to return to insecure border areas under the control of Cambodian guerrillas opposed both to the regime in Phnom Penh and to Vietnam's military occupation of most of the country. Mr. Smith and ranking members of the Justice Department, including the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, Alan C. Nelson, are on a 23-day trip to Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Pakistan, Italy and France for talks on narcotics trafficking as well as refugees. The main obstacle confronting Amerasian children wanting to leave Vietnam, the Attorney General said, is likely to be the Hanoi Government. But he said he hoped the children could now leave by a faster and ''more efficient process'' than many had left through Vietnam's ''orderly departure program.'' The new United States law, signed by President Reagan this month, allows Amerasian children in South Korea, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand to prove without any accompanying declarations by their fathers that they are half American and should therefore be eligible for admission to the United States. The law empowers the Attorney General to make such determinations, and the Reagan Administration is formulating the law's rules and regulations. Dealings With Hanoi an Issue Mr. Smith said he did not know yet just how the United States would deal with Vietnam, where there are estimated to be from 8,000 to 25,000 or more Amerasian children. Washington has practically no formal contact with Hanoi. The new law makes no provision for the admission of a child's mother or half-siblings. Several American officials who have worked with Vietnamese Amerasians and their families have expressed private doubts over the willingness of mothers to sign over their children to voluntary agencies or foster parents in the United States, as the new law requires. Very few American fathers have claimed their Vietnamese children and fewer still have asked to take them into their homes.

1436-> A CHINESE OFFICIAL PLANS AFRICA VISIT
Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang is embarking on an extended tour of 10 African nations as part of China's campaign to enhance its image as a champion of the third world. Mr. Zhao's monthlong trip will begin on Monday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry confirmed today, and will take him to Egypt, Algeria, Morocco, Guinea, Zaire, Congo, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Kenya. The common element in visiting these countries of disparate ideologies, cultures and concerns is China's increased identification with other developing countries over the last year. Mr. Zhao's trip is the first undertaken to Africa by a highranking Chinese official since Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who died in 1976, visited there 19 years ago. Western diplomats here believe that an unspoken goal is to counter Soviet influence in the continent and to portray China as a more faithful friend. The diplomats also expect the Chinese Prime Minister to play to his hosts by returning to Peking's old characterization of the United States along with the Soviet Union as superpowers who want to expand their domination of the third world. 'China Belongs to Third World' This unflattering equation of Washington with Moscow was dropped for several years in the early glow of the normalization of Chinese-American relations. It was revived by Foreign Minister Huang Hua last fall in his brief tour of Africa and has become more common since in the public polemics of the Chinese leadership. Mr. Huang was replaced in November. China's renewed solidarity with other developing nations was sketched out by Prime Minister Zhao at the meeting of industrialized and developing countries in Cancun, Mexico, in October 1981. The Chinese party chief, Hu Yaobang, summed this up last September at the 12th Communist Party congress, when he declared: ''Socialist China belongs to the third world. China has experienced sufferings similar to those of most third world countries, and they are faced with common problems and tasks. China regards it as her sacred international duty to struggle resolutely against imperialism, hegemonism and colonialism together with the other third world countries.'' A visit this month of an Arab League delegation headed by King Hussein of Jordan also found a sympathetic hearing on the Palestinian question from the Chinese leadership, which nonetheless also acknowledged the Israeli people's right to exist peacefully. The Chinese have also sought better ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to force a withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. 'Strategic Cooperation' In carving out a more unaligned stance, China has tacitly given up its old policy of ''strategic cooperation'' with the West, specifically the United States and Japan, against the Soviet Union, a policy that some third world countries frowned on. To strike equidistance between the United States and the Soviet Union, Peking agreed in October to periodic consultations with Moscow on their longstanding differences. But leaders like Mr. Zhao and Mr. Hu also made clear that relations could not improve until the Russians made concessions by withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, Mongolia and along the Chinese-Soviet border and by making the Vietnamese get out of Cambodia. Two weeks ago Prime Minister Zhao met with diplomatic envoys from the 10 African countries that he intends to visit. The New China News Agency quoted him as telling them that his coming trip ''shows that China attaches great importance to developing its friendship and cooperation with African and third world countries.' Mr. Zhao told the African envoys that he hoped to exchange views on further economic cooperation. Before the death of Mao Zedong six years ago, up to half of China's foreign aid went to Africa. But the aid was cut back in 1978 as part of China's economic retrenchment at home, creating some African resentment. No Major Aid Projects Expected A senior Chinese official told reporters this week that no major Chinese aid projects would be proposed by Mr. Zhao on his visit to Africa. Instead, he said, the Chinese will concentrate on more small or medium projects that have proved effective in Africa, like Chinese medical aid teams and agricultural technicians. The official said that Mr. Zhao's tour had two principal aims. The first was to strengthen political unity with the third world. The second was to discuss economic cooperation among the countries of the third world, including China. China has offered aid that is generally more modest than many Soviet aid projects, but it has no strings attached. In suggesting that this strategy would continue, People's Daily today published excerpts of interviews with African students here praising such Chinese aid projects as the railway through Tanzania and Zambia, built with a $680 million interest-free loan, and a sports stadium in Kenya. The Prime Minister's visit precedes the conference of the nations professing nonalignment scheduled in New Delhi early next year. China is not a member of the nonaligned movement but is expected to attend as an observer. Mr. Zhao's visit provides an opportunity to influence the movement's position on issues such as the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the Vietnamese presence in Cambodia.

1438-> DANCE: WIMMER TROUPE, MARITAL REMINISCENCES
Enough was never enough for Wimmer, Wimmer and Dancers, the company from Philadelphia that offered a program Thursday night in the Theater of the Riverside Church that was disturbing because of its brutal choreographic insistence. The troupe was founded by Lynne Wimmer, a choreographer, and her sister Gayle Wimmer, an artist. Although they have collaborated on productions, none of them was shown at Riverside. However, there were two pieces by Lynne Wimmer. The accompaniment for ''Small Legends'' included recorded voices of people reminiscing about what made them decide to get married. The reminiscences were witty and poignant. Yet all Miss Wimmer could think to have her cast do to them was parody a wedding ceremony and prance jerkily about. Miss Wimmer set paintings by Goya in motion in ''Dances from Goya,'' to harpsichord music by Soler and Spanish poems read by Josephina Guerra Fitzgerald. Paintings can cause trouble as choreographic inspirations because they are moments frozen in time and, to make them dance, a choreographer must provide them with a past or a future. But if the choreographer's imagination fails to equal that of the painter, the dancing may seem irrelevant. Given Miss Wimmer's tendency to overstatement and Goya's love of the grotesque, watching this work was like being clobbered by the clubs its dancers wielded in a fight scene. Quite a lot of clobbering went on and, in addition, villains skulked, aristocrats degenerated into gibbering idiots and the battle of the sexes turned savage. Through his imagery, Goya wished to protest man's inhumanity to man. But painted images are single images. To repeat images and then follow them with a constant barrage of new, equally violent images, as Miss Wimmer did, was to sensationalize Goya. She turned his paintings into a horror film. Martin Kravitz, the company's associate director, contributed ''The Once Not Remembered,'' in which women tried hard to be wispy to Scriabin. But because they tried so very hard, one was aware only of their effort. Into their midst came Mr. Kravitz who at first was confident but who ended up by being vulnerable. What accounted for his metamorphosis was one of the things ''The Once Not Remembered'' never revealed.

1439-> MARINES TO START PATROLLING CHRISTIAN-DOMINATED EAST BEIRUT TODAY
The United States Marine contingent here said today that its first patrols would enter East Beirut on Wednesday to extend its presence to what has been the stronghold of Christian militiamen. The first patrols will consist of armed infantrymen in four jeeps, according to Lieut. Col. Jonathan Abel, the spokesman of the Marine contingent, which is stationed at the international airport on the southern outskirts of Beirut. The colonel spoke at a briefing a day after the State Department announced in Washington that the role of the marines in the multinational peacekeeping force was being expanded at the request of President Amin Gemayel. A spokesman for the Lebanese Forces, as the Phalangist-dominated militias are known, said the entry of marines would present ''no problem whatsoever.'' He said the militiamen would stay in their barracks. In recent weeks, the Lebanese Army has established a slight presence at a few intersections in East Beirut, but the army has not taken full control of the predominantly Christian area. The Christian militiamen have removed their checkpoints and ordered members not to wear uniforms in the street. The militiamen have remained in several barracks in East Beirut. Colonel Abel said marines would move into East Beirut at about 1 P.M. on Wednesday for roving patrols. ''Our mission,'' he said, ''is an extension of our presence, to facilitate the President of Lebanon's efforts to stabilize the country.'' He said the mission of the marines would not be one of reconnaissance. ''But if they see anything out of the ordinary they will report it to the Lebanese Army,'' he added. The colonel said he did not know if the Americans would be joined in East Beirut by French and Italian units of the three-nation peacekeeping force. No Ammunition in Rifles As has been the practice of the Marine force here, he said, patrols entering East Beirut will have unloaded weapons but will carry ammunition. But, he said, ''the rules of engagement have not changed.'' They remained, he said, ''Fire if fired upon.'' He said that if the patrols were blocked by a Phalangist unit the marines ''would get out and talk it over.'' The colonel declined to say what arms, in addition to the usual rifles, might be carried by marines on patrol, or how many men would be in each of the jeeps. One Arabic-speaking marine will be in one of the jeeps, he said. President Gemayel, a leader of the Phalangist Party before his election, has said that all militiamen, Christian and Moslem, must be disarmed. But he has been vague on plans to disarm the Lebanese Forces. The Lebanese Army, supported by French and Italian troops, has swept through Moslem-dominated West Beirut, collecting arms and arresting, or forcing underground, members of leftist and Moslem militias. During this time, the Phalangists are believed to have gradually moved their tanks and artillery into the mountains to the north and east of Beirut. The Phalangist-dominated militias have said they will not disarm until all foreign forces have left Lebanon. ---- U.S. to Send Military Advisers WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (AP) - Defense Department officials said today that the United States was proposing to send military advisers to Lebanon to begin training the Lebanese Army. The aim, they said, would be to make it possible for the army to take over security responsibilities and allow the peacekeeping force to withdraw. The officials said this was one element of an aid package to be discussed with President Amin Gemayel in Beirut. If he accepts the plan, as is expected, a security assistance office numbering perhaps a half dozen military officers will be established in Beirut. The plan was said to envisage sending 50 to 60 military advisers to Lebanon on a temporary basis. The officials said the aid package would also include 24 armored troop carriers and a dozen or more 155-millimeter artillery guns.

1440-> THE TRICKS AND TREATS AT THE MAGIC SHOPS
Transient terror, illusory monsters, scary trickery and a smattering of realistic gore are sensations we expect on Halloween. But this year, E.T., the friendly alien, has been insinuated right into the midst of such less gentle folk as Frankenstein, Wolfman, Dracula and last year's popular Halloween villain, Darth Vader. Masks, exploding smoke powder, Dracula capes, a seance in memory of Harry Houdini, Wolfman fangs, convincing illusions in which arms seem to be pierced by twin knives, bloodlike ''blood'' and inklike ''ink'' that stains horribly are all to be found this Halloween in New York's magic shops. But if you or your child is of a less-gory bent, then a remarkably accurate E.T. mask is available for $55 at Circle Magic, 1661 Broadway, at West 52d Street, or the Magic Towne House, 1026 Third Avenue, at 61st Street. 'How About the Rest of You?' ''The problem with E.T.,'' Dick Brooks, president of the Towne House, said, ''is the rest of the outfit. The mask is great, but how about the rest of you? How can you look like him?'' But this is not likely to be a problem for E.T. fans. The mask and perhaps a long coat will probably do nicely. As for the rest of the paraphernalia being offered by the magic shops, an effort seems to be under way to give the observance some tang. Among the popular items is a lifelike or, more precisely, a deathlike skull that covers the entire head and is realistic enough, according to Jack Flosso, owner of the Hornmann Magic Company, to ''scare the hell out of you.'' Annual Party Over the years, costumes have become more imaginative, more keyed to characters recognizable to children, and some of the tricks in trick-or-treating are now more like the professional illusions used by magicians. Hornmann Magic, 304 West 34th Street (279-6079), which has been in business since 1869 and which was owned from 1917 to 1919 by Houdini, perhaps the greatest magician of all, has the skull masks for $75 and such scary tricks as ''flash paper'' that sprouts into flame and smoke powder that erupts in puffs of smoke, each $3. All the tricks will be on display and demonstrated by professional magicians at Hornmann's free Halloween party tomorrow at 5:30 P.M. Who buys most of the gear? ''Middle-aged people,'' said Mr. Flosso, who keeps his shop open from 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays. ''We're all kids today.'' Jokes and Seances At the Magic Towne House (752-1165), sales of monster masks, Frankenstein and Dracula in particular, from $20 to $40, have been brisk. So have Dracula capes and fang sets, from $16 to $60, depending on the degree of realism. ''Our masks are expensive, at $40, but they have full heads of hair,'' Mr. Brooks of the shop-and-theater complex said. And after visitors have wandered through the shop, buying rubber chocolates; vanishing inkl candy-covered beetles (not truly); bugs in mock ice cubes; ''black-eye jokes,'' which combine black eyes with black soap, and cold-cream jars that sprout snakes, they can see magic shows. The shop is open Tuesdays through Sundays. Its children's theater has performances Saturdays and Sundays at 1, 2:30 and 4, and its adult cabaret is open Friday and Saturday nights at 8:30; the cost is $20 a person for dinner, show, taxes and tip. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday nights, there will also be a Houdini seance conducted by the Houdinilike escape artist Dorothy Dietrich. ''We put a bunch of Harry's possessions on a table,'' Mr. Brooks said, ''and try to reach Harry. This isn't a gag. Have we ever reached him? No, but we came close once. His picture fell off the wall.'' 'Cute' Needle At Louis Tannen, which bills itself as the world's largest magic store, on the 17th floor of 1540 Broadway, at West 45th Street (541-9550), several special Halloween tricks are selling briskly, according to Jack Ferero, vice president of the company. Tannen deals largely with professionals and carries no monster masks, but it does have some illusions intended to frighten. There is ''A Little Slice of Hand,'' at $99.50, in which two knives seem to penetrate one's arm, then are pulled out, with no visible wounds. There is also ''knots of silk,'' at $12.50, in which lengths of silk are knotted and become unknotted simply by passing the hand over them. In his shop, which is open Monday and Saturdays until 3 P.M., Mr. Ferero is also selling professional makeup kits (usually $37.95) for $27.95, ''but just for Halloween week.'' 'Gory Is Very Big' However, most shops, unlike Tannen, do, sell masks, and one of the biggest is Circle Magic (247-3299). According to John Quinn, masks of such folks as Dracula, Frankenstein and Darth Vader, 60 varieties in all, are selling for $49.50 to $59.95. ''We usually sell about 500 masks in the time before Halloween, and I think we'll do at least that this year,'' Mr. Quinn said. Masks vie for favor with rubber spiders and cockroaches, six-foot-long imitation cobras, ''stage blood'' and matches that explode, sparkle or burn continuously. ''Gory,'' he said, ''is very big this year.''

1441-> NATO URGES SOVIET TO REBUILD TRUST
The United States and its European allies, stressing their willingness to develop trade and human relations, told the new Soviet leadership today that a chance was at hand to rebuild a climate of international trust. In a communique that stressed openness toward the Government of Yuri V. Andropov, the new Soviet party leader, and avoided confrontational language, the foreign ministers of the 16 members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization called on the Soviet Union for tangible signs that it is seeking a better climate after two years of deteriorated East-West relations. ''The allies are open for all opportunities for dialogue,'' the statement said. ''They will welcome any positive move to reduce tension, and desire, if Soviet attitudes allow, to cooperate in rebuilding international trust.'' 'To Extend Areas of Cooperation' The alliance, the statement said, wants ''to improve relations with the member states of the Warsaw Pact and to extend areas of cooperation to their mutual benefit.'' At the same time, the allies pointed to what they said was a largescale Soviet arms buildup, and said studies were going ahead in various organizations on the conduct of East-West trade. Without any suggestion that these relations would be further restricted, the leaders agreed to review the findings of the studies in June at the next Atlantic Council meeting in Paris. The two days of meetings here had few of the specific trans-Atlantic pressures growing out of the Reagan Administration's attempts in the past year to induce the allies to cut back on Soviet trade. References in the communique of the last major alliance meeting, in Bonn in June, to ''prudent and diversified'' treatment of East-West commercial relations, and the ''use of commercial prudence'' in the granting of export credits to the East, were omitted this time. Rather, the alliance said that if it was consistent with security goals, ''the allies recognize that mutually advantageous trade with the East on commercially sound terms contributes to constructive East-West relations.'' In the apparent effort to avoid a confrontational approach, today's statement also dropped charges that NATO has made in the past to the effect that the Soviet Union forces countries within its zone of influence to act as a bloc, and that it is willing to threaten and use force beyond its borders. Evidence on Chemical Weapons The alliance did, however, express grave concern for the first time about what it said was ''strong evidence of continued use of chemical weapons in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan in violation of international law, including Soviet involvement in the use of such weapons.'' As the alliance meeting ended at NATO headquarters in the outskirts of Brussels, Secretary of State George P. Shultz joined four other American Cabinet officials for talks on trade relations with the European Common Market Commission at its headquarters in the capital. Mr. Shultz, who is attending his first alliance meeting, said at a news conference that he found the European allies' attitude on the new Soviet leadership rather like that of the United States. ''We're all interested in seeing constructive relations based on a different pattern of behavior,'' he said. ''We're ready for a dialogue, but whether or not something emerges remains to be seen.'' Mr. Shultz said the review of East-West trade would continue in international bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and NATO's standing coordinating committee on strategic goods. He offered no sense of concrete results, referring instead to ''a report on progress'' to be presented at the Paris meeting in June. The considerably less than binding tone of the enterprise appeared sufficiently vague to win the approval of France, which refused to join in a statement on East-West trade, covering about the same ground as the studies detailed by Mr. Shultz, when it was issued in connection with the lifting of American gas pipeline sanctions last month. France, which does not participate in NATO's integrated military command, does attend the political deliberations of the Atlantic council. Spain, the alliance's newest member, took part in the ministerial session, but refrained from taking part in the communique. Spain is engaged in a national debate on the country's defense requirements and its relationship with NATO, but officials stressed that its position did not represent a disengagement from the alliance. ---- Spain Plans Referendum BRUSSELS, Dec. 10 (Reuters) - The Spanish Foreign Minister, Fernando Moran, said today that his Government would call a referendum on whether to stay in NATO. He held out the possibility that Spain would opt for partial membership similar to that of France. Mr. Moran said at a news conference after the meeting of NATO foreign ministers that Spain wanted to consider carefully whether and how it should participate in the alliance. Until the referendum is held, he said, the Government intends to freeze its participation in alliance military activities. Spain joined NATO in May despite opposition from left-wing political parties.

1444-> RACE IN CONNECTICUT'S 6th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT FOCUSES ON NEW BRITAIN
The contest for the House of Representatives from the Sixth Congressional District will probably be determined here, in the district's largest city, and the registration of 25,000 Democrats, 7,600 Republicans and 4,100 unaffiliated voters would seem to give the race to State Senator William E. Curry Jr., the Democratic aspirant. But the voters of New Britain, Democratic though they may be, elected Mr. Curry's Republican opponent, Nancy L. Johnson, to the State Senate in 1976, 1978 and 1980, the last time by a 2-to-1 margin. As a result, the candidates agree that the race will be close. Partly because it is the only race in Connecticut with no incumbent, the Sixth District has attracted considerable outside attention. Mrs. Johnson has benefited from a visit by United States Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, and Betty Ford, the former First Lady, campaigned with Mrs. Johnson today. Mr. Curry had help this week from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and is expecting visits from Paul C. Warnke, who was the director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in the Carter Administration, and Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts. Reagan Policies Attacked Mr. Curry is also trying to bring in another opponent, Ronald Reagan, and the Administration's economic program. ''My Republican opponent,'' Mr. Curry said at a campaign rally here Tuesday, ''like Republicans across this country, has supported budgets that have made people bleed, has supported cuts in Social Security, in Medicare, in student loans, that have attacked all the things that we've accomplished over decades.'' At that rally, Mr. Curry appeared on a podium with Representative Toby Moffett, who is running for the Senate, and Senator Kennedy. Mrs. Johnson was co-chairman of the Reagan campaign in the March 1980 primary in Connecticut, but is generally regarded as a moderate in the State Senate and has embraced most but not all of Mr. Reagan's policies. ''There has to be money for capital growth,'' she said in an interview at her headquarters here, ''as well as for services. Government has to see itself more as a leverager of problems than as a solver, an agent of solution rather than Big Daddy.'' Differs With Some Policies Mrs. Johnson said that she approved, for example, of the Reagansponsored decision to combine 28 educational grants into a single grant, and said that the 20 percent reduction in funds could be carried out with no reduction in services because of administrative savings. But, she said, ''If you cut too deeply, you betray the commitments I think we all value, to the poor, to children, to job training, and the elderly.'' Still, her overall relationship to Mr. Reagan has been too close for some potential supporters, including the National Organization for Women, which endorsed Mr. Curry, a supporter of women's issues. In a recent campaign stop at a lunch-hour meeting of the Women's Network at the New Britain Y.W.C.A., one of Mrs. Johnson's supporters, Helen Z. Pearl, an attorney, commented, ''It's a shame we have to make a choice between the two of them.'' Mrs. Johnson first ran for the State Senate after serving as a volunteer in social services. She served as president of a community guidance clinic and was on the board of directors of a group home for emotionally troubled teenage girls in the 1970's. Cites Foster-Care Bill She cites as one of her accomplishments in office her work in passing a bill that requires the state to make foster children available for adoption after two years or it must return them to their parents, barring unusual circumstances. In the Senate, she was chairman of the Program Review and Investigations Committee and ranking minority member of the Finance Committee in the last session. Mrs. Johnson, who is 48 years old and the wife of a New Britain obstetrician, has three daughters, one of whom is working as her campaign scheduler. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe, and did graduate work in art. Mr. Curry, a 30-year-old graduate of the University of Connecticut Law School, entered the State Senate in 1978 and is regarded as its most liberal member. He has specialized in such areas as reducing industrial and chemical pollution and occupational safety. Curry Economic Proposals ''My opponent's position is the President's program is working,'' he said at a recent debate before the Avon-Canton Rotary Club. ''The most important difference between us is I don't believe it's working,'' he said. ''The things that the President wants are every bit as expensive as what he doesn't want,'' Mr. Curry said. He argued that more was needed to help the economy of the district, which includes such aging, ailing industrial centers as Bristol, Torrington, and New Britain. Mr. Curry has proposed a program of interest-rate reduction and making special credit available to industries and job training programs and other steps for ''rebuilding our economy.'' While Mrs. Johnson is advertising that she supports a balancedbudget amendment, Mr. Curry opposes it. As the campaign approaches the election, Mr. Curry and Mrs. Johnson have clashed on simpler issues. Mr. Curry has accused Mrs. Johnson of using television advertisements to falsely state that he opposed bills for speedy trials, tougher sentencing for criminals and treatment of juvenile criminals. He also accused her of changing her position on a nuclear weapons freeze, which he favors.

1445-> ARTIFICIAL HEART RECIPIENT SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY FROM SEIZURES
When Una Loy Clark walked into her husband's room in intensive care this morning, she said, ''Good morning, honey.'' Dr. Barney B. Clark opened his eyes, looked toward her, reached out and squeezed her hand. Dr. Clark, the 61-year-old retired dentist from Seattle who is the first recipient of a permanent artificial heart, is connected to a respirator and cannot talk because of a tube in his windpipe. He used a finger board to spell out answers to questions posed by his doctors. ''That shows us he has the capacity to understand the question,'' Dr. Chase N. Peterson said at a news conference at the University of Utah Medical Center, where Dr. Clark is a patient. But Dr. Peterson, the university's vice president for health sciences, added that ''none of us can yet tell you there is no brain damage'' from seizures Dr. Clark suffered early Tuesday and that his condition continued to be critical. Brain Wave Test Is Normal Nevertheless, he said Dr. Clark's doctors took both his response to his wife and his communication by spelling as signs of further gradual improvement in his recovery from the seizures, whose cause has not been definitely determined. Dr. Clark has had no further seizures, and his latest brain wave test was reported as normal. Dr. Peterson also said that results of a test called the lumbar puncture had given the physicians further assurance that Dr. Clark had suffered neither a stroke nor meningitis, which is a potentially fatal infection of the membrane that covers the brain. Today a physical therapist was continuing the passive and active exercises that are designed to prevent Dr. Clark's muscles from withering away. Such withering, called atrophy of disuse, can occur quickly after operations if the body's muscles are not used in such exercises as bending the legs and moving the arms through a range of motions. The doctors are increasing Dr. Clark's caloric intake through a feeding tube to about 4,000 calories today. The increased intake reflected the fact that he has overcome a condition called ileus, which commonly follows surgery, and that his bowel function has returned to normal. ''We know he is absorbing that food,'' Dr. Peterson said. Some Tubes Removed The doctors are also removing some of the intravenous tubes in Dr. Clark's body to decrease chances of infection and other complications. They are also taking precautions to prevent pneumonia, one of the complications about which the medical team is most concerned. Dr. Peterson said that Dr. Clark's body chemistries were in the best shape since the artificial heart was implanted on Dec. 2 and that many of them were better than they were before that operation. His vital signs were reported as normal. The artificial heart is now set at a rate of 70 beats a minute, instead of the 90 that it had been in recent days. The lower number of beats has reduced the amount of blood that is being pumped through Dr. Clark's body. The measure of the blood pumped each minute is called the cardiac output. It is now 6 liters a minute instead of the 7.8 or so that it had been in recent days. His blood pressure also was lower; at latest report it was 135/80. ''We are trying to find the right level,'' Dr. Peterson said. Tests also show that Dr. Clark's liver is working normally and that the body chemicals known as the electrolytes are also normal. Sees Cause for Optimism Kidney, liver and various body chemical tests all showed cause for optimism, Dr. Peterson said. But he said it was worrisome that Dr. Clark was not as alert as he had been. Dr. Fumisuke Matsuo,a neurologist who is a consultant in the case, told Dr. Peterson that such a state could last up to a week after the type of seizures Dr. Clark suffered. A neurologist not connected with the case agreed that that was possible, but he suggested that part of the reaction might be a result of psychological depression from the overwhelming events that Dr. Clark has gone through in recent weeks.

1446-> RENAMING GUIDO TO HEAD POLICE WEIGHED
WHITE PLAINS IT all began with a phone call early in 1981 from the County Executive, who asked, according to the man who got the call, ''if I could take a temporary position to help him out.'' Daniel P. Guido's answer to Alfred B. DelBello was yes. Next Friday, as corks pop at county New Year's Eve celebrations, Mr. Guido's ''temporary'' assignment as the $58,000-a-year Commissioner/ Sheriff of the county's merged Department of Public Safety Services comes quietly to an end. The 51-year-old executive's reappointment as head of the county police force, where discontent among officers has bubbled close to the surface since 1979, seems likely, according to legislative sources. Mr. DelBello, a Democrat who will be sworn in New Year's Day as the state's Lieutenant Governor, has asked for Mr. Guido's reappointment. It is being considered by the County Board of Legislators' Committee on Internal Affairs, whose chairman is Leonard N. Spano, a Republican of Yonkers. Last week, Mr. Spano was noncommittal about Mr. Guido's chances, saying that the appointment, along with those of other commissioners, would be up to the new County Executive, Andrew P. O'Rourke. He said, however, that Mr. Guido was ''competent'' and ''highly qualified.'' For his part, Mr. Guido said in a recent interview, ''I have no problems staying on'' as long as there are no ''philosophical differences or differences in style whatever'' between the incoming County Executive and himself. A 28-year veteran of law enforcement, Mr. Guido has been Police Commissioner in Long Island's Nassau County and in Yonkers, from which he went to his present post. ''I think there's much that can be done here,'' he said. ''I think the opportunities are very great.'' Since July 1979, when the present department was created by the joining of the County Sheriff's Department and the Parkway Police, many officers have grumbled about alleged inequities in such areas as salaries, disability benefits, promotions and retirement that they say came along with the merger. Some have agreed to discuss their complaints only if their names are not used. Mr. Guido, acknowledging the existence of some underlying causes of discontent, said, however, ''They're not solvable, certainly, by me nor by anyone else, short of unmerging the departments.'' ''They've destroyed a department we had pride in,'' said Raynold A. Arcuri Jr., last week. Mr. Arcuri, a former sheriff's deputy whose job now is to transport prisoners between jail and the County Courthouse, has tried unsuccessfully for several years to obtain certification for a single union that could represent officers of both groups. ''Morale is terrible,'' Mr. Arcuri said, ''and we foresee more problems.'' ''Everbody thinks the other got a better deal,'' said a former parkway police officer now assigned to the police division, who requested anonymity. The police division, composed mostly of the blue-uniformed men who once patrolled the county's parkways, and the services division, staffed mainly by former sheriff's deputies in gray, are the two principal sections of the 400-member department. Sheriff's deputies, before the merger, performed a number of functions ranging from criminal investigation to being court officers. Before the merger, sheriff's deputies earned $1,500 to $1,800 a year less than the equivalent parkway patrol officers, according to Mr. Arcuri. The gap has widened. Maximum yearly salary for a police division officer with 42 months service is $25,000, according to Michael Wittenberg, the county's Director of Labor Relations. Top pay for a Services Division officer stands at $20,625. It takes the services division officer five years to reach the top step. A 6.5 percent increase will go into effect for services division officers next Saturday if they ratify a contract between the county and the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents them. Police division officers are represented by the Westchester County Police Officers Association. In 1975, Mr. Arcuri founded the Westchester County Department of Public Safety Services Police Benevolent Association, which the county has refused to recognize as a bargaining agent and which is not certified to represent anyone. In proposing one union, Mr. Arcuri said last week, ''the bottom line is to eliminate inequities'' between former parkway officers and former deputy sheriffs. Commissioner Guido said that for the 80 sheriff's deputies working as court officers before the merger, ''expectations of advancement have been severely minimized.'' Before the merger, Mr. Guido said, ''they could aspire to be a sergeant in the courthouse or an officer working in the Civil Divison or an officer working in investigations. They no longer have those options. Their career path begins and ends in the courthouse.'' ''The impact of that today is that the people across the street are frustrated,'' Commissioner Guido said, looking at the County Courthouse from his Grove Street office window. He said that the courthouse officers had been conducting a ''job action'' that was ''born of their frustration'' over delay in getting a pay raise and over the ratification issue. He added that this was also ''a manifestation of their lingering discontent with their changed career paths.'' Upgrading for the court officers, he said, would ''be a question of giving them a status that would bring them into the police pension system,'' which allows a police officer to retire after 20 years. Court officers ''have a 25-year plan at age 55,'' Commissioner Guido said. At the time of the merger, the Commissioner said, deputy sheriffs acting as court officers were designated peace officers or public safety officers, not police officers. ''Police officers have a broader array of arrest powers than do peace officers,'' Mr. Guido said. ''The peace officer generally exercises his functions wherever he's working, whereas the police officer generally has a 24-hour day, seven-day week.'' Peace officers are not allowed to carry their guns off duty as police officers are, he added. The court officer, if he is pressed into service at an emergency scene, Mr. Guido said, does not have the same disability protection as the police officer. ''If a court officer and a police officer were standing duty at the County Jail during a riot, and a prisoner fired a shot that passed through both officers, severely disabling both, the police officer would be entitled to what they call 207C benefits,'' he said. That section of the General Municipal Law provides that the police officer ''would be entitled to full pay for the length of his disability, and if he's totally disabled, of course, he'd go on his disability pension.'' ''The court officer would not get that,'' said Mr. Guido. ''The police officer who's disabled theoretically could be kept on the payroll until he's 63 years old, whereas the court officer, at age 22, would find himself without a job and disabled. And no funds coming in.'' The court officer may take an examination for police officer status, just as any civilian can under state law. But those who succeed in changing divisions may do so with all their seniority intact, a situation that has provoked complaints from the former parkway officers. Commissioner Guido cited the hypothetical example of a former parkway officer with seven or eight years on the job who can now apply for a desired summer vacation. ''Suddenly there is a situation arising where half a dozen court officers have passed the police test and have come on the police side of his department,'' the Commissioner said. ''They're on the job 10 years. They are now senior to the seven-year person and not only that, if there's a layofff the next day, the seven-year parkway person goes first. Now that person doesn't look too kindly on these people coming over, not only taking better vacations but also a senior, higher position on the layoff list.'' The Commissioner said that ''in some respects,'' department morale had improved ''slightly over the last year or two,'' mainly because ''there's a little more stability at the top of the organization.'' He was referring to Mr. DelBello's suspension in 1981 of the previous Comissioner/ Sheriff, Thomas J. Delaney, and the resignation of Carl J. Fulgenzi, the deputy commissioner of Public Safety, after he pleaded guilty to administrative misconduct charges. Mr. Guido has been Commissioner/ Sheriff since last Jan. 22, filling out Mr. Delaney's elected four-year term, which ends Friday.

1448-> COURT OFFICER HELD IN SHOOTING
A court officer assigned to the Civil Term of Manhattan Supreme Court was arrested on charges of shooting his estranged wife and her sister-in-law and attacking an off-duty police sergeant during a dispute in Jackson Heights, Queens, last night, the police said. The wife's head was grazed by one bullet and the sister-in-law was shot in the stomach and taken to St. Johns Hospital and admitted in fair condition, according to Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman who gave the following account of the dispute and shooting. The court officer, 35-year-old Joseph Higgins, of 86-12 Elliot Avenue in nearby Elmhurst, Queens, had gone to the Jackson Heights home of the sister-in-law at 10:30 P.M. seeking his wife, Susan, also 35, who had moved there when she left him on Nov. 5. An argument developed between the husband and wife at the entrance to the home at 6308 Booth Street and the wife began shouting for help as did her sister-in-law, Ximena. Their shouts and the dispute were heard by Sgt. Michael Faranda of the 110th Precinct who was off-duty and visiting his parents at their home on the same block as the sister-in-law. When Sergeant Faranda arrived at 6308 he saw Mr. Higgins in the driveway with his gun drawn and grappling on the ground with his wife. As the sergeant approached, the gun was fired and the bullet grazed Mrs. Higgins. The sergeant struggled with Mr. Higgins and before he could be subdued, the gun went off two more times, with one bullet striking the sister-in-law.

1449-> SEARS PLANS TO SELL 4 SHOPPING CENTERS
Sears, Roebuck & Company, a diversified concern with major interests in retailing and financial services, announced today that it had agreed to sell four company-owned shopping center developments to Corporate Property Investors Inc., a private New York concern. Sears did not disclose the purchase price nor the terms of the agreement. Edward R. Telling, chairman and chief executive of Sears, said in a statement that the nation's largest retailer had already sold its 1.1-million-square-foot Westminster Mall shopping center in California to C.P.I., and had agreed to sell three additional shopping centers to the concern within the next two years. Also scheduled for sale are the 1.1-million-square-foot Burnsville Center in Burnville, Minn.; the 1-million-square-foot Brea Mall in Brea, Calif. and the 700,000-square-foot Maplewood Mall in Maplewood, Minn. All four properties had been developed, owned and managed by the Homart Development Company, a unit of the Coldwell Banker Real Estate division of Sears, which will continue to manage the developments. Sears called the move a ''reployment of assets.'' Currently, Sears has 9 multi-use shopping center properties under construction and development. It sold a shopping center in Florence, Ky. and one in Mesa, Ariz. this year. In 1981, Sears sold four shopping malls and realized a gain of about $62.2 million, said a company spokesman, Douglas A. Fairweather. John S. Landschulz, an analyst at Meisrow & Company, said such transactions ''have become in vogue in the retail community,'' noting that Dayton-Hudson, Marshall Field and Carson Pirie Scott & Company have all followed similar strategies.

1450-> NJ TRANSIT TO USE 500 EXTRA BUSES IN CASE OF RAIL STRIKE JAN.1
NJ Transit Corporation officials, facing a Jan. 1 deadline for settlements with 16 rail unions, has announced plans to use 500 extra buses to carry most of the state's 70,000 train commuters in the event of a strike. ''It's going to be a mess,'' said Jerome Premo, executive director of the state transit agency, ''but what we're trying to do is make the best of a bad situation.'' The plan calls for substantial increases in regular bus service to areas already served by bus routes and the creation of 16 special park-and-ride bus centers in areas where no bus service exists. All of the park-and-ride centers will carry commuters directly to New York City or Newark, Jersey City, Hoboken or Staten Island, where riders can connect with other transit systems, such as the PATH trains or the Staten Island Ferry. Would Serve 40,000 Daily ''This plan will provide the smoothest possible means of dealing with the congestion and confusion that would be created by the shutdown of the state's nine commuter rail lines,'' Mr. Premo said. ''It is designed to handle 75 percent of the rush hour rail commuters who go to Newark, New York City and Hoboken,'' he said. ''Over all, the contingency plan would provide transportation for approximately 40,000 commuters daily.'' Mr. Premo said the agency hoped to complete negotiations with the 16 rail unions, representing 2,650 Conrail workers, before midnight, Dec. 31, when Conrail goes out of the passenger-service business and its commuter operations in New Jersey are taken over by an NJ Transit subsidiary. ''We continue to be hopeful that we will reach agreements with these unions so we can avoid a work stoppage on Jan. 1,'' Mr. Premo said. ''On the other hand, we owe it to the riding public to put forward a thoughtful and comprehensive contingency plan in the event of a strike.'' To Provide Shuttle Service On the Northeast Corridor Line, from Trenton to New York, shuttle service will be provided from the Lawrence Shopping Center in Lawrence Township, Palmer Stadium in Princeton, Rutgers Stadium in Piscataway, Metropark in Edison and the Metuchen train station. On the North Jersey Coast Line, riders will be able to catch buses from the Seaview Square Mall in Neptune Township and the Garden State Arts Center in Holmdel, as well as on regular bus routes north of Perth Amboy. Regular bus routes will be supplemented along the Raritan Valley Line, the Morris-Essex Line and the Pascack Valley and Bergen Main Line. Shuttle service to Newark will be provided from the William Mennen Sports Arena in Morristown, the Dover, Convent, Madison, Chatham and Summit train stations and the Springfield Municipal Pool. Park-and-ride shuttle service will also be provided from the Meadowlands Sports Complex to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Terminal in Manhattan.

1451-> YIDDISH THEATER CENTENNIAL AT MUSEUM
IT was a theater world in which stars denounced one another on stage; in which seasoned actors advised newcomers not to argue with a director during rehearsals, but do what they wished during performance; in which playwrights excoriated actors during shows for improvising on the script; in which partisans of stars fought in the streets, sometimes in the theaters, and in which audiences expected a show to last four or even five hours and brought food in bags for the family. This was the turbulent New York Yiddish theater, which spread from the Lower East Side to Harlem, Brooklyn, the Bronx and, eventually, to Broadway and midtown in a process that began 100 years ago. Today, after 18 months of digging in its own archives, sifting through collections at the New York Public Library and Lincoln Center and borrowing from individuals, the Museum of the City of New York at Fifth Avenue and 103d Street, opens an unusual exhibition to honor the centennial of the Yiddish theater in this country. Knishes and Champagne With life-sized mannequins of stars in costume, photographs, posters, sheet music, paintings, drawings and newspaper clippings, the exhibition traces the European-born Yiddish theater from its stormy American beginnings under Boris Thomashefsky at Turn Hall on the Lower East Side in the summer of 1882. The show recaptures the changing Jewish culture in which the Yiddish stage was nurtured and flourished and declined - although Yiddish theater still manages to mount lively productions, defying predictions of its imminent demise. In gilt letters, some of them almost as large as the lighted ones that once brightened marquees along Second Avenue, the museum acclaims the centennial in Yiddish and English. Appropriately, a preview last night commingled knishes with champagne and featured a showing of ''The Golden Age of Second Avenue'' produced by Arthur Cantor. At center stage, in a circular showcase, is a Molly Picon mannequin, adorned in the bridal costume of one of her many hits, ''Mazel Tov, Molly.'' Gathered around her behind the glass shelter are life-sized mannequins of Menasha Skulnik, in the crumpled, undersized hat that was one of his trademarks; Jacob Ben-Ami, in Russian tunic trousers and boots, and Ida Kaminska, in her lavish gown from ''Mirele Efros.'' 'Just so Much Space' Looking down from blown-up photographs on the walls are such stars as Thomashefsky, David Kessler, Jacob P. Adler, Maurice Schwartz, Bertha Kalish, Ludwig Satz, Jennie Goldstein, Aaron Lebedeff, Jacob Jacobs and the casts of Artef and the Folksbiene. Beneath the pictures are 300 items of print, photographs, drawings and posters for the shows that dealt in tragedy, comedy and music for an immigrant world that was to supply prodigious talent to Broadway, Hollywood and television. ''The hardest part in doing this exhibition,'' said Diane Cypkin, the Yiddish theater consultant at the museum who assembled the exhibition, ''was in choosing from materials we have in our archives here and have assembled elsewhere. I know I'm going to get criticism from people who will say, 'Why didn't you include this or that?' We had just so much space.'' A Yiddish actress, Miss Cypkin was assisted by MaryAnn Smith, assistant curator. ''This is not just an exhibition,'' Miss Cypkin said. ''This is a celebration. It is a happy event. There is Molly Picon in her wedding dress, and all around her are the men and women who brought the bricks with which the Yiddish theater was built, all helping in the celebration. The Yiddish theater was more than mere entertainment. It was Jewish culture. It portrayed the conflicts of old and new in the ghetto world of New York.'' Freely Translated Harold Clurman, the drama critic, called the world ''in every sense a people's or a community theater - that is to say, a true theater, the like of which was rarely if ever to be achieved again in our country.'' In the clippings and programs of this world are such luminaries from the Golden Age of Jewish literature as Sholem Aleichem, I.J. Singer, Sholem Asch, Jacob Gordin, Osip Dymov, S. Anski who either wrote directly for the theater or whose works were adapted for it. The Yiddish theater also had assistance in translations and adaptations - sometimes very free ones - from Goethe, Tolstoy and Ibsen. There were some Shakespeare adaptations that were advertised as ''farbessert,'' - improved-on. On the front pages of sheet music are such names as Sholem Secunda and Joseph Rumshinsky, whose tunes were inexhaustible. One song in this exhibition is Secunda's ''Bei Mir Bist du Shein,'' which became a hit on American radio andjuke boxes when sung in English by the Andrews Sisters. Secunda sold his rights to the song for a pittance after it was written in the early 30's for the musical ''I Would If I Could.'' The exhibition reveals the basic battle in the Yiddish theater between those who felt it should deal only with serious matters and those who believed shows were meant to make people happy - a dispute not unknown on Broadway. Miss Cypkin's selections do not take sides.''My belief,'' she said, ''is that there is only one kind of theater worthy of this exhibition - good theater.'' The museum is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. and Sundays and holidays 1 to 5. Admission is free.

1453-> Weaver Sorry For Remarks
Mike Weaver, who lost his World Boxing Association heavyweight title last week to Michael Dokes, has apologized to the Nevada Athletic Commission for remarks he made. In a telegram, Weaver said he did not mean to imply the commission was involved in any ''fix'' of the bout. ''The sudden decision and fact I was so upset led to my unfortunate remarks,'' Weaver said. Referee Joey Curtis stopped the bout in the first round with Weaver offering no resistance. Weaver later said he thought there had been a conspiracy to pick a referee who would stop the bout quickly. In his telegram, Weaver said that, although he ''did not agree with the referee's decision,'' he wanted to offer his ''sincerest apology'' for the remarks.

1454-> IONA WINS, 99-76, IN TOURNEY
Iona blocked 15 shots and used a overpowering fast-break attack tonight to rout Loyola of Baltimore, 99-76, in the opening round of the Manufacturers Hanover Classic at Mulcahy Campus Center. Iona (3-1), which has won three of the four previous tournaments, will play American University in the final Saturday night. American (3-0) beat Marist (1-3), 80-62, in tonight's opening game. Led by Gary Springer, a junior forward, who scored 31 points, Iona built a 43-32 halftime lead and then outscored Loyola (0-3) by 12-7 for a 55-39 margin. ''We got a lot of balance scoring,'' said Pat Kennedy, the Iona coach. ''And that was a different Gary Springer we saw. That was the Gary Springer of his freshman year.'' Springer made 11 of 15 field-goal attempts and grabbed 10 rebounds. Springer averaged 20 points a game as a freshman, but was limited by an injured knee last year. For Iona, Steve Burtt, a junior guard, scored 19 points and Chris Crockett had 16. Kevin House was high for Loyola with 21. Mississippi 57 Fordham 47 PROVO, Utah (UPI) - Carlos Clark scored a game-high 22 points to lead Mississippi in the opening game of the Cougar Classic. Brigham Young played Long Beach State in the other first-round game, with the winner advancing to Saturday night's final against Ole Miss. Ed Bona led Fordham (2-3) with 16 points. Army 73, Yale 70 WEST POINT (AP) - Scott Millfren and Dennis Schlitt scored 16 points each and converted clutch free throws in the final minute. Army (3-3) led, 69-63, with 2:03 remaining, but 5 consecutive points by Butch Graves brought Yale (2-3) within 1. Schlitt then made two free throws. Millfren added two with eight seconds left. Indiana 85 Eastern Michigan 48 BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - Indiana (5-0) got 16 points apiece from Uwe Blab and John Flowers to advance to the final Saturday of Indiana Classic against Wyoming, which beat North Carolina-Wilmington, 52-42. Mike Jackson scored 19 points for Wyoming (3-3).

1456-> IN AMAZON, HUGE STUDY AIMS TO SAVE JUNGLE LIFE
AT night, bats swooped through the jungle lean - to as the group of visitors to the Amazon lashed their hammocks in place. By morning, the group was picking its dark and damp way along the forest floor, 130 feet beneath the canopy of treetops and the spotty dawn's light. ''Hear that squeaking hinge? That's a toucan,'' said Richard Bierregaard Jr. Moments later, he was training his binoculars on a formation of five parrots that had swept into view. ''That's an odd sighting,'' he said. ''Parrots mate for life. The odd one must be an early widower or a juvenile.'' Judy M. Rankin was gingerly scooping up petals, tendrils and leaves from the ground. ''This one was cut right through by a beetle with very sharp mandibles,'' she said. Thunder rumbled overhead. It was raining heavily, but it would be 10 minutes before drops penetrated the leafy understory to where Dr. Rankin was now examining the bark of a towering trunk. She, Dr. Bierregaard and other scientists here are engaged in a 20-year project, keeping such a watch on everything that happens inside specific jungle parcels that have been pre-selected for preservation in parts of the Amazon that are being cleared for farming and cattle raising. They study them while they are still part of the undisturbed rain forest, then restudy them, once they are isolated, to monitor the deterioration of plant and animal life. Other scientists have pursued the same kind of research, examining mountaintops, coral heads, forest fragments and islands that were once part of mainlands. But until now no one has ever done so with a secure knowledge of what existed in the target zone before its isolation. John Terborgh, a tropical ecologist from Princeton University, calls the ambitious approach here ''so grandiose it verges on the undoable.'' He added that it was ''exciting'' that someone ''would even try it.'' The joint American-Brazilian project, now in its fourth year, has a limited and environmentally sober objective. There is no hope of rescuing the Brazilian jungle from exploitation, and no intention of trying. Instead, the goal is to determine, in the words of the project's architect and co-director, Thomas E. Lovejoy, ''the minimum critical size of ecosystems.'' ''There are some groups of people who say if you do this kind of minimum-size research that's all you're going to end up getting,'' said Dr. Lovejoy, who is vice president for science of the World Wildlife Fund in Washington. ''My response to them is that if you don't know the minimum size, you may not even get that.'' One has only to observe Dr. Lovejoy caution a newcomer to the jungle fastness against disturbing the pathside leaf litter to know that conservation is the reason behind this pulse-reading of dying forest patches. The vital signs of everything down to ant colonies are being recorded by the specialists working under the auspices of the World Wildlife Fund in Washington and Brazil's National Institute for Research on Amazonia, based in Manaus. The tropical forests that still exist across the middle latitudes of the globe hold at least half of the 10 million to 12 million animal and plant species on the planet. ''The tropical rain forest is the greatest expression of life on earth,'' said Dr. Lovejoy, who is vice president for science of the Washington organization. These forests are being leveled for colonizing, pasturage, timber and other commercial purposes at a rate of 50 million acres a year, a total as large as the state of Minnesota. Operating on the assumption that what options remain to create parks and protected areas will be exercised in the next two decades, the directors of the Amazon project hope their work will slow the growing extinction of plant and animal life and lead to the establishment of preserves to protect evolutionary and ecological processes. ''Some people think you just put a fence around an area, and it's preserved,'' said Dr. Lovejoy. ''They forget that a forest is a dynamic thing.'' Interdependence of Life Forms The Amazon harbors plant and animal associations of humbling complexity. Insects, bats and moths pollinate flowers on trees, which produce nuts that are cracked open by rodents who deposit the residue in select soils for new cycles of germination. One type of creeping bean plant must spend time inside the belly of an Amazon fish before being excreted into a particular kind of mud, where the life pattern starts again. Sand dunes along the roadside leading north out of Manaus into the jungle are stark evidence of what can happen when these kinds of interdependencies are disregarded. The scientists track these life patterns with an odd assortment of gear. There are cans of fermented banana to attract fruit flies, extracts of a flower scent that is sexually alluring to butterflies, colored stakes and ribbons to mark special areas of scrutiny, piles of newspapers for pressing plant specimens, bottles of alcohol for preserving finds and lots of small plastic bags. In the project's 25-acre reserve, two hours north of Manaus by jeep, she has listed 350 species of trees with a trunk width of four inches or more. She estimated that a similar piece of forest in New England would yield no more than 20. ''And if you increased the area you wouldn't keep finding new ones the way you do here,'' she added. ''It's a pain to identify some of them,'' she said. ''Often you have to wait until it's been observed by the one specialist in the world on that particular tropical family.'' Under Dr. Bierregaard, the project's field director, team members have banded 7,000 birds, tracking their evolution and movements about the jungle by repeated captures. They use barely visible black nylon nets strung across the middle of the reserves at a six-foot level. The nets have ample give and do not harm the birds caught in them. Once they are checked for species, sex and feather molting and weighed on a hand scale, the birds are released, always in the same spot. One of the project's purposes is to measure the range of the 150 species thus far turned up, and one of its conclusions is that birds with wider ranges, like those that feed on swarming army ants, do not last long in the smaller areas. The data are recorded on cards and then entered into a computer located in Dr. Bierregaard's bedroom in Manaus, where an accumulating clutter of field equipment, literature and household gear has taken on a riotous tropical growth momentum of its own. The 25-acre reserve has already lost some of its monkey population only two years after being isolated by the cattlemen who turned the surrounding area into pasture land by burning it. Two saki monkeys were not able to find enough fruit trees and vanished. A band of golden-handed tamarin monkeys also disappeared, though howler monkeys, which eat foliage, seem to be adapting. In a 2.5-acre reserve created at the same time, the bird count soared, as avian populations from the torched areas flocked into the green patch in a phenomenon called ''influx,'' documented for the first time by the scientists on the project. Within 12 months, however, the numbers had fallen below pre-isolation levels, and they are still declining. Only two to four months after isolation the white-plumed and rufous-throated antbirds, two species that feed on the fleeing prey of army-ant hordes, were gone. The project has already marked off 23 reserves, ranging as large as 25,000 acres. Only the 2.5-acre and 25-acre reserves have been isolated so far, but the delay in clearing around the others is simply giving the scientists more time to study the makeup and behavior of the undisturbed ecological communities. Data from the larger reserves, which are expected to change less rapidly, will be used as control numbers for the smaller reserves. ''I wish we were walking through undisturbed forest, because it wouldn't be so quiet,'' said Dr. Bierregaard as he showed a visitor around the 25-acre section. The departure and extinction of so many birds had muted the dawn chorus. 'Weeds Will Take Over' The plant life has suffered from exposure to hot winds from the edges of the reserve and invasions of weedy plants from the second growths in the surrounding clearings. ''Eventually the seeds of the canopy species won't dominate and the weeds will take over,'' said Dr. Rankin, the project's botanical ecology study coordinator. ''In small reserves, these secondary species will strangle the others. In larger ones, they could reach an equilibrium.'' ''You know it's always said that every time you cut down the jungle, it fights its way back,'' said Dr. Bierregaard. ''But what comes back is not what was there before.'' Dr. Bierregaard said ranchers had been cooperative in letting the scientists come on their property. When the cattlemen are ready to burn areas marked for pasturage, they let Dr. Bierregaard know in advance so he can set up backfires to protect areas marked for reserves. Under an erratically enforced Brazilian law, people clearing land in the Amazon must leave 50 percent of it untouched, so the researchers are generally operating in parcels that could not be converted into grazing land anyway. In return, the cattlemen get the benefits of mapping surveys, environmental guidance and favorable reputations with bureaucrats in Brasilia who pass out development subsidies for the region. Dr. Bierregaard noted with satisfaction that one of the ranchers had returned a stolen bird net that had surfaced in a river town 160 miles away. Intrusions into the reserves by local colonizers ended abruptly when word spread that the bird nets could trap humans in a spidery death clutch. Dr. Bierregaard said he decided there was an advantage in not disavowing the rumor.

1458-> Minerals Found by Spaceship
An area potentially rich in gold, silver and other ore deposits has been discovered in a remote Mexican desert by a sensor carried on an American space shuttle flight. Minerals detected by the infrared radiometer indicate the area also might contain copper, lead and zinc, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said Thursday. But the agency cautioned that considerable exploration would be needed before it could be determined if the ores normally associated with such minerals were in the area. The site, three miles in diameter, is in the mountainous central Baja California desert. The space agency said the finding marked the first time a group of minerals typical of metal-rich areas had been pinpointed from space. The agency said mineral identifications made by the shuttle sensor were verified at the site last October by American and Mexican scientists lifted to the isolated site by helicopter. The instrument, carried aboard the shuttle Columbia's second manned flight in November 1981, identified iron oxide minerals, kaolinite clay and possibly alunite as constituents in the surface materials in the area. ''Areas containing these minerals are high-priority exploration sites for gold, silver, copper, lead and zinc deposits,'' according to Dr. Alexander F.H. Goetz of the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Dr. Lawrence C. Rowan of the United States Geological Survey.

1459-> Penn Loses Its First To Lafayette, 35-20
The quarterback Frank Novak set a school record for total yardage today to help the Lafayette upset previously undefeated Penn, 35-20. Novak passed for 195 yards and ran for 16 more, giving him a career total of 3,218 yards in three seasons. The junior quarterback from Leominster, Mass., also threw three touchdown passes, giving him another Lafayette career record of 25. After gaining only four yards on its first offensive series of the game, Lafayette took advantage of a Penn mistake for its first touchdown. Tim Chambers took a Lafayette punt and ran 63 yards for an apparent score, but a clipping penality nullified the play. On Penn's third down of the subsequent series, the defensive back Bob Mahr intercepted a pass giving Lafayette a first down on Penn's 23-yard line. Novak then threw his first touchdown pass of the game to Jack Gatehouse for 17 yards. Novak and Gatehouse connected for a 26-yard scoring pass in the second period as Lafayette took a 14-0 halftime lead. The Leopards dominated the statistics in the half, limiting Penn to only 33 yards rushing and 111 yards of total offense. Lafayette opened a 21-0 lead at the beginning of the third period when Novak and the fullback Craig Williams combined on a 34-yard scoring play. Penn scored its first touchdown, on the next series, on a 2-yard run by the fullback Chuck Nolan. Lafayette insured the outcome at the start of the fourth period, scoring on a 6-yard run by the halfback Nick Kowgios. Brown 38, Cornell 19 ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Bill Barrett and Rod Jones scored two touchdowns each for Brown. Jones put Brown in the lead for good with a 12-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. The play was set up by the recovery of Derrick Harmon's fumble. The victory lifted Brown's record to 3-2 over all and 2-2 in the Ivy League. Cornell is victoryless in five games, including three in the league. The Bruins capitalized on another turnover in the third period as Jeff Gradinger intercepted Jeff Hammond's pass. That set up a 29-yard field goal by Bud Brooks. Brown put the game out of reach with three scores in the fourth quarter. The first came on an 83-yard pass play, Joe Potter to Barrett. The others were ona 33-yard keeper by Potter and a 2-yard run by Barrett. Brown recovered two fumbles and intercepted three passes. Dartmouth 14, Harvard 12 HANOVER, N.H. (UPI) - Rick Stafford connected with John Olejniczak, a flanker, on a 68-yard touchdown pass play in the fourth quarter to lead Dartmouth. Dartmouth prevented a possible game-tying, 2-point conversion late in the fourth quarter to preserve its first victory of the season. Dartmouth marched for the winning score in six plays, with Stafford hitting Olejniczak for the longest touchdown pass completed in the 86 meetings between the teams. It was the sixth longest scoring pass in Dartmouth history. After Harvard scored on a field goal, Dartmouth put its first touchdown on the board in the second quarter. The Big Green drove 76 yards in a series culminated by an 8-yard scoring run by Sean Maher. It was the first time this season Dartmouth had lead in a game. The victory improved Dartmouth's record to 1-4 and 1-1 in the league; Harvard is 3-2 and 2-1.

1462-> POP: JEFFERSON STARSHIP
THE JEFFERSON STARSHIP that performed at the Byrne Arena, in East Rutherford, N.J., is a different animal from the Jefferson Airplane-Jefferson Starship axis that produced powerfully exhortatory folkrock in the 1960's and 70's. The San Francisco-based septet is now a hard-rock band in which the founder, Paul Kantner, and the most famous member, Grace Slick, play subsidiary roles. Marty Balin, whose urgent duets with Miss Slick highlighted the group's 60's and 70's concerts, has been replaced by a hard-rock belter, Mickey Thomas. The bassist Pete Sears does a good chunk of the songwriting. The lead guitarist, Craig Chaquico, favors long blues codas on any and all the group's songs. And the new drummer, Don Baldwin, plays essentially one rhythm - a pile-driving parade strut. To one who saw the Starship at its zenith, Saturday's concert was nothing less than a painful travesty of the past. Of the group's many new songs, not one stood out as distinguished. Alternating between speech-song and harmony vocalizing, Grace Slick showed little of her old fire. Mr. Sears and Mr. Baldwin each took a dreadful instrumental solo. Even the Starship's standards, like ''Somebody to Love'' and ''White Rabbit,'' were cut to ribbons by Mr. Baldwin's jackhammer drum attacks, which all but drowned out the singers. It was a sad night for San Francisco rock. Stephen Holden

1465-> RENTAL LIBRARIES ENJOYING COMEBACK
One of the most avid patrons of the Womrath Book Store at 971 Lexington Avenue in New York is a fireman who regularly stocks up on popular fiction, spy stories and mysteries. The Anderson's Book Shop in Larchmont, N.Y., sends about 10 books a week to a woman who rarely sets foot inside the store. A woman in Texas reads so many books that the owner of the Cobler Book Stores in Houston says, ''I don't think she bothers to sleep.'' What all three readers have in common is that they rent rather than buy their books. These days such readers have a lot of company, because lending libraries, which seemed to have faded from sight after being in practically every drugstore and candy store in the years immediately after World War II, are enjoying a modest comeback. ''The rental business has never been so good,'' said Bill Buschel, owner of Anderson's, one of a growing number of bookstores that are stocking and servicing their own lending libraries. ''For a while television cut into lending libraries, but there's been a definite upsurge in recent times,'' said John Martin, president of Womrath Rental Libraries, which has 300 lending libraries in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Womrath once owned more than 50 bookstores in the New York area alone, all with rental libraries, but it sold them years ago. A few bookstores still carry the Womrath name and maintain lending libraries, but they are independently owned and operated. Paperbacks' Price Rises Mr. Buschel recalled that there were about four wholesale library companies in the metropolitan New York area after the war, including Womrath, and five other lending libraries in Larchmont alone. What destroyed much of the rental business, by all accounts, was not only television, which changed the leisure-time habits of many readers, but also the popularity of the ubiquitous paperback book. Throughout the 1940's paperbacks sold for only 25 cents, finally rising to 35 cents in 1950, then up to 50 cents in 1951 with the publication of John O'Hara's ''A Rage to Live.'' By contrast, hardcover best sellers were typically renting for 15 cents for the first three days. It simply became easier to buy books than rent them. The reason that lending libraries are thriving again can also be traced to a changing economic picture. Nowadays hardcover novels increasingly sell for between $15 and $20, and popular paperbacks, once so cheap that they drove rental libraries out of business, sell for $5 and $6. By contrast, lending libraries again seem like a bargain to many readers, charging $1.25 to $2 for the first three days, and from 10 cents to 40 cents for each additional day. ''Our minimum rental is less than the sales tax alone on the average hardcover books,'' Mr. Martin said. Moreover, in contrast to the experience at many public libraries, there is scant waiting time for a best-seller. No Space for Collections Some readers prefer to rent for still other reasons. ''Some of them live in apartments and don't have space to collect books,'' said Dan Gross, owner of a Womrath Book Store in Bronxville, N.Y. Mrs. David Knapp, owner of Cobler Book Stores, said, ''Many people want to read books that they might not want to have in their personal libraries.'' They could always wait for the lower-priced paperbacks, of course, but Judy Goldberg, manager of the Womrath Book Store on Lexington Avenue between 70th and 71st Streets, said that rental customers usually did not want to wait a year; indeed, some of her customers are such avid readers that they rent a book in the morning and return it the same night. Besides, these days there is no assurance that middle-list fiction will be reprinted in paperback. Independent operators service lending libraries from their own stock, although Womrath Rental Libraries employs four representatives to service accounts, replenishing the usual 75 to 300 titles at weekly or monthly intervals. Either way, the libraries' standard fare is popular fiction, mysteries, and an occasional celebrity biography. The Anderson store carries at least 400 titles in its lending library at any given time, most of them fiction. ''The public libraries in Westchester County are better with nonfiction,'' said Mr. Buschel. But in contrast to the one or two best-selling novels carried in most public libraries, he said, Anderson's may carry 25 copies. As their popularity wanes, they are withdrawn from circulation and sold at the store's twice-a-year usedbook sale. Three- to Four-Day Rentals Salamack's Card Shop in Schenectady, N.Y., which is served by Womrath, usually has two copies of the most popular novels. Customers keep books an average of three or four days, although, according to Colleen O'Connor, Salamack's owner, ''A few will keep one out for 10 days, but by then they'd be better off if they bought it.'' In the past, customers of lending libraries were predominantly middle-aged women. They still make up the majority, by all accounts, but the recent popularity of rental books has attracted many men also. Some corporations are now maintaining reduced-rate lending libraries for employees. Three Citibank employee clubs in New York have Womrath libraries, according to Mr. Martin, and so does the Avon Products headquarters in Manhattan. An Avon spokesman said that its library consisted of about 100 titles, available to employees without charge. Most store owners report only modest direct profits from their lending libraries, but all of them say that the indirect benefits are substantial. ''It's a traffic builder,'' said Robert Gold, owner of the Bodleian Book Shop in Harrison, N.Y. ''People come in to rent books and they wind up buying cards, gifts or even other books. Even customers who rent as many as eight books at a time still buy books.'' Nevertheless, general-interest lending libraries are relatively rare beyond the Middle Atlantic states. ''We're the only ones in Houston and the only ones I know of anywhere in these parts,'' said Mrs. David of the Cobler Book Stores. Mr. Buschel, among others, finds the lack of lending libraries elsewhere a paradox. ''I really can't explain it,'' he said. ''It's a very profitable operation by itself, it certainly sells books, and independent book stores need all the help they can get.'' Ray Thompson, general manager of McNaughton Book Service, a company in Williamsport, Pa., that leases books to 4,800 public libraries in the United States, said the explanation might lie in the fact that ''the rental business is different from the established way of doing business.'' He added, ''Most book dealers still have this gut reaction that rentals deprive them of sales, when that isn't the case.''

1466-> DESIGNERS FORSAKE FORMALITY IN A SPRING ACCESSORY SPREE
Straw hats with shallow crowns and wide brims skim over tailored suits, complemented at the other end of the body by delicate shoes with tall, skinny heels, sending most of the mannequins, who are at least 5 feet 8 inches tall in their bare feet, to well over the 6-foot mark. There is as a result plenty of room for gobs of glittering jewelry including drop earrings, massive necklaces and bracelets. Waistlines are cinched in by wide belts, often of patent leather, and fitted snugly. In the recent introduction of spring fashion collections, gloves are either crocheted in lacy patterns or made of supple kid, with contrasting cuffs and other decorative treatments. Over-the-elbow gloves, not seen in fashion shows for more than a decade, have returned with evening dresses. Lace handkerchiefs peek from pockets and in at least one show, Calvin Klein's, mannequins carried them in their fingertips as if they were fans. Severe and Distinguished The preoccupation of most designers with more formal, fitted clothes has led them to an emphasis on accessories that has not been seen since the birth of the miniskirt. Wild, unkempt hairdos, including the casual, windswept look, have been replaced by close-tothe-head cuts that look severe and distinguished, never uncontrolled. All this is being presented for spring, a season that as recently as last year was largely ignored by fashion designers. They then concentrated strongly on warm-weather cotton and linen clothes that would fit easily into summer vacation wardrobes and serve more appropriately for weekends in the country than as daily fare for working women. Undoubtedly the need for clothes for the rapidly growing number of women who are climbing the corporate ladder, entering the professions and otherwise joining the work force has contributed to the more structured clothes that designers are offering for the spring season. That, at least, is a more valid reason for the return to more formal designs than the belief that women throughout the country are going to get all decked out for Easter Sunday as they did years ago, in flower hats and all that. A Return of Hats There are no flowers these days, but cartwheel hats with sweeping brims, moderate-size sailor hats and plenty of variations, such as Bill Blass's upside-down punch bowl that could hold enough drinks for a dinner for 10. Mr. Blass feels sufficiently confident about the return of hats that he shows them with cocktail dresses and dinner suits as well as day clothes, feeling they represent both ''chic and glamour.'' The hats are by Lee Black who designed them for Mr. Blass and is selling them to stores. Calvin Klein is enthusiastic about them too, but he says women can wear his clothes without them as well. ''With hats, the clothes look more sophisticated,'' he said. ''Without them they're more easy or natural.'' He observed, ''At one time, say the mid-70's, I would never have dreamed of showing hats with my clothes - it used to be a fashion show trick - but I find people are thinking about hats today and more are wearing them.'' Not only hats, but ''the right shoe, the right jewelry'' are important, he believes. The shoe shown most often with his clothes was a high-heel style with a wide ankle strap by Manolo Blahnik. In addition to masses of colored stones in necklaces and earrings, he was fond of an antique watch fob he found in an antiques store and had reproduced. He clips it on a lapel and tucks it into the breast pocket of many suits. Fernando Sanchez was so pleased with the jewelry that accompanied his clothes that he credited the designer, Richard Serbin, who also supplied the extra glitter for other fashion shows. Mr. Sanchez said he designed the belts himself. Giorgio Sant'Angelo considered coiffures so important that he asked Christiaan, hairdresser to many of Seventh Avenue's most prominent models, to stay around during his informal show and keep touching up as they made their changes. ''Not down,'' said Christiaan as he wielded his comb. ''The hair must be up around the ear lobes and swirl close to the head.'' There are any number of glittering extras on the spring clothes that were just introduced, from Ralph Lauren's modest string of pearls to Perry Ellis's five-inch-wide belts with silver buckles. Oscar de la Renta used silk flowers at the base of evening decolletages and silk bows at the necklines of tailored suits. Geoffrey Beene was enamored of lacy stockings and many designers found lacy gloves for their models to wear. These supplemented the leather gloves for both day and evening. It is all part of a growing sense of formality in clothes and a drastic change from the days only a few years ago when Elsa Peretti's crooked silver heart and a pair of string gloves was all the decoration that was needed. From the way things look, it will certainly take women more time to get dressed in the morning.

1468-> LOCKHEED'S GRIP ON WASHINGTON
AFTER more than a decade of debate about how to revamp the military's fleet of cargo planes, both Congress and the Pentagon seem determined to purchase the C-5B - a cargo carrier that is just about identical to an older, troubled and highly criticized plane made by the Lockheed Corporation. Which only goes to show, as a former Pentagon official recently wrote, that in Washington's wars of military procurement, it is better to be on Lockheed's side than against it. Lockheed is, indeed, a tough opponent. And after one of the hardest-fought lobbying efforts in some time, the aerospace company is just days away from signing a contract for 50 of these carriers - a $9 billion deal that would be the single largest military order in its history. When the ink is dry, Lockheed will have outflanked McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, its two biggest competitors, outsmarted some of the Capitol's leading Congressmen and demonstrated its ability to influence a government - one on the verge of its biggest military buildup ever. That ability to sway Washington's civilian leaders - even in the face of opposition from the military - may now be more crucial than ever for Lockheed. After a $466 million write-off for its now-defunct L-1011 Tristar passenger plane late last year and its virtual withdrawl from the commercial airline market, the company is counting on military orders for just about all of its business. Lockheed is for now ''90 percent military to 10 percent civilian,'' says Roy Anderson, chairman of the company, which last year racked up $5 billion in sales. And while he would ultimately like to increase the percentage of nonmilitary business, one of his first goals is to take funds freed from the demise of the Tristar program to ''diversify in our core businesses'' and to exploit sales opportunities in military space programs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and the stealth aircraft development effort. BUT if the past is any indication, there could be stumbling blocks i n the way. In one of its traditional core businesses - military c argo planes - Lockheed has in recent years had difficulty winning d esign competitions and building affordable trouble-free aircraft. A lthough it has a monopoly on such planes, it has in recent years s pent more time modifying air carriers built years ago than it has inb uilding new ones. In fact, one of Lockheed's current contracts with t he Government is a $1.2 billion program to replace the wings on 77 C -5A's, the predecessors of the new C-5B's. The wings had proved too w eak to last the predicted lifetime of the big transports. Of course Lockheed's new contract for the C-5B's, which are to be used in the Rapid Deployment Force, would return the company to the business of building aircraft. Some financial analysts, however, are worried about the possibility that by making a fixed-price bid for the C-5B - a feature that helped Lockheed win the award - the company might find itself in a bind similar to the one caused by its failure to provide budget safeguards for the C-5A's, and which ultimately resulted in $2 billion in cost overruns, much of it absorbed by Lockheed. This not only embarrassed the Air Force, but came close to killing Lockheed, which only survived because of its $250 million in loan guarantees provided by the Federal Government in 1971. Things will be different this time, says Mr. Anderson, who points out that, with the rewinging program and the spare parts production from the older C-5A, Lockheed is already producing ''50 percent'' of the new C-5B aircraft. He expects that plane to ''provide normal profitability'' and calls the entire contract a ''manufacturing guy's dream.'' As good as the C-5B production plan may have looked on paper, it was the intense lobbying campaign in Washington that clinched the deal for Lockheed. IN September 1981, a month after the McDonnell Douglas company had won a design competition for a new strategic mililtary cargo plane with its C-17, Lockheed submitted an unsolicited proposal to sell the Air Force instead a new fleet of Lockheed's giant C-5A Galaxy air cargo planes, the largest military transport in the world. The Defense Department's civilian leadership decided in favor of Lockheed. When the Boeing company entered the competition in March with its own unsolicited proposal to sell 747 freight planes, Lockheed, fervently assisted by the Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger, and Deputy Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, ultimately won an epic lobbying battle in both houses of Congress, working its way around Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and Representative Joseph P. Addabbo of New York, among others. By late last week it seemed likely that the Defense Department would sign a go-ahead contract - a contract that critics said the Air Force was trying to rush through before more adverse comment on the cost, delivery schedules and performance of the aircraft was made. Lockheed's ability to maneuver deftly in familiar waters was also demonstrated late last year, when the Department of Defense decided to suspend for five years Navy procurement of the company's turboprop, four-engine anti-submarine patrol plane, the P-3C Orion. AFTER the company protested that this decision would place the Lockheed California division in ''great jeopardy,'' the Pentagon continued P-3C procurement at six aircraft a year, a rate high enough to encourage continued sales to foreign navies. Speaking in an interview of the ''bumps'' the company had encountered and of ''all the things we have been through,'' Mr. Anderson said ''we're recovering rapidly.'' Many investors and financial analysts seem to agree, and the writeoff of the L-10ll airliner program seemed to bring sighs of relief both inside and outside the company, not to mention higher earnings. In this year's second quarter Lockheed reported profits of $51.8 million, up from $14.8 million, a year earlier. And some Wall Street analysts expects the company's earnings to rocket from $9.50 a share this year to $16 a share in 1985. ''We could build a good widebody commercial jet but we didn't know the civilian market as well as our competitors,'' said Richard Cook, Lockheed's vice president for Washington and governmental affairs. ''The domestic and foreign military market is something we do know very well.'' Indeed Lockheed, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year, is one of the great and quintessential defense contractors. For practical purposes it has nearly monopolized the field of military airlift for several decades. All three of the Air Force strategic air cargo planes now in service are Lockheed products: the C-5A, the C-141 and the C-130 propellor-driven Hercules. The latter is an acknowledged classic airplane - a veteran of Congo airdrops, numerous wars, the Israeli raid on Entebbe and other encounters. More than 1,650 C-130's have been sold to 56 governments, and three aircraft a month are now being produced at the Georgia Lockheed line at Marietta, just outside Atlanta. However, Mr. Anderson said that ''despite our image as an airplane company, Lockheed is much more diversified than many people seem to realize.'' The Lockheed Missile and Space Company, now centered at Sunnyvale, Calif., already accounts for about half of the parent corporation's 1981 sales of $5.1 billion and is the largest of Lockheed's 13 operating companies. It also seems likely to be the one that will grow most quickly. Robert A. Fuhrman, president of the missile and space operation, which has produced all of the fleet ballistic missiles used by United States nuclear missile submarines, said that such nuclear-armed missiles now constitute about 40 percent of the divisions' $2.5 billion annual sales. Another 40 percent of its business has been in military space systems, with the remaining 20 percent of sales in everything else, much of which is highly classified. Mr. Fuhrman said that development work on the D-5, or ''Trident II'' missile, with which the new Trident class of nuclear submarines will eventully be armed, will probably be the company's biggest business in 1983. The D-5 is to be designed with such a substantial improvement in missile accuracy over existing sea-launched missiles that many military analysts think it might achieve the accuracy needed to make production of the land-based MX missile unnecessary. In any case, it is expected to be the strongest leg of the United States nuclear triad for several decades. And because missile submarines have many launch tubes, Lockheed production orders may be substantial. The Reagan Administration's planned emphasis on military applications of space technology and on an $18 billion, five-year plan to improve ''command, control, communications and intelligence'' systems for controlling strategic military power also seems to mesh with technological strengths of Lockheed. Lockheed is already doing research and development work on equipment intended to spot targets for space-based lasers and to point and track those lasers. Although it may be many years before space-based laser weapons are militarily workable - if they ever are - such systems could eventually provide a method of ballistic missile defense against Soviet missiles by attacking fleets of missiles in the first few minutes after launching. The missile and space operation is currently involved in design competitions against other defense contractors for important elements of a Milstar communications satellite that is expected to be a cornerstone of the new command and control system envisoned in the Defense Department five-year plan. It will also be involved next year in a competition with Boeing and General Dynamics for the ''advanced cruise missile.'' Company officials cannot discuss that highly classified project, nor many others. However, aerospace trade journals, Pentagon sources and the Washington grapevine have left no doubt that Lockheed is one of two corporations most deeply involved in so-called stealth technology aimed at using advanced shapes, materials, nonreflective surfaces and other methods to make aircraft and missiles nearly invisible to hostile radars. Pentagon officials do not deny that Lockheed is working at technology for a Stealth fighter-reconnaisance plane while Northrup works on Stealth Bomber techniques. However, last March Lockheed also signed a memorandum of understanding with Rockwell in which the two companies are believed to have agreed to try to develop a stealth version of Rockwell's B-1B bomber, to be called the B-1C. In some ways and to some outside analysts, Lockheed's strongest technological base now seems to be in its larger, but lesser known, operations such as missiles and space and some of its smaller operations such as shipbuilding. After selling the last 14 Tristars sometime next year, Mr. Anderson said ''our whole capital structure will be changed'' and equity will hopefully exceed debt, something that Lockheed has not enjoyed for a long time. However, Lockheed, which survived bad times partly because of its ability to operate with political success in Washington, is not likely to neglect that effort. Last summer's lobby battle with Boeing and others, Mr. Anderson claimed, was in ''self-defense.'' ''Our main customer is really the Department of Defense,'' he said. ''I think most of our selling, and we do sell, should be done at the Department of Defense level.'' However, Lockheed has shown it is no more willing than its corporate rivals to accept without appeal or without battle decisions that might harm its interests. An official of a rival company, asking not to be identified, said, ''The Defense Department has said that the 51st airlift plane produced after the production run on the C-5B's will be a new plane. But I have a feeling that the 51st plane may be another C-5.''

1474-> ART; MUSEUMS ARE AGLITTER FOR CHRISTMAS
SO MANY art museum exhibitions are shot through with such sobriety of intent, grandeur of purpose and single-minded resolve that a respite is welcome. That respite comes at different times, but particularly during the Christmas holidays. That is when the exhibitions become a little less serious, grand and resolute. Also, they are often much more amusing, delightfully warm and joyous in keeping with the spirit of the season. Because of financial hardships and extensive belt-tightening, the displays this year may not be so splendidly ambitious as before, but they are certainly worth visiting for their jolly variety and liveliness of mood. Following is a sampling of exhibitions in some of the New Jersey museums: The Newark Museum has made a tradition of celebrating a Victorian Christmas. This is fitting, since part of the museum is the Ballantine House, a Victorian structure that exalts its Victorian essence from the brick in the foundation to the wood in the rafters. The house is a time capsule and, because of the complete authenticity of the structure and its furnishings, visitors can experience a Victorian yuletide to the fullest. The tree in the house is decorated with genuine Victorian ornaments, the table is set for an elegant Victorian dinner and every knicknack, lamp and bauble are of the style that is so popular today. New this year is the display in the little Music Room. There, items that might have been Victorian gifts are given attention, such as a sugar box, beautiful glass and ceramic objects, candlesticks and porcelain pieces. The Montclair Art Museum has an outstanding collection of its own, and it seems to be vast enough that it can be drawn on for nearly every kind of occasion, including Christmas. On view from the collection are Italian and northern European works from the Gothic and Renaissance periods. One of the most remarkable examples in the show is the ''Madonna of Humility'' by Jacopo di Cione. This painting can be found among notable engravings by Martin Schongauer, Rembrandt and Durer, etchings and French and Flemish tapestries of the 17th and 18th centuries. The Monmouth Museum, on the campus of Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, has been known for its presentation of Christmas trees with different national ornaments. Even though these are missing this year, there are five trees decorated with puppets and handmade gewgaws. One tree also recalls Victoriana. Most fascinating is the display of puppets in an opulent variety of shapes, colors and personalities. Among them we can recognize Punch and Judy and Pinocchio. Some of the puppets are by Jim Henson, the imaginative creator of the Muppets. The Morris Museum of Arts and Sciences in Morristown has a 10-foot Victorian tree adorned with handmade ornaments, along with a singular selection of toy boats from the Forbes magazine collection. Landlubbers who like to view seagoing vessels on terra firma can learn a lot about different kinds of battleships, pleasure boats, river boats and ocean liners. And maybe they can learn, by looking closely, the difference between a sloop, a yawl and a ketch and, yes, the difference between a boat and a ship. Some craft in the exhibition are more than 100 years old, and many were made by some of the best French and German companies specializing in the construction of such vessels. As a result, the accuracy of their detail draws admiration. These toy boats may not be everybody's cup of eggnog at Christmas; however, with a bit of imagination, they can take us anywhere we want to go. And that definitely is a great gift for anyone. The Summit Art Center probably has the most unusual Christmas display. It is simply one Christmas tree, a balsam about seven feet tall, and it has not one decoration on it. ''I simply wanted a tree with an understated elegance,'' said Paul Master-Karnik, the museum's director, ''and the only way to get what I wanted was a tree without decoration. ''Every day, somebody comes by and urgently wants to put something on it. But no. I want people to look at the tree for what it is - a tree, a bit of nature brought from the outside to the inside.'' Mr. Master-Karnik may have a valid point. There are those who have said that less is more, and there is no reason why that dictum should not apply to Christmas trees. And certainly minimalism is a respectable style that has not yet lost its impact, even at Christmas.

1475-> FILM STUDIOS AND ABC NEGOTIATE FOR SHOWTIME
Two major movie studios and a television network apparently are on the verge of purchasing the major share of Showtime, the second-largest pay-cable programming service. According to a source close to the situation, Columbia Pictures, 20th Century-Fox and ABC are negotiating to buy the service, which offers movies in exchange for a subscriber fee additional to that paid for the basic cable service. The deal is expected to be completed within three weeks. Viacom, the owner of Showtime, has been searching for a partner for the service, which has 3.5 million subscribers but which lags far behind the pay-cable network leader, Home Box Office, with 11 million subscribers. Last week, the third-largest pay-cable channel, the Movie Channel, which has 2.2 million subscribers, was purchased by Paramount Pictures, Universal and Warner Bros. Control Over Distribution A senior executive at one of the companies involved said that it was important for the film makers to regain the control over the distribution of their product that they have lost in the last few years, especially to Home Box Office, the cable service owned by Time Inc. He indicated that the deal could go beyond Showtime to include other cable services that would allow for the possibility of payper-view. The studios have long been unhappy about the fees they receive from cable television for their films. By gaining a cable service themselves, the studios would be in a better position, they believe, to market their films for higher prices. ''The studios feel they missed the boat by allowing Home Box Office to become a middleman between their product and the subscribers,'' said Jane Hall, editor of View, an industry trade publication, at the National Cable Television Association's second annual programming conference in Los Angeles last weekend. ''They are now scrambling to get onto what they feel may be the last boat, the last opportunity to get into the national pay market.'' TV 'Life After Movies' Up to now, the programming on the five biggest pay-cable channels has consisted primarily of movies, with many of the services playing the same movies at the same time. At the weekend conference a panel discussion on ''Life After Movies: What Else Will Make Pay?'' was thronged, but the panel of experts offered only platitudes and the rueful concession that ''the challenge is to broaden the scope of the appeal of original programming.'' According to Paul Kagan, a leading analyst of the cable industry, the key issues in pay-cable this year are the growing interest in pay-per-view, the differentiation of the pay-cable networks, and ''the shootout between the movie studios and HBO over HBO's pre-buys of unfinished movies.'' Mr. Kagan said, ''The Movie Channel purchase is an example of the pressure the studios feel over who is going to own pay-television rights to major movies.'' HBO has exclusively bought new movies from Columbia, Orion and numerous independent producers. Because of its domination of the market, it has also traditionally been able to buy movies for less than the studios feel they are worth. A joke circling the conference yesterday concerned a studio executive who was asked when Home Box Office would have less than 60 percent of pay-cable subscribers and who answered, ''I get out of bed every morning wondering when they'll have 100 percent.'' Fear of Antitrust Action Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros. probably will not try to restrict their movies exclusively to the Movie Channel; an earlier attempt to enter pay-cable was voided on antitrust grounds over that issue. But it is expected that the three companies might ask high prices that only the Movie Channel will be willing to pay. Over the last six months a larger amount of original programming has begun to appear on both HBO and Showtime. Because many subscribers now buy more than one pay-channel, with each channel costing subscribers $8 to $12 extra per month, the pay-channels are trying vigorously to differentiate themselves. Showtime is moving heavily into creating original series and serials more mature in theme and more racy in execution than would be allowed by television network censors. In ''The Lone Star Bar and Grill'' - a series of 90-minute shows now being written by Brad Radnitz and Pat Falken Smith, a former head writer for soap operas - the owner of the bar, who is paralyzed and impotent because of a car accident, fantasizes about his wife in their hot tub with his best friend. Disconnect Rate Watched ''Once you get a subscriber, you want to retain him,'' said Mike Weinblatt, president of Showtime. ''After you show a movie, you're no better or worse off with the subscriber than you were before. But if he gets hooked on a series, you'll keep him.'' One problem that has come to the surface in the last several months is the high ''churn,'' or disconnect, rate in pay-cable, especially among subscribers who have been enticed into sampling three or four pay services by low-price introductory offers. Churn rates are as high as 50 percent a year on some cable systems. ''Showtime is staffed by ex-network personel, and its format plays more like a television network,'' said Mr. Kagan, ''while HBO is positioning itself as a big-event service.'' Pay-per-view, in which the subscriber pays a special $8 to $15 fee for one boxing match, movie or concert, is looked on by the movie studios as the solution to many of their problems. However, Robert Wright, president of Cox Cable, told a panel that though pay-perview generates revenue, cable systems can't make any profit with the 50-50 or 60-40 split of the money that the movie studios are demanding.

1477-> 2 BASQUES SUSPECTED OF PLOT TO KILL POPE ON HIS SPANISH TRIP
Two Basque separatists arrested in France are believed to have plotted to assassinate Pope John Paul II during his trip to Spain, press reports said today. The reports said a warning from Prime Minister-elect Felipe Gonzalez to Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy of France led to the arrests. The Spanish national press agency, citing sources of ''absolute confidence,'' said Peio Antxola Larranaga and Carlos Ibarguren, both considered top figures in the Basque separatist movement, ''are suspected of being involved in preparing an attack against John Paul II that was to be carried out in the Basque country.'' French police arrested Messrs. Larranaga and Ibarguren with two other Basques, Sabin Zabieta and Zabala Sarria, on Saturday. According to a report in the Spanish newspaper Diario 16, the arrests in the French Basque city of Saint-Jean-de-Luz followed a telephone call from Mr. Gonzalez to Mr. Mauroy warning of possible Basque action against the Pope. The paper said Mr. Gonzalez had been told Friday about evidence of the plot. The press agency said Spanish security officials and the Pope's bodyguards were filled in and protection was increased for the papal visit Saturday to Loyola, the birthplace of St. Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuit order. Messrs. Antxola, Ibarguren and Zabieta were arraigned Monday on charges of membership in a criminal organization. Mr. Antxola also faced charges of resisting arrest, possession of forged Spanish identity papers and violation of a 10-year-old order banning his entry into France. Mr. Sarria was released on his own recognizance.

1479-> Odds Seen Slim for Rise in Soviet Trade
While President Reagan's removal of sanctions against companies participating in the Soviet gas pipeline project is a step to ease a bilateral economic strain, many businessmen and experts expressed skepticism yesterday that it would result in increased trade with the Soviet Union. ''It will be an uphill battle for us and all American companies to re-establish credibility in the Soviet market,'' said M. Scott Nickson Jr., vice president and general counsel of Dresser Industries, the Dallas-based oil and gas supply company whose French subsidiary has a major pipeline contract. ''We are concerned that Dresser and all American companies will be suspected of being unreliable suppliers for some time,'' he added. Restoring lost confidence among potential Soviet customers is a major goal of some 225 American members of the Soviet-U.S. Trade and Economic Council Inc., a business-sponsored group that is meeting this week in Moscow. Soviet Economic Constraints But some experts said that economic constraints on the Soviet Union seem to preclude a rapid increase in trade, in any case. ''From a trade perspective, what has happened is basically irrelevant,'' said Lawrence J. Brainard, vice president and chief international economist at the Bankers Trust Company. ''Economic factors will determine future Soviet trade patterns, and they don't have any money. As a result, they feel they can't afford to take the risk of investing huge amounts of funds in new projects.'' Another banker, who refused to be identified, was even more pointed. ''Trade with the Soviet Union is history as far as American manufactured goods and big projects are concerned,'' he said. ''That is something that people in this Administration wanted,'' he added. ''We may sell some components, but I can't see any sort of revival occurring.'' But Marshall I. Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard, and a specialist in Soviet economics, disagreed. Stepped-Up Oil Sales Seen ''The Soviets clearly have structural economic problems,'' he said. ''But in the last six months they have significantly stepped up their petroleum exports to hard-currency countries, and that has helped their foreign exchange position enormously.'' Largely as a result of the oil sales, Mr. Goldman said, Soviet export earnings during the first half of 1982 rose 33 percent, or $2.6 billion, from levels a year earlier. ''It's difficult to predict what will happen,'' he added, ''but I think they will take advantage of the change created by the lifting of sanctions, and offer some contracts.'' Until the President made his decision, Mr. Goldman added, ''the Japanese and Western Europeans had a decided advantage in that market. Now I'm not so sure.'' Compared with other countries, America's trade volume with the Soviet Union has never been large. According to Commerce Department figures, American exports to the Soviet Union reached a peak in 1979, at $3.6 billion; of that total, 80 percent was in agricultural products. And despite American sanctions imposed in retaliation for Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the imposition of martial law in Poland, neither the size nor the composition of exports has changed much. First-Half Exports $2 Billion Through the first six months of 1982, said Hertha W. Heiss, director of the Soviet division at the Commerce Department, the United States shipped $2 billion worth of goods to the Soviet Union. As was the case three years ago, agricultural exports represent 80 percent of that total. According to one expert, however, the chances of selling the Russians more grain seem poor for the time being. ''The Soviets have shifted to other countries as a preferred source for grain,'' said Martin Abel, senior vice president at Schnittker Associates, a consulting firm based in Washington. ''They will continue to buy corn from us, but we are going to have to re-establish ourselves as a reliable and preferred supplier. That will take time.'' Companies affected by the sanctions, though pleased that they had been lifted, were cautious about their prospects for retrieving lost business. ''We are still assessing what the immediate impact will be,'' said Jack B. Gatzemeyer, general manager of General Electric's international gas turbine department in Schenectady, N.Y. ''We don't know if the Russians are going to want to buy our motors.'' Since the sanctions were imposed in two phases, the first last December and the second in June, and affect sales of equipment and technology manufactured both here and overseas, estimates about their cost in lost export contracts and licenses to American companies range widely -from $300 million to $1.6 billion. ''Some business will be irretrievably lost,'' Mrs. Heiss said. ''But some of these longer-term delivery contracts will probably be able to go on.''

To the Editor: Regarding the letter about those nonconvertible, leftover coins brought home from foreign lands (Travel, Aug. 29), my wife and I dispose of them in a way that we think is pleasant and practical. We put the coins aside until friends are about to take off for those same lands and give them the coins as bon voyage presents. When you light on foreign soil some change in the local currency comes in handy for those first tips or snacks or postcards or whatever. ARTHUR WILMURT Provincetown, Mass.

1481-> WINED AND DINED, HUSSEIN STILL NIBBLES AT REAGAN'S PLAN
WASHINGTON NEARLY four months after President Reagan appealed for ''a fresh start'' toward peace in the Middle East, it may be saying a lot to simply report that the American initiative is still alive. The effort to get Arabs and Israelis to talk to each other has been frustrating, as expected, but its ''shelf life'' - as one official put it - ''has not yet expired.'' King Hussein of Jordan, whose participation is central to the Reagan plan, passed through Washington last week and was subjected to intense behind-the-scenes exhortations. Mr. Reagan and Secretary of State George P. Shultz (who dined with him twice) urged him to screw up his courage and agree to join Egypt, Israel and the United States in talks to end the impasse over Palestinian rights in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. No Arab leader has been more supportive of Mr. Reagan's efforts. As the King left the White House after a second meeting, Mr. Reagan and his aides went to some lengths to appear optimimistic about the week's results. ''We've made significant progress toward peace,'' the President said, adding that, despite a tough road ahead, direct negotiations were ''within our reach.'' Nevertheless, the King refrained from taking the big step and announcing he would, after all, join the talks. He has survived coup attempts, assassins, a crushing military defeat by Israel in 1967 and a full-scale revolt by Palestinians in 1970. But he made it clear well before his arrival in Washington that conditions were not yet ripe for taking the lead in the Reagan peace process. He was not interested in repeating the dramatic go-it-alone approach of the late Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, who ended up isolated in the Arab world after his trip to Israel in 1977. He will mfe, Hussein has said, when Israel makes some visible concessions to the local Palestinians such as agreeing to stop new Jewish settlements in the West Bank, and when the Palestine Liberation Organization and such influential Arab states as Saudi Arabia publicly give him a green light. So far, no such encouraging signs have appeared. Mr. Reagan's negotiators are aware that the Middle East is replete with peace plans that rocketed like Mr. Reagan's onto the political scene with tremendous publicity, only to fall months later into oblivion. They are saying that the Reagan initiative, despite its rejection by the Government of Prime Minister Menachem Begin and the skittishness of the Arabs, is not dead yet. They are wary of setting deadlines, but the common view seems to be that the Administration has until next spring or summer to get something going before the plan dies. This will mean that American diplomats have to continue to press not only the Israelis, but the Saudis and other Arabs for steps that will allow King Hussein to join the process. When Mr. Reagan made his Sept. 1 address on the Middle East, it was recognized also that little was likely to happen on such sweeping questions as Palestinian rights until the situation in Lebanon was sorted out. The Egyptians and Jordanians were not going to negotiate on Palestinian rights with the Israelis until the Israelis withdrew their troops from Lebanon. The Israelis, in turn, were not going to pull out until they had a political deal with the Lebanese - to demonstrate to the Israeli public that the invasion produced tangible political results such as recognition by some other Middle East country besides Egypt - and until there was an arrangement worked out for the Syrians and the P.L.O. also to withdraw. All these conditions should have set off warning signals in Washington, but strangely, Philip C. Habib, the special negotiator, believed that he could bring about the withdrawal of foreign troops by the end of the year. His relative optimism led Mr. Reagan to recommit American marines to the so-called multinational force of Italians and French, thinking they would also be gone by Dec. 31. When the Administration realized earlier this month that its target date would not be met, frustration set in at the White House and Mr. Reagan sent toughly worded messages to Mr. Begin to stop stalling. The Begin Government, looking for some way of softening its image without appearing to yield to American pressure, resorted to what may have been some diplomatic sleight-of-hand. The Israelis announced that Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, the most anti-American of the Israeli leaders, had secretly negotiated a framework agreement with special Lebanese envoys not only on withdrawal, but also on security arrangements in southern Lebanon and on political normalization. Difficult Decisions Ahead As a result, the Israelis said they would be willing to drop their insistence that some of the talks be held in Jerusalem, a condition rejected by the Lebanese because of the Arab refusal to recognize Israeli sovereignty over eastern section of the city. The Lebanese denied they had agreed to anything more than to begin talks on troop withdrawal and these are now due to start this week, alternating between a Beirut suburb and the Israeli border town of Qiryat Shemona. It is evident that all sides have some difficult decisions to make. The Israelis, with the court of inquiry into the Palestinian massacres in West Beirut coming to an end, are faced with important political choices. If the inquiry finds that Mr. Begin or Mr. Sharon was negligent in not preventing the Phalangists from killing Palestinians, Mr. Begin may seek elections to secure an endorsement of his policies. Will he subsequently decide to maintain his distance from Washington by rejecting virtually every American initiative? Or will he find it more profitable to switch signals and appear the peacemaker again? For him, the most dramatic and the least damaging move would be to announce a moratorium on new Jewish settlements in the West Bank for a set period if the Jordanians entered the negotiations. That would remove the main irritant in relations with the United States. The P.L.O., which seems divided on how to react to the Reagan plan - with Yasir Arafat seeing ''positive'' elements in it - must also decide whether anything more can be gained by refusing to recognize Israel's right to exist. Such a move would bring it instant recognition by the United States and allow Palestinians to have much more of a say in American policies affecting the West Bank and Gaza. It must also decide whether the Palestinians living under Israeli occupation would benefit from allowing King Hussein to negotiate on their behalf. The ideologues, who are based in Damascus, have so far rejected both moves. In effect, they have played into Israel's hands by delaying the start of active negotiations, and giving Israel more time to build up settlements. For the White House, the main question is whether Mr. Reagan wants to do what he has said up to now he would not do - bring pressure on the Israelis to be more conciliatory, for example, by withholding foreign aid. Mr. Shultz believes that a tough approach in the end will be counterproductive but Mr. Reagan is said to have a stubborn streak that might lead him to act differently if he felt he was receiving no cooperation from the Israelis.

1483-> LESSON OF 1982: PERSONAL ATTACK AS A NECESSITY
Any number of columnists and candidates have decried the ''negative tone'' of the 1982 Congressional campaigns, as if the meanness that spewed from television sets and direct-mail envelopes was the result of some transient distemper brought on by the recession. In fact, such attacks seem likely to be a prominent part of the political scene for the foreseeable future. That is because candidates and campaign strategists, like generals, cannot resist using a weapon once it is been perfected, and certainly the 1982 campaign year witnessed the perfecting of high-tech mudslinging. That is one of several lessons that seem worth a final moment's reflection before the campaign notes are relegated to the file cabinet and the hot blasts of campaign oratory give way to the statesmanlike droning of yet another Congress. Mudslinging is a primitive art rooted in the folklore of our politics. For years, its practice was limited by the fact that to attack one's rival was to give him recognition. So, the accepted wisdom was that one did not use television or newspaper advertising to publicize a rival's name and likeness except in extraordinary circumstances. The idea was to make the opponent dip into his own campaign treasury to purchase his own ''name ID.'' But advances in advertising and campaign fundraising have made the direct personal attack not only possible but necessary. As one Washington television consultant explained when asked about the new vogue for attack advertising, ''Everybody in competitive races these days has enough money to buy all the name ID he needs. You just want to make sure it's negative name ID.'' So, in a year when $300 million was available for campaign spending, it was outdated to use television primarily as a tool for enhancing a candidate's reputation. More and more, television dollars were spent to undermine an opponent's image. Yet, despite the great reach of television, direct mail is often the weapon of choice for those who go in for serious combat. That is because a letter denouncing a candidate's stand on, say, abortion or gun control, can be sent to a targeted constituency so privately and so late in the campaign that it cannot be answered before the election. For years, professional strategists, candidates and journalists have known that the shoeleather campaign was an anachronism. Yet, like high-church traditionalists battling for the old liturgy, they have clung to the comfortable forms of the past. Candidates still tramp through shopping centers and gnaw on catfish or kielbasa, depending on the ethnic composition of their districts. Reporters still follow the candidates, reporting their words and deeds. Even so, it is increasingly clear that the candidate and his entourage are appendages to the real contest, which is a match-up of polling, broadcast advertising and mailing lists. ''Back in the headquarters, they determine where the candidate is going, what the theme is,'' said one Republican professional. ''The headquarters makes the decision of where the media buys are. They make the decisions about direct mail.'' This year, the most extreme refinement of the candidate-asappendage approach was practiced by the Congressional Club, the political action committee of Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina. The club recruited Congressional candidates, flew them around the country for audiences with wealthy contributors, dictated positions on key issues, produced their advertising and directed their mailings. In the end, the majority of the Congressional Club candidates were defeated, but that should not be taken as evidence that their techniques will be abandoned. Rather, 1984 will bring the spectacle of Presidential candidates and their attendant reporters bashing around the country in airplanes while the real campaigns are conducted in Washington. In this new order, the campaign plane is reduced to one distinction. ''That's probably the only place where a mistake can cost you the campaign,'' said the Republican professional. In the new campaign weaponry, polls have become enormously important for novel reasons. For example, to gain entrance to political action committees, which are the ''fat cats'' of today's political order, a candidate needs a survey, or at least an encouraging letter, from a big-name polltaker. Sometimes, the polltakers themselves become a tactical weapon. For example, on a number of occasions this year, prominent pollsters were invited to predict ''long-shot'' winners. Almost invariably, they picked candidates of their own party and quite often they predicted victory for their own clients. Shortly before Election Day, Lance Torrance, a well known polltaker for Republicans, held a news conference in Alabama at which he announced that his client, Emory Folmar, was in a dead heat with George C. Wallace in the gubernatorial race. Mr. Torrance said he entered the fray to rebut what he regarded as a statistically flawed survey by The Birmingham Post-Herald, which showed Mr. Wallace ahead by 20 points. ''It wasn't but about two days after I left that Wallace started picking up steam,'' Mr. Torrance recalled. ''Then he came out and won by 18 or 19 points, so it looks like they were right all along.'' The episode, of course, raised suspicions that Mr. Torrance had released figures intended to make his candidate appear stronger than he really was. But he insisted that his figures were correct when he released them. They turned out to be wrong, he said, because his poll sample underestimated the heavy black turnout for Mr. Wallace. It was, he added, only the second time in his career that he had publicly released figures on an election in which he was involved. In each case, he said, he felt his candidate was being victimized by others' polls. ''If we made mistakes,'' he said, ''they were honest mistakes in that we could not figure out what the turnout would be.'' As an afterthought, he observed, ''If the Republican party doesn't solve the black turnout problem, advances in the South will not only be limited. They may be halted.''

1484-> WALESA VOWS A PEACEFUL BATTLE FOR BANNED UNION
Lech Walesa, who was detained by the authorities Thursday to prevent him from giving a speech, told foreign journalists today that he planned to continue to fight for his outlawed independent union, Solidarity, ''but only by peaceful means.'' ''The time for watching is over,'' said Mr. Walesa, whom the martial law authorities released last month after 11 months of internment, saying he was ''no longer a threat.'' Mr. Walesa had planned to give a speech at the towering monument outside the gates of the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, on the anniversary of the deaths of workers shot by the authorities as they protested food prices in 1970 and of the dedication of the monument to their memory by Solidarity in 1980. But at midmorning, two black limousines pulled up in front of his housing project building and carried him off. More than 40 journalists approaching the area were held by the authorities for several hours, too, and special riot policemen saturated the area around the shipyard, preventing any demonstrations from forming. ''I was kidnapped,'' Mr. Walesa said. Questioned About Union Finances The union leader told foreign reporters who visited his home today that he had been taken first to the finance department of the municipal offices in Gdansk to answer questions about the finances of the local Solidarity organization. The official press had carried articles in the last few days contending that there may have been fiscal chicanery in the union. The men who came to get him, he added, carried crowbars to break into the apartment. But they did not have to use them. Mr. Walesa said he was driven around and around the ring road linking the Baltic ports of Gdansk and Gdynia for the rest of the day until he was returned to his apartment, feeling somewhat dizzy, about 7:30 P.M. Speaking of the new, officially sanctioned labor unions that the Government plans to set up at the beginning of the year, Mr. Walesa said, ''The new unions in their present form do not interest me.'' The new unions, established by the same parliamentary legislation that outlawed Solidarity, are sharply restricted in their right to strike, limited to individual workplaces and closely tied to the Communist Party. 'The Way of Partnership' Mr. Walesa said he wanted to press for independent unions, but only in a ''peaceful way, the way of partnership and understanding.'' ''We shall win for sure, but we must not fight,'' he said. ''Such methods are not appropriate in the 20th century, and I want the other side to understand this. It is time to use arguments and not force as an argument.'' Mr. Walesa emphasized that he did not want to challenge the Government itself, saying, ''I don't want to topple the authorities, but in the best way I can I want to improve conditions and fight for the cause of the working world.'' ''I don't want to take over power, and I am offended that they should think I want that,'' he added. Mr. Walesa wrote to Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish leader, this month offering to work with the authorities but insisting that the basis for national reconciliation must be amnesty for those who had been interned or arrested, the restoration of jobs to those dismissed for union activity and, above all, the establishment of independent unions. Move to 'Suspend' Martial Law But the suggestions were brushed aside in the package of legislation for Parliament in a widely publicized move to ''suspend'' martial law that in fact strengthens the provisions of military rule. Parliament is expected to approve the legislation Saturday. Meanwhile, the Government announced that the former Polish Ambassador to Japan, Zdzislaw Rurarz, who asked for political asylum after the imposition of martial law, had been sentenced to death for high treason. The sentence, handed down in absentia by a Warsaw military court, also calls for confiscation of his property. A similar death sentence had already been passed on Poland's former Ambassador to the United States, Romuald Spasowski, who also defected to protest the military takeover.

1485-> A HEALTHY MCNEIL IS ELUSIVE
Today was as normal as any Monday can be at a Jet camp after the end of a player strike, a 37-0 victory and the re-emergence of a second-year running back who is on his way to being a star. Players got in and out quickly, the television set showed a tape of Sunday's triumph over the Baltimore Colts, and Coach Walt Michaels, characteristically, refused to gloat over the rout of a rival team. Yet, there was something special about today for the Jets, and it had to do with that rising star, Freeman McNeil. The most impressive runner in recent Jets history, McNeil, while on the move, notes the position of the defensive players with what he described today as ''camera-shutter speed.'' That trait worked wonderfully on Sunday as he gained 123 yards to take the league lead in rushing. It will be tested next Sunday against the undefeated Green Bay Packers at Shea Stadium. The Packers are forceful in halting the run. They have permitted only 2.9 yards a carry and limited the Minnesota Vikings to 25 yards in 17 rushes on Sunday. Three 100-Yard Games McNeil has 345 yards rushing this season and is the only runner in the league to have gained at least 100 yards in each of the three games. He is averaging 6.4 yards a carry. And, before tonight's Raiders-Chargers game, he stood atop pro football's rushers with 55 yards more than the Oilers' Earl Campbell. No Jet has ever led the league in rushing. There have been bigger and faster Jets, but perhaps none as elusive as McNeil. He disappears into a hole, seemingly swallowed up by the opposition, and then suddenly emerges, feet still churning. ''He can make the first guy miss him,'' said Michaels. ''It's a knack.'' But McNeil says: ''I look past the first guy - then it just happens. It's like I'm looking through him.'' Injury-Plagued Rookie Although the Jets made him the third choice in the entire draft, he did not make an impact on the league last year as a rookie out of U.C.L.A. Because of injuries, he wasn't among the top half-dozen rushers. Yet, starting only six games, and playing in parts of five others, he gained 623 yards and had a fine average of 4.5 yards a carry. ''I was being brought along very slow,'' McNeil said. ''They wanted me to get in different situations. They're even leaving me alone in the backfield now.'' Whenever the Jets were in passing situations last year, no matter what down, McNeil came out and Bruce Harper, a good pass-catcher, replaced him. On Sunday, McNeil still came out on third down, but remained in at other times. ''We used Free for play-action on first and second downs,'' said Richard Todd, the quarterback. ''Normally, Bruce would come in. But Freeman's picked up a lot.'' McNeil has already caught eight passes for 97 yards - second in both categories on the club to Wesley Walker. McNeil's average of 12.1 yards per reception is unusually high for a running back. ''I can see everything,'' McNeil says. ''I know when I run my head is on a swivel all the time. I can actually see things taking place. Camera-shutter speed, I guess.'' ---- Jets' Defense Overshadowed The Jets' offense overshadowed the defense, which for the second time in three games produced no sacks. Michaels noted that in an attempt to free Mark Gastineau from the double-teaming Colts, he had switched Gastineau from his normal left end position to right end on one play. But the Colts responded, Michaels explained, by moving their tight end to Gastineau's side. ''Walt just told me to go out and do it,'' said Gastineau. But he did not know whether he would be asked to play that side against the Packers. Kenny Neil, who was playing right end for the injured all-pro Joe Klecko, was ''like any other young guy out of the box, a little late getting off the ball,'' said Michaels.

1486-> CUOMO FILLS 3 MORE HIGH POSTS IN ADMINISTRATION
Governor-elect Mario M. Cuomo yesterday formally announced three appointments to the inner circle of his government in formation. The three are Michael J. Del Giudice as secretary, Michael Finnerty as Budget Director and Fabian Palomino as special counsel to the Governor. All three had been previously disclosed by Mr. Cuomo himself or his aides. Mr. Cuomo said that the three had extensive experience in government and that Mr. Del Giudice and Mr. Finnerty, who have both served in the Carey administration, would be vital in efforts to cope with the state's budget problems. During the Carey years the post of secretary became the focus of power in the administration. Mr. Cuomo has said that his administration will be run differently and that more people will have direct access to him. Former Aide to Steingut Mr. Del Giudice, who is 39 years old, has worked both in the executive and legislative chambers in Albany. From November 1974 until December 1978 he was secretary to Speaker Stanley Steingut of the State Assembly. After Mr. Steingut's defeat, Mr. Del Giudice joined the Carey administration, where he served until August of last year as Director of State Operations and Policy Managment. He is first vice president for public finance of Shearson/American Express. Mr. Finnerty, 38, is secretary to Governor Carey, having succeeded Robert J. Morgado, who had centralized extensive power in the secretary's office. Mr. Finnerty, a former marine, previously worked as first deputy director of the State Budget Division and as director of budget studies for the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. The posts of secretary, Budget Director and counsel, which Mr. Cuomo filled Wednesday with the appointment of Alice G. Daniel, all currently pay $76,709 a year. Mr. Cuomo said, however, that he was reviewing the salaries. He has the authority to increase them without legislation. The posts do not require confirmation by the Senate. Redistricting Post Mr. Palomino, 58, is a longtime friend of Mr. Cuomo. A professor at Brooklyn Law School, he recently served as counsel to the commission responsible for redistricting the City Council. The commission's original work was rejected by the Justice Department on the ground that it diluted minority voting strength in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The dispute and the redrawing opf the district lines caused a one-year delay in election of members to the Council. Mr. Palomino has been active in Albany for many years. He was Governor Carey's liaison with the Legislature in the early part of Mr. Carey's administration. He was also an assistant counsel to Gov. W. Averell Harriman and a law clerk to Adrian Burke, when he was a judge of the Court of Appeals. During a news conference to announce the three appointments, Mr. Cuomo explained that the secretary, special counsel and Budget Director would be among the ''big five'' jobs in his executive chamber. Not the Patronage Post As he added that the others were counsel and communication director, Mr. Palomino asked, ''Appointments?'' in a reference to the appointments secretary, who is responsible for dispensing many state jobs, particularly patronage appointments. ''Should that be in the inner cabinet,'' Mr. Cuomo replied sarcastically. After announcing the appointments of Mr. Del Giudice, Mr. Finnerty and Mr. Palomino at the news conference and praising them for their experience, Mr. Cuomo turned to the three men, all in dark suits and looking somber, and asked if any of them wanted to say anything to the assembled reporters. They all shook their heads no. ''That's another reason why I selected them,'' said Mr. Cuomo, who has been irritated recently by leaks of information, some of it accurate, on his transition operation. In another development affecting the transition, Assemblyman William B. Finneran of White Plains, who has been under consideration by Mr. Cuomo for a job in the administration, was arrested early yesterday in Albany on a charge of driving while intoxicated. Mr. Cuomo said the incident would not automatically disqualify Mr. Finneran for a state post. ''I wouldn't take a person respected as an excellent public servant,'' Mr. Cuomo said, ''who ran an earnest political campaign and say I'm eliminating him because of something I've read on the wire.'' Mr. Finneran had been the Liberal Party candidate for State Comptroller.

1487-> ORDERS UP 0.2% FOR DURABLES
New factory orders for durable goods edged up two-tenths of 1 percent in September, with improvements for household items and machinery mostly offset by declines for automobiles, the Commerce Department reported today. Though small, the overall gain in orders, to a seasonally adjusted $73.3 billion, was an improvement over a big August decline - now estimated at 4.4 percent. And Government economists noted that the September increase would have been 2.1 percent except for a big drop in the highly volatile category of military goods. ''I find it very encouraging,'' said Robert Ortner, the Commerce Department's chief economist. 'Better Month Than August' Noting that retail sales and housing starts had already shown improvement in previous reports covering last month, he said that ''September is shaping up as a better month than August, apparently by a wide margin.'' The report on durable goods covers orders for goods that are expected to last at least three years - often relatively expensive goods that are bought on credit, and therefore goods that might be expected to do better in coming months if interest rates continue to decline. In September, companies' total shipments, reflecting previous months' orders, dropped 1 percent, to $76.4 billion, the lowest level since January. There was a 7.4 percent gain in orders for household goods, which include furniture, big appliances, television sets and other electronic equipment. And there was a 5.6 percent increase for nonmilitary capital goods, mainly machinery. Most economists are agreed that consumer spending - including household items - will likely be an important factor in pulling the nation out of the recession. Spur to Production Orders for big machinery are important also, not only because they mean more production and perhaps an end to industrial layoffs, but also because new machinery would be necessary to sustain any gains in production of almost any other items later on. The report said orders for transportation equipment were down 10.3 percent in September, falling to a level of $14.4 billion that was the lowest since May 1980. ''Most of the decline was attributable to the motor vehicle and parts industry,'' the report said. Without the big transportation decline, the value of new orders would have risen 3.2 percent in September, the report said. Orders for military capital goods fell 23.9 percent, pulling the total for all capital goods orders down nine-tenths of 1 percent from August. However, military orders tend to bounce up and down by large amounts since they include expensive equipment that can greatly sway any one month's figure. For example, the category had risen 13.5 percent in August.

1488-> ADVERTISING; Family Circle Promotions Set
Family Circle magazine, a publication of The New York Times Company, yesterday announced a number of top management changes. Thomas C. Redd, 58 years old, currently vice president of advertising, has been appointed publisher and senior vice president. David G. Ferm, 34, a vice president of the Times Company's magazine group, becomes executive vice president and general manager of Family Circle. He will supervise business management operations in the newly created post. Also, Arthur Hettich, 57, becomes editor in chief and a senior vice president of the magazine. He is currently vice president and editor. Both men will report to Robert F. Young, president of the magazine. Mr. Redd joined the magazine's Chicago office in 1951 and was advertising manager for the Middle West for 12 years. Mr. Ferm was director of marketing at The New York Times before joining the magazine group earlier this year. He previously worked at The Chicago Tribune. Family Circle publishes 17 issues a year, with an average circulation of more than 7 million copies.

1489-> AROUND THE NATION; Thompson Is Certified As the Winner in Illinois
The State Board of Elections today certified Gov. James R. Thompson as the winner of the Nov. 2 governor's race. But Adlai E. Stevenson 3d, the Democratic challenger, said he would seek a recount. An official tally certified by the board showed that Mr. Thompson, a Republican, had defeated Mr. Stevenson by only 5,074 votes out of a total of more than 3.5 million ballots cast. The margin of victory, less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the total number of ballots, was the closest for a statewide race in modern Illinois history, officials said. The election board said Mr. Thompson had defeated Mr. Stevenson by a vote of 1,816,101 to 1,811,027, becoming the first Governor of Illinois to win election to a third straight term. Mr. Stevenson's attorney, John Schmidt, said his client would seek a recount of 25 percent of the ballots in 58 counties. Requests for a limited canvass must be filed within five days.

1492-> CRAFTS; 10 WINNERS AT THE ROBESON GALLERY
NEWARK ''CRAFTS: EMERGING ARTISTS,'' an exhibition of about 60 pieces in fiber, clay and metal by 10 artists, indicates that work with a strong personal identity can be produced at many levels of maturity, The show is on view at the Robeson Center Gallery of Rutgers-Newark. The exhibitors - seven women and three men - are the winners of a statewide competition open to artists between the ages of 18 and 27 who are working in craft media. Sponsored jointly by the gallery and the Morristown CraftMarket, the competition drew some 100 applicants. The artists, each of whom received a cash award of $300, were selected by a jury consisting of Hortense Green, former crafts coordinator for the State Council on the Arts; William McCreath, chairman of the Art Department at Montclair State College; Stuart White, curator of the Robeson Gallery, and Hildreth York, chairman of the Rutgers Art Department. The project is one of several financed this year by the CraftMarket, which is sponsored by the Kiwanis of Randolph Township. A predominance of artists who work in clay perhaps reflects the proportion of potters in relation to other craftsmen in the world at large. In addition to six ceramists represented, there is one artist who works in clay in combination with metal, two who work in fiber and one who works in metal alone. Less than half have used craft materials for functional objects or jewelry. Most have seen their materials (and, in some cases, the forms they imply) as starting points for expressive statements. Encompassing an age span that covers preparatory years as well as early stages of careers, the group includes both college students and college instructors. Half of the winners acquired their skills in colleges, universities or art schools within the state. Some have graduate degrees, while others have not been enrolled in formal academic programs. If the breaking of convention is something to anticipate in the work of young artists, Pamela Grossi's toothlike, three-legged standing ceramic presences satisfy that expectation. Miss Grossi, whose credentials include a Master of Fine Arts degree from the Rhode Island School of Design, is a resident artist at the Peters Valley Craft Center in Layton. Although definitely alien, her figures -they have fingerlike tentacles instead of heads - are well proportioned and never menacing. A technical invention - an example of the ''media crossover'' that shows up frequently today - is the use of acrylic paint, rather than glazes, as surface treatment for fired clay. Richard Freiwald of Laurence Harbor, who makes sculptural statements with overscaled vessels, also paints on clay. Some of his pieces are covered with flat pastel shades suggestive of plastic soap containers. Some sections appear to be made by diecast units; others are softened by either draping clay like cloth or by incorporating steel mesh resembling a veil. Two exhibitors who have been employed in other artists' studios reveal traces of that influence. Bonnie Cooper of Hoboken is the studio manager for Dorothy Hafner, a New York City potter known for her production line of patterened dinnerware. In Miss Cooper's plates, cups and bowls, the shapes and seashore images are her own, but their color and spirit are closely akin to those in Miss Hafner's designs. Karen Vierno of Cresskill, who apprenticed with Ina Chapler of Englewood Cliffs, an artist who makes ceramic jewelry, uses beads very much like Mrs. Chapler's. However, Miss Vierno combines them with metal in original ways. Of special note are the clasps in her necklaces; each is handmade and uniquely appropriate to the piece it closes. A trend toward using non-precious metals in jewelry is evident in the use of brass by both Miss Vierno and Vivian Gold of East Brunswick, a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. Miss Gold is represented by a group of elegantly simple raised forms and also some fabricating jewelry. Nina Gelardi of Rocky Hill and Steven Rae of Wyckoff, full-time potters who make their living from their work, showed contrasting approaches to thrown forms with fire-darkened surfaces. Miss Gelardi, a veteran of both the CraftMarket and the Fair at Rhinebeck (N.Y.), is the furthest emerged of this emerging group. Her baskets bristling with projections, as well as plate forms containing shards and egg forms, all use functional pieces to support elements that alter their meanings. Mr. Rae's straightforward polished vessels - unfortunately, there are only three in the show - extract expressiveness from minimal essentials. Ramon Mordan created, with the precision of an architect's rendering, small reliefs representing building facades incised and formed in clay. Personal and sensitive, these works have a poetic quality that, more than any others here, transcend their materials. The two fiber artists are Helen Phillips Cole of Freehold and Beth Rakszawski of Basking Ridge. In 10 works, Miss Rakszawski has explored the capabilities of many materials, such as wool yarn, paper twine and handmade paper. Although no single image comes across, all indicate that the character of different materials helped to determine structure. Miss Cole, on the other hand, made all three of her pieces with bamboo and rags that focused on metaphorical implications in the shapes of primitive garments. The show will remain on view through Wednesday. The gallery is at 350 High Street and is open from 11:30 A.M. to 5 P.M. on weekdays. A collection of beaded and enameled neck pieces at Vitti Artisans Gallery in Upper Montclair calls attention to two significant current phenomena. One is a quiet return of enameling in a contemporary idiom to a level of technical excellence comparable to that in the Byzantine and Medieval periods. The other is a growing interest among artists in collaborations where, through reciprocal investments of talents, one artist's vision expands the potential of the other's. Here the artists are Laura Popenoe, an enamelist with an international reputation, and a couple known professionally as Martin and Lucia, who have developed an individual approach to designing with unusual glass and metal beads. Although the combined efforts of the three California artists were represented in a prestigious exhibition of enameling in Washington last month, Vitti is the first gallery in the East to introduce a body of their work. Nine pieces, especially in small-scale objects like wearable jewelry, are fewer than one would hope to find. However, the complexity of each invites the consideration that one might direct toward any work of art with substantial content. At the heart of every piece is a sizable enameled form in which Miss Popenoe has developed, through color and pattern, a particular concept. Then, using a vast assortment of beads, Martin and Lucia have further orchestrated this on a collar, a fringe or within the enameling itself. Miss Popenoe has achieved many variations in translucent and opaque colors through different means of applying the enamels to the metal (copper or silver) before fusing. Among them are the use of thin wires to separate the colors (cloissone), placing the enamels in etched recesses in the metal (champleve) and freely brushing on adjacent colors (limoges). She also creates relief surfaces in the metal by the use of repousse. The pieces are both dazzling -flecks of metal are interspersed with the luminous colors - and elegant. Leather backs and, in some, the flexibility of detached beads are added thoughtful elements. Several, especially those that are evocative of traditional amulets, have connotations that transcend ornamentation. However, such eclectic combinations as antique Chinese bells, Mexican trinkets and tiny metal beads from France mark this work as unmistakably contemporary. Starting at $2,000, the collaborative pieces will remain at Vitti Artisans Gallery, 594 Valley Road (look for an alley called ''The Mews''), Upper Montclair, through Dec. 31.

1493-> NEW YORK TOURISM NEARLY MATCHES 1981 LEVELS
A surge of tourists and business visitors in the last three months has enabled New York City to come close to matching last year's figures, according to city tourism officials. There was a slight decline in the estimated number of visitors this year, but they spent as much as did visitors during 1981. Preston Robert Tisch, chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, said that this year's 16.9 million visitors - 100,000 fewer than last year's total - spent $2.1 billion. That produced nearly $200 million in direct tax revenues during the year, he said. A Major Economic Strength ''The tourist boom that began in 1976 is continuing, and it's one of the city's major economic strengths,'' he said. Although hotel occupancy in New York is down slightly this year, to about 70 percent from last year's 72.9 percent, it still substantially exceeds the estimated national average of 64.9 percent. New York has 97,800 hotel rooms, at least 30,000 more than either Paris or London. Weekend package plans offered by many hotels in the city and marketing by the visitors bureau were responsible for the surge in tourism in the final quarter of the year, according to Charles Gillett, the bureau's president. He noted that in late December, usually a slow period, hotel occupancy had risen. Conventions Up, Delegates Down Convention business in 1982 has been about the same as in 1981, Mr. Gillette said. A total of 933 conventions have been held in New York this year, four more than last year, but the number of delegates, 4.12 million, was 90,000 fewer than last year. ''Some organizations have been sending smaller groups to conventions this year for budgetary reasons,'' Mr. Gillette said. Estimated convention spending, however, has been higher - $828 million compared with $796 million for 1981. This week, the American Social Science Association will bring 8,000 people to its convention Tuesday through Thursday. Factors in Declines Mr. Tisch said that the slight drop in tourism and business visits is directly related to trends affecting the entire travel industry - the national recession, inflation and the strengthening of the dollar abroad. Not only is a trip to the United States more expensive, but many of the countries from which visitors often come have had economic problems, he said. For the first time in two decades, the number of visitors from overseas had a year-to-year decline, to 2.55 million this year from 2.7 million in 1981. Yet New York has lost less overseas business than any of the other United States gateways. In 1982, New York has been the port of entry for 30 percent of all visitors from abroad. Hotel Construction Responds One result of the continuing tourism boom, which started in the bicentennial year of 1976, has been a wave of hotel construction less than three years after the last wave, which added 6,000 rooms in six major hotels during 1980 and 1981. Current construction will add more than 3,300 rooms between now and early 1985. Included are the Ritz-Carlton and the Barbizon with 360 rooms each; the Nova Park Gotham, 250 rooms; the Novotel Broadway, 480 rooms, and the Marriott, for which excavation is now nearing completion, being built by John Portman on Times Square, with 1,878 rooms.

1494-> MONEY SUPPLY UP $3.5 BILLION
With business credit demands and the economy weak, the Federal Reserve released data yesterday that showed it was continuing to supply the banking system with the funds necessary to sustain both rapid money supply growth and lower interest rates. The Fed also reported yesterday that, for the week ended Dec. 8, business loans outstanding at large banks across the country declined by $1.2 billion and are now nearly $8.6 billion below the peak level of $220 billion during the week ended Oct. 6. The decline in the first week of December was much larger than the $259 million drop in the comparable week last year. ''Business loans are much weaker than seasonal and are yet another sign of the weak economy,'' according to Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber Inc. The latest Fed data showed that, in the week ended Wednesday, the banking system held an average of $98 million more that it was required to hold in reserves, which are the funds that banks must keep on deposit at the Fed. Some banks borrowed an average of $490 million of reserves from the Fed, while others held an average of $588 million more in reserves than was required. The availability of reserves is a sign, analysts agreed, that the Fed is not yet alarmed about the rapid growth of the nation's money supply. Since October, the Fed has not focused on the M-1 money supply measure, which it announces weekly, and which was the primary target of monetary policy earlier in the year. M-1, which is currency plus all kinds of checking accounts, increased by $3.5 billion in the week ended Dec. 8 and is now about $17 billion above the level that would be consistent with the maximum 5 1/2 percent growth rate that the Fed set as an annual growth target early this year. Other, broader money supply measures, particularly M-3, have become more important in recent weeks, Fed officials have said. When the discount rate the Fed charges on loans to banks was cut to 8 1/2 percent from 9 percent last Monday, the Fed cited recent slowdowns in the broader money supply measures as one reason for cutting the lending rate. M-2 and M-3 Revised Upward Yesterday, the Fed announced upward revisions of $800 million in the November levels of the two broader money supply measures - M-2 and M-3 - for which it announces data only monthly. The November data were announced last week. For both measures, the fourth-quarter growth target announced by the Fed is 8 1/2 percent to 9 1/2 percent. M-2, defined as M-1 plus small savings deposits, certain short-term bank borrowings and money market mutual funds used by the public, increased by $19.8 billion in November and is $6.8 billion above the level consistent with 9 1/2 percent growth. M-3, which is M-2 plus large time deposits, other bank borrowings and institutional money market funds, has not grown so rapidly and is barely above the fourth quarter growth target set by the Fed. There was little reaction to the latest Fed data in the credit markets, where interest rates rose slightly in all maturities. Traders and salesmen described the day's activity as extremely quiet. Analysts at Merrill Lynch said in their daily commentary that ''interest from investors remained almost nonexistent.'' By late in the day, prices of both the 9 3/8 percent notes due in 1984 and the 10 percent notes due in 1986 were well below the average prices set at their auctions earlier this week. The 9 3/8 percent issue was offered at 99 17/32 to yield 9.63 percent, down from slightly more than 99 27/32 at the auction, while the 10 percent notes were offered at 99 3/8 to yield 10.2 percent, down from nearly 99 22/32 at the auction. In advance of next Tuesday's sale of new seven-year notes, dealers offered the issue to large customers with a yield of 10.6 percent, up from 10.58 percent a day earlier. The 20-year bonds to be sold next Wednesday were offered with a 10.85 percent yield, compared with 10.78 percent a day earlier.

1498-> CLARKE'S GOAL TIES ISLANDERS
The Islanders, for all their gallant effort to win a second consecutive game for the first time since October, came up with only a 4-4 tie in a hard-fought game tonight with the Philadelphia Flyers in Nassau Coliseum. For a while, the Islanders appeared to have snatched victory from defeat by rallying from a 3-1 deficit on three straight goals in the third period. But the Flyers came right back for the tie on Bobby Clarke's goal at 14 minutes 22 seconds. Al Arbour, the Islander coach, accepted the tie by saying: ''It's been a long time since we've been down, 3-1, and the guys put their heads down and said, 'Not again.' '' Mike Bossy, the Islanders' leading scorer, who accounted for two goals, said that a week ago the Islanders might not have been able to come back as they did tonight. After a poorly played first period, the Islanders livened up in the second but still trailed, 2-1, going into the third. The Flyers quickly made it 3-1 on a goal by Darryl Sittler at 1:14. Then the Islanders scored three straight goals. Two of those goals were only 45 seconds apart. Bossy, with his second goal of the evening, brought the score to 3-2 on a power play at 4:43. Then John Tonelli and Brent Sutter scored a pair 45 seconds apart to give the Islanders a 4-3 lead at 12:28. Undaunted, the Flyers' Clarke tied the score less than two minutes later with a shot from beside the goal mouth. Ilka Sinisalo and Brian Propp scored Phildelphia's earlier goals. Bossy, who also scored in the second period, got his 25th and 26th goals of the season. On Friday night, he scored three in a 5-2 victory over the Rangers. Some Calls Disputed Tonight there was some criticism from both sides about the officiating by Andy van Hellemond, the referee. Clarke, the acting captain of the Flyers, said the officiating was a ''terrible job.'' The Islanders complained about a goal by Denis Potvin that was disallowed and about a Philadelphia goal that they said should have been disallowed. The Flyers, long known as the Broad Street Bullies, are making a point this season of not taking many penalties. But they are not exactly the Broad Street Angels yet. Arbour, discussing the Flyers' play, said, ''I counted three tackles.'' Asked to judge whether the Flyers had cleaned up their act, Arbour said, ''Only to the point where refs don't call any penalties.'' The game tonight was the third of the season between the teams. The Flyers won here, 6-3, on Nov. 6, and then the teams tied the next night at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. Melanson Loses Argument Philadelphia took a 1-0 lead in the first period on an unusual break. From behind the Islander net, Sinisalo hit what was intended to be a passout, but the puck struck the thigh of Roland Melanson, the Islander goalie, and caromed into the net. Melanson protested to van Hellemond that Sittler had interfered with him - in fact, was sitting on him. Early in the second period Bossy tied the score, but nine minutes later the Flyers made it 2-1 on Propp's goal. Buoyed by the Bossy goal, the Islanders played a livelier game in the second period, with brisk rushes into the Phildelphia zone. The next disputed call came at 13:20 of the second period on an Islander power play. Potvin lashed in a hard shot from the left point, but van Hellemond disallowed the goal on the ground that Duane Sutter had interfered with the Philadelphia goatender, Pelle Lindbergh. ''He was 10, 12 feet out of his net, and he was fair game,'' said Sutter, referring to Lindbergh's coming out of the crease. ''The loss of that goal was disappointing,'' Bossy said, ''but those are the breaks of the game.'' Moments later, Propp took advantage of the deflated Islanders and moved the Flyers ahead, 2-1, with a goal from close in on Melanson's left side. After Sittler's goal widened the lead to 3-1, Bossy followed with his second goal by helping along a shot from center ice by Tomas Jonsson. As the puck reached the goal area, Bossy deftly stickhandled it out of the reach of Lindbergh and flicked it in to begin the Islander surge.

1499-> LEBANESE SHIFTING VIEW OF MASSACRE
Reluctantly, painfully and with a sense of guilt, more and more Lebanese, both Moslems and Christians, are beginning to admit that Lebanese Phalangist militiamen were probably the killers in the massacre at the Palestinian refugee camps in West Beirut in September. The official explanation of the Government, given by President Amin Gemayel, is still that the Phalangists had no role in the killings, that Israeli troops occupying the area around the Sabra and Shatila camps were solely responsible for the deaths. No Outcry for Full Inquiry But the passage of time has opened some minds among the Lebanese. Stories about the Phalangist involvement are beginning to spread quietly in living rooms. Local newspapers have been printing accounts of the Israeli inquiry into the massacre, and these accounts repeatedly report the Phalangist role. A Government investigation of the massacre is still under way, but its findings have not been made public and only a few details of it have been disclosed. For years the Palestinians in the refugee camps have been widely mistrusted, and now there are many Lebanese who feel the Government will and should let the entire matter dissolve in time. The official count of the bodies of the men, women and children who were killed between Sept. 16 and 18 is 328. Several hundred more bodies are believed to have been carried away by the killers, and 991 camp residents remain officially listed as missing. Despite the numbers, there is no public outcry here similar to that in Israel for a full investigation, leading to the indictment of the killers. But some moral indignation is expressed privately. ''They are getting suspicious,'' a university-educated Maronite Christian woman said of friends with whom she had recently discussed the massacre. ''They don't like the idea of their boys getting involved.'' ''When it first happened, people did not believe the Lebanese Forces were involved,'' she said, referring to the militia organization dominated by the Christian Phalangists, who have denied any participation. ''Now,'' the woman said of her friends, ''they're beginning to realize that something went wrong. The Israelis set our boys up for it. It was not official Phalangist policy. It caught people by surprise. People then were already overwhelmed by the invasion, the bombing, the assassination.'' The assassination two days before the massacre was of President-elect Bashir Gemayel, the younger brother of the President, who was the leader of the Phalangist-dominated militia. Killers Unlikely to Be Punished ''People say,'' she continued, ''that if Bashir had been alive, this would not have happened.'' They cite an article in this week's issue of the magazine An Nahar Arab and International, a respected independent publication, reporting that shortly after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon on June 6, Israeli officials asked Bashir Gemayel to send the Lebanese Forces, with their Phalangist vanguard, into West Beirut to fight the Moslem leftists and guerrillas of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Bashir Gemayel reportedly refused, saying his men would not fight Lebanese Moslems. Few Lebanese, the woman said, express concern that the killers will probably go unpunished. A few of them were killed during the three days of violence in the camps and were buried quietly in the Christian town of Brummana, northeast of Beirut, with the official explanation that they were victims of stray bullets at posts near the airport. But while there is guilt and regret about the massacre among some Lebanese, the woman pointed out, they also feel that ''in all the killing of the last eight years, killing by the Israelis, by the P.L.O., thousands of other killers have gone unpunished, too.'' A Moslem writer said it was increasingly admitted among Lebanese that the Phalangists were probably the killers. ''It is obvious,'' he said. ''But we can say safely that both Moslems and Christians would not like to know any more. The Christians have been much embarrassed by what has already been said.'' ''The Moslems,'' he added, ''don't want to know because of the horrors of the past that have taken place.'' He noted that Moslem leaders, like their Christian counterparts, have blamed Israel alone for the massacre. ''The Moslems,'' the writer said, ''are trying to preserve by all means what they have left in the country. They want to be able to talk to the Christians, to preserve what is left to them.'' A Problem for the Government ''The Moslems,'' he continued, ''feel crushed - crushed by their cooperation with the P.L.O., by the Israeli invasion. There is no sense in pressing to reveal what really happened. It was a tragedy for the Palestinians, but the Moslems here have their own country to think of.'' An investigation that named Phalangist culprits would also pose a serious problem for President Gemayel, a Maronite Christian who was a Phalangist political leader while his brother headed the militia. The Christian militia was loyal, almost fanatically, to Bashir, not to Amin Gemayel. The Phalangists have still not been disarmed, as most of the leftist Moslem militias have, and Amin Gemayel has disclosed only vague plans for their disbanding and replacement by the Lebanese Army as the nation's only military force. President Gemayel's own public conclusion, reported in an interview in the Paris daily Le Monde last month, is that under the international rules of war the occupier is responsible for what happens on occupied territory. That is, Israel is guilty. The President also said explicitly that the Phalangists had no part in the killings. ''Everybody knows the Kataeb did it,'' said a Lebanese businessman, using the Arabic word for Phalangists. ''They can make an investigation but what can they do? If they catch some Kataeb, they will get in trouble with the Kataeb.''
