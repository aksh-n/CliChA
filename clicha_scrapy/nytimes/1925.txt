162-> THE SCREEN; A Chip of the Old Block.
With a whip for a weapon, Douglas Fairbanks in the title rôle of "Don Q. Son of Zorro," last night stirred an audience in the Globe Theatre to many an outburst of genuine merriment, and at the end of the entertainment there was a peal of applause which to any star, stage or screen, is more beautiful than the music of Chopin, Liszt or Wagner. The principal of this picture was possibly seated in his Hollywood home, more than 3.000 miles away, at the time the throng in the theatre was delivering its approval of his latest film. But it is pretty safe to say that long before midnight one of his managers informed him by telephone of the success of the photoplay."Don Q. Son of Zorro," is just as full of new idas as the average Fairbanks effort. Mr. Fairbanks impersonates a Don Zalva the Brave or a Don Casanova in this picture, a gentleman of wonderful imagination who easily outwits those who wish his end. He is a gentleman with a whip who can use it to knock the ashes off a cigarette, tear a forced marriage license in twain, or wherewith to climb up to a balcony. The whip comes in handy in lassoing his opponents or depriving them of their swords. Mr. Fairbanks seems more at home with this Australian stock whip than he was with a sword as d'Artagnan in "The Three Musketeers." This current story is a sequel to "The Mark of Zorro," which was a joy to many hundreds of thousands. Don Cesar de Vega is a chip of the old block, and incidentally Mr. Fairbanks also is seen as Zorro, his dreaded father, in which make-up he is excellent.It is a swift picture with plenty of pleasing surprises and action. Mr. Fairbanks appears to have trained down to a very slender figure for the part. He springs into the saddle with amazing ease, and never makes a false move. It is an ideal part for Mr. Fairbanks, who as usual has put in no end of work in mastering the great whip as well as in showing that he is just as agile as he was years ago when he first startled audiences by his remarkable leaps."Don Q. Son of Zorro" is prefaced by a prologue in which Fred Lindsay gives a remarkable display of manipulating the stock whip. You see how this lash with the wonderful popper can be cracked time and time again by an expert. Mr. Lindsay flung it around a girl's neck and also around her wrist. He flicked a cigarette from a man's hand, and did several other stunts which actually thrilled and startled persons in the packed theatre.As Don Cesar Mr. Fairbanks even uses this whip to light his cigarette, and the sight of it means ill-luck for his enemies. Mary Astor is an ingenious and charming heroine, Dolores de Muro. Dolores falls in love with the gallant Don Cesar the instant her eyes light upon him, which is about the only time this intrepid person is still or in one place. One never knows when he will turn up, for after a seeming plunge from a great height into a torrent he reappears—needing only a hair-comb.Don Cesar surprises the brutal Colonel Matsado, binds and gags him, and then, with a few touches on his own dainty mustache and a patch over one eye, he deceives men who knew Matsado well. There is a beautiful sequence when father and son are fighting together. With a full appreciation for the fantastic idea of the whole plot, Don Cesar and Zorro are seen battling, with perfect equanimity, against about fifteen soldiers. Twenty might have been too much for them, but fifteen was merely a matter of time. Zorro and his son even exchange conversation as they slash at their enemies with their swords.Donald Crisp enacts the part of Don Sebastian in such a way as to prove that he has lost none of his histrionic cunning since he took to directing pictures. It will be remembered that he scored no mean success as the brutal father in "Broken Blossoms." Jean Hersholt, who gave a memorable performance in Erich von Stroheim's "Greed," is splendid as the crafty, calculating scoundrel who is blackmailing the man who slew the Archduke, having picked up a card—the two of swords—on which the Archduke wrote his last words, naming his murderer.There are some ingenious settings in this picture, with mysterious trap doors and interesting caves. A delightful scenic effect is where a castle is shown and the riders galloping hell-for-leather around winding paths into the dim distance.Don Cesar is garbed in the fascinating costume of a Spaniard—the ilk that settled in California. He has bell-bottomed trousers that are tight around the waist, a bolero jacket and a wide flat-brimmed hat. This is touched off with the small mustache, waxed at the ends, and Spanish whiskers.This is a photoplay which creates no end of mirth and sustains the interest all through. It will probably prove to be a far more satisfactory box office asset than even "The Thief of Bagdad." Those who enjoyed "The Mark of Zorro" will find this brimful of the same satisfying gallantry and courage, in which the villains are backed off the screen. A Chip of the Old Block. DON Q. SON OF ZORRO, with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Astor, Jack McDonald, Donald Crisp, Stella De Lanti, Warner Oland, Jean Hersholt, Albert MacQuarrie, Lottie Pickford Forrest, Charies Stevens, Tote Du Crow, Martha Franklin, Juliette Belanger, Roy Coulson and Enrique Acosta, based on the novel, "Don Q's Love Story," by K. and Hesketh Prichard, directed by Donald Crisp; special prologue featuring Fred Lindsay in a demonstration of an Australian stock whip; musical accompaniment by Mortimer Wilson. At the Globe Theatre.It would be a blessing indeed to the screen if more pictures were produced along the lines of "Siege," the present offering at the Capitol, which is an earnest and praiseworthy effort in the direction of true drama. This photoplay was adapted from Samuel Hopkins Adams's novel, and was directed by Svend Gade, who unquestionably received no little assistance in his task from the comprehensive scenario mapped out by Harvey Thew.This is not a flawless film, as there is an occasional tendency to exaggerate both in the posing of the players and in the scenic effects. The comedy touches are rather forced and the ending is flamboyant, with a leaning toward standardized conceptions. But the characters are forcefully drawn, and through that and the strict adherence to the theme "Siege" makes a strong impression. There have been many comedies produced with cunning and skill and also a number of satiric and fantastic films, but only too rarely does one see a worthy strong drama on the screen.In this current subject there is a good story which does not stray far from the bounds of probability, and for the most part the characters are human, especially Augusta Ruyland (Mary Alden), a widow, who is a dominant factor among the interests of a great factory and in the town. The portrayal of her iron will is admirably pictured, so well that one does not feel opposed to her even when she ejects Fredericka, wife of her nephew, Kenyon Ruyland. It strikes one that the old woman is selfish, but she has so much personality that she retains one's respect and to a certain extent one's sympathy.Aunt Augusta, as she is known, sits at board meetings, where her will is law, the other family stockholders being mere puppets who read and nod their acquiescence. She garbs herself as a Victorian and resents the invasion of some modern ideas. She goes to her business in a horse-drawn barouche, while her nephew and Fredericka speed along the highways in a fast automobile. Aunt Augusta turns over to her nephew and his bride an old home, many of the rooms of which denote the long period of vacancy by heavy lengths of cobwebs. This place is cleaned up and Fredericka so changes the aspect of the interior that she infuriates Aunt Augusta, who, although she admires cleanliness, objects to the new decorations and furnishings. Aunt Augusta has her spies and they report that Fredericka has been receiving daily great bouquets of roses from some anonymous person. Fredericka denies that she knows who is sending her the flowers, and Kenyon becomes jealous and his young wife leaves the great homestead.Norval Ruyland (Marc MeDermott), a nephew, who has been mute since birth, writes on a piece of paper that he has been sending the flowers to Fredericka, as she reminded him of a woman he loved. His admission is greeted with ridicule, and therefore he feels that he is partly responsible for Fredericka's unfortunate plight. One night he ends his life with a bullet, and leaves Fredericka his stock in the factory, which with Kenyon's gives the young couple the controlling interest in the business. There follow the surprise of the strong-willed elderly woman, and the way to a cheerful outcome of the misunderstandings.Miss Alden gives a splendid portrayal of Aunt Augusta, as she is strong but human, always ready to bend a little in favor of her own clan. She impresses everybody that she makes the wheels go round and that therefore they must do her bidding. Miss Alden registers the proper mood in all the scenes, but the director strains the effect when he makes Aunt Augusta take a standing pose in her carriage. It would have been more natural to have her delivering her opinion seated.Virginia Valli enacts the part of Fredericka. She is attractive, but frequently appears too cheerful immediately following dramatic and tragic situations. Obviously, she had forgotten what happened. Eugene O'Brien gives a capable performance as the nephew, Kenyon.MR. McDermott, who since he impersonated a deaf and dumb paralytic in "While New York Sleeps" has furnished the screen with one or two deaf and dumb characterizations, is excellent as the mute nephew. He uses his eyes cleverly and creates much sympathy for the rôle. Mr. Gade pictures Norval's end in a deft, original way.This is a photodrama of unusual meri and one which we hope will lead other producers to appreciate the value of intensive characterization and a natural and plausible theme. A Strong Drama.SIEGE, with Mary Alden, Virginia Valli, Eugene O'Brien, Marc McDermott, Harry Lorraine, Beatrice Burnham, Helen Dunbar and others, adapted from Samuel Hopkins Adams's novel, directed by Svend Gade; overture, "Mignon;" "Papillons," with Capitol ballet corps; "Roxy's Gang at the Seashore," with some nautical songs; organ recital. At the Capitol."Kosher Kitty Kelly," which came to the Times Square Theatre last night, is described on its program as "a unique comedy."There were those in last night's audience who maintained that the production of the new piece might rightly be laid at the door of the success of "Abie's Irish Rose," along with the other imitative foundlings it has caused to be brought into the world. Perhaps this interpretation is correct."Kosher Kitty Kelly" is concerned with the love affairs of a Jewish boy and an Irish girl, to which are added for good measure the love affairs of an Irish boy and a Jewish girl. There is a further plot in which it is established that Mrs. Kelly's late husband was really, without her knowledge, a previous husband of Mrs. Feinbaum.The characters in the piece chatter incessantly, to little mirthtful effect. Vaudeville nifties of what one had thought was a forgotten era are dusted off and held to the light. And ever and again one of the personages stops to make a little speech.The acting is decidedly spotty. Helen Shipman, a capable and experienced musical, comedy actress, shines brightly against the dismal background of her endeavors. Fred Santley is vigorous as an Irish policeman who sometimes used a brogue and sometimes not. The rest are what is known as capable and at least as good as the play. KOSHER KITTY KELLY.

337-> THE SCREEN; A "Greater" Movie.
Those gay, rollicking early days of movie art are recalled by the antiquated technique so skilfully maintained in "The Love Hour," Vitagraph's initial contribution to the Greater Movie Season. The gestures and expressions of the players and the gallant attempts at drama are reminiscent of that period when ambitious pictorial offerings received their world-premieres in Fourteenth Street. The story of this audacious reflection of the past is none other than that of the little blond girl, pretty, but so poor, who meets and marries a blasé young millionaire. This production is produced in a modern style—that is the furnishings are up to date and the players wear short skirts and loose trousers.The villain, who is moderately successful for two chapters, gives a sincere imitation of the spiteful sneer and wicked frown of the stage cur of a generation ago. The hero does nothing to deserve being called a hero, and the heroine is a foolish little person. Some of the scenes in this presentation are on a par with "The Great Train Robbery," but as it is longer it suffers in comparison.Coney Island of the present day affords some slight digression from the story, but the subsequent happenings are apt to make one inattentive to the shadow characters, which to the producers, would seem ungrateful.In one sequence Ward Ralston, the villain, appears on the threshold of Rex Westmore's sick-chamber with an unprepossessing specimen of a physician. Westmore, the aforementioned millionaire, who encounters financial losses, is told that he will have to go to Switzerland for an operation. Soon one hears that the poor man has not enough money to go to Switzerland, and the villain thereupon seizes the opportunity to offer the necessary funds to Betty, Westmore's wife, provided she divorces her husband and marries him. The woman wishes to conciliate the brute—at least one presumes so—so she permits him to embrace her. Then follow scenes showing Ralston and Betty in the mirror and Westmore looking at their reflection from his bed. It appears to have an excellent effect upon him, as he arises and apparently has no trouble in getting well.And this is an impression of "The Love Hour," intended to be representative of the 1925 photoplays! It has gained entrance to the Rialto! You can think of lots of things not in the least connected with this picture while you are viewing it. THE LOVE HOUR, with Huntly Gordon, Louise Fazenda, Willard Louis, Ruth Clifford, John Roche, Charles Farrell and Gayne Whitman, scenario and adaptation by Bess Meredyth, directed by Herman Raymaker: "Ben Bernie and His Rialto Gang," "Felix Trifles With Time," a cartoon. At the Rialto.The first performance of "Outside Looking In," by Maxwell Anderson, one of the authors of "What Price Glory," is announced for next Monday night at the Greenwich Village Theatre.

Shea's Productions.Three plays are announced for early production by Joseph E. Shea, who declares that he will offer several plays during the season in one of the small theatres off Broadway, with a view to moving the successful productions to houses in the theatrical district.Mr. Shea will produce "So That's That," by Joe Byron Totten, in which Louise Carter will be featured, and two plays by William Hurlbut, entitled "The Trust Story" and "The Laugh."

786-> THE SCREEN
Not often does one see so powerful a photodrama as "The Unholy Three," the offering with which Major Edward Bowes initiates the "Greater Movie Season" at the Capitol. It is a stirring story stocked with original twists and situations, a picture that teems with surprises and one in which the suspense is kept as taut as the string of a bow. After viewing this production the figures that have passed upon the screen still cling to one's mind, and one feels like talking about the strange and unusual tale."The Unholy Three" is at first concerned with the sideshow of a circus, but the whole plot is quite different from any other narrative with such a background. The atmosphere, inside and outside the freak's tent, is wonderfully impressive, and the characters and their actions are so realistic. Tod Browning, the director of this film, and the scenarist have cooperated magnificently on this effort, which was adapted from a story by C. A. Robbins. Added to this, the cast is one in which the players are thoroughly suited to their respective rôles. The principals are Lon Chaney, Mae Busch, Matt Moore, Victor McLaglen and a midget, Harry Earles.The trio referred to in the title are Echo, a ventriloquist, played by Mr. Chaney; Hercules, a circus strong man, impersonated by Mr. McLaglen, and Tweedledee, the midget, acted by Harry Earles. Their avocation is picking pockets, in which light-fingered pilfering they are aided by Rosie O'Grady (Miss Busch). There are singular contrasts in the mentality of the three, as Hercules, the man of muscle, is a coward; Echo is eager but cautious, and Tweedledee is a vicious, ill-tempered little person. They adopt the usual tactics of their ilk on the show grounds by taking advantage of the concentration of the crowds to steal from their victims. Sometimes Tweedledee will create a fuss in the tent and the onlookers will press toward his stand. Echo and Rosie profiting by the throng's curiosity.This trio, with Rosie's connivance, decide to go out for bigger game. They abandon their circus profession and engage in the business of selling birds, principally parrots. Here the tale becomes absorbing, for one sees Echo, with a wig and gown, disguised as a good-natured old lady, and Tweedledee clothed as an infant. Hercules officiates as a sort of helper. Hector McDonald is employed as a, clerk in the bird shop. He is a dolt who suspects nothing, believing the selling of parrots to be a curious but honest pursuit. Actually it is an amazing plan whereby the thieves or robbers can enter houses and purloin valuables.A customer buys a parrot, thinking it can talk because Echo, the ventriloquist, has made it appear so. A complaint comes over the telephone to the effect that the bird won't say a word, and the old lady of the bird shop, with her infant in a perambulator, goes to the customer's house to find out why the parrot won't talk. The midget uses his nimble little legs when he sees the opportunity and he does the stealing while his "mother" keeps the purchaser engaged. There is one scene in which the "mother" and "child" go to a house at a most opportune moment, as the occupant is examining an emerald necklace. The costly string of precious stones attracts the "baby," who cries for it, and the owner laughingly dangles it before the supposed child, being astounded when the "baby" clings to the necklace with strange strength and only reluctantly parts with the jewels.The strong man, urged on by the hapless, greedy, cruel midget, commits a murder, which is a shock to Echo. There is the detective who comes to the bird shop, and while he is there one sees the old "lady" and the "infant." As soon as he goes away the midget raises his child's clothes and puts his hands into his trousers pockets, and Echo is seen without his wig.There is nothing ludicrous or slap-stick about a single scene. It all seems plausible, and the way in which the story is worked out, with the possible exception of the introducing of a giant gorilla, is a credit to the director. Even this particular stretch is quite effective.The midget's acting is remarkable. First Earles is the crying baby, and then he is the vindictive, tiny specimen of manhood. While he is being watched his face is that of a child in arms, but the second he is safe from strangers he turns like a Dr. Jekyil into a Mr. Hyde. Mr. Chaney gives a brilliant, restrained and earnest performance, and Mr. McLaglen is the personification of bulk and brawn with an apparently cowardly mentality. He gives a very fine performance in a rôle which is not an easy one. Miss Busch is appealing as Rosie, and Matt Moore is effective as the simpleton, Hector McDonald.This pictorial effort is a startling original achievement which takes its place with the very best productions that have been made. It is encouraging to witness something so different from the usual run of films. An Excellent Drama. THE UNHOLY THREE, with Lon Chaney, Mae Busch, Matt Moore, Victor McLaglen, Harry Earles, Matthew Betz, Walter Perry, John Merkyl, Charles Wellsley, Percy Williams, Marjorie Morton, Violet Crane, Lou Morrison, Edward Connelly, William Humphreys and A. E. Warren, adapted from a story by C. A. Robbins, directed by Tod Browning; overture, "Maritana"; male quartet, divertissements with songs and dances; brass sextet; "special prologue to the feature; organ recital. At the Capitol."The Goose Woman," the present film attraction at the Colony, is an unusually interesting production, the narrative of which was inspired by the "Pig Woman" of the famous Hall-Mills murder in New Jersey. It was actually adapted from a story by Rex Beach. In this picture Miss Dresser demonstrates her talent as a screen actress. Her performance is so remarkable that it has been the talk of Hollywood for the last six weeks.In the first chapters of this picture Miss Dresser, who impersonates Mary Holmes, is seen as a drink-sodden woman who lives in a comfortless shack wherein her geese roam. Her besetting vice is gin, and to have it when she wants it she hides the liquor on a mantlepiece in a coffee pot. She has a past, and that past causes her to long for publicity. She gets the chance when a murder is committed near her squalid abode. The authorities come to interrogate her, as they might any one else in the vicinity, and to their great surprise they discover that the pathetic human wreck has a story to tell Mary Holmes shows the results of her craving for gin in her face. She has neglected herself miserably, but her vanity is touched at being questioned by the sleuths. She leans back in one of her wooden chairs and as she half closes her tired-looking eyes she tells them an amazing tale of having seen a man in a white coat fire a shot at another man on the night of the murder.The detectives and a representative from the District Attorney's office had arranged to have the woman's testimony taken down by a stenographer through a dictograph, and she is eventually confronted with her statement in typewritten form. She hesitates before she signs the paper, realizing that it is only a fictitious account. The interrogators ask her to swear to it, and after biting the end of the pen she takes the oath. Then she slowly puts her signature to the typewritten sheets, smiling as she finishes the flourish at the end of her name. She has not signed "Mary Holmes," but that of an erstwhile opera singer, Maria Nardi. The emissary from the District Attorneys office remembers this opera singer, and doubts that this forlorn woman can possibly be the former prima donna. Mary Holmes, however, proves that she is then telling the truth by bringing forth many photographs of herself as she was in the better days of the past.The narrative is unfolded convincingly, as the wretched woman's illegitimate son, Gerald, appears upon the scene. He wants to marry the beautiful Hazel Woods, and is griefstricken by what his mother tells him. Later he is arrested, as he has a white coat in his automobile, and then the aged mother is frantic about the damage her desire for publicity has done. She had been taken to a clean home, where she received attractive gowns, and therefore when she appears at the prison she looks like a real reflection of the past.Jack Pickford is earnest and natural in the rôle of the son and Constance Bennett is sympathetic and attractive as the heroine. Gustav von Seyffertitz, as the District Attorney's representative, is a decided personality. He is restrained and careful, never brutal or cruel in his questioning, and really gives one the idea that he is interested in the yarn the "Goose Woman" is unfolding.Marc MacDermott figures as Amos Ethridge, the murdered man. He does not have a responsible rôle, inasmuch as he is slain soon after the story opens.Here is another drama well worth seeing and a film in which the director. Clarence Brown, shows marked ability and a genuine desire to tell the tale in a modulated but effective tone. Mr. Brown now is directing Rudolph Valentino in his new Russian romance. An Echo of a Murder.THE GOOSE WOMAN, with Louise Dresser, Jack Pickford, Constance Bennett, James O. Barrows, George Cooper, Gustav von Seyffertitz, George Nichols and Marc MacDermott, adapted from a story by Rex Beach, directed by Clarence Brown; overture, a popular potpourri; instrumental novelty, with Roy Smeck; "A Fisherman's Fantasy," with Grace Fenimore Cooper and Howard Mills; special scenic; "Innocent Husbands," with Charles Chase.

848-> THE SCREEN
There is a measure of satisfaction in knowing that one is going to see Reginald Denny in a comedy, for no matter how flimsy his plot may be, it is reasonably certain that one will not be irritated and that some portions of the picture will be amusing. The latest contribution to the screen in which Mr. Denny is featured is known as "Where Was I?" It is running at the Colony, where yesterday it created occasional outbursts of merriment.It is a tale that has been stretched to a straining point. It looks as if the author had put in an extra idea here and there to keep up the interest in the weak chapters. It does, however, possess an element of suspense, as it keeps you guessing, but the way in which the denouement is brought about is abrupt and artless.William Seiter is responsible for the direction of this production, and it is probably he who encouraged Mr. Denny to bcome much to skittish at certain junctures. This example has been emulated by Otis Harlan and it has a tendency to lower the tone of the farce until in their sequences it is on a level with ordinary slapstick stuff.Mr. Denny fills the role of Thomas Bedford, a shrewd young business man who loses his heart to Alicia Stone (Marion Nixon). The girl's father does not look with favor upon the alliance, but the happy pair resolve that no paternal frown shall interfere with their marriage.Nobody can blame Thomas for being somewhat surprised when, the day before he is to be married, a young and pretty girl comes to his office and greets him as her husband, saying they were wed on January 9, 1923. The insistence of this young woman is most puzzling to Bedford, who to make matters more disturbing, cannot find out where he was on January 9, 1923. He does his utmost to ascertain and in his haste becomes involved in further trouble. He discovers that he has taken another man's brief case in which there is $12,000. So it is not long before our hero is wanted for robbery.Naturally in such a farce the two women have to appear in the same house, missing each other a number of times by the mere closing of a door. Finally Thomas feigns being ill with the result that he is forced to drink two bowls of chicken soup. He is up against a brick wall, it being inevitable that sooner or later Alicia is going to discover Claire.Mr. Denny makes things hum, with an occasional jolt. He has a pleasing personality and therefore one feels lenient when he becomes a trifle too acrobatic. Pauline Garon plays the part of Claire in a lively fashion. Marion Nixon is appealing as Alicia.If Mr. Denny is to join the ranks of Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Douglas MacLean and others he must have more satisfactory material. There are no novel twists or ingenious situations in this story, it apparently being the aim of the author to see how long he can stave off the inevitable end. His Awkward Predicament.WHERE WAS I? with Reginald Denny, Marion Nixon, Pauline Garon, Lee Moran, Tyronne Power, Otis Harlan and Chester Conklin, written by Edgar Franklin, directed by William Seiter; "Melody Masters"; Roger Dixon, tenor; "Banjoland," comedy musicians; Dolores Farris in "Humorous Steps."

1484-> EXTRAVAGANCE AND BANDITRY
We may not count the bandits and hold-up men among the highly socialized members of the community, and yet we may consider the situation from an angle intimately human.

--------
1487-> THE SCREEN
Joseph C. Lincoln's novels have attained their popularity because he knows how to make the folks down on Cape Cod real to his readers. His stories have the flavor of life in them, and this flavor is derived as often from the quaintness and humor the author sees about him as from the sterner virtues. What his characters do is often less important than how they do it.The producers of the film version of "Rugged Water," shown at the Rialto this week, seem to have forgotten that. They have again made the mistake that is so often made when a novel is translated to the screen; that is, they have taken the obvious outline of the story and let the color go by default. The result is, as always, a somewhat wooden narrative. Events in the life-saving service at Setuckit Station and the village of Orham move rather by schedule than by inspiration.If Lincoln had written all his novels as they have screened this one, Cape Cod would not be as well known in Medicine Hat and points West as it is today and the author would not be a best-seller. With certain honorable exceptions the movies today seem unaware of the fact that almost anybody can put together a story but that it takes an artist to install the interior decorations that make it carry conviction. When they get to understand that better they will know, for instance, why so many people rave about "The Last Laugh" and forget the comic notion that it is because the film was made without sub-titles.So this is a down-shore picture in which the sea air is not salt and the folks are not folks, but just persons. Indeed, the lack of sufficient characterization is, in one instance, so conspicuous as to interfere with the proper telling of the story. One questions seriously whether audiences will think the pivotal character of Cap'n Bartlett anything but grotesque. His antecedents have not been sufficiently explained. The book amply prepares the reader for his collapse into religious dementia. The film does not. From the book we know that this life-saver from another station thrust upon Setuckit as commander by political manipulation carries a scar on his soul left by a terrible experience. The film carries no adequate suggestion of that, and the actions that are revealed are therefore lacking in conviction.Within its limitations, however, the film gives a fairly consistent story, if we ignore the deficiency in the character of Cap'n Bartlett. And it is a fairly interesting one. Another merit is that it exploits a setting that is out of the ordinary. Further, its motives and incidents are drawn from real life, as far as they go, which is important in these days of artificiality in the movies. The acting is satisfactory throughout. Lois Wilson and Warner Baxter meet the not exacting demands of the principal rôles and Phyllis Haver and Dot Farley are excellent as the village siren and her scheming mother. Wallace Beery does as well as the script allows with Cap'n Bartlett. Not Folks, But Persons.RUGGED WATER, from Joseph C. Lincoln's novel of the same name, with Lois Wilson, Wallace Beery, Warner Baxter and Phyllis Haver, directed by Irvin Willat: "Boys Will Be Joys," an "Our Gang" comedy; Riesenfeld's classical jazz in four numbers; and a Lyman Howe "Hodge Podge." At the Rialto Theatre.Given a dog to exploit as the "hero" of a moving picture, what is a director going to do? Why, if he is sensible, just about what Herman Raymaker has done with "Tracked in the Snow Country," this week's feature picture at the Piccadilly. It is all about how Rin-Tin-Tin, descended from the four-footed tribe of man-slayers—one hates to say wolves when it can be put more elaborately—is suspected of having killed his master; how he is pursued and takes to the wilds and the company of the four-footed tribe of man-slayers—otherwise wolves; how he tracks down the real slayer of his master; and how all ends happily.If you like that sort of thing—and there are apparently many persons who do—you will like this film. It is a good specimen of the north-country type of melodrama. There is plenty of action in it and very little of the action is the overstrained kind you might expect, though they try your patience a bit at the end. There is also some very good photography. And the whole thing is set in snow and ice—not at all difficult to look at about this season of the year.The dog does what he is told by his invisible animal trainer, and sometimes they are very clever about creating the illusion that he has taken a look at the scenario and knows what it is all about. To accomplish that is no doubt very difficult. There are some who will wish it were impossible.Let us, however, not be too fussy. Art is a democratic institution and if a dog has genius, by what canon shall self-expression be denied him?The human actors in the piece—one supposes they should be mentioned—are altogether capable. June Marlowe is attractive and David Butler stalwart. Mitchell Lewis is so good a villain it seems likely he might fool any hero except Rin-Tin-Tin. The directing of Herman Raymaker is intelligent. The whole thing deserves the Scotch verdict: Not guilty, but don't do it again.Other Films.Other feature films at the Broadway houses this week include "Lightnin,'" at the Mark Strand; "The Street of Forgotten Men," at the Rivoli; "A Slave of Fashion," at the Capitol; "Under the Rouge," at the Colony; "Down to the Sea in Ships," at the Cameo; "The Danger Signal," at the Broadway, and "Don Q, Son of Zorro," at the Globe. A Dog as the Hero.TRACKED IN THE SNOW COUNTRY, with June Marlowe, David Butler, Mitchell Lewis, Charles Sellon, Frincess Lea and the dog Rin-Tin-Tin, directed by Herman Raymaker; "Indian Love Call" and "Un Pea d'Amour," violin solos played by Fredric Fradkin; organ novelties by John Hammond; Virginia Newbegin, soprano, and Claire Stetson in songs. At the Piccadilly Theatre.The chief ornament of the Philharmonic program and the test of Willem van Hoogstraten's conducting at the Lewisohn Stadium, City College, last evening, was Beethoven's "Eroica."The first part of the program, except for a brilliantly played introduction to Act III of "Lohengrin," had been comparatively light. The overture to "Die Fledermaus" was all rhythm and tunefulness. Charpentier's "Impressions of Italy," atmospheric and descriptive in the first two movements, became slightly tedious. But the orchestra and Mr. van Hoogstraten came to the real business of the evening in Beethoven's Third Symphony. As some one remarked, "they always keep the best for the last."The Stadium audience is worth looking at. It has a ground body of gray, on which is painted in pastel colors all the tints of the artist's palette. It is an audience which loves and appreciates music and follows the development of the scores with silent attention, to mark its approval with genuine applause.Tomorrow evening, when Beethoven's Ninth Symphony will be given, there probably will be a record crowd, as there was last year.Large Audience Hears Goldman.The Goldman Band, under Edwin Franko Goldman, attracted another large audience to the campus of New York University last evening. Inquiries have been made from various quarters as to whether these concerts were free to the public. They are, being a gift of the Guggenheim family to the people of the city. That the program which Mr. Goldman offers his audiences is greatly enjoyed is proved by the increasing crowds.

1489-> CHINA AND NATIONALISM; Chinese Student Sees His Class Striving for International Justice and Reform of Their Country's Present Diplomatic Status.
It is unfortunate that nearly all the reports which I have read in the newspapers here on the Shanghai situation are more or less one-sided. Naturally, as sent by Western men, they are in favor of foreign interests. Such terms as "Chinese mob," "students' rebellion," "rioters" or "agitators" are simply misleading.
