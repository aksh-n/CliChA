622-> THE SCREEN; More Backstage Bickering.
Helen Morgan, who was last seen in "Applause," is one of the featured players in "Roadhouse Nights," an audible film story of politics and bootlegging now at the Paramount. This picture has been produced with a sense of drama and also a sense of humor. There are moments when the impossible is accomplished, but as Hobart. Henley has directed it so intelligently one is willing to accept them, together with convenient co-incidences, as interesting imaginative feats.Ben Hecht, author of "Underworld," is responsible for the story, and his work is strong enough to withstand studio attacks. Perhaps it inspired Mr. Henley and the players, for one cannot point to a single disappointing performance in this film nor to a scene that does not hold the attention.Charles Ruggles, well-known for his characterizations of inebriates, is perceived in this tale both drunk and sober. It falls to his lot to talk a lot of twaddle over the telephone to the city editor of a Chicago newspaper and at the same time to tick off by dots and dashes the story of a murder by rum-runners and the fact that a chief of police of a suburb of the Windy City is one of the leading figures in a liquor ring. One can't help thinking while Willie Bindbugel (Mr. Ruggles) stands in the telephone booth, with a desperate bootlegger a few yards away, and talks in one line and uses the Morse code in another, that he is straining his mighty brain. Be that as it may, the message is quite successful.While this is going on, one also wonders why Sam Horner, the bootlegger, played by Fred Kohler, does not grasp what's happening, for he appears to be intelligent if lawless.In a final episode of this narrative, Helen Morgan, as Lola Fagan, takes a leaf out of "Broadway" and saves her old-time sweetheart, Bindbugel, by putting a bullet through Horner's heart. This is accomplished with stirring effect and without the tried and trusted methods of old movie tactics.In the beginning James Hanson, a reporter, is sent out by his city editor to look up a report on Horner's bootlegging activities. Hanson calls up to tell the result of his investigation to the newspaper and the city editor is seen listening at the telephone to Hanson, whose voice is heard. Suddenly the talking ceases. In another scene Horner is perceived putting his pistol back in his pocket and then taking a paper with penciled notes from Hanson, who is dead.The city editor presumes that Hanson has been drinking, and so he sends Bindbugel out to follow up the story. Mr. Bindbugel has little knowledge of the den of iniquity run by Horner. He meets Lola, whom he recognizes as a girl from his home town. How he subsequently is sent away after being drugged and then returns is a mixture of comedy and drama. His persistence finally wins out, but he would have paid for it with his life had not Lola been ready with a pistol.Horner's retreat is filmed impressively, for everybody in it, from the entertainers to the waiters and cook, have the appearance of desperadoes. Horner is a ruthless gunman, who expects to be obeyed or he will know the reason why.Miss Morgan gives a human interpretation to the rôle of Lola. Mr. Ruggles is capital as the persistent reporter, and Fred Kohler lends to his part the necessary authority.Charles Rogers is appearing in person in Jack Partington's stage contribution, "Hollywood on Broadway." Bootleggers and Murder.ROADHOUSE NIGHTS, with Helen Morgan, Charles Ruggles, Fred Kohler, Jimmy Durante, Fuller Mellish Jr., Leo Donnelly, Tammany Young, Joe King, Lou Clayton and Eddie Jackson, based on a story by Ben Hecht, directed by Hobart Henley; "Hollywood on Broadway," staged by Jack Partington, with Charles Rogers, Paul Ash, Allen and Canfield, Harriett Lee, Paul Small, Worthy and Thompson and others; Jesse Crawford, organist. At the Paramount Theatre.Except for a few interludes of passable comedy and two clever recitations by Marie Dressler, "Chasing Rainbows," another audible backstage pictorial narrative, now at the Capitol, is a hapless piece of work. It goes on and on, telling of the love affairs of a susceptible, thick-headed performer named Terry, until finally his loyal little teammate, Carlie, to whom he turns for affection and sympathy in moments of disappointment, is supposed to be happy in having won his affection.It is so utterly nonsensical that it becomes tedious before it is half way over, and that in spite of some impressive Technicolor episodes. During one sequence Bessie Love, as Carlie, is called upon to give vent to a fit of hysterical laughter that lasts for several minutes, and in another Miss Dressler, as Bonnie, and Polly Moran, as Polly, endeavor to create laughter by a show of intoxication.Carlie and Terry have been partners for years. Carlie is in love with Terry, but he is fascinated by leading women. Carlie looks after Terry, who, after his first blighted love affair in this yarn, calls for a pistol with which to end his life. Eddie, the stage manager, has plenty of common sense. He asks if anybody in the theatrical company has a weapon to accommodate Terry, knowing full well that Terry loves life more than he loves any woman.The new stellar performer, Daphne, is an old flame of Terry's and their affection is rekindled. Terry talks of love to Carlie, after discovering Daphne in the arms of another man. Daphne, however, soon convinces the stupid Terry that she really cares for him, and, much to the exaperation of part of the audience yesterday afternoon; Terry and Daphne are wed.The noble little Carlie continues to be sympathetic, although she is down-hearted. Daphne, who has hopes of obtaining a Broadway engagement through Terry's influence, happens to be overheard by Terry protesting her love for another player. This time Terry takes matters more seriously and then Carlie lets Terry know what an ingrate he has been. It might have helped the story a little if she had refused to have anything further to do with him, but the author presumed that it would be a good idea to have the clever Carlie once again Terry's victim. One can presume that Terry will continue his attentions to leading women, and that Carlie will have to put up with it.During this cascade of bickering behind the scenes, Charles King, who impersonates Terry, sings several songs, two of them being called "Lucky Me to Have Lovable You" and "Happy Days Are Here Again."Part of Miss Dressler's low comedy had the desirable effect upon the throng yesterday afternoon. Miss Love is worthy of a far better vehicle. More Backstage Bickering.CHASING RAINBOWS, with Bessie Love, Charles King, Jack Benny, George K. Arthur, Polly Moran, Cwen Lee, Nita Martan, Eddie Phillips, Marie Dressler and Youcca Troubetzkoy, Written by Bess Meredyth, directed by Charles Riener; "Krazyland," produced by Chester Hale, with Barbara Blair, Leon Chalzel and others.

715-> GRANDEUR'S FIRST REAL TALKER SHOWN; "Happy Days," William Fox's Film at the Roxy, Boasts Largest of Screens. MANY FAVORITES IN CAST Dialogue of Large Group Made Possible--Minstrel Show Imaginatively Staged.
William Fox's first Grandeur audible picture to have had the studio advantages of special settings and illumination is now at the Roxy, which, besides being the largest cinema theatre in the world, can for the time being also boast of having the largest screen ever constructed. It is 42 feet wide and 20 feet high, the standard screen of this house being 24 by 18 feet. The single Grandeur film frame is twice that of the standard picture and a trifle higher. An additional advantage of the Grandeur film is that it permits the sound track to be three times as wide as that of the standard film. This increased space results in the voices being more modulated and in the incidental sounds being more natural.This enlarged picture is called "Happy Days," most of it being a minstrel show with a host of the Fox stars and feature players.Full opportunity is taken of the imposing screen in the matter of enormous stage settings and large groups of players, but while this production is enlightening concerning the benefits of the Grandeur film, it is not one that gives as full a conception of the possibilities as future films of this type will probably do. That is to say, those offerings on the same scale with a definite dramatic story accompanied by indoor and out-of-doors scenes will perhaps prove still more impressive than the actions of players in a minstrel show with a haphazard undercurrent narrative. Also at the first showing about noon yesterday the device behind the screen for reproducing the sound was not always arranged so that the voices came directly from the person whose lips were moving. This, it is true, was only apparent in semi-close-up "shots," and doubtless this theatre reproduction fault will be corrected. On the other hand, this Grandeur film has the attribute of permitting from three to half a dozen persons to appear, in the foreground, quite large enough to carry out the dialogue, without flashing to one person while the others are left off the screen, as is done in the ordinary films."Happy Days" may not be highly exciting, but through the medium of its presentation it affords a really good and impressive entertainment, which at a second showing to a packed theatre yesterday afternoon was roundly applauded. There are songs from several of the Fox favorites, including J. Harold Murray, Victor McLaglen, George MacFarlane, Frank Richardson, "Whispering" Jack Smith, Marjorie White, Dixie Lee and others.An amusing number is one contributed by Mr. McLaglen and Mr. Lowe in which the former goes his partner in the vicissitudes of pictorial stories one better by singing while Mr. Lowe contents himself with reciting. They tell what good friends they really are in spite of their animosity in other films. Judging by what happens, this assertion can be taken with a grain of salt.This Grandeur film is not only imaginatively staged but beautifully photographed. When one of the minstrels is called upon to do his stunt, the burnt cork suddenly vanishes from his face and his physiognomy is white.In one of the features a bevy of dancing girls suddenly appears from two huge shoes. In another there is a giant baby carriage with about a dozen crying infants, and in a third a wedding cake that makes the players look like Lilliputians. James J. Corbett comes forth as one of the victims of interlocutors, and Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor chant a melody as they put a tiny house together.Will Rogers, Walter Catlett and William Collier contribute to the fund of gayety, and Ann Pennington delights with an exhibition of the light fantastic.All the scenes in sweeping nearly across a proscenium such as the Roxy's are wonderfully effective, for through the increased stature of the characters portrayed it makes this stage seem no larger than that of an ordinary theatre. Giant shadows are performing, but through the comparative size of everything they do not strike one as being too big, not even when they are drawn into a semi-close-up.In some of the early scenes there are exterior views which are also striking.The story deals with the energetic and comic efforts of Marjorie White to help Colonel Billy Batcher, the reigning genius of the "Mammoth Minstrels," who is stranded somewhere along the Mississippi. Miss White is an enterprising little person who enlists the support of the players mentioned to give a benefit performance in Memphis for Colonel Batcher. Part of the time Miss White finds it necessary to masquerade as a page boy in the Screen and Stage Club, but one day through gruff treatment, her long hair betrays her sex and then everybody is eager to dash to Memphis to aid Billy Batcher. And so there is the special minstrel show on the screen in Grandeur form. HAPPY DAYS, with Janet Gaynor, Will Rogers, Charles Farrell, Warner Baxter, Victor McLaglen, Edmund Lowe, Frank Albertson, El Brendel, Walter Catlett, William Collier, Dixie Lee, Sharon Lynn, George MacFarlane, J. Harold Murray, Paul Page, Tom Patricola, Ann Pennington, Frank Richardson, David Rollins, Marjorie White, "Whispering" Jack Smith, James J. Corbett, Richard Keene, George Olsen and others, based on a story by Sidney Lanfield and Edwin Burke, directed by Benjamin Stoloff; "Niagara Falls," a Grandeur scenic; "Rhapsody," with Von Grona and the Roxy ballet corps; Movietone News; "La Grande Jardiniere," with Beatrice Belkin, Patricia Bowman and others. At the Roxy Theatre.Just when George Arliss in the flesh may have been giving an order for tea, either at the Garrick Club, in London, or at the Casino, in Cannes, the audible pictorial translation of William Archer's play, "The Green Goddess," in which Mr. Arliss plays the smooth-spoken, Oxonian Rajah, of Rukh, was being unfurled last night at the Winter Garden in this city. And it might also be said that this same Mr. Arliss, moving and speaking, but in shadow form, was entertaining simultaneously an audience at another Broadway theatre in the guise of that redoubtable British premier, Disraeli.As the Vitaphone version of Louis N. Parker's play, "Disraeli," had met with such astounding success in this city, it was naturally expected that "The Green Goddess," with the same brilliant actor, would equal, if not surpass, the previous presentation. But, sad to relate, the Archer melodrama does not in any way measure up to "Disraeli."Both these productions were directed by Alfred E. Green, but it happens that "The Green Goddess" was the tryout before the camera and the Parker play the second effort. Whether this made any difference is problematical, but there was, perhaps, greater hope before studio work for "The Green Goddess" than for "Disraeli." As a silent picture Mr. Parker's play was pleasing, but "The Green Goddess" was brilliant. In fact, even endowed as it is with speech and other sounds, it is doubtful whether this current edition of Mr. Archer's clever melodrama can vie with the mute production.The fault, however, is not with Mr. Arliss, for he gives his usual polished performance. He is just as different from his impersonation of Disraeli as that British statesman was from any Hindu Rajah. The incidents in the present production, however, are not developed with the necessary care and H. B. Warner, who acts the part of Major Crespin, is far too theatric in his performance.This version of "The Green Goddess" has also the benefit of the talent of Ivan Simpson, another actor who has played in the same melodrama for both the stage and the silent screen, but the work of others can at best be characterized as good intentions. The true import of the drama is sufficiently accentuated, but the necessary details have received but scant attention.The timely arrival of the airplanes is presented in a fashion that is not nearly as stirring as was the same incident in the silent film. Neither is the telegraphing sequence in this audible film to be compared with that of its mute predecessor. There seems to be a lack of drama throughout, in spite of the competent performances of both Mr. Arliss and Mr. Simpson. It is true that the Rajah impresses one with his evil intentions concerning the attractive Mrs. Crespin, but there seems to be a definite assurance that she will be rescued eventually from the vengeful Rajah of Rukh.To give this film its due it should be set forth that the death of Watkins, the Rajah's valet, is pictured most effectively, for one perceives him falling from the palace window to the depths of a mountain canyon.It will be remembered that the story deals with a party of Britishers, including the personable Mrs. Crespin, who make a disastrous landing in an airplane, which is so badly crippled that they cannot get away. They find themselves in the realm of the Rajah of Rukh, who has his own reasons for hating Britishers.Major Crespin is killed and the Rajah rather fancies the alluring Mrs. Crespin, whose life he is willing to spare so long as she becomes one of his favorite wives. As for the men he thinks that they all had better stand against a wall.Alice Joyce does well enough as Mrs. Crespin, Ralph Forbes is not especially impressive as Dr. Traherne, Nigel de Brulier impersonates a Hermit priest. Then there are other Hindus who are more than slightly suggestive of Californians. The Rajah of Rukh.THE GREEN GODDESS, with George Arliss, Alice Joyce, H. B. Warner, Ralph Forbes, David Tearle, Reginald Sheffield, Nigel de Brulier, Betty Boyd, Ivan Simpson and others, based on William Archer's play, directed by Alfred E. Green. At the Winter Garden.

But she has already agreed to accompany the grandee of the island to the fiesta and the sailor waxes furious. There follows a scene in which he denounces her in a manner in which only a motion picture hero would and at the same time be allowed to live.Nevertheless, the girl goes to the celebration, wins the plaudits of the pseudo Spaniards and afterward induces the nobleman to release her sailor sweetheart from prison where he has been cast for no particular reason. The seaman, set free, returns to rescue the girl from the plotting villain and carries her off on his ship.Miss Daniels sings pleasantly enough in this photoplay, the only evident reason for its being. Mr. Hughes is certainly miscast as a rollicking seaman, his manner of braggadocio being so assumed as to make his part far too obvious. Montague Love as the grandee speaks in an accent so thick that his acting is completely screened.

1435-> THE SCREEN; The Duncan Sisters. The Lout.
The Duncan sisters, Rosetta and Vivian, are to be seen at the Capitol in an alternately cheery and mournfultalking and singing film known as "It's a Great Life." The plot of this affair may not be widely different from other back-stage tales, but it is set forth interestingly and with no little ingenuity. It is virtually the same bag of tricks as was used in Moran and Mack's "Why Bring That Up?" and while the ending in this current offering virtually is identical with that of its predecessor, it is accomplished here in an imaginative fashion.For the first time on the screen there is an impressive conception of a stage girl's delirious dream. This is wrought in Technicolor with modernistic settings, with action that is right down clever. Just before this dream comes to the screen one sees Casey. Hogan (Rosetta) and Babe Hogan (Vivian) in each other's arms. Babe is delirious and does not recognize her sister, and the ensuing scenes are the sick girl's dream of her stage hopes. This brightly arranged stretch also gives the director a chance to save the spectator several minutes anguish and at the same time permits him to entertain the audience with performances of the merry sisters as Babe dreams of their act.Even the lachrymose incidents are so adroitly acted that they have more than a veneer of truth. The bickering and recrimination that go on between Jimmy Dean (Lawrence Gray) and Casey are not without humor, and just as Casey's humor is the meat of the act, so the frolicking in this picture, more than anything else, causes it to be a corking good entertainment despite its stereotyped narrative.Besides the dream sequence there is another passage in natural colors, one concerned with a stage performance. It is rather confusing, however, to look at the same background first in rainbow hues and then in plain black and white, for only half of this chapter is in pastel shades.The vocalized screen serves the Duncan sisters well, for they are without a doubt infinitely more successful in this present affair than they were in their silent shadow production, "Topsy and Eva." Sam Wood, the director of "It's a Great Life," runs his story at a fast pace and makes the most of the talents of the Duncan sisters. There is also good singing and tuneful music in this film, "Following You" being one of the catchy melodies that is rendered several times.The opening scenes are far from conventional. The Hogan sisters, with a word or two about a purse, are perceived darting down the front steps of a house and then tearing through the streets. Their haste arouses the curiosity of a policeman and the sight of a minion of the law running stirs up the interest of hundreds of idle pedestrians. The shame-faced bluecoat eventually learns that he was pursuing two shopgirls who were five or ten minutes late for work.The glimpses inside Mandelbaum's department store provoke plenty of mirth, for such a place of business is a fertile field for the vivacious Duncans, and when they are subsequently beheld back-stage and before the footlights, these sisters naturally are in their element, and the fact that they are so familiar with the life of a stage performer is perhaps one reason why this production is so much more pleasing than the usual run of such yarns.Mr. Gray does well in the part of the ignoramus, Jimmy Dean, a piano player, who finds Casey Hogan one too many for him. He also sings pleasingly. Jed Prouty gives a sympathetic portrayal as a love-smitten store manager and Benny Friedman appears to advantage in the minor part of booking agent.On the surrounding program is a stage contribution called "Land of Syncopation," devised and staged by Arthur Knorr. One of the best numbers in it is the work of the Caligary brothers, European acrobatic comedians. The Duncan Sisters.IT'S A GREAT LIFE, with Rosetta and Vivian Duncan, Lawrence Gray, Jed Prouty and Benny Rubin, based on a story by Byron Morgan and Alfred Block, directed by Sam Wood; "Land and Syncopation," staged and devised by Arthur Knorr, with the Caligary Brothers, Sally and Ted. Serge Flash and others. At the Capitol Theatre.An ably directed and cleverly acted audible pictorial story of a stage lout, a pretty girl and a brilliant performer is now on view at the Paramount. It was directed by Robert Milton and Dorothy Arzner, who share alternately in screen credit for their dual direction. In the case of this present production, known as "Behind the Makeup," Mr. Milton enjoys the distinction of having his name appended to it.The characters are quite well delineated, but the story is rather limp and disappointing. Hal Skelly, William Powell and Fay Wray are the principals in this film, which opens promisingly and continues to hold the interest until Hap Brown becomes a trifle too eager to shield Gardoni, his colleague, who steals Marie, the girl he loves, and who also makes capital out of Hap's ideas.Hap is a dolt, a comedian without imagination. His doctrine is hokum. He finds Gardoni faint through lack of food. He befriends the foreign performer, who has failed on the stage because his efforts are over the heads of his audiences. Hap and Gardoni come to the conclusion that if they team together they may strike a happy medium and be successful. They try out their scheme. ??? it fails, an awesome stillness ???going their work before the footprints.The partnership is severed and Hap girls to work as a dishwasher in the little New Orleans restaurant where he was in the habit of taking his meals and chatting with Marie.Hap and Marie go to the theatre together and Hap is amazed to see Gardoni on the stage entertaining the audience with a suggestion he (Hap) had made to the foreigner. Marie and Hap go backstage to see Gardoni and quite abruptly Marie becomes fascinated by the glib foreigner. It isn't long before they are married and Hap, downhearted, consents to team up again with Gardoni. This time the act proves to be successful, more so that when Gardoni was acting alone.The morose Hap worships Marie, but when he discovers Gardoni's infidelity, he keeps the matter to himself. Gardoni supplies funds to an adventuress, who has a jolly time gambling.Mr. Milton finally gets rid of Gardoni by letting it be known that he has committed suicide by jumping in the river. Still the hapless Hap considers it his duty to whitewash Gardoni's character, but all's well that ends well, for in the end there is an appreciative smile on Marie's charming countenance as she sits in a theatre gazing upon Hap's successful performance.The lighting of the scenes and the movements of the players are effectively done. The voices are especially well recorded. William Powell as Gardoni speaks with an Italian accent. Sometimes he utters whole sentences in Italian, and his performance throughout is excellent. Miss Wray is pleasing as Marie. Mr. Skelly goes about his part with earnestness and intelligence. Kay Francis does nicely as the adventuress.Harry Richman appears in the stage offering, "Jazz Preferred." The Lout.BEHIND THE MAKEUP, with Hal skelly, William Powell, Fay Wray, Kay Francis, E. H. Calvert, Paul Lukas and Agostino Borgato, based on a story by Mildred Cram, directed by Robert Milton; "Jazz Preferred," staged by Louis M. McDermott, with Harry Richman, Yvette Rugel, Smith and Hadley, Caperton and Fiddle and others; Jesse Crawford, organist. At the Paramount Theatre.
