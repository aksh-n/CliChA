98-> Irwin Shaw's 'Young Lions'; War Story Is Offered at the Paramount Brando, Martin and Clift Are Starred
A FRESHLY refurbished Paramount Theatre was reopened for business last night with a benefit premiere performance of the film made from Irwin Shaw's "The Young Lions." In harmony with the occasion, Mr. Shaw's story has been refurbished, too.Most noticeable of its changes is in the character of the young Nazi who, along with two American soldiers, is central in Mr. Shaw's novel of World War II. In that large and sweeping saga, this young warrior is introduced as a fairly decent ski instructor who, under the hammering of nazism and war, is molded into a monster, fired with militaristic madness and blood lust.But in this prettier film version, which is two hours and forty-seven minutes long, this significantly unregenerate Nazi is changed into a very nice young man who never embraces nazism with any apparent zeal. Indeed, he regards the whole business of war with sadness and disgust that become increasingly depressing as time and disasters pile up. Finally, he is thoroughly disillusioned and sick to death with it all, when a bullet, fired by one of the American heroes, brings his sad life to an end.As played by Marion Brando, with his hair dyed a shiny corn-silk blond and his voice affecting a German accent reminiscent of Weber and Fields, this fellow is sensitive and attractive. He evokes complete sympathy. He has the gentleness of one of those nice young Germans in the memorable "All Quiet on the Western Front." Indeed, there is much about "The Young Lions" that is mindful of that film. It is not so much anti-Nazi as it is vaguely and loosely anti-war.And this cues the second notation of what has been done with Mr. Shaw's story in this film, which was produced by the late Al Lichtman for Twentieth Century-Fox. It has been chopped by scriptwriter Edward Anhalt into a sort of formless mosaic episodes that fall together int a sort of formless mosaic of the emotional upsets and physical hardships of three soldiers caught up in war. There is really no noticeable moral difference between the one German and the two Americans.Some of the episodes are quite affecting, such as the one in which the American, who is a Jew, puts up a long, courageous battle against a group of G.I. bigots, abetted by his captain, in training camp. This is matched by the episode in which the German is distastefully compelled to take part in the slaughter of British soldiers caught in a desert surprise attack. In each instance, the individual hero is brutalized by his own countrymen. The only villains are the singular brutes on both sides who make life in the armies miserable.As it happens, Mr. Brando makes the German much more vital and interesting than Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin make the Americans. Mr. Clift is strangely hollow and lackluster as the sensitive Jew. He acts throughout the picture as if he were in a glassy-eyed daze. And Mr. Martin plays a Broadway showman pulled into the army against his will as if he was lonesome for Jerry Lewis and didn't know exactly what to do.Unfortunately, neither the script nor the direction of Edward Dmytryk gives him much help. Mr. Martin has by far the least expressive of the three main roles in the film. Even his girl, played by Barbara Rush, gets shanghaied somewhere along about the end of the second hour and is seen no more. There are several loose threads that Mr. Anhalt and Mr. Dmytryk have failed to tie.As for the women in the picture—Hope Lange, May Britt and Miss Rush—they are competent and attractive in conventional war-picture roles. A shrill, vicious Nazi captain is played that way by Maximilian Schell.There are plenty of hard, familiar incidents in this black-and-white CinemaScope film, but they are old stuff in the making of war movies and they don't add up to a clear theme. "The Young Lions" is strangely impositive about totalitarian aggression and all-out war. THE YOUNG LIONS, screenplay by Edward Anhalt; based on the novel by Irwin Shaw; directed by Edward Dmytryk; produced by Al Lichtman; presented by Twentieth Century-Fox. At the Paramount.

104-> F. D. R. AS INVALID; ' Sunrise at Campobello' Chronicles Grim Years of His Private Ordeal
THE deep emotional power of "Sunrise at Campobello" is not simple to explain. Although Dore Schary's script is well written, although Ralph Bellamy's performance as F. D. R. is remarkable, neither the one nor the other is great enough to account for the profound impression the production makes on the audience. 
--------
105-> CHILDREN THE THEME; Seymour's Photographs On View at Limelight
PHOTOGRAPHY of the underprivileged child can be a revelation of childhood in distress, or it can merely approach the maudlin for a propaganda effect. One is the reporter's way, to communicate with simple directness the fact and emotion of a real situation; the other is almost always recognized for what it is -- an obviously calculated effort to evoke a sympathetic response, and therefore, nearly always lacks conviction.

1105-> Screen: Rene Clair's 'Gates of Paris'; Tender and Wistful Film at Fine Arts
RENE CLAIR is another of the great film satirists of former days who has become quite mellow and wistful now that he is getting on in years. His new film, "Gates of Paris" (called "Porte des Lilas" in France), is a touching indication of it. It opened at the Fine Arts yesterday.Where M. Clair was often mocking and ironic in the past, in such sparkling films as "Le Million" and "A Nous la Liberté," he is tender, good-natured, facetious and not a little sad in this. His theme is the force of human kindness and the value of helping others with a little love.As he did in many of his previous pictures, notably "Sous les Toits de Paris," he has chosen a corner of Paris and a handful of Paris types to represent the cosmos he is thinking about in this film. The corner is a working-class area near one of the ancient "gates," and the people are workers, one criminal, bistro denizens and a genial bum.This bum is the principal character, for it is he, a neighborhood joke, who does the amazing and audacious thing of giving a secret hiding-place and home to a notorious fugitive criminal who is trapped in the neighborhood. And it is he who acquires new strength and happiness by helping this man in need, then turns on the ingrate and destroys him when the latter attempts to betray a loving girl.This may sound like a solemn melodrama, and in some of its details it is a little strong on the heavy business of violence and guns. But always M. Clair is the mellow and droll observer who finds the goodness or homely human failings in the best of his characters.Pierre Brasseur as the neighborhood "stupide" constitutes the most appealing of these, combining a sweetness of nature with his heavy and clumsy ways. As the girl whom he hopelessly worships and who later falls in love with the crook, little Dany Carrel is as attractive as, and a much better actress than, Brigitte Bardot. Henri Vidal is handsome and dynamic, with a touch of gentleness, as the crook, and Raymond Bussièrres is heavily Gallis as the bartending father of the girl.As a melancholy guitarist, M. Clair has Georges Brassens, a well-known Parisian cafe singer of anarchistic songs. M. Brassens, according to the stories, has never hidden his hatred of the cops—"les flics"—who are the villains in this picture, and his surliness comes out in the film. He makes perhaps the weakest and least appreciable of all the characters. His principal contributions are some moody, guitar - accompanied songs.Indeed, it is too bad—and surprising—that M. Clair has not employed more music of the sort that M. Brassens sings, or of a more poignant nature, through the film. For this is a picture and a subject that cries for the musical refrains and the complements of melody that used to feature M. Clair's earlier films. It is bitter-sweet and sentimental, a reflection of the Paris that lived under the rooftops and in the bistros. M. Clair should have given us more songs.But "Gates of Paris" is, without them, still a genial and wistful film. It is in black-and-white, which is appropriate, and the English subtitles do their job. The CastGATES OF PARIS, written and directed by Rene Clair; produced by Andre Daven for Filmsonor Productions of France; presented by Lopet Films. At the Fine Arts.
