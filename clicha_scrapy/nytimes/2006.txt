1-> A Song-and-Dance Salute to the Sun King
It seemed appropriate on Friday that the New York Collegium’s concert “Music for the Sun King” was held in the Allen Room at the showy Time Warner Center, overlooking Central Park South and the lavish apartments of Manhattan’s own royalty. The concert, conducted by Andrew Parrott, opened the Baroque band’s ninth season with a focus on Jean-Baptiste Lully, the star composer of the court of Louis XIV. The program included scenes from Lully’s opera “Armide,” the lively Chaconne from his “Amadis,” and “Domine Salvum Fac Regem,” a Lully choral work, interspersed with vocal and instrumental pieces by other composers of the French court. Robert Mealy, the collegium’s fine concertmaster, provided a strong pulse and rhythmic vitality to the strings, although the overall pace of the first half of the program felt somewhat sluggish. Nathalie Paulin, a soprano, and Aaron Sheehan, a tenor, who sang in “Armide” and other works, were strong. Shelley Gruskin played intriguing interludes on the hurdy-gurdy and the musette, the bagpipe popular with the French aristocracy. One of the evening’s highlights was Marin Marais’s “Tombeau Pour Mr. de Lully,” performed by Emily Walhout, a viola da gamba player. Marais’s gamba music was popularized by Jordi Savall on the exquisite soundtrack to “Tous les Matins du Monde,” an eloquent French film. Ms. Walhout offered a soulful and expressive performance of this lovely piece, accompanied by Eric Milnes, the ensemble’s harpsichordist. Mr. Milnes also gave a stylish, spirited rendition of D’Anglebert’s “Courante de Mr. de Lully.” But unfortunately, the two dancers who appeared often during the program looked hopelessly kitschy in their period costumes, with wigs that bobbed incongruously against the flickering lights of the jagged Manhattan skyline. The players, in contrast, wore stylish black outfits that fitted the sleek, modern contours of the Allen Room. Two musicians took part in a vaguely amusing dance lesson, but for the rest, the dancers were a distraction. This is gorgeous music, and it doesn’t need illustrating.

5-> A Girl, a War and a Bunch of Gentle Lessons
“Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front” is to sincere as “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” is to camp. So it’s both odd and satisfying, while watching this sweet holiday television movie (Sunday night on the Disney Channel), to come upon a “Mommie Dearest” moment. When little Molly McIntire (Maya Ritter) refuses to eat the turnips served at dinner, the neighbor looking after her and her siblings orders her to sit at the table until she has cleaned her plate. “Which means I’ll be here until I die,” Molly announces woefully. But unlike Christina Crawford, Molly has a mother (played by Molly Ringwald) who is willing to compromise. When Mom comes home from her job at the airplane factory, she warms up the turnips, mixing in a little butter and sugar (to heck with the rations!), and Molly happily finishes her meal. It is wartime  1944 to be exact  and Molly is learning about sacrifice, hardship, doing her part and the preciousness of family. As she does, viewers may be concerned about manipulation on more than one front. First there’s Molly’s provenance. She is one of the dolls-with-historically-significant-back-stories that make up the lucrative American Girl empire. (The Fifth Avenue store has its own restaurant and its own on-site theater production, as well as floors of dolls, doll clothing, doll books and other accessories.) Clearly, at least one of the reasons the movie exists is to sell merchandise. Then there’s the war. Granted, this is World War II, the one that even protesters in the Vietnam era could see as “the good war,” totally justified and noble. But it may seem to some viewers that Molly’s lessons in the necessity of the ultimate sacrifice are meant to persuade young viewers to see the current war in Iraq as equally noble. Parents can talk to their children about that issue and then safely allow them to enjoy “Molly” for what it mostly is, a heartwarming, dreamlike vision of American small-town life six decades ago, with universal lessons around every corner. In addition to loving her parents and tolerating her brother and sister, Molly has a rich life. She and her best friends go to the movies and learn about the world from the newsreels (in which young Princess Elizabeth of Britain makes a reassuring speech to children around the globe). They idolize a pretty young teacher, Miss Campbell (Sarah Manninen), and fantasize about her romance with and coming marriage to a handsome young soldier. Molly desperately wants to win the lead in the big tap-dancing finale of the school’s Christmas show. She acknowledges that she isn’t a very good dancer but is willing to do whatever it takes to become one. “I’ll practice day and night,” she announces, although she hates to practice. Her father (David Aaron Baker) supports her completely. “Once my girl makes up her mind, there’s no stopping her,” he tells her with an approving smile. Molly’s trials include dealing with a wartime shortage of ice cream, saying a tearful goodbye to her father as he leaves for Britain, watching her mother take a job (horrors!) and, most intrusive of all, being forced to share her bedroom with a total stranger. That stranger is Emily Bennett (Tory Green), a young refugee from London who modestly talks about living in a manor house and having the royal family to tea. (“It was only once.”) Not surprisingly, Molly’s resentment of Emily diminishes, and they become friends, even before Emily apologetically reveals her terrible secret. “Molly: An American Girl” is poignant but carefully avoids difficult choices and long-term disappointment. A spelling bee that pits two major characters against each other is interrupted and declared a tie. Telegrams from the War Department arrive regularly, but really bad things happen only to minor characters. Hard work and sacrifice always pay off in victory. (Molly isn’t that great a tap dancer, but what are the odds of her winning the starring role in the show?) That, come to think of it, may be the most subversive message of all.

6-> Java Gas Explosion Tied to Mud Eruptions
JAKARTA, Indonesia, Nov. 23  A gas pipeline explosion that has killed at least seven people in East Java was a consequence of the mud eruptions that began several months ago, government officials and drilling experts said Thursday. The heavy outflows of mud and water caused the earth level to drop, and a dike that had been built to contain the mud collapsed, officials said, creating pressure that ruptured the pipeline. “The land subsided two meters,” the minister for energy and mineral resources, Purnomo Yusgiantoro, said at a news conference in Surabaya after inspecting the site of the blast, 23 miles to the south. The explosion, which occurred Wednesday evening, sent flames shooting into the sky. Unofficial accounts have put the death toll at 10, most of them police officers and soldiers. At least 15 people were injured and several are still missing, officials said Thursday. Such an accident had been feared since the mud eruptions began nearly six months ago, after a company drilling for natural gas, Lapindo Brantas, failed to properly line the sides of its well, according to government officials.

8-> Rounding Up the Best of the Boxed; John Coltrane -- Fearless Leader
John Coltrane's sessions for Prestige records from the late 1950s are seen as warm-ups for his later accomplishments, and rightly so: in technique and sound and concept, he evolved miles past what you hear on these discs, and they don't benefit from the intuitive magic of a working band. But these sessions -- which resulted in LPs including "Traneing In," "Lush Life" and "Soultrane" -- are excellent, casual, small-group pickup jobs, all led by Coltrane, most of them with the bassist Paul Chambers and the drummer Arthur Taylor. Since the last time this material came out on a CD box set 15 years ago the audio has been improved so that you can hear way, way more of the colors in the music, the size of the bass notes, the timbre of Coltrane's sound.

12-> Drug Industry Is on Defensive as Power Shifts
WASHINGTON, Nov. 23 — Alarmed at the prospect of Democratic control of Congress, top executives from two dozen drug companies met here last week to assess what appears to them to be a harsh new political climate, and to draft a battle plan. Hoping to prevent Congress from letting the government negotiate lower drug prices for millions of older Americans on Medicare, the pharmaceutical companies have been recruiting Democratic lobbyists, lining up allies in the Bush administration and Congress, and renewing ties with organizations of patients who depend on brand-name drugs. Many drug company lobbyists concede that the House is likely to pass a bill intended to drive down drug prices, but they are determined to block such legislation in the Senate. If that strategy fails, they are counting on President Bush to veto any bill that passes. With 49 Republicans in the Senate next year, the industry is confident that it can round up the 34 votes normally needed to uphold a veto. While that showdown is a long way off, the drug companies are not wasting time. They began developing strategy last week at a meeting of the board of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Billy Tauzin, president of that group, a lobbying organization for brand-name drug companies, recently urged Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of New York, to seek a position as chairman of a powerful House subcommittee, said Karen Johnson, a spokeswoman for Mr. Towns. The subcommittee has authority over Medicare and the Food and Drug Administration. Democrats have yet to decide who will head the subcommittee. Mr. Tauzin, a former congressman, also met with Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who has been trying for six years to allow drug imports from Canada. The industry vehemently opposes such legislation. James C. Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, another trade group, said, “There is a lot of pent-up animosity among Democrats against the pharmaceutical industry.” Mr. Greenwood, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania, said he had a list of 37 Congressional Democrats whom he intended to call in the next month. Amgen, the biotechnology company, recently disclosed that it had retained as a lobbyist George C. Crawford, a former chief of staff for Representative Nancy Pelosi of California. Ms. Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, is in line to become speaker in January and has said that the House will immediately take up legislation authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. The 2003 Medicare law prohibits the federal government from negotiating drug prices or establishing a list of preferred drugs. Amgen is also seeking strategic advice from the Glover Park Group, a consulting firm whose founders include Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for President Bill Clinton. Other major drug companies have been snatching up Democratic former-aides-turned-lobbyists. Merck recently has hired Peter Rubin, a former aide to Representative Jim McDermott of Washington, one of the more liberal House Democrats. Cephalon has hired Kim Zimmerman, a health policy aide to Senator Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat of Nebraska. The Biotechnology Industry Organization has retained Paul T. Kim, a former aide to two influential Democrats, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative Henry A. Waxman of California. A Medicare expert who works for House Democrats said he recently received three job offers in one day from the drug industry, by telephone and in person. At a dinner last week at the Hotel Monaco here, as part of their board meeting, pharmaceutical executives dissected the midterm election results with experts including Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster, and Stuart Rothenberg, the editor of a political newsletter. Drug makers have not set a budget for their campaign. They and their trade groups already spend some $100 million a year on lobbying in Washington. “We have new political realities to attend to,” Mr. Tauzin said in an interview after the board meeting. “We and our allies will do everything we can to defend the Medicare drug benefit, to get out the message that it is working.” To reinforce that message, drug companies plan to mobilize beneficiaries and urge them to contact Congress. “I’m putting my trust in beneficiaries,” said Mr. Tauzin, who represented Louisiana in the House for more than two decades, first as a Democrat and then as a Republican. Several recent surveys suggest that at least three-fourths of the people with Medicare drug coverage are satisfied. But Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, who hopes to head the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said price negotiations for Medicare were his priority. “The 2003 Medicare law was essentially written by the drug industry,” Mr. Pallone said in an interview. “That’s why you don’t have negotiated prices. Republican policies have served special interests like the pharmaceutical industry, and the American taxpayer is paying the price.” Drug lobbyists believe that the Senate will be receptive to their argument that price negotiations lead inevitably to price controls, and to restrictions on access to drugs, likely to be unpopular with beneficiaries. Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, said the White House opposed federal price negotiations because they would unravel the whole structure of the Medicare drug benefit, which relies on competing private plans. Among leaders who attended the board meeting last week were Kevin Sharer, chairman of Amgen; Jeffrey B. Kindler, chief executive of Pfizer; Sidney Taurel, chairman of Eli Lilly; and Richard T. Clark, chief executive of Merck. Drug lobbyists say they want to work with the new Democratic majority, but that will not be easy. In its campaign contributions, the pharmaceutical industry has overwhelmingly favored Republicans over Democrats. Drug companies infuriated many Democrats in 2003, when they worked closely with Republicans to create the Medicare drug benefit, in a process from which Democrats were largely excluded. On other issues, Democrats are pushing for stricter regulation of drug safety and for legislation to encourage development of low-cost generic versions of expensive biotechnology drugs. They are determined to allow imports of drugs from Canada, where brand-name products are often cheaper. They want to investigate drug pricing and profits, drug advertising aimed at consumers and the marketing of drugs to doctors for purposes not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Democrats may try to repeal some of the liability protections that have been given to vaccine manufacturers. Outspoken critics of the pharmaceutical industry will gain power as a result of Senate committee assignments made last week. Senators Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, and Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, are joining the Finance Committee, which has sweeping authority over Medicare and Medicaid. Three liberal senators — Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Barack Obama of Illinois and Bernard Sanders of Vermont — are joining the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, which oversees drug regulation and biomedical research. The pharmaceutical industry lost one of its most effective defenders when Senator Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania, was not re-elected. The new Senate Republican whip, Trent Lott of Mississippi, is no friend of the brand- name drug industry. He supports bills to allow imports from Canada and to increase access to generic drugs. Top pharmaceutical executives are hurriedly planning a response to the Democratic agenda. “It’s all hands on deck,” said Ken Johnson, a senior vice president at Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. “It’s like a hurricane warning flag. You don’t know where it will hit. You don’t know who will be affected. But everybody has to be prepared.” Drug companies may be open to some changes in the Medicare drug benefit, but they say they cannot accept any form of price negotiation. “The new Medicare program is clearly benefiting seniors and people with disabilities and has exceeded initial expectations,” Mr. Tauzin said. “But we are open to new ideas that could make it even better. We will propose at the same time we are opposing.” Specifically, Mr. Tauzin said, drug companies would like permission to fill a gap in coverage that has angered many Medicare beneficiaries. Many drug companies have programs to provide free drugs to people with limited incomes. When such programs are used to fill the gap in the Medicare drug benefit, they may run afoul of federal law — the anti-kickback statute — because they steer patients to products made by one particular company. The drug industry is anxiously waiting to see details of the Democratic proposal. Lawmakers are weighing several options. At a minimum, Congress could simply repeal the ban on price negotiations, without requiring Medicare officials to do anything. Many House Democrats want to go further. They would direct Medicare officials to negotiate prices for a government-run prescription drug plan, which would compete with dozens of existing private plans. The government could negotiate prices for all drugs or just for brand-name drugs that have no competition. Alternatively, Congress could require manufacturers to provide a specified discount, so Medicare would get the “best price” available to any private buyer. Such details, defining the federal role, are immensely important and could determine the outcome of any votes in Congress.

13-> A Missed Chance in Iraq (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “The Saddam Hussein Verdict” (editorial, Nov. 6): The trial process represented a tragic missed opportunity to provide a reckoning for the victims of Saddam Hussein’s crimes and to set the new Iraq on the path to justice. The tragedy is made worse by the tribunal’s decision to impose the death penalty. Mr. Hussein’s sentence flies in the face of the growing international consensus that the death penalty is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment and constitutes a violation of the most basic human right of all, the right to life. The tribunal should reconsider the death penalty during the appeals stage and seize its second chance to put human rights at the core of post-Hussein Iraq. Beth Ann S.

15-> Inside the List
It’s a reviewer’s cliché to observe that an author, with his or her new book, “leaps into the top rank” of American novelists — as if writers were bullfrogs jostling for space on a lily pad. But the print ads for Nell Freudenberger’s new novel, contain a perplexing spin on that cliché. “Freudenberger . . . leaps into the upper quartile of American novelists,” the ad reads, quoting a review that ran in Salon. Upper quartile? Is that praise? Or a sneaky put-down? Even if you were in the upper quartile of, say, Brooklyn novelists, couldn’t your ranking still be as low as No. 3,407? Freudenberger’s elegant novel, which has received respectful but not ecstatic reviews, has not yet cracked the Times list (or the extended lists). In terms of critical attention, it’s been crowded out by narratives from two other young novelists: Claire Messud’s (No. 8 this week) and Marisha Pessl’s (No. 21). When Freudenberger published her first short story in The New Yorker, in 2001, her editor was Bill Buford, whose own book is still selling — it’s No. 41 on the nonfiction extended list. This summer, The Guardian of London got around to condensing Buford’s book in its “digested read” feature. Here’s how their excellent boiled-down version begins: “It takes a man with a large ego to accept one of my dinner invitations. Mario Batali, chef and co-owner of Babbo, Manhattan’s most famous Italian restaurant, is one of them. He came bearing his own quince-flavored grappa. I took out my white, dense slab of lardo. He glanced down at it, his huge masculine frame rocking in a testosterone-busting parenthesis, before producing his own. ‘My lardo is bigger than yours,’ he scoffed. At that moment I decided I was going to be Mario’s kitchen slave.” Now you can skip Buford’s first 50 pages. You’re welcome. There is a new No. 1 novel on the this week — Brad Meltzer’s thriller “The Book of Fate” bumps off Anna Quindlen’s (Meltzer’s book was advertised on a car during a Nascar race; Quindlen’s wasn’t.) Meltzer’s novel is, in part, about the lives of this country’s former presidents, a topic he hit upon after receiving a fan letter from the first President Bush. On Meltzer’s he’s interviewed by none other than Barbara Bush, who mentioned skimming his Web site. “You read my Web site?” Meltzer said. “Don’t you have staff for that?” Bush’s brisk reply: “I have an iPod and a BlackBerry. I know how to go to Web sites, Brad.” The curse of the “time-dividers” — writers who feel compelled to tell us, on their dust jackets, that they divide their time between, say, the Hamptons and Gstaad — isn’t going away. The New York Post’s film critic Kyle Smith takes a swipe at this practice on the jacket of his forthcoming novel, “A Christmas Caroline.” Smith’s back flap reads: “He divides his time between the front and back rooms of his apartment.” That’s warming to see, whether Smith’s novel makes this list or not.

16-> For Your Digestion; The Gathering
Outside, the scene was right for the season, heavy gray clouds and just enough wind to blow down the last of the yellow leaves. But the house was different that day, so distant from the other houses, like a planet inhabited by only a dozen people with the same last name and the same nose rotating slowly on its invisible axis. Too bad you couldn't be there but you were flying through space on your own asteroid with your arm around an uncle. You would have unwrapped your scarf and thrown your coat on top of the pile then lifted a glass of wine as a tiny man ran across a screen with a ball. You would have heard me saying grace with my elbows on the tablecloth as one of the twins threw a dinner roll across the room at the other. Billy Collins is the author, most recently, of "The Trouble with Poetry: And Other Poems."

17-> Departing From the Old Themes to Make a Big Political Statement
David Dorfman ponders the relationship between activism and terrorism in “underground,” which received its New York premiere on Tuesday night at the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music as part of the BAM 2006 Next Wave Festival. The new piece is a brave, ambitious departure from the norm. New York choreographers for the most part avoid tackling major social themes and perhaps are no longer equipped to do so, given their long love affair with nonnarrative dance. But Mr. Dorfman’s quietly searing personal relationship with much of his choreographic material is missing here. And its absence diminishes the work. Mr. Dorfman has talked in recent interviews of his fascination, as a young teenager, with the passion and idealism of the radical Weather Underground movement of the 1960s and ’70s, an interest that was reawakened after his viewing of the 2005 documentary, “Weather Underground.” (Several members will participate in post-performance discussions.) He has even said that the activism of that era helped to form his artistic core. But only in the last, somewhat too facile image of “underground” is there a sense of Mr. Dorfman’s connection to his subject, as a man suddenly darts out of the ensemble to join a reawakened, bomb-throwing old Weatherman. “Underground,” set to music by composers and groups that include Jonathan Bepler and Broken Social Scene, juxtaposes surging all-out dancing with spoken text in which a man holding out an imaginary microphone questions young activists. The young, it turns out, ask much harder questions of themselves. Should they lash out or cringe? one woman asks, dancing an affecting approximation of each emotional state. Does the end justify the means? another asks. Kill 850 people and save 5,692 others, still another says in a simultaneously funny and chilling litany of escalating numbers. “Who am I?” one woman asks. That timeless search for one’s own young self runs like a vein through the piece, which alludes subtly to recent political protest. The look of “underground” is handsome, with video projections across the set designed by Cameron Anderson, smoky lighting by Jane Cox and ready-for-action street wear designed by Heather McArdle. The piece is expertly put together. But the greatest interest of the piece is the strange sense that it offers, perhaps intentionally, a view into the mind-set of young Middle Eastern terrorists today.

A decomposed body was found in the Passaic River about 7 last night, the state police said. The condition of the body and its clothing had deteriorated so much that the police were unable to determine the race and sex of the victim, though officials believe that it may be a man. It was unclear how long the body had been in the water, officials said. A medical examiner will determine the cause of death. A crew team first spotted the body in the river near the intersection of Third Avenue and Passaic Street and called the police, the authorities said.

Lyn Jacobson, a psychotherapist, and Kenneth Mirkin, a violist, are to be married today in Garrison, N.Y., at the country home of the bride’s parents, Anita and Robert Jacobson Jr. of New York. John Rennie, who is the editor in chief of Scientific American magazine and became a minister of the Church of Spiritual Humanism for this event, is to officiate. He is a longtime friend of the bride’s. Jennifer Honn Rennie, who is Mr. Rennie’s wife and who also became a minister of the Church of Spiritual Humanism for the event, will assist in the ceremony. The bride, 38, practices in New York and specializes in treating eating disorders. She graduated from College-Conservatory of Music at the University of Cincinnati and received a master’s degree in social work from Fordham. Her mother is a founder of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum. Her father retired as a stock specialist on the New York Stock Exchange for Benjamin Jacobson & Sons, a former securities brokerage firm in New York that was founded by a great-grandfather of the bride. The bridegroom, 48, plays with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. He graduated from the Juilliard School, where he also received a master’s degree in music. He is the son of Evelyn Mirkin of Denver and the late Joseph Mirkin. His father was a television repairman in Brooklyn. The bride’s previous marriage ended in divorce, as did the bridegroom’s.

22-> Diner's Guide
Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Porter House New York Inheriting the space in the Time Warner Center that belonged to V Steakhouse, Porter House New York takes a less cheeky, more earnest approach to rib-eyes and strips. It marks the re-emergence of Michael Lomonaco, the chef at Windows on the World until 9/11, and he's supervising a kitchen that cooks well-sourced cuts of meat with care. Other dishes and most appetizers were less successful, and the food overall, like the amber-glow ambience, casts this restaurant as a generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in a lesser mall. It's like an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at the Outback Steakhouse. 10 Columbus Circle, Time Warner Center, fourth floor; (212) 823-9500, porterhousenewyork.com. Dinner entrees, $24 to $39. * [Rating: One Star] STK Slick, dark, noisy and in need of a vowel, STK blurs the line between restaurant and nightclub; in other words, it's in the meatpacking district. It attempts to feminize the steakhouse by including smaller cuts, and it wants to do for filets and T-bones what the city's Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. Those steaks were fine, but other dishes in the menu weren't, and you have to be in the mood for circular white leather booths and a maelstrom of revelers. 26 Little West 12th Street, between Ninth Avenue and Washington Street, West Village; (646) 624-2444, stkhouse.com. Entrees, $24 to $66. Satisfactory. The Lonesome Dove Western Bistro Imagining and executing what might be called contemporary cowpoke cuisine, the Lonesome Dove Western Bistro presents a mash-up of the Southwest, the Wild West, the Outback and maybe even Brokeback, with a menu of meaty chops, peppery rubs and a Noah's ark of birdies and beasties, including kangaroo (for marsupial nachos, of a sort). It's filling and sometimes entertaining, but it goes overboard with seasonings and effects. Dishes that are supposed to be festive hoedowns sometimes come across as bruising slam dances, and the restaurant's patchy lighting and questionable décor give it the look of the dreariest saloon between Lubbock and Laredo. 29 West 21st Street, Chelsea; (212) 414-3139; lonesomedovenyc.com. Entrees, $19 to $60. Satisfactory. Picholine Picholine's stuffiness may well be chromosomal: this Lincoln-Center-area restaurant is never going to feel youthful and hip. A lavender-on-lavender redo certainly hasn't helped. But the chef and owner, Terrance Brennan, has seized the occasion of a cosmetic overhaul to reinvigorate the restaurant's soul, stacking the menu with terrific new dishes -- a Roquefort parfait, an haute spin on chicken Kiev -- that carry a sense of fun. And Picholine still has the best cheese presentation in the city, along with a glorious selection of Scottish game birds in the autumn and much of the winter. 35 West 64th Street, between Broadway and Central Park West; (212) 724-8585; picholinenyc.com. Two courses (including dessert), $64; three courses, $78; four courses, $92. *** [Rating: Three Stars] Boqueria Although the tapas spirit of snacking and grazing took root in this city long ago, tapas themselves haven't been so easy to find. Boqueria is doing its bit to change that. Both the menu, devoted to small plates, and the space, in which all the seats are the height of bar stools, send the message that you needn't commit to a conventional meal. You can let your appetite wander, and if you're smart, you'll make sure it heads in the directions of squid salad, patatas bravas, chilled almond soup, lamb shank and suckling pig. An array of Spanish wines is on hand, along with four kinds of sangria. 53 West 19th Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-4160. Dinner tapas, $6 to $11; entrees, $19 to $31. ** [Rating: Two Stars] What the stars mean: (None) Poor to satisfactory; * Good; ** Very good; *** Excellent; **** Extraordinary.

23-> Keeping a Flame Burning for the Past, While Embracing the Future
It may not be the most famous or well-endowed troupe around these days, but the Limón Dance Company serves as a model for American modern dance in two ways. It is a repository of mid-20th-century classics, both the dances and the even earlier techniques necessary to perform them. And it is an example for other companies devoted to the repertory of long-gone great names, demonstrating how to keep themselves alive. For the opening program on Tuesday of a two-week run at the Joyce Theater, both these agendas were very much in evidence. In celebration of its 60th anniversary, the company has invested in several important revivals. And there is a lively commission for Lar Lubovitch, as well. The Limón company may be named for its founder, José Limón, the Mexican-American dancer who died in 1972, but it has another powerful choreographer to draw from in its revivals. Limón studied and danced with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman, and after the demise of their company in 1945, Humphrey became the Limón company’s first artistic director. She died in 1958, but has a strong body of work still well worth reviving too. One big Humphrey revival is scheduled for the second program, which alternates with the first: her “Lament for Ignacio Sánchez Mejías,” first done by the newly formed Limón company in 1946. It will be flanked by Limón’s “Choreographic Offering” (1964) and his signature piece, “The Moor’s Pavane” (1949). Tuesday’s program had Limón’s “Dances for Isadora” (1971), Humphrey’s “Day on Earth” (1947) and the New York premiere of Mr. Lubovitch’s “Recordare,” first seen in Boston a year ago. “Dances for Isadora” is, of course, a homage to Isadora Duncan, a dominant influence on the American modern dance of Limón’s time. It consists of five solo dances evoking facets of Duncan’s style, with whatever degree of detailed accuracy no one can completely know, given the lack of filmed evidence. The first four dancers, all commanding in their different ways, are dressed in nude leotards and colored flowing fabric and are accompanied by Chopin: Kristen Foote, Ryoko Kudo, Kathryn Alter and Roxane D’Orléans Juste. The fifth, in black fabric and dancing in silence, is Carla Maxwell, a former Limón dancer who has guided the company since 1978. This style of dancing, with cantilevered bodies, heaven-reaching arms and soulful, angst-ridden posing, can look dated. But it also breathes honorably of another era and hence remains well worth seeing. “Day on Earth” is a psychodrama with a Man, a Woman, a Young Woman and a Child. Their sometimes tortured, sometimes loving interactions again look out of time, compared with dance abstraction or contemporary, nonnarrative theatrical dance. But the performances, by Raphaël Boumaïla, Ms. D’Orléans Juste and Ms. Foote as the adults and Morgana Cragnotti as the child, are all superb. Who can say how the 10-year-old Ms. Cragnotti will evolve, but with her charming, self-possessed stage personality, she’s already a professional in the best sense. “Recordare” finds Mr. Lubovitch offering a comic take on a Mexican Day of the Dead fiesta. Here the full company, abetted by a colorful physical production from Anne Hould Ward (costumes), Ken Foy (set design) and Jack Mehler (lighting), brought Mr. Lubovitch’s inventions to vivid life. The music was selections from Elliot Goldenthal’s “Juan Darién,” which suited Julie Taymor just fine in the past but serves Mr. Lubovitch equally well in the present.

24-> The Way You Move
We may have landed a man on the moon and invented penicillin, Paris Hilton and the iPod, but deep down in our stem cells, we’re still hairy, barely bipedal chimpanzee cousins trying to make it through the day while protecting our vital organs from attack. This at least is the conclusion I drew from this hefty, informative, often amusing, sometimes a tad self-apparent encyclopedia of body language. The first edition of this book was published 22 years ago. This one contains 50 percent new material, including lots of pictures of Bill Clinton and Marilyn Monroe. I’m sorry not to have made its acquaintance back then, since a good deal of the body language studies seem to be devoted to the all-important question: Is your date going to sleep with you? How useful it would have been, back in 1984, to know that while her eyes seemed to be saying yes, her right foot, pointed toward the door, was whispering, “I’m out of here.” If the approximately one zillion studies adduced here by the authors are any indication, it seems that 90 percent of the population has been gainfully employed studying the body language patterns of the other 10 percent. While you and I have been hunter-gathering at the office, protecting our necks and other vulnerable areas, the Peases, along with legions of academics and students of evolutionary behavior, have been monitoring how often French people touch each other in outdoor cafes (142 touches per hour versus zero touches per hour for Londoners); or who opts for the end toilet stall (that must have been a fun project); the smiling patterns among middle-class residents of Atlanta and Memphis (more fun than watching public toilets, anyway); the hip-to-waist ratios in 50 years of Playboy centerfolds (significantly more fun than the toilet survey); how many among 400 cigar exhalations at a festive event were directed upward, as opposed to downward (a toss-up between that and observing toilets); and whether larger-breasted women hitchhikers get more rides than smaller-breasted ones. This last was undertaken by “researchers at Purdue University.” Care to hazard a guess as to the finding? I smell an earmark in some omnibus transportation bill. Indeed, a number of the studies cited here have about them the aroma of sizzling appropriations pork. According to a study of handshaking at the University of Alabama — prepare to have your preconceived notions shattered — “extroverted types use firm handshakes, while shy, neurotic personalities don’t.” Well, thank God that’s settled. Many of the other studies, though, are rather interesting. The Gillette razor company, for instance, commissioned research that indicates that Scotsmen are Britain’s vainest males, spending 16 minutes a day preening in front of the mirror. (Presumably post-“Braveheart”; or maybe not. All that blue face paint takes time to apply.) And I was grateful to learn that “Professor William Fry at Stanford University reported that 100 laughs will give your body an aerobic workout equal to that of a 10-minute session on a rowing machine.” Now, instead of working out, I’m just going to watch “Young Frankenstein” on the DVD player while eating Cheetos and drinking 36 ounces of Coke. The authors, whose other books include “Why Men Don’t Listen and Women Can’t Read Maps,” have over the years advised clients ranging from politicians to rock stars to Australian Customs. This last client wanted help in identifying smugglers. (Hint: When walking through customs at J.F.K. with a half-dozen Cuban Robustos stuffed in your underpants, smile a lot and don’t sweat.) Using research in pupillometry done at the University of Chicago, they were able to help Revlon increase sales of its lipstick by enlarging the pupil size of the models in the catalogs. I’m hard pressed to think of a better example of science at the service of humanity. In this political season, those running for office might find “The Definitive Book of Body Language” handy. If, say, you’re a candidate being interviewed on TV, don’t look sideways from the reporters to the camera. It will make you look shifty. (Or shiftier.) There’s also some good advice on where to stand while being photographed shaking hands. The chapter titled “Evaluation and Deceit Signals” is illustrated with a photo of Bill Clinton giving his famous grand jury testimony. In that regard, our noses apparently do actually swell when we’re lying. Call it the Pinocchio effect. The even worse news is that “a man’s penis also swells with blood when he tells a lie.” No, really, honey, it’s this damn Viagra. Aficionados of Stephen Potter’s “Upmanship” books will appreciate some of the tips and strategies. My favorite is in the section called “The Power Gaze,” on how to counter someone who is either trying to dominate you or bore you. (Hard to say which is worse.) “Imagine the person has a third eye in the center of their forehead and look in a triangular area between the person’s ‘three’ eyes. The impact this gaze has on the other person has to be experienced to be believed.” Can’t wait to try it out this Thanksgiving. Chess and poker players will profit, too — the latter probably more than the former. If while you touch your chess piece to make your next move, your opponent “steeples” his hands (as in “Here’s the church, here’s the steeple”), this signals he or she feels confident. If he clenches his hands, he feels threatened. If he stabs you in the chest with his bishop, he feels really threatened. The prudent poker player, meanwhile, will wear dark glasses. It’s not an affectation: he’s shielding his dilating pupils from signaling to the other players that he’s aroused by that third king he’s just drawn. The book is amply and often wittily illustrated with celebrity photographs. There’s a fetching one of Brigitte Bardot, goddess of my youth, executing the “head toss and hair flick.” What’s going on here — God knows how much government research went into finding this out — is that the pose “lets her expose her armpit, which allows the ‘sex perfume’ known as pheromones to waft across to the target man.” Did Gillette participate in this study? And what book on body language would be complete without 107 photos of Marilyn Monroe, who “reputedly chopped three-quarters of an inch off the heel of her left shoe to emphasize her wiggle.” On a more sober note, Nazis during World War II were on the lookout for males sitting in what the authors call “The American Figure Four” — legs spread to reveal the crotch, with the left crossed over the right at an almost 90 degree angle. “Anyone using it was clearly not German or had spent time in the U.S.A.” Our Department of Homeland Security might do well, as it strips us of our unguents, shampoos and precious bodily moisturizers, to employ Mr. and Mrs. Pease to instruct them on body lingo profiling. This is a fascinating book, though clearly more — much more — government funding is needed to study the hitchhiking patterns of busty women. After reading it, you’ll be able to decode and analyze the signature moments of our times. The famous confrontation, for instance, between Tom Cruise and Matt Lauer on the “Today” show. Observe as Tom sprays spittle at Lauer for having no understanding at all, Matt, of why Brooke Shields should be clubbed to death for resorting to modern medicine to help her cope with postpartum depression. Note that Tom’s legs are splayed open in the classic Crotch Display. He’s leaning forward toward Lauer, eyebrows lowered in the manner of our Neanderthal forbears. Note, too, that he is pointing his finger at Lauer’s chest, at his heart, a signal of aggression which — by the way, guys — women find totally offensive. And what is Matt doing, other than wondering, Will I get rabies from Tom’s saliva? He’s leaning back in his chair. The wide open eyes denote not only elation over the probable ratings jump for this episode, but also fear that he might not make it out of the studio alive. Now look at his right leg: it’s crossed defensively over the left. What’s with that? He’s protecting his genitals. I’d have, too.

27-> ART IN REVIEW; Tigers of Wrath -- Watercolors by Walton Ford
Brooklyn Museum 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park Through Jan. 28 With his prodigious skills as an illustrator, the naturalist artist Walton Ford has, over a relatively short time, produced a remarkable, at times repetitious but deeply reflective group of works on themes like colonialism, the tradition of naturalist illustration and the existence of animal species. The present show assembles more than 50 of his large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, all produced since the early 1990s. Combining pathos and wit, artifice and honesty, they frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. In "Thanh Hoang" (1997), a tiger has burst his bonds of captivity and is seen fleeing away into the forest, his tail flesh grazed and exposed and surrounded by buzzing flies. In "November 1864" (2005), an immense, angry-looking wild boar roars as its habitat burns. Though wonderfully lucid and dramatic, the moralizing of these images can become a little tedious, as in "Dirty Dick Burton's Aide de Camp" (2002), in which a monkey represents Richard Burton, the 19th-century explorer, who apparently kept primates in his house in an effort to learn their language. The illustrator John James Audubon also comes in for some censure, for his practice of trapping and killing animals to study them; in one image he lies fallen in the snow as a golden eagle flies away, a trap still attached to its leg. But bashing old-school naturalists and scientists is not the only -- or chief -- preoccupation of this popular, prolific artist. He also imparts an environmental message, couched in terms of a lament for the irreversible loss when a sense of morality does not govern the treatment of animals. BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

The Ramapo Police said on Wednesday that they would not charge the owner of a pit bull that killed one woman and injured her sister last weekend. Detective Lt. Brad Wiedel of the Ramapo Police Department said the owner of the dog, Aaron Hall, 37, of Norwood, N.J., had cooperated in the investigation. "We don't see anything in the facts and circumstances where the owner of the dog may have committed a criminal act," Lieutenant Wiedel said. According to the Ramapo police, Jeannine Fusco, 44, was watching the dog for Mr. Hall when she was killed in her garage on Oct. 7. She was bitten on the throat and head. Her sister, Valerie Wall, 43, was bitten on a knee and hand and was treated and released from Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern.

34-> DINING/SOUTH NORWALK; A Promising Start In an Inviting Setting
THE exciting miscellany of ethnic restaurants in South Norwalk has yet another new Italian place, Alga Marina, which replaces the short-lived Pelican Seaside Restaurant. Alga Marina ("alga" is the Italian word for seaweed) is appropriately situated opposite the Maritime Center. The only problem, one waiter told us, is that tourists visiting the center are looking mostly for snacks or fast food, not a leisurely, more upmarket dining experience. Leisurely was certainly the operative word one evening recently. We were the only diners, although two young women and their children were leaving just as we were seated and before the little dish of delicious marinated olives and warm focaccia was delivered to our table. Empty as the restaurant was, we waited almost 40 minutes between our starters and entrees. During that time a man entered the restaurant, chatted at length at the bar with the sole waiter present and eventually left with what seemed to be a takeout order. Finally, my companion went to the waiter, who was lounging by the bar, and asked what had happened to our entrees. Within a few minutes they arrived, piping hot. The long delay was never explained, but when the food came, it tasted fresh and was attractively presented. Appetizers were especially notable. Two salads, Di Capri and Montebianco, were refreshing -- and so large they could have been entrees. Di Capri consisted of sizzling hot, nicely browned scallops wrapped in crisp bacon, embedded in baby greens, orange segments and toasted almonds with balsamic dressing. Montebianco was just as lively: thin pear slices, candied walnut halves, mushroom slices, hearts of romaine and crumbled Gorgonzola in a piquant lemon dressing. We were just as satisfied with the broiled oysters, lightly breaded, in a whisper of Pernod sauce; grilled calamari over baby greens in a lemon vinaigrette; and big, juicy Prince Edward Island mussels sautéed in a white wine-garlic sauce teased with tomato. Two veal dishes, enjoyed on several visits, were exemplary. Vitello Siciliano united tender veal scaloppine with eggplant, mozzarella and fresh tomatoes, while grilled veal chop (nodino alla salvia) was meaty and well married to a sharp sage sauce. Best of all the entrees was galletto alla diavola, a splendidly grilled Cornish game hen, unusually meaty and juicy, butterflied and served atop a fresh spinach salad, with a side dish of crisply sautéed green beans. There were a few weak spots, like the gnocchi al forno. The potato dumplings were as heavy as lead, and the thick layer of melted fontina almost masked that the menu-promised Bolognese sauce was missing. Heaviness plagued one dessert: panna cotta, a favorite of mine when it is ethereally cloudlike, was instead weighty, a sharp contrast to the light, heavenly tiramisù and delizia di cioccolato (rich flourless chocolate cake with a seductively soft center). Another disappointment was the cappuccino, which tasted inexplicably soapy (probably the fault of an improperly rinsed cup). But these were flaws in a restaurant that does many things right. With time and more attention, they are certainly correctable. Meanwhile, if you order judiciously, you can have an enjoyable meal in airy, open and casual surroundings. Alga Marina 19 North Water Street South Norwalk (203) 838-8323 www.algamarinarestaurant.com GOOD THE SPACE -- Sponged tan walls and handsome place mats on the tables make for casual dining. Two-story windows extend the length of the main dining area. Wheelchair access. THE CROWD -- A mix of young and old, families and couples.

36-> Two Bronx Youths Indicted in Roommate's Death
A Bronx grand jury has indicted two teenagers in the rape and stabbing death of their 26-year-old roommate, Monique Hattan, whose body was found in a garbage can on the roof of their building. The teenagers, Dashawn Harris, 16, and Raymel Poole, 18, were indicted on Tuesday. The Bronx district attorney's office said that they would be tried as adults. Ms. Hattan was killed between May 1 and May 16, when her body was found by the building's superintendent. Mr. Harris and Mr. Poole had continued to live in the one-bedroom apartment on the Grand Concourse they shared with Ms. Hattan and her boyfriend, Meek Hall. Mr. Hall, who prosecutors said was not involved in the crime, said he had thought Ms. Hattan had gone to stay with friends.

38-> This Is a Job for ‘Senior Move’ Managers
WHEN Sally and Harold Lion decided to sell their home of 43 years in Springfield, Va., and move to a retirement complex a few miles away, Mrs. Lion thought she had worked out an orderly transition process. The couple picked out the furnishings and belongings they wanted and sent them to their new apartment. Then Mrs. Lion, 78, planned to sort through the remaining contents in the house to decide what could go to charity and what could go elsewhere. But after spending several weeks trying to make a dent in the clutter, she felt stymied about what to do. “You can spend hours going through one little box,” she said. Finally she turned to Busy Buddies, the same local company that had helped her choose what to take to her new home. The company is one of an increasing number of “senior move management” businesses offering services to retirees who are moving and must sift through the detritus of a lifetime. Busy Buddies helped Mrs. Lion go through her leftover possessions, supervised the sale of some items, rented a paper shredder and packed 45 boxes for charities to haul away. They also offered advice. “They said, ‘Tell your children they have until this date to come and get the things they want,’ ” Mrs. Lion said. Above all, they left her with an empty house. As the comedian George Carlin once said, “A house is just a pile of stuff with a cover on it.” When people downsize, selling a house is usually not as difficult as dealing with its contents. The sheer amount and sentimental meaning of “stuff” stashed in attics and basements often confound older people or children whose elderly parents die or fall seriously ill. Picking through possessions, dividing them fairly and discerning what has monetary value and what does not can be a mammoth job, especially if it’s done under duress or during a time of grieving. Busy Buddies is one of 120 companies that belong to the National Association of Senior Move Managers, a group that requires members to follow a code of ethics; businesses must carry insurance and provide references. Typically, these companies use a floor plan of the new home to help older clients make room-by-room decisions about what to move. They then help clients sort through their other belongings and recommend estate-sale specialists, appraisers and auction houses as well as charities that will accept donations. Many companies offer packing and unpacking services. They also assess what is trash and how best to get rid of it. People who use such services can spend $1,500 to $5,000, depending on the selections and nature of the move. Ron Butler, a real estate agent in Virginia Beach, tells clients that it is generally worthwhile to hire professionals for the downsizing process. He still regrets the hasty decisions he made when he cleaned out his parents’ home after they died. “They were people who lived through the Depression, and they saved everything — broken transistor radios — in case they ever needed a part,” Mr. Butler said. At the time, he felt inundated and threw or gave away things he could have sold. Nancy Loyd and Mary Ann Brewer, the founders of Busy Buddies, said about three-quarters of their clients were elderly people, but they were getting more and more calls from empty-nest couples in their 50’s who are moving from suburban homes to smaller city apartments. Many older customers are caught in a vortex of emotion and confusion about where to start and what to keep. “What we hear a lot is, ‘My kids work full time, they’re really busy and they don’t want anything,’ ” said Margit Novack, who in 1996 founded Moving Solutions, a company in Havertown, Pa., that specializes in moving retirement-age people and has franchises in the mid-Atlantic region. Experts say the best approach is to plan ahead. Of course that is easier said than done, as contemplating the breakup of a household can cause conflict within the family and bring up thoughts of mortality. The University of Minnesota Extension Service, a statewide community education system, developed a program called Who Gets Grandma’s Yellow Pie Plate? The program helps guide families through the process in a structured way. Its Web site, Yellowpieplate.umn.edu, offers free materials (like articles and tip sheets) and also sells workbooks and videos. Extension instructors urge older people to gather relatives or talk with them separately to determine what belongings have meaning to them. Jewelry, art or antique furniture can be earmarked or itemized in a will, but knickknacks might have emotional value. Program worksheets ask what things family members would like to receive and how they would feel if they did not get a particular item. The questions are loaded but useful in averting future problems, said Mary Anderson, an Extension educator. “There are families not talking to each other because of a $2 Christmas ornament,” she said. Families also are encouraged to discuss the history of items before the stories die with their owners. Sunny Schlenger, an organizing consultant and the author of “Organizing for the Spirit: Making the Details of Your Life Meaningful and Manageable,” considers that history essential. To illustrate the point, she opens workshops by showing a photo of one of her ancestors. She asks people if they know who it is. As they shake their heads no, she says, “Neither do I.” Ms. Schlenger, who lives in New Jersey and Arizona, began her career organizing closets and has worked with large and small businesses. In an essay on her Web site, Suncoach.com, she describes the looming predicament for aging baby boomers who “now live in their house happily surrounded by their own Stuff, their parents’ Stuff, and their kids’ Stuff.” She suggested weeding through things at least every five years. “Think, who am I today? What do I really need? Do I really want to be the custodian of all these things? Who else would want them?” Ms. Schlenger said. “Start the conversations early with your siblings and your kids. Otherwise, someone is left saying, ‘Oh, my God, how can I deal with all this on top of losing someone?’ ”

39-> To Prevent Amputations, Doctors Call for Aggressive Care
After leaving her job at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, Elaine Fry mapped out her life as an active retiree: daily outdoor excursions, meetings with friends, cross-country trips. But as her legs inexplicably began retaining more and more fluid, swelling like ripening melons, just leaving her bedroom became a struggle. Last year, an ulcer appeared on her bloated right calf, with an infection that festered for months and turned the surrounding tissue black. Her doctor confirmed her worst fears: an above-the-knee amputation was the only option. Following the surgery, Ms. Fry, now 63, sold her house and went to live with her daughter, her son-in-law and their four children in a basement apartment of their Columbia, Md., home that she describes as “not wheelchair friendly.” “Before, if I wanted to go to the bookstore or grocery store, I could,” she said. “But now, my daughter can’t just drop everything and do whatever I want to do. Losing my independence has been really hard.” Ms. Fry’s story is a surprisingly common one, though amputation is often stereotypically viewed as a side effect of war, not a consequence of disease. About 1.8 million Americans have had amputations; every year, more than 100,000 non-accident-related, lower-limb amputations are performed in the United States. The high numbers have prompted the medical community to debate whether most foot and leg amputations can be prevented — and, if so, how. Dr. Karel Bakker, a foot specialist who is a chairman of the International Diabetes Federation, believes that more effective foot care and patient education strategies would render up to 85 percent of these procedures unnecessary. Lower-limb ulcers are the most reliable harbingers of future amputation: according to a study published earlier this year in the journal Diabetes Care, nearly 9 in 10 nontraumatic foot and leg amputations come after the development of these infected sores, which can spread and quickly destroy surrounding tissue. Some of these amputations, like Ms. Fry’s, can be traced to ulcers resulting from edema or other conditions that affect blood flow to the lower extremities. Others — as many as 60 percent, according to some estimates — are due to a common complication of diabetes: lower-limb numbness resulting from nerve damage from the disease. Dr. Michael S. Pinzur, an orthopedic surgeon at Loyola University in Chicago, has had diabetes patients who have lost so much sensation in their feet that they have been oblivious to large objects, like cigarette lighters or toy trucks, that have gotten lodged in their shoes. “Normally, if you’ve got something as small as an ingrown toenail, you feel it,” Dr. Pinzur said. “These people can’t feel it.” Because there is no pain to alert them to potential danger, these patients often continue walking on increasingly sore, infected legs until they resemble hunks of raw meat. With proper education, observation and follow-up care, Dr. Bakker argues, most patients at high risk of amputation could be healed before reaching the point of no return. He envisions an across-the-board protocol of aggressive wound care that would function a little like early-stage cancer treatment, vanquishing relatively minor sores and irritations before they have a chance to become something more serious. “Some people do go to clinics for their ulcers and have them treated, but there often isn’t any follow-up,” he says. “There’s no good recall system. If you have an ulcer, you should really be seen every three months.” At present, he points out, only 14 percent of general practitioners perform foot exams during yearly patient visits. He hopes this percentage will increase greatly as doctors become more aware of the benefits of preventive foot care, which includes checking the feet for redness, cuts and sores. The World Health Organization has also lobbied for better preventive foot care to eliminate the need for amputations. “Any amputation, especially for conditions like diabetes, is a human tragedy and a gross failure of public health efforts,” said Dr. Robert Beaglehole, W.H.O.’s director of chronic diseases and health promotion. “We are failing desperately to prevent the most preventable conditions.” Dr. Pinzur, however, thinks it is unrealistic to expect the levels of patient compliance needed to achieve the results that Dr. Bakker and Dr. Beaglehole envision. Many diabetics, he notes, have difficulty learning to administer proper wound care, and many other patients do not follow doctors’ orders or show up for scheduled visits. “ “One-on-one patient education is really the only solution,” he said. But Dr. Vivian Ho, an economist at Rice University, said that raising awareness about amputation danger signs among patients and doctors only addresses part of the problem. Her 2005 analysis of Medicare claims data showed that adding one vascular surgeon for every 33,000 Medicare beneficiaries in a region yielded a 1.6 percent decrease in amputations. These results suggest that in many poor or rural regions of the United States, there simply are not enough specialists available to perform foot- and leg-saving procedures. “Whether or not you have an amputation is a function of who you get sent to,” Dr. Ho said. “If there are only six vascular specialists in the entire state, many patients won’t get told to see a vascular surgeon at all.” While general practitioners are trained to perform amputations, they are not usually qualified to perform complex limb-saving operations like bypasses or balloon angioplasties. Economically and socially marginalized groups, Dr. Ho adds, get the shortest shrift in the amputation lottery. Among diabetics in North America, Hispanics and African-Americans are 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely than whites to undergo lower limb amputations. “There’s no advocacy group for this condition the way there is for something like breast cancer,” she said. “It’s a disease of the lower class.” Dr. Ho argues that Medicare reimbursement rates in underserved regions should be raised to create an economic incentive for specialists to move to those areas. “There’s correlation between the supply of specialists and how attractive an area is in terms of culture and economy — all the factors you’d find in the Places Rated Almanac,” she said. “But doctors will respond to higher rates. Anywhere dollar signs come into play, you’ll see an effect.” Some physicians, though, think Dr. Ho’s focus on the drought of specialists is misguided. “The obvious answer is, ‘Let’s get everyone to see a vascular surgeon,’ but that won’t solve anything,” Dr. Pinzur said. “Vascular surgeons only start seeing patients at the point when they already have nonhealing ulcers, and at that point a lot of the damage has been done.” Even in areas where specialists are plentiful, said Dr. Herbert Dardik, chief of vascular surgery at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center in New Jersey, doctors may be performing amputations that are not absolutely necessary. “Doctors have to decide whether to spend three or four hours doing a complicated salvage procedure, or 35 minutes for a short, quick amputation,” he said. Still, doctors caution against viewing amputation as something to be avoided at all costs. “Some people say: ‘If you take my leg off, my life is over. I’m going to die’ ” Dr. Pinzur said. “But it’s not a black-or-white issue. You always have to ask, ‘Will a salvage outperform an amputation in this case?’ ” One of Dr. Pinzur’s patients, vehemently opposed to amputation, had been in and out of the hospital for years as a recurring infection smoldered in his foot. “Finally he said, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” Dr. Pinzur said, “and two weeks after his amputation, he was walking around with a prosthesis and asking, ‘Why did I wait so long?’ ” For Elaine Fry, the recovery process has been slower — just healing her surgical wound took several months. A year after surgery, she has been attending physical therapy to get used to a recently fitted prosthesis and has been learning to drive with a left-leg accelerator pedal. “I’m looking forward to doing all the things I used to do,” she said.

40-> An Old Show Returns, With Just a Little News About Race and Sex
Four minutes into the first installment of the new season of “Russell Simmons’s Def Comedy Jam,” which returns to HBO tomorrow night after a nine-year hiatus, Mike Epps, the hyperactive host, spots a white guy in the audience, makes fun of him, and immediately segues into a routine about the difference between black people and white people. It takes the first comedian of the night, Tony Rock, about four minutes before he addresses the same subject. And the second comedian, Sommore, has some news for the crowd: when it comes to sex, she explains, men and women are different. A lot has changed since “Def Comedy Jam” was last on the air, but you wouldn’t know it from the first two shows of its new incarnation. There is the occasional topical reference: three of the six performers have jokes about the high price of gas. But otherwise, the subject matter, the humor and the attitude are essentially the same as they were back in the day: usually irreverent, often vulgar and, as the euphemism has it, urban. And yet amid the punch lines about sodomy and sagging breasts, amid the ritual repetition of “bitch” and even ruder words, there are a few self-referential moments that suggest that something new is in the air. For example, the funny and personable Adele Givens does a routine making liberal use of a colorful obscenity that was a mainstay of the series in its 1990’s heyday, when she was a frequent guest. Judging from the evidence at hand, it’s going to be a mainstay again. What distinguishes Ms. Givens’s bit is that it doesn’t just use the word; it is actually the word. Specifically, it is about a clergyman who chastises her for using the word onstage, and whose self-righteousness leads to a hilarious comeuppance. It’s dirty, it’s clever and it has something to say. What a concept. A young comedian named Vince Morris provides an even bigger departure from the “Def Comedy Jam” norm. Bespectacled and soft-spoken, he neither looks nor sounds like the stereotypical black comic, and that in a way is the point of his very smart act. Though his primary target is the advertising industry, his beef is racial stereotyping, and though he himself doesn’t make the connection, it isn’t a stretch to hear some of his barbs as applicable to “Def Comedy Jam” itself. On the other hand, Mr. Morris also tells an O. J. Simpson joke. Some things, it seems, never change. Directed by Stan Lathan; created by Russell Simmons and Mr. Lathan; Mr. Lathan, Sandy Wernick and Kimber Rickabaugh, executive producers; Cisco Henson, executive in charge of production; Bob Summer, co-executive producer.

41-> Wage Cuts Approved for Comair Workers
The commuter carrier owned by Delta Air Lines received bankruptcy court approval yesterday to cut wages for flight attendants and mechanics and end contributions to their pension plans. The bankruptcy judge, Adlai S. Hardin Jr. in White Plains, authorized the carrier, Comair Holdings, to impose hourly wage cuts of 7.5 percent for the cabin crews and 2 percent for the maintenance workers. Judge Hardin also approved an increase in contributions to workers 401(k) plans costing $156,000 a year. Comair, based in Cincinnati, had previously reached agreement with unions on the cuts. The carrier filed for protection from creditors with Delta in September 2005 and seeks to reduce costs by $42 million a year. The latest cuts will save Comair about $8.9 million in 2007, according to documents filed by its lawyers. Comair operates more than 800 flights a day to 103 cities, according to court papers.

42-> World Briefing | Americas: Canada: Arar Still On U.S. Watch List
Maher Arar, the Canadian the United States sent in 2002 to Syria, where he was tortured for months, remains in a database of terrorist suspects maintained by the United States, despite a two-year Canadian investigation that found him to be innocent of any terrorist ties this year. David H. Wilkins, the American ambassador, acknowledged the continued listing of Mr. Arar on Canadian radio. In a later statement issued by the embassy, Mr. Wilkins said that the Canadian inquiry "was not privy to our information" and that the decision to include Mr. Arar on the list and to keep his name there were both "based on information from a variety of sources." He said a lawsuit Mr. Arar has brought against the United States prevented him from providing further details. IAN AUSTEN

43-> Arts, Briefly; Berlin Opera Supervisor Quits
The director of the foundation established to supervise three debt-encumbered opera houses in Berlin plans to step down in April, the city government said yesterday, The Associated Press reported. Michael Schindhelm, appointed in late 2004 as the first general director of the foundation, has had an uneasy relationship with the mayor, Klaus Wowereit, who won a new five-year term in September and plans to take direct responsibility for cultural matters. The foundation was established to enhance coordination, cut costs and keep open the Staatsoper, Deutsche Oper and Komische Oper. In a statement yesterday, Mr. Wowereit said: "It is increasingly clear that the creation of the opera foundation so far has not contributed sufficiently to solving the fundamental problems. It is now time to shape calmly and thoroughly the future of the opera landscape. It is the city government's stated aim to maintain all three opera houses."

Hundreds of thousands of protestors flooded the main avenues of Santa Cruz and other provincial capitals in eastern Bolivia to call for greater political autonomy from the central government. Officials in the eastern lowlands provinces are chafing at efforts by supporters of President Evo Morales to rewrite the Constitution to increase the power of the indigenous population in the west. Though some groups advocate outright independence, most organizers of the protests focused on calls to reverse a measure that allows Mr. Morales's supporters in the constituent assembly that is to rewrite the Constitution to implement changes with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds vote.

45-> World Briefing | Europe: The Netherlands: Anne Frank's Chestnut Tree To Be Cut Down
The old chestnut tree visible from Anne Frank's attic window in Amsterdam that comforted her as she hid from the Nazis from 1942 to 1944 is diseased and rotten and must be cut down, the city council said. Experts estimate the tree's age at 150 to 170 years. The Anne Frank House Museum, where the tiny apartment has been preserved, said that grafts had been taken from the chestnut and that it hoped to replace it. Anne Frank made several references to it in her diary. "Nearly every morning I go to the attic to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs," she wrote on Feb. 23, 1944. "From my favorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind. As long as this exists, I thought, and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies, while this lasts I cannot be unhappy."

46-> In Paris, a Feast of Art and History, in Bite-Size Pieces
Seasoned travelers to Paris know that they are likely to be cross-examined upon return and put to the Philistine test of cultural fluency. “What exhibitions did you see?” “Did you see X at Y?; I hear Z isn’t worth the two-hour wait.” Indeed, it’s such a given that one should make time for culture in the French capital that first-time visitors with no background or particular interest in art feel compelled to return home armed with tales (or better yet, video) of little Jimmy getting lost in the Louvre or of having to wait hours on line to see the Impressionists in the Orsay, only to come away a bit overwhelmed — or worse, unimpressed — by the experience. But it needn’t be that way. Beyond the “must-see” major museums and exhibition halls and the many single-artist showcases like the beloved Picasso, Rodin and Maillol museums, there are dozens of smaller Parisian museums that won’t require a whole day nor a battle plan to “do” them. Paris offers museums and foundations with superb collections and installations of everything from Asian art and Impressionist masterpieces to modernist architecture. Many collections remain in the grand former homes for which the works were acquired and are clustered in less-touristy neighborhoods, making it easier to “hit” several of them in one afternoon. Andyou will probably never have to stand in line. So while various government agencies decide what to do with the Grand Palais and “Da Vinci Code” fans are racing through the Louvre, and the art critics, ethnologists and architects ponder the pros and cons of Jean Nouvel’s recently opened Musée du Quai Branly, this might be the season to stay away from the Seine when it comes to art in Paris and find some hidden treasures discreetly tucked throughout the city. First up is the Musée Jacquemart-André in the tony Eighth Arrondissement. The museum is often compared with the Frick Collection in New York, and it similarly offers a glimpse into another epoch of elegant living and collecting. While the collection, which includes works by Mantegna, Botticelli, Chardin, Rembrandt and Van Dyck, may not stack up against the holdings of the Frick, the Jacquemart-André’s exuberantly theatrical 1875 architecture and plush interiors play to French strength and remind us of why Frick and other American art patrons made their European grand tours in the first place. This is part of the fun of strolling through endless gilded, paneled or tapestry-covered rooms, not to mention the marble and glass winter garden, spying masterpieces when you least expect them. Edouard André was from a prosperous banking family and Nélie Jacquemart was a young painter; they surrounded themselves with fine objects (they created their own “Italian Museum” on the second floor) and elegant company whom they entertained lavishly, something that the audio guide plays up a bit to enhance the belle époque mood. The museum cafe plays it up as well, and a festive brunch or afternoon tea is a popular rite — if not an outright raison d’être — for those who come to the museum (which includes many Parisians). Not far away is the recently reopened Musée Cernuschi, which houses many exceptional works of Asian art in dramatically high-impact new galleries. Almost next door to the Cernuschi is the much more “white gloves and whispers” Musée Nissim de Camondo, which showcases one of the finest collections anywhere of Continental furniture, and like the Jacquemart-André, underscores Paris’s stature as an international tastemaker, a beacon of refinement and opulence over the centuries. Even on a hunt for small museums, one can easily overlook some. “Well, don’t forget about us,” Bruno Quantin, a spokesman for the Musée Carnavalet — in a petit-musée-dense area between the Marais and the Place des Vosges — said, reminding me that the museum is in fact composed of two important hôtels particuliers, as grander family homes were known back in Marie Antoinette’s day, combined and expanded during the sweeping urban revamp of Paris in the second half of the 19th century. The Musée Carnavalet might be among the city’s most overlooked museums as a repository of French residential refinement. More or less a museum of “the city of Paris,” the Carnavalet chronicles the capital’s history with everything from Roman ruins and Renaissance apothecary signs to Renoirs and Ruhlman Art Deco furniture. Whole buildings, storefronts and art collections are on view, so it’s like a warehouse of small museums, with no end of surprises. FOR instance, the 18th-century French nobility had a special fondness for paintings of hunting scenes and their aftermath, so tenderly painted still lifes of dead stags, pheasants, wild hares and other parkland-to-pantry carcasses are fairly abundant. Alongside this traditional fare, the Carnavalet’s painting of a dead sewer rat by Auguste Charpentier “reminds us of what was on the menu in the city during the siege of Paris,” a passing guide told a group of French students, referring to the 1871 Paris Commune. A similar riches-to-rags theme can be noted in the somewhat spartan and mismatched suite of furniture, complete with a little tabletop spinning wheel with which to pass the hours, that accompanied Marie Antoinette during her stint in prison, which ended when she was sent to the guillotine. Leave behind such reminders of rococo excess, head across town and fast-forward to the 1920’s, when the local design aesthetic had undergone its own French revolution. Simplicity replaced opulence, and refinement now meant smooth, unarticulated white plaster walls with not a speck of gold leaf to be found anywhere. One of the movement’s pioneers was the Swiss-born Charles Edouard Jeanneret (1887-1965), better known as Le Corbusier and the man not only responsible for so much of our pared-down modernist aesthetic but also, it might be argued, the one responsible for inspiring subsequent generations of architects to wear chunky geometric eyeglasses (his own were brutally round). In the Auteuil section, near the Bois de Boulogne, you can join the current crop of opthalmologically challenged young talents meditating on Le Corbusier’s minimalist mastery at the Maison La Roche, a house he built in 1923, now part of the Fondation Le Corbusier. The Maison La Roche also includes examples of Le Corbusier’s better-known furniture designs, like the curvy tubular steel and pony-skin chaise-longue on which to lie and contemplate his pioneering spatial conception; his two-dimensional genius is on view in a small gallery of his paintings. Not too far away, toward the Bois de Boulogne, is the Musée Marmottan Monet, an institution that — metaphorically at least — could be said to have staked out the middle ground between the Carnavalet’s ad hoc harvesting of Parisian opulence past and Le Corbusier’s tightly edited vision of the city’s future. Established in the 19th century as a collection of Napoleonic and Second Empire art, archives, and related paraphernalia, the Marmottan became part of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and as such was the recipient of several serendipitous bequests, including major ones from the heirs of Monet, quickly converting it into one of the world’s great repositories of his works. Starting with the painting that gave an art movement its name — “Impression: Sunrise” of 1873, which critics first mockingly called Impressionism — the collection covers the full sweep of Monet’s long career with paintings of his gardens at Giverny, his studies of Rouen Cathedral and the British Houses of Parliament, and on through his nearly abstract images of water lilies. Monet’s works are augmented by some 300 other works by artists including Pissarro and Gauguin. With just these museums marked on your map, a good guidebook can help you fill out an itinerary. There is the Musée Gustave Moreau, once the opulent home and studio of that love-to-hate/hate-to-love 19th-century Symbolist painter, not too far from the onetime artists’ haunt of Montmartre. Or take a break from shopping for chic linens or Muji wallets on the Rue des Francs Bourgeois and stop by the Musée Cognacq-Jay, another Frick-ish joint (also recently renovated) that practically backs up to the Carnavalet and is around the corner from the popular Musée Picasso. Most won’t take more than an hour to visit. Then you can pepper your next post- Paris cocktail banter with all sorts of deliciously refined-sounding names that will firmly assert your Parisian cultural credentials.

The bride, 31, will continue to use her name professionally. She is the founder and owner of Ware, a women’s sportswear line in New York that is sold in department stores and boutiques. She graduated from the University of Virginia. Her father, who is retired, worked in Boston as a senior vice president and a risk manager for the Bank of America.

49-> Panel Calls for Big Changes in Medicaid
WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 — A federal advisory panel says that long-term care for aging baby boomers threatens to bankrupt Medicaid, and it recommends sweeping changes to rein in costs, including greater use of managed care for the sickest Medicaid recipients. The proposals set up a likely clash between the new Democratic Congress and the Bush administration, which has sent strong signals that it will seek big savings in Medicaid next year. Panel members adopted the recommendations last week, by a vote of 11 to 1, and are drafting a report to be submitted next month to Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services. Mr. Leavitt created the panel in May 2005 and is receptive to many of its proposals. The panel, known as the Medicaid Commission, said states should have more freedom to alter benefits and eligibility for the program, which serves more than 50 million low-income people. Moreover, it said states should be allowed to enroll some of the sickest Medicaid recipients, including nursing home residents and people with disabilities, in managed care plans. The panel said such plans “would provide a medical home and better coordinated care” for people entitled to both Medicaid and Medicare. Care is often fragmented now because Medicaid pays nursing homes while Medicare is the primary payer for doctors and hospitals, and in many cases “clinical data is not shared,” the panel said. People enrolled simultaneously in the two programs account for 13 percent of Medicaid recipients, but more than 40 percent of Medicaid costs. Medicaid, which is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, covers two-thirds of the nation’s 1.6 million nursing home residents. “The anticipated costs for long-term care services in this country threaten the future sustainability of the Medicaid program,” the panel warned. It recommended that the federal government and the states provide new tax incentives for people to buy private insurance covering the costs of long-term care, so they would not rely so much on Medicaid. “Public policy should promote individual responsibility and planning for long-term care needs,” said the panel, led by former Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee, a Republican. More generally, the panel said states should be free “to consolidate or redefine eligibility categories” and should be given “greater flexibility to design Medicaid benefit packages.” The proposals drew a swift negative response from Democrats who will be responsible for Medicaid in the new Congress. Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, who is in line to become chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, dismissed the panel as “a hand-picked commission stacked against working families.” Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the Democrat in line to lead the Finance Committee, said many of the proposals would make it more difficult for “the most vulnerable Americans” to get comprehensive care. John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said, “In some states, flexibility means cutting benefits.” But Christina Pearson, a spokeswoman for Secretary Leavitt, said, “He definitely supports more flexibility for states to meet the needs of different population groups.” Grace-Marie Turner, a commission member, said, “People who rely on both Medicaid and Medicare are the most vulnerable beneficiaries, but in most cases, nobody is coordinating their care.” Even if a state wants to place them in managed care, it may take months or years to get federal approval, said Mrs. Turner, who is president of the Galen Institute, a research center focusing on health policy. The commission said states should be able to place all types of Medicaid recipients in managed care without getting “a waiver or any other form of federal approval.” But, it said, individuals should be able to “opt out” of managed care. Gwendolyn G. Gillenwater, a commission member who is policy director of the American Association of People With Disabilities, an advocacy group, voted against the report. “People with disabilities have not had good experience with managed care,” Ms. Gillenwater said. “We need federal protections and safeguards. People with disabilities should at least have a choice of two managed care plans. And what are your choices if you opt out of managed care? The alternatives are getting more and more limited.” The panel said Congress should rewrite the Medicaid law to encourage the use of home care and community services, instead of nursing homes and other institutions. In an interview, Angus King, the former Maine governor who is the panel’s vice chairman, said: “We need to reverse Medicaid’s institutional bias. Community care — that’s what people want. It’s better for beneficiaries. And it’s less expensive.” The panel urged the Bush administration to study a novel idea: increasing federal subsidies for low-income groups added to the Medicaid rolls, while scaling back subsidies for higher-income people added to the program. The panel said this would help achieve “Medicaid’s core purpose,” serving low-income people.

51-> India? No, Arizona, and That's a Monsoon
It may sound like a science fiction project designed for a dystopian future climate, but the North American Monsoon Experiment is going on now. Monsoons are often associated with the Indian Ocean, but they occur around the world, including North America. They are storms caused by seasonal shifts in winds, and the North American ones, which occur from July to September, are a critical element in the climate and the environment of the American Southwest and northwestern Mexico. The experiment, which began in 2004 and runs to 2008, is an international effort, with scientists from the United States, Mexico, Belize and Costa Rica. The goal of the research, which involves rain gauges, weather stations, research flights, atmospheric profiles, radar and other observations, is to improve monitoring and prediction. It also has an educational arm, to bring teachers into the field and produce materials for science classes. One thing is safe to predict: monsoon thunderstorms, like the one over Arizona shown above, will begin in a couple of months, and occur almost daily.

53-> Deal by Lab Equipment Makers Priced at $10.6 Billion in Stock
The Thermo Electron Corporation agreed yesterday to buy Fisher Scientific International, a company twice its size, for $10.6 billion in stock to become the largest supplier of medical laboratory equipment. Investors in Fisher will receive two Thermo shares, or $78.90, for each Fisher share, an increase of 7 percent from Fisher's closing price on Friday. Shareholders of Fisher, which is based in Hampton, N.H., will own 61 percent of the new company, which will occupy Thermo's home in Waltham, Mass. The combined company, Thermo Fisher Scientific, will be a source for nearly every type of laboratory equipment. Thermo had $2.63 billion in sales last year, compared with Fisher's $5.58 billion. The combined company is expected to have $9 billion in sales next year with 30,000 employees. One rival, Invitrogen, had $1.2 billion in sales last year, and another, the Applied Biosystems Group, had $356.7 million. Shares of Fisher rose $2.22, to close at $75.95; Thermo shares fell 91 cents, to $38.54. Thermo's chief executive, Marijn E. Dekkers, will head the combined company. Public filings indicate that Paul M. Montrone, the chairman of Fisher Scientific, may be among the big winners from the merger. Brian Foley, the head of an executive compensation consulting firm in White Plains, said that his review of the filings indicated that the value of Mr. Montrone's unexercised stock options and restricted stock awards was about $110 million, assuming a price of $76 a share. If Mr. Montrone is terminated, he will receive at least $8.1 million in severance and other benefits, including an annual pension of $1.6 million, Mr. Foley said. Executives of Fisher Scientific did not return a telephone call seeking information about compensation issues. Thermo was advised by Lehman Brothers and Rothschild Inc., with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acting as legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Company and Lazard advised Fisher, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom giving legal advice.

62-> THE WEEK; Dinnertime Bandit Suspect Arrested in Belgium
He was called the Dinnertime Bandit because of his penchant for breaking into homes in Greenwich while the occupants were eating. Nine years after the last break-in, the man wanted in those burglaries has been arrested in Antwerp, Belgium, state and local authorities said. David I. Cohen, the state's attorney for the Stamford and Norwalk judicial district, said the suspect, Alan Golder, 51, was arrested on Dec. 14. Mr. Cohen said he believed that Belgian authorities were holding him on a burglary charge. Mr. Golder was wanted on various charges in Connecticut, including burglary and robbery, involving 23 separate incidents in Greenwich in 1996 and 1997, Mr. Cohen said. The state will ask the Justice Department to seek Mr. Golder's extradition, Mr. Cohen said, but he did not expect that to happen soon. "The authorities in Antwerp will have to decide if they want to prosecute the charges there, before he gets extradited to the United States, and that's totally within their discretion," he said. "But we're talking later rather than sooner." Authorities in Connecticut did not know if Mr. Golder had retained a lawyer in Belgium. JEFF HOLTZ

This week’s cover illustration is the handiwork of Peet Pienaar, an Afrikaner born and raised on a farm 60 miles outside Johannesburg in the days when apartheid was the law of the land. Pienaar, whose appearance this week is his first in the Book Review, stands in the forefront of a generation of South African artists who are erasing long-standing boundaries. Last year he was commissioned to create the graphics for Cape Town’s first art biennale, and he is the publisher, designer and editor of Afro magazine, which showcases contemporary African writing and culture. Pienaar has also become increasingly visible on the American scene. He has designed a limited edition shirt for Gavin Henson, a British rugby player, for Nike, and he will be the chairman of the Clio Awards in 2007. “Competing in your own continent with Paris Hilton, where most people don’t know who Stacy Hardy, Gazelle or Richard De Jager is, is fun and exciting,” he said in an e-mail message. “My world is changing day by day, and the West is turning into a childhood memory.

They have names like Clem, and tend to refer to themselves as “fellers.” Watching them hash out their feelings about McCarthy’s new novel, — see No. 4 on the — is like listening to the members of Waylon Jennings’s old band talking on a back porch somewhere, smoking cigarettes and plunking squirrels with varmint rifles. One burning issue in the forums right now is McCarthy’s strategic deployment of the number 117. In his new novel, 1:17 a.m. is when clocks stop and the world ends. In his last one, “No Country for Old Men,” there was a grisly motel murder in Room 117. And so on. Is McCarthy referencing the Book of Revelations? Genesis? Who knows? One writer on the forum drawls: “That’s the Bible: you can make it support an argument any which way.” There are new No. 1 books on both hardcover lists this week. Mitch Albom’s “For One More Day” tops the fiction charts, and Bill O’Reilly’s “Culture Warrior” heads up the It’s instructive to search these writers’ earlier best sellers on Amazon.com and scan the computer-generated lists of “statistically improbable phrases” that appear in them. Albom’s books barely have any statistically improbable phrases beyond things like “hibiscus plant,” and this makes sense — his prose is nondescript and marshmallow-soft. But what statistically improbable phrases show up in O’Reilly’s 2001 book, “No Spin Zone”? Among them: “humble correspondent.” Dick Francis’ new novel, “Under Orders” (see No. 3 on the fiction list), is the first he’s written since his wife, Mary, died in 2000. It’s also his first since his authorized biographer, Graham Lord, claimed that Mary had essentially written all of his books. Francis, who is 85, told The Sunday Herald in England that the couple were indeed a partnership. She did research and “put the English right,” he said. As a writer, Francis does seem to be able to carry on alone: “Under Orders” has gotten approving early reviews. One of the many good things about The London Review of Books is its personal ads; they’re cheekier than the comparable ones you find in this country in The New York Review of Books. Some of the best will be collected later this fall in “They Call Me Naughty Lola: Personal Ads From The London Review of Books.” This book doesn’t have a prayer of making the list. But here’s one great LRB personal ad: “This is the first time in my life I’ve appeared in any font other than Courier New. That’s because my best work is still in my head, as are my years of financial stability, my buff physique, the respect of my peers and my ability to trim sea bass. What were you expecting — Saul Bellow? Man, 34. Takes what he can get, as will you. Box no. 1763.”

67-> Brush Up Your Chekhov
At the start of her new book on writing, Francine Prose dispatches with The Question — the five words that inevitably confront writers who teach, writers who don’t teach, and possibly even nonwriters who do neither: “Can creative writing be taught?” Prose’s succinct answer is “no,” but she elaborates on it with characteristic humor, asking us to imagine “Kafka enduring the seminar in which his classmates inform him that, frankly, they just don’t believe the part about the guy waking up one morning to find he’s a giant bug.” Repelled by that sort of poisonous atmosphere, I used to inveigh against writing workshops — right up until the day I started teaching one. Now, like many of my colleagues, I find myself wondering just how much success I (and my students) can reasonably expect. Useful teaching texts are few. For all the wisdom in John Gardner’s “Art of Fiction,” his sallies against 1970’s experimentalism are aging poorly, and undergrads seem to dislike his curmudgeonly tone. E.M. Forster’s “Aspects of the Novel” is likewise yellowing at the edges. Classic reference books like Strunk and White’s “Elements of Style” and William K. Zinsser’s “On Writing Well” are thorough sources for writers of both fiction and nonfiction, but their focus on grammar and other supposedly arcane topics makes them slow going. (Maira Kalman’s illustrations for the new edition of “The Elements of Style” at least illuminate the Strunkian demands with quirky panache.) Eudora Welty’s “One Writer’s Beginnings,” Anne Lamott’s “Bird by Bird” and Stephen King’s “On Writing” are heartening, but perhaps because they’re so personal, the advice to be gleaned from them is scattershot. Another difficulty faced by writing teachers is, paradoxically, the lack of interest many students show in reading. And those who do read often lack the training to observe subtle writerly clues. There’s a real need, then, for “Reading Like a Writer” — a primer both for aspiring writers and for readers who’d like to increase their sensitivity to the elements of the writer’s craft. Prose notes that the creative-writing workshop (which she brilliantly satirized in her novel “Blue Angel”) is a latecomer to literary culture, but that writers have always turned to their predecessors for inspiration: “They studied meter with Ovid, plot construction with Homer, comedy with Aristophanes.” In other words, it helps to read the masters: “You can assume that if a writer’s work has survived for centuries, there are reasons why this is so, explanations that have nothing to do with a conspiracy of academics plotting to resuscitate a zombie army of dead white males.” Prose also recommends savoring books rather than racing through them, a strategy that “may require some rewiring, unhooking the connection that makes you think you have to have an opinion about the book and reconnecting that wire to whatever terminal lets you see reading as something that might move or delight you.” Delight? As a student, I rarely heard the word mentioned, although, like Prose, I became a writer because books gave me such joy. Her insistence on that pleasure informs her method: reading carefully to see what an author does on the page and between the lines. This casts learning in a positive light, unlike the typical workshop’s E.R. approach of trying to diagnose and cure the ailments of a story. Prose’s chapters focus on potentially challenging topics: dialogue, narration, even where to take paragraph breaks. (I wish she’d included one on getting characters in and out of rooms.) In each chapter, she quotes from authors who approach the subject in interesting ways. Writing about sentences, for example, she cites Rebecca West, Samuel Johnson, Philip Roth and Virginia Woolf, and then patiently explains why. Here, for example, from the chapter called “Words,” is her take on a passage from Paul Bowles’s story “A Distant Episode”: “The contents of the Professor’s ‘two small overnight bags full of maps, sun lotions and medicines’ provide a tiny mini-course in the importance of close reading. The protagonist’s anxiety and cautiousness, his whole psychological makeup, has been communicated in five words (‘maps, sun lotions and medicines’) and without the need to use one descriptive adjective or phrase. (He was an anxious man, who worried about getting lost or sunburned or sick and so forth.) What very different conclusions we might form about a man who carries a bag filled with dice, syringes and a handgun.” Despite her book’s didactic purpose, Prose distrusts hard-and-fast rules. When she recalls advising students to stick to one point of view, or to avoid assigning two characters similar names, she remembers finding counterexamples in Chekhov. Her notions of good writing are elastic and open-minded: a liberal view rooted in a belief in the importance of reading. “The advantage of reading widely,” she notes, “as opposed to trying to formulate a series of general rules, is that we learn there are no general rules, only individual examples to help point you in a direction in which you might want to go.” No reader will revere all the writers Prose finds great, and some may carp at her list of 117 “Books to Be Read Immediately.” But “Reading Like a Writer” is sufficiently capacious — and encouraging — to allow for such differences of opinion. As her subtitle promises, Prose’s little guide will motivate “people who love books” and “those who want to write them” to be sensitive readers of their own and others’ work. And it will inspire them to practice the skills she teaches when reading books like “Middlemarch” and “Sense and Sensibility,” two of the many her exegesis made me hungry to reread. I don’t know if any book about writing can tell us where novels come from — or how they take shape in a writer’s mind. Nevertheless, “Reading Like a Writer” should be greatly appreciated in and out of the classroom. Like the great works of fiction, it’s a wise and voluble companion.

69-> Woman Jumps With Baby From Perth Amboy Bridge
A young mother jumped off the Victory Bridge in Perth Amboy, N.J., late yesterday morning clutching her baby daughter, the authorities said. The woman survived the plunge into the Raritan River, but the child died. The woman, Jerlisa Contreras, 24, of Perth Amboy, was in critical condition after jumping from the southbound side of the bridge, said a spokeswoman for Perth Amboy, Shakira Johnson, who said the two were pulled from the river by fire and emergency rescue workers. The mother was taken to Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick. The baby, Alyssa Scott, 14 months old, was taken to Raritan Bay Medical Center in Perth Amboy, where she was pronounced dead, a hospital spokeswoman, Lynette Davis, said. The Perth Amboy police declined to discuss the matter "because it's now a homicide investigation," Ms. Johnson of Perth Amboy said. Relatives and friends of Ms. Contreras said yesterday that she had been upset since the weekend, when she confronted a woman they said was seeing her daughter's father. "It could be she was trying to get back at him, or maybe it was that she was just stressed out," said a friend and next-door neighbor, Jessica Colón, 25. "I never thought she would go to this length." Ms. Contreras, the eldest of six children, immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1995 with her mother and five brothers to join her father, according to friends and family members. She had been working at a gas station in Woodbridge, they said. She also had a young son, who lives in Texas with relatives, they said. It was the second time in the past six weeks that the 110-foot-high span of the new Victory Bridge was the site of a suicide attempt. On May 3, Joseph Palladino, a 32-year-old bus driver from Barnegat, jumped from the bridge shortly after killing his estranged wife, Donna Beckmann-Palladino, and her mother, Mary Jane Beckmann, 62. Ms. Beckmann-Palladino, 36, was at her parents' home in South Amboy to attend her father's funeral. He died a few days earlier of natural causes.

72-> When Couric Broadcasts the News, Some Radio and Web Sites Will Too
PASADENA, Calif., July 16 — When a network evening newscast passes the anchor’s baton, viewers have come to expect an overhauled set, music and graphics. But for Sept. 5, when Katie Couric takes over on “The CBS Evening News,” the network is planning more widespread changes, including fanning the newscast out across different media, including radio and the Web, to capture a wider audience. Taking questions from more than 200 television critics gathered here on Sunday for their semiannual meeting, Ms. Couric and Sean McManus, president of CBS News and Sports, outlined some of what Mr. McManus calls “expansive and in many ways unprecedented” changes that will come when Ms. Couric takes over from Bob Schieffer and becomes the first female sole anchor of a major network newscast. “The CBS Evening News is going to be showcased on the radio,” said Mr. McManus, “which is new and it’s different and I think will further expose our product to a lot of people.” The multiplatform strategy will involve simulcasting the first segment of the evening news on CBS Radio News, which will be made available to its more than 500 affiliated stations around the country. Already committed to the simulcast are WCBS-AM in New York, WTOP radio in Washington and WBZ in Boston. The strategy will also include on-demand, extended Webcast interviews (done by Ms. Couric or CBS correspondents) and daily on-camera Web rundowns of the news lineup for the television broadcast that evening. “Our goal on Sept. 5 is that whether you’re in your car, on your computer, commuting, listening on your cell phone, or, God forbid, at home watching television, that the CBS news will be available to you,” said Mr. McManus. Additionally, it was announced that CBS news anchor Bob Schieffer, who has not only stabilized the newscast but attracted some 300,000 new viewers, will be staying on as a contributing correspondent based in Washington. He may also be assigned a role as commentator, according to Mr. McManus. Ms. Couric appeared relaxed, in good spirits and ready to take on a crowd of eager reporters. Her meeting with the television critics came one day before the end of her six-city “listening tour,” a series of town hall meetings and cancer fund-raisers closed to the new media that were designed to ease her transition from NBC to CBS and to foster goodwill with important CBS affiliates such as Dallas, Denver, San Diego and San Francisco. “I took the entire month of June off,” said Ms. Couric. “I found that sleep is very underrated and it was a great time for me to relax and spend quality time with my children.” As for what she had heard this week from her viewers in the town hall meetings, Ms. Couric said, “it reinforced, happily, the view that there are a lot of highly intelligent, very engaged people in this country who are very interested in serious subjects and the news of the day.” What she learned, she said, is that people want longer news stories and they want to know how the stories are relevant to their lives. They also feel, she said, that the news is too depressing. Ms. Couric says that the her broadcasts will be a work in progress. “We have a lot of work ahead. I’m really excited to get started, to stop talking about this and to actually start doing the job.”

73-> How 3 G.O.P. Veterans Stalled Bush Detainee Bill
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 16 — Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham cornered their partner, Senator John W. Warner, on the Senate floor late Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Warner, the courtly Virginian who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee, had been trying for weeks to quietly work out the three Republicans’ differences with the Bush administration’s proposal to bring terrorism suspects to trial. But Senators McCain, of Arizona, and Graham, of South Carolina, who are on the committee with Mr. Warner, convinced him that the time for negotiation was over. The three senators, all military veterans, marched off to an impromptu news conference to lay out their deep objections to the Bush legislation. Mr. Warner then personally broke the news to Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, and the next day the Armed Services Committee voted to approve a firm legislative rebuke to the president’s plan to reinterpret the Geneva Conventions. It was a stinging defeat for the White House, not least because the views of Mr. Warner, a former Navy secretary, carry particular weight. With a long history of ties to the military, Mr. Warner, 79, has a reputation as an accurate gauge to views that senior officers are reluctant to express in public. Notably, in breaking ranks with the White House, Mr. Warner was joined by Colin L. Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a rare public breach with the administration he served as secretary of state. As Mr. Warner left his Senate office on Friday afternoon, he carried a briefcase of material to prepare for a potential legislative showdown in the coming days. At stake, he said, was more than the fate of “these 20-odd individuals,” a reference to the high-level terrorism suspects awaiting possible trial at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. “It’s how America’s going to be perceived in the world, how we’re going to continue the war against terror,” Mr. Warner said. Then he showed off the motto on his necktie: “Democracy is not a spectator sport.” Ronald Reagan had a similar tie, Mr. Warner said, and had given him a copy. Democrats and Republicans alike had assumed that Mr. Warner, a smooth negotiator not given to public confrontation, would relent to the administration, especially considering the importance Republicans had placed on passing the legislation as midterm elections approached. The thinking was that Mr. McCain, who was tortured as a Vietnam prisoner of war, would not budge, nor would Mr. Graham, a military lawyer and zealous guardian of military standards. That left Mr. Warner as the best potential target for the White House. But as he considered the consequences of the proposal, the chairman decided to stick to his guns, saying he believed the nation’s reputation was at stake. “He is a man of the Senate,” said Mr. Graham, arguing that Mr. Warner’s stance spoke volumes because it went against his nature to have so visible a conflict. “He is also a military man and has thought long and hard about this.” Mr. Bush seems equally determined to win provisions he says are needed to interrogate and prosecute terrorism suspects. He and his allies are ratcheting up pressure on Senate Republicans who support alternate rules adopted this week by the Armed Services Committee. Mr. Warner, like his two colleagues, has a network of high-ranking current and retired military officers who provide regular guidance and support. While he has been consulting them privately, some are expected to weigh in publicly in the days ahead. One aide said on Saturday that the number of Senate Republicans behind the three senators was widening beyond the 8 or 10 they had anticipated, with lawmakers — heavily influenced by Mr. Powell’s stance — preparing to soon go public with their views. In interviews, two senior Bush administration officials acknowledged that the White House had underestimated the depth of opposition Mr. Bush’s proposal would provoke. They also said they had focused mostly on gaining Mr. Graham’s support and mistakenly believed they had it, based on statements he made about the Geneva Conventions in Senate hearings. A Republican senator separately described the clash between the White House and Mr. Warner’s group as “a train wreck.” The administration officials and the Republican senator were granted anonymity because they would not openly discuss negotiations between the White House and Congress. Mr. Warner’s convictions about how military trials should proceed appear to stem largely from his personal experience, beginning with his Navy service in World War II. Hanging with the photographs on his office wall is a worn, small placard that his mother displayed on the door of their Washington home from 1944 to 1946: “There’s a Man from this family in the Navy.” “I’m a man that’s been through a lot,” Mr. Warner said, recounting his days as secretary of the Navy in the early 1970’s when he was personally confronted with issues of military prisoners. “I mean, I’ve been through this before.” Mr. Graham has similarly drawn on his legal and military background in challenging the White House. “The Geneva Convention means more to me than the average person,” he said. He said “some people” considered the conventions “a waste of time, but I know they have been helpful.” Mr. Graham acknowledged that the political battle was bruising, but said he could not tolerate a change in the American interpretation of the conventions if it meant short-term benefits at long-term costs. “President Bush is very sincere in wanting the tools he needs to fight the war on terror,” Mr. Graham said in an interview. “I don’t want the tools they are given to become clubs to be used against our people.” In a letter sent Friday to Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, Mr. Graham also took issue with a provision of the administration’s approach that would allow the use of secret evidence in trials of terrorism suspects. "Where in American jurisprudence do you find support for the concept that a person accused can be tried and convicted on evidence which that person has no opportunity to see, confront or rebut?” Mr. Graham wrote. The bonds between Mr. Warner, Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham were forged in difficult times. Mr. Warner and Mr. McCain first met when Mr. Warner was the Navy secretary and Mr. McCain was returning to his Navy career after his captivity. Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham became close during the 2000 primaries in South Carolina, when Mr. McCain came under attack from Bush Republicans. They teamed up last year in forcing the White House to accept a ban on torture. After the Supreme Court struck down the administration’s earlier plan for military tribunals in June, they joined with top military lawyers to form the chief bulwark against what they said were efforts to undermine military law and the 60-year-old protections of the Geneva Conventions. “It’s not a question of defiance or intransigence, it’s the way we’ve worked,” Mr. Warner said. “We’ve continued to indicate a willingness to look at situations — is there a bridge that we can build between certain provisions? And our core principles are very rooted in the three of us.” Mr. Graham added, “There are three branches of government, not one.” Mr. Warner sought to serve as a counterbalance to the occasionally combative Mr. McCain and Mr. Graham during a turbulent week that fractured the Republican majority on its signature issue, national security. It saw Mr. Powell enlisting with the three Republicans against Mr. Bush, and left Mr. Graham chewing out General Michael V. Hayden, the C.I.A director, in a closed meeting. In the Senate, Mr. Warner is known for hearing out colleagues and trying to find consensus. “John Warner is always very gracious,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who is also on the Armed Services Committee and sided with Senators Warner, McCain and Graham. “He is patient and he is thoughtful. And people sometimes mistake that for uncertainty about his position.” Administration officials said they had focused on Mr. Warner as the key to overcoming Republican opposition in the Senate. When he raised a question with General Hayden about the State Department’s view on the matter, Mr. Warner received a phone call within hours from Ms. Rice. Ms. Rice followed up with a letter to Mr. Warner, which administration officials distributed on Capitol Hill on Thursday to counter the letter from Mr. Powell, which had objected to the administration’s plan to redefine Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. But once it became clear that Mr. Warner was dug in, the administration began setting its sights on other senators, inviting them to the White House. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Frist’s office arranged a conference call between staff members for Senate Republicans and Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, to emphasize talking points for making the administration’s case on Capitol Hill. As the fight swirled around him last week, Mr. Warner got a call from his grandson, Nicholas, a boarding school student who was an intern in his office this summer, asking what all the fuss on television was about. “I took the time to try to explain it to him,” Mr. Warner said. “That’s one of the jobs we have to do, explain to the American people.” He added: “Neither McCain nor Graham nor I nor anybody wants to tie the hands of the intelligence community.”

74-> Addition to Wyeth Fen-Phen Fund Approved
By Bloomberg News Wyeth won final judicial approval to add $1.3 billion to a $3.75 billion settlement of lawsuits over the fen-phen diet drug combination, the company said yesterday. The addition to the $3.75 billion national settlement fund is aimed at resolving more pending fen-phen cases and speeding up payouts to dieters, Wyeth officials said in May 2004 when the company agreed to the addition. The extra money will help settle about 42,000 pending claims, the company said. "This development is an important milestone to the company and an important step to an ultimate solution of this issue," a Wyeth spokesman, Douglas Petkus, said in a telephone interview. Final judicial approval by Judge Harvey Bartle III of United States District Court in Philadelphia, comes after trial court approval of the settlement on March 15, 2005. Final judicial approval was possible only after appeals against the settlement had been exhausted, a plaintiffs' lawyer, Michael Fishbein of Philadelphia, said. "It's now fully effective," Mr. Fishbein said. "People couldn't get paid and it wasn't fully funded until we got this final approval." Wyeth, based in Madison, N.J., withdrew the diet drugs Pondimin and Redux from the market in 1997 after researchers linked them to heart and lung problems in some users. Those drugs were combined with the generic phentermine in the fen-phen combination. The company said it had set aside more than $21 billion so far to resolve its fen-phen liability. Wyeth officials sought in 2000 to wrap up fen-phen litigation with the $3.75 billion national settlement. Under that accord, the company set aside $1 billion for future medical checkups for former users of the drug who have shown no adverse reaction and $2.35 billion to resolve individual suits.

75-> Breezing Over the Classics With a Sampler of What’s to Come
The New York City Opera formally opens its season on Wednesday with a new production of Handel’s “Semele.” But on Thursday evening the company, which takes seriously its mantle as the “people’s opera,” in the words of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, kicked off the season informally by throwing a combined concert and house party. The performance, featuring the City Opera Orchestra and Chorus and a large roster of singers conducted by the music director George Manahan, was the first event in the company’s second annual Opera-for-All Festival, which continues through the weekend with performances of Bizet’s “Carmen” and Puccini’s “Bohème.” The festive program offered concert performances of excerpts and arias from all but one of the 12 works the City Opera will present this season. Tickets in every section of the house cost only $25, first come first served. The New York State Theater was packed, proving, if any classical music institutions doubted it, that high ticket prices are a deterrent to audiences, especially younger people and neophytes. Besides conducting, Mr. Manahan was the evening’s affable host, introducing the singers, describing the music and generally trying to entice newcomers to check out the City Opera. The program began with a rousing, nearly frantic account of the orchestral entr’acte from Act IV of “Carmen,” then segued into the spirited quintet from Act II, in which the Gypsies plot their next act of smuggling. Mr. Manahan explained that in this breathless, quicksilver ensemble Bizet tried to evoke a lot of rapid-paced chatter. It’s a tricky piece, and the singers pulled it off deftly. There were excerpts from Handel’s “Semele” and “Flavio”; Mozart’s “Così Fan Tutte”; Rossini’s “Donna del Lago”; and other works. The lyric tenor John Tessier won the evening’s biggest ovation for his ardent singing of the popular aria “Una furtiva lagrima” from Donizetti’s “Elisir d’Amore.” A restless performance of the ominous orchestral interlude and the beguiling “Tanzlied” (sung by the baritone Keith Phares) from Korngold’s mystery opera “Die Tote Stadt” proved an enticement for the company’s production of this neglected 1920 work, which opens on Sept. 24. The agile soprano Elizabeth Futral and the sweet-toned tenor Ryan MacPherson were standouts as Violetta and Alfredo in the “Libiamo” duet and chorus from Verdi’s “Traviata.” The evening ended with the extended final scene from Act II of “La Bohème,” everything from Musetta’s Waltz (coyly sung by the soprano Elizabeth Caballero) to the bustling conclusion with the intrusive military band and the excited children’s chorus. After the concert the audience gathered in the promenade of the State Theater for a reception with music by the East Village Opera Company, a band that does rock versions of arias and ensembles from opera. Indeed, their first selection was a pumped-up yet surprisingly faithful rendition of the Overture to Mozart’s “Nozze di Figaro.” Most of the crowd seemed to love it. Mindful of protecting my hearing for professional purposes, I headed home.

82-> Taxi Chariman Opposes New Cab Plan
Matthew W. Daus, chairman of the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, said at a City Council hearing yesterday that he opposed a bill that would require the commission, which is scheduled to sell 308 taxi medallions in June, to devote half of the new licenses to wheelchair-accessible cabs and the other half to cabs that use alternative fuels or run on a combination of electricity and gasoline. Mr. Daus said that the 27 wheelchair-accessible cabs in use have had "a series of component failures" and that the available hybrid-electric models do not allow for the safety partitions that are in most of the city's 12,779 yellow cabs. However, the State Energy Research and Development Agency, which has an agreement with the taxi agency to promote alternative-fuel and wheelchair-accessible cabs, said yesterday that the bill was "a constructive move."

84-> How Do You Take a Gun Away?
In his essay on disarming Hezbollah (Aug. 27), James Traub says that "just because you can't see your way to a long-term solution doesn't mean you dispense with short-term palliatives." But short-term palliatives have been tried repeatedly over the last half-century to no avail, and most significant, every resort to palliatives has been treated by terror organizations as weakness, and weakness as an invitation to strike again. The hard proof is in Israel's withdrawals: Israel withdrew from Lebanon six years ago, recently withdrew from Gaza and has elected a party whose platform is to withdraw from the West Bank. The only withdrawal compatible with the charters of Hezbollah and Hamas is Israel's withdrawal into the Mediterranean. Hezbollah's oft-stated goal is the annihilation of the state of Israel, which it calls "the Zionist entity." What palliative "solution" to annihilation works -- a compromise of only 50 percent annihilation? Ellen Schneider Fort Lauderdale, Fla.

91-> Art in Review; Artists Against the State
Perestroika Revisited Ronald Feldman Fine Arts 31 Mercer Street, SoHo Through June 24 Not all art is for all time. Many artworks burn brightly for only particular historical moments and then they become more or less interesting artifacts, like those in "Artists Against the State: Perestroika Revisited." The more than 100 paintings, sculptures, drawings, photographs and books in the exhibition were made by dissident artists in the Soviet Union during the time leading up to and including perestroika, a period of political and cultural reform preceding the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Some of the more than 50 artists and artist teams included went on to enjoy successful careers in the United States: Ilya Kabakov, Komar & Melamid and Grisha Bruskin, for example. Many will be unfamiliar to nonspecialists. Ranging between Conceptualism and Pop Art, most of the work resists official culture in ways that now seem mild and often obscure. Some things are obviously satiric, like Leonid Sokov's bronze sculpture representing a meeting between Lenin and one of Giacometti's emaciated figures or Alex Kosolapov's Warhol-style portrait of a feminized Gorbachev on a gold background. But it is difficult to see political risk-taking in many other works, like tiles based on zoological illustrations of the body language of geese by the Peppers; Mr. Kabakov's brushy painting of an idyllic farmscape with actual pieces of work clothing hanging on the front of the canvas; or a wonderful miniature, premodern village populated by chubby little people realized in colored Plasticine by another team, the Martinchiks. But an antic, rebellious festivity emerges from the whole, a giddy excitement about new possibilities of thinking, feeling and acting. This is the most interesting and touching aspect about it. As thought police and the artists pitted against them both know, under the right circumstances even the slightest expressions of nonconformist imagination can be politically as well as spiritually inflammatory. You have to wonder, what are Russian artists doing now under the rule of capitalism gone wild? KEN JOHNSON

The store owner, Wayne Edelman, said the assailant, a nattily dressed man, walked into the store, Meurice Garment Care at 245 East 57th Street, and demanded money. Mr. Luciano gave him about $1,000 in cash and told him to leave, but the man punched him and then stabbed him when he tried to fight back, Mr. Edelman said.

96-> Diner's Guide
Diner's Guide presents excerpts from recent restaurant reviews. Tocqueville In an attempt to move on up in the restaurant scene, Tocqueville went this year from one end of a East 15th Street block to the other. But the shortness of the distance belies the extent of the effect. Tocqueville now feels like a much more proper restaurant. Its shortcomings, including uneven service, are more noticeable in the context of a changed image and expectations. But the considerable pleasures of Marco Moreira's cooking are intact, as is a serious wine list. Try the duo of seared sirloin and braised short rib, the salmon in Savoy cabbage and the roasted chicken, whose tenderness underscores the care this kitchen takes. 1 East 15th Street, Manhattan; (212) 647-1515; tocquevillerestaurant.com. Dinner entrees, $29 to $38. ** [Rating: Two Stars] The Tasting Room This restaurant, which started out as a 25-seat nook in the East Village, is now more than triple that size and has a more stylish NoLIta address. It remains crowded on many nights, because many New Yorkers rightly appreciate that few chefs exalt nature's seasonal bounty, including esoteric mushrooms and exotic herbs, as lovingly and creatively as Colin Alevras. But the seafood and meat in the foreground of dishes get less respect. It's as if the Tasting Room were a vegetarian restaurant that hasn't come out of the closet. The wine list is original and absorbing. 264 Elizabeth Street, at Houston Street, NoLIta; (212) 358-7831; thetastingroomnyc.com. "Taste" portions, $8 to $18; "share" portions, $14 to $32. * [Rating: One Star] Spicy & Tasty Spicy & Tasty, in Flushing, is one of the most aptly named restaurants in the five boroughs -- and a showcase for Sichuan cooking that doesn't hold its fire in deference to many Westerners' palates. The blazing effects of numbing Sichuan peppercorns and hot chili peppers recur in one spicy dish after another. As for the other side of the ampersand, there are juicy little shrimps with black bean paste, shredded bean curd with an irresistibly bouncy texture and a scallion and egg fried rice whose fluffiness is a revelation. All of these dishes, and the modest prices, compensate for a lack of atmosphere, desserts and much in the way of alcohol. 39-07 Prince Street, Flushing, Queens; (718) 359-1601. Entrees, $6.95 to $16.95; fried rice and noodles, $4.95 to $7.95. ** [Rating: Two Stars] Porter House New York Inheriting the space in the Time Warner Center that belonged to V Steakhouse, Porter House New York takes a less cheeky, more earnest approach to rib-eyes and strips. It marks the re-emergence of Michael Lomonaco, the chef at Windows on the World until 9/11, and he's supervising a kitchen that cooks well-sourced cuts of meat with care. Other dishes and most appetizers were less successful, and the food over all, like the amber-glow ambience, casts this restaurant as a generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in a lesser mall. It's like an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at the Outback Steakhouse. 10 Columbus Circle, Time Warner Center, fourth floor; (212) 823-9500, porterhousenewyork.com. Dinner entrees, $24 to $39. * [Rating: One Star] STK Slick, dark, noisy and in need of a vowel, STK blurs the line between restaurant and nightclub; in other words, it's in the meatpacking district. It tries to feminize the steakhouse by including smaller cuts, and it wants to do for filets and T-bones what the city's Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. Those steaks were fine, but other dishes in the menu weren't, and you have to be in the mood for circular white leather booths and a maelstrom of revelers. 26 Little West 12th Street, between Ninth Avenue and Washington Street, West Village; (646) 624-2444, stkhouse.com.

99-> Drawn to Eastern Tennessee's Natural Beauty
VONORE, Tenn. TWENTY-FIVE years ago, Tellico Lake in eastern Tennessee was little more than a trout stream trickling down from the Smoky Mountains. Now it is a 35-mile section of an inland waterway connecting the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, formed by a dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The dam was controversial at the time of its completion in 1979, but now it is credited with creating a retirement community real estate boom here, about 30 miles south of Knoxville, particularly in the last few years as Floridians are increasingly drawn north, some of them fearful of hurricanes. Since the first planned community was built here in 1986, it has mostly been a haven for retired Midwesterners. The first developer in the area, Cooper Communities, marketed its gated community, Tellico Village, at golf and boat shows throughout Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. (The developer has more recently expanded its marketing campaign by hiring the actor Erik Estrada as a pitch man, and running ads about Tellico Village on British television, oddly enough.) But it is the natural beauty of the area that makes for an easy sell: Lakefront property with views of the Smokies has attracted people like Charles and Laurel Rightler. After Mr. Rightler retired from DaimlerChrysler, the couple sold their home in Michigan and rented a house in the area while they built a home on lakefront property in Tellico Village, where they now have lived for a year. In addition to playing golf at three courses in the area, the couple have a boat dock off their backyard, which they can see from their living room overlooking the lake and a thicket of trees. "The natural beauty drew us here and the community really enriched that," Mrs. Rightler said. "We know our neighbors. We're involved with the church. It's not so remote that things are inconvenient, but for the most part, Tennessee is a well-kept secret." Not as well-kept as it once was, however, as the "half-backs" — Northerners who retired to Florida only to change their minds and move half-way back, to Tennessee — take advantage of lower real estate prices. "Most people are from the Midwest," said Elby Loyd, who opened Re/Max at the Lakes in the Tellico Lake area in 1999. The convenience of being able to drive to eastern Tennessee within a day of most urban areas in the Midwest and being able to enjoy the change of seasons that are still relatively mild have been big selling points for people who might otherwise go to Florida. "Now there's an influx of people coming up from Florida because of prices," Mr. Loyd said. "But it's not as cheap as they expect." A standard waterfront lot, about a third of an acre, costs a minimum of $200,000, and larger lots can climb as high as $700,000, depending on the view. With such steep land prices, houses on the lake are getting bigger, creating some ill will as views are being blocked by houses that are as large as 12,000 square feet. But for people willing to live a little more inland, the Tellico Lake area — about a 50-mile radius — is still relatively affordable, especially for those pushed out of Florida by heavy costs for insurance and other hurricane-related expenses in addition to high real estate prices. Marie and Jim Smith moved from Boston to Cape Coral, Fla., where they lived for nine years. "We were tired of the hurricanes," Mrs. Smith said. "After we got hit with Charley, we just looked at each other and said, 'Did we retire just to board up the house every June 1?' Our children wouldn't visit us in September and October any more." Mrs. Smith said she began looking on the Internet for an alternative. As avid boaters, access to water was priority No. 1. She found a Web site about Tellico Lake and the couple came up to look, eventually buying a house in Rarity Bay, built by a local developer, Mike Ross. While they are not on the water, they can drive a golf cart to the marina where their boat is docked. "This brought us closer to our children and grandkids," who are scattered around the Midwest, Mrs. Smith said. "Our house was on the water in Florida; we sold it a year ago," she said. "It was a nice time for us to cash out." Bob Gilley, principal owner of Tellico Lake Realty, said surveys indicate that 20 percent of people moving here are from Michigan, 8 percent from Illinois and 7 percent Ohio. "When those surveys are updated, we'll see a whole bunch from Florida," he said. These days, "40 percent of people who come in our doors are from Florida." Kendall and Bonita Brown lived in eastern Tennessee before moving to Florida with the intention of retiring there. Mr. Brown, a pharmacist who also has a building contractor's license, built a house near the water in Destin, on Florida's panhandle. "We had the intent to retire down there," Mrs. Brown said. "We did like the area. But we felt like we sold our house at the right time to be able to achieve full retirement status at our age and maximize our investment." Mr. and Mrs. Brown are 61 and 59 respectively. In addition to the price differential, the Browns — who bought a pre-existing house with a lake view, but not on the water — were also influenced by the increased frequency and strength of hurricanes. Their home in Destin was damaged by Ivan, the strongest hurricane of the 2004 season. "The impact of Ivan and the smaller storms affected the insurance rate and going through those hassles — the power was off for seven days," Mrs. Brown said. "We were lucky, but you wonder if you'll be lucky the next time." While the six developments in the Tellico Lake region are geared to retirees, there is a smattering of younger families. The Orcutts live in a newer, more intimate development called Kahiti, the second phase of Tellico Village, built in the last four years. "We planned to build a house here when Jonathan went off to college, but we decided we didn't want to wait," Jim Orcutt said about his son who is 16. The Orcutts lived in Texas and Atlanta previously, where Mr. Orcutt worked in the insurance business. Being able to work from home, however, enabled the family to move sooner than they otherwise would have. They bought their lakefront property two and a half years ago, and the 2,600-square-foot house was completed last May. The Orcutts have sweeping views of undeveloped land across the lake, which they believe will not be released for development by the Tennessee Valley Authority, owner of nearly all the land. To keep past controversies from erupting again — the dam was delayed for years by eminent domain disputes, and then by an endangered species lawsuit over the snail darter — the authority has indicated that development in the area will be limited. "It makes the land that is developed more valuable," Mr. Gilley said. "The people who have moved in here feel they have their own bit of paradise and they like it the way it is."

100-> Manhattan: Two Workers Killed in Accidents
Two workers were killed in separate accidents yesterday, one on the Upper East Side and the other on the Queensboro Bridge, the police said. In the first accident, three workers painting under the bridge were lowering themselves from a scaffold about 11 a.m. when the scaffold tipped, the police said.

The other workers, who were wearing harnesses, were not injured, the police said. The other fatal accident occurred about 1:15 p.m. when a mason fell five stories from a scaffold at 880 Fifth Avenue, the police said. The man was not identified yesterday.

101-> Journal Clarifies Report on a Stem Cell Finding
The scientific journal Nature has issued a clarification of a recent report that human embryonic stem cells can be derived without harm to the embryo, but has affirmed the report’s validity. The finding, by Dr. Robert Lanza and colleagues at Advanced Cell Technology’s laboratory in Worcester, Mass., caused a stir when Nature published it online in August, because under current methods, the generating of such cells entails destroying the embryo. The paper would seem, then, to undercut the argument of opponents of embryonic stem cell research that the work requires the loss of a potential human life. Dr. Lanza’s approach is made possible by preimplantation genetic diagnosis, a test sometimes used in fertility clinics whereby one cell is removed to test for abnormalities when the embryo has reached the eight-cell stage. This does no apparent harm to the embryo, which, if the testing finds it normal, is then implanted with its seven remaining cells. The process has resulted in the birth of apparently healthy children. Dr. Lanza found that one such cell, or blastomere, could generate embryonic stem cells. His article is being published again by Nature  online yesterday and in the printed journal today  along with itemized changes in the text and an addendum by him and his colleagues. The changes address issues that were misunderstood or misstated earlier, as in a press release issued by Nature. These included the fact that although Dr. Lanza said others could use his method to avoid destroying embryos, he himself had destroyed those used in his experiments by using many cells from each. Had he taken just one cell from each of a number of eight-cell embryos, many more embryos would have been needed. Ritu Dhand, Nature’s chief biology editor, said the sole purpose of the clarification was to make the article easier to understand. “There was nothing either scientifically or technically wrong with the paper,” Dr. Dhand said. The journal has had the article reviewed by experts a second time, she said, “just to be sure that everything was as it should be.” It is too soon for other laboratories to have repeated Dr. Lanza’s work, the acid test of scientific findings. Richard M. Doerflinger, a spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said the ability to derive stem cells from a single blastomere was still unproved.

102-> SHARK ATTACK; Cruelty in the Name of Art
To the Editor: Re "Swimming With Famous Dead Sharks" by Carol Vogel [Oct. 1]: As an art historian and curator, I am fully aware that "shock value" fuels many of our contemporary art trends, and in actuality there is nothing new or original in this particular artistic goal. However, the story of Damien Hirst's replacement of the prime component of his construction "The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living" brings another significant issue to the forefront: the sacrifice of an animal, albeit a rather uncuddly one, for the sake of Art. The destruction of animals and the violent mutilation of animal carcasses, whether real or artificially created, send messages to viewers that are beyond these artists' intent. If art reflects the time we live in, these examples tell us -- and will tell future generations -- about the loss of our humanity. Cecelia Levin Boston

HOUSTON, July 25 (AP)  A federal judge on Tuesday rejected a request by a former chief executive of Enron, Jeffrey K. Skilling, to overturn his convictions for fraud and conspiracy related to lies told to investors and employees about the company’s financial health. Mr. Skilling contended that the evidence presented when he was tried alongside Kenneth L. Lay was not adequate for conviction and that his convictions on 19 of 28 criminal counts should be thrown out. With no explanation, Judge Simeon T. Lake III denied the request. Mr. Skilling, who intends to appeal and is to be sentenced on Oct. 23, is awaiting rulings on other issues. For one, the government has asked Judge Lake to order Mr. Skilling to pay $139.3 million.

108-> The Final Cut
One day soon, people will have had their fill of dead bodies. I know of five books about the body-parts trade. Museum exhibitions of preserved cadavers are cropping up like Starbucks in every major city from Houston to Taipei. “CSI” has more spinoffs than “Godzilla.” I would ask you to leave room for one more bite: “Human Remains: Dissection and Its Histories.” The title may be somewhat cautious and plodding, but the narrative isn’t. It sparks and scorns and spins you around (in, you know, a heavily sourced, academic sort of way). Helen MacDonald argues that if you peer behind the typical justifications offered for the use of the dead by the living (i.e., education and research) you are likely to find that something less wholesome is at work. Depending which side of the scalpel you were on, dissection has been both punishment and reward. Historically, murderers were dissected by law, and the unclaimed dead of poor houses and city hospitals, by default. Bodies were parceled out to the anatomy instructors with the best connections. Dissections were arranged not just for students, but for paying amphitheater audiences. Like Body Worlds and other contemporary exhibitions of corpses, dissections were as much about entertainment, profit and status as they were about education. Though MacDonald’s approach is studious, her book is never weighted down by its scholarship. Her arguments are ornamented by a richness of esoteric historical nuggets. In 1803, by way of example, a series of executed murderers was given to a Prof. Giovanni Aldini to investigate the possibility that electricity might be used to reanimate the dead. (Would they then be re-executed? “A complicated problem for the law,” MacDonald writes.) Aldini had a spirited flair for theatrics. At one point, he amazed and alarmed an audience by running electricity through the facial nerves of a pair of decapitated heads such that they appeared to be grimacing. “He had also made the hand of a headless man clutch a coin and throw it across a room.” MacDonald is that rare and precious commodity: a crack historian with a taste for the bizarre. Her discussion of female cadavers is a good example of both her research prowess and her discerning eye for the delectably lurid detail. The topic of women and the iniquities they have borne is a perennial — though not typically entertaining — topic for historians. But combine it with MacDonald’s sensibilities and a parallel topic of cadavers, and this is some of the most fascinating scholarly reading since Foucault tackled sex. We learn that female corpses were prized and uniquely necessary as teaching material because Regency physicians practiced gynecology and urology on women without looking. The insertion of a catheter was done blind, the doctor’s hands under the sheets and his gaze heading off in some polite middle distance. “Students,” MacDonald wryly observes, “needed to learn the comparative location of urethra and vagina by heart ... lest acts performed blind should go horribly wrong.” Even dead women got a dose of this surreal decorum: “A woman was normally opened differently, to leave a triangular flap to ‘fall over the parts of generation.’ ” The young and fetching female cadaver, however, was treated with the opposite of decorum. Mary Paterson, a prostitute who was killed and sold to an Edinburgh anatomy instructor, Robert Knox, was wrestled into a cheesecake pose and sketched prior to her dissection. Women’s cadavers were ogled and groped, and subjected to all the other depressingly predictable degradations perpetrated against poor women around the world and throughout history. Though occasionally grotesque, the details MacDonald serves up are never gratuitous. They are employed with obvious restraint, and always in service of her arguments. Much of “Human Remains” is set in Tasmania. (MacDonald is Australian.) The island was, for a time, the epicenter of a frenzy of global human specimen collecting. Skulls, in particular, were in demand by anthropologists known as polygenists. These men argued that different races were, in fact, immutably different species. Thus they believed it made no more sense to try to educate the “savage” than it did to educate a gorilla. One way the polygenists argued their ugly case was by collecting remains from the far-flung crannies of the Empire, measuring them every which way and then elucidating the racial differences in tomes like “Thesaurus Craniorum” and “Crania Britannica” and other reference volumes you’re not likely to find at your local library branch. Like other British colonies, Tasmania held a double appeal for the polygenists. There were “primitive” aboriginal skulls to be had, and there were medical men willing to dig them up and ship them to England. In return for his distasteful labors, the Tasmanian physician could keep a foot in the door of the far-off world of London’s prestigious science and medical societies. Corresponding and cooperating with British scientists eased the nagging inferiority complex of the colonial man of science. In tracking down the diary entries, letters and meeting reports of Tasmanian body snatchers, MacDonald has, as she describes it, dug up a different kind of human remains. In this case, exhumation serves a noble cause. She is to be commended for spotlighting the indignities done to men and women in the name of science.

109-> F.D.A. Adds $4 Million Fine for Red Cross Blood System
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8  The Food and Drug Administration announced a $4.2 million fine against the American Red Cross on Friday because it had repeatedly failed to handle and collect blood supplies properly. The penalty is the culmination of a 20-year effort by federal regulators to force the Red Cross to improve its oversight of its giant blood business. It comes on top of $5.7 million in fines the agency has imposed since 2003. In a news conference, drug agency officials said that the blood supply remained safe and that they had no evidence that contaminated or recalled blood sickened anyone. Instead, the problems “indicated a decreased assurance of safety,” said Dr. Jay Epstein, director of the Office of Blood Research and Review at the agency. In a statement, the Red Cross said its senior management took the fine “seriously” and was “committed to full compliance” with the rules. It said it would officially respond in 20 days. “The Red Cross remains dedicated to its mission and to the millions of Americans who rely on us to provide lifesaving blood and blood components each year,” the statement said. F.D.A. officials acknowledged in a news briefing Friday that fully complying with the agency’s regulations was “very difficult.” The associate commissioner for regulatory affairs, Margaret O’K. Glavin, said, “F.D.A. does not consider the current situation acceptable.” The violations include failing to ask the right donor-screening questions and failing to follow other procedures that led to blood recalls from 2003 to last year. The recalls could have been prevented if the Red Cross had followed its own procedures, the agency said. The Red Cross has struggled for years to put its multibillion-dollar blood business, by far its biggest money maker, into compliance with federal rules. It provides 45 percent of the nation’s blood supply. In 2003, the Red Cross, in an accord with the F.D.A. and a federal judge, promised to pay fines if it failed to follow proper blood procedures. The repeated violations of that agreement led to the nearly $10 million in fines. Such judicial consent agreements often take years to resolve, along with expensive outlays by manufacturers. In a case unsealed this year in Federal District Court in Washington, a former Red Cross quality-control manager accused the organization of releasing 607 pints of contaminated blood in New Jersey, even though Red Cross officials knew that the blood had been improperly collected and exposed to air.

110-> No Change at Interior (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re "Dirk Kempthorne Arrives" (editorial, June 13): You express hope that the new secretary of the interior, Dirk Kempthorne, will "resurrect his department's long tradition of responsible stewardship of the public lands," reversing the policies of Secretary Gale Norton  supported by Vice President Dick Cheney  that favored recreation and commercial exploitation over preservation of public lands. Realistically, Secretary Kempthorne would not have been appointed to this critical position if he did not share the anti-environment ideology of the Bush administration. Robert H.

111-> Kimberly-Clark Cites High Costs
Kimberly-Clark, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, said yesterday that third-quarter profit rose nearly 12 percent, but the results failed to impress Wall Street and its shares fell. Kimberly-Clark also said its full-year profit should come in toward the lower end of expectations as it continues to feel pressure from higher costs for materials like pulp. Such costs should be up more than $350 million this year, even though oil costs have fallen, the chairman and chief executive, Thomas J. Falk, said during a conference call. That is up from the company’s original estimate of $200 million and the forecast of $300 million to $350 million it gave in July. Kimberly-Clark is 15 months into a restructuring plan that includes cutting 6,000 jobs as it works to improve its diaper and health care businesses. Profit rose to $364.2 million, or 79 cents a share, from $325.3 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.

116-> A Penny-a-Share Loss at Liberty Media
Liberty Media, which owns television and Internet networks on four continents, has posted a first-quarter loss of $26 million after a profit a year earlier.

117-> Down-Home Playground for Outdoors Fun
BY the time the last brittle leaves drift to the forest floor in the Canaan Valley, most residents of the tiny West Virginia mountain towns of Thomas and Davis are obsessing over one thing: snow. The question, though, is not whether it will snow, or even how much — but rather when it will fall in earnest. By mid-November, a “spitting” of snow, as residents in the valley’s two towns call it, has usually settled in the cracks of sidewalks, only to melt off by noon. Then, late in the month, the snow-making machines crank up. At ski areas like White Grass in Davis, bonfires and Appalachian picking music heralded the opening of the season last weekend. So far, there have been light dustings of snow, and temperatures in the 20s at night. On average, 150 inches of snow, coming off the Great Lakes on northwesterly winds from Canada, blanket the region, which is less than 200 miles west of Washington. Most of those who don’t ski the steep slopes of the Canaan (pronounced kah-NANE) Valley put on cross-country skis or strap on snowshoes to move through the woods and to revel in spectacular views. A growing number of geocachers have also discovered the backwoods of the valley in Tucker County. Treasure hunters of sorts, they use G.P.S. coordinates posted on the Internet to find hidden caches. Because the region — which at an average elevation of 3,200 feet is one of the highest mountain valleys east of the Rockies — offers a range of outdoor activities and is convenient to much of the East Coast, it has attracted families like Dr. Jim Vaughan and his three adult sons, who originally considered buying a second home in Vail, Colo. Dr. Vaughan, a physician, and one son, Jim Jr., a jazz musician, live in Elmira, N.Y., and the other sons, Tim and P. J., live in Arlington, Va., working as salesmen for information technology firms. Three of them are downhill skiers, and P. J. is a geocacher. “From a number of perspectives, including accessibility and the different kinds of things we’re interested in, West Virginia makes a lot more sense for us,” Dr. Vaughan said, “especially since we plan to spend time here in all four seasons.” In the coldest months, outdoor pursuits include ice skating, snow tubing and sledding, in addition to skiing and snowshoeing. In spring, summer and fall (and sometimes in the snow), it’s mountain biking, spelunking and horseback riding. Kayaking, golfing and trout fishing are also popular. Winter or summer, the lack of ambient light in the sparsely populated region makes the valley ideal for stargazers. In all seasons, the Canaan Valley lures visitors who prefer to spend their time outdoors and, not surprisingly, the scene both day and night is decidedly casual. At the Purple Fiddle, a popular night spot in Thomas, an old coal-mining town, where the beer arrives in Mason jars and the country music is live, the unspoken dress code calls for jeans, casual tops and maybe a cowboy hat for the daring. At the Canaan Valley Resort and Conference Center, several miles south of Davis, Dr. Frederick Reichle, the owner, described the atmosphere in the lodge after a day on the slopes as family oriented and relaxed. “Don’t expect to see a $1,000 ski suit around here,” said Dr. Reichle, who is also a physician in Philadelphia. “That’s not what we’re about.” While the valley attracts mostly skiers and hikers, not everyone focuses solely on the outdoors. For John and Titi Ferguson, a draw is the active local arts community. A major feature is the 3,000-square-foot MountainMade Artist Gallery in Thomas, which features the works of more than 200 West Virginia artists, including handcrafted furniture and hand-blown glass. Former residents of Washington, Mr. and Mrs. Ferguson — he designs stained-glass art objects and she paints watercolors — bought their rambling three-bedroom ski lodge in Davis 17 years ago and have since retired there. “At first, we went to Canada for reliable snow conditions, but we couldn’t always get away for a long time, so we started coming to the Canaan Valley, which was more convenient,” said Mr. Ferguson, who formerly worked in medical publishing. “And then we discovered this other big plus about living here.” The Canaan Valley is expected to become a more accessible getaway from the Washington area in the next few years. When the oft-delayed Corridor H, a four-lane federal highway being built, is finally completed (still a few years away), the trip from northern Virginia, Maryland and Washington, where many owners of second homes in Tucker and Davis live full time, will be reduced to 2 hours and 45 minutes from the current three and a half hours. Corridor H, which begins in Wardensville, W.Va., will eventually end 110 miles farther west, in Elkins, after looping through Davis. But no matter how popular or accessible it becomes, there is a built-in limit on how densely populated the Canaan Valley can become. Sixty percent of the land is either state or federally owned and cannot be developed, said William Smith, executive director of the regional chamber of commerce, leaving about 5,000 acres of private land in the valley that either has been developed or can be developed. The valley includes the 10,215-acre federal Dolly Sods Wilderness Area, which has steep, rocky trails for expert hikers, and Canaan Mountain Backcountry, a plateau of about 13,532 acres that takes in Blackwater Falls State Park. And sections of the federally owned 919,000-acre Monongahela National Forest are in Tucker County. Those seeking of-the-moment restaurants and glitzy entertainment should look elsewhere. The “downtowns” of Davis and Thomas include no more than one or two main streets, with a smattering of stores and restaurants. Both towns bear a striking resemblance to a Western-movie set. By the way, there is one traffic light in all Tucker County, in Parsons, the county seat, west of Davis. Many people buying second homes in Davis and Thomas are from the Philadelphia area as well as from around Washington, according to Amy Fiorini, a sales agent for Timberline Resort Realty in Canaan Valley. They tend to be investors, lawyers or business executives. “My customers tend to be young, family-oriented, athletic families who want to play hard during the day,” she said, “and then spend their evenings by the fireplace with a bowl of popcorn and a Scrabble board.” Laura Reed, who owns Canaan Realty with her husband, Cary W. Reed, said the lack of municipal sewers in some places also limits intense development, forcing lots to be large enough to accommodate septic fields. For $335,000, home buyers can find a three-bedroom, three-bath ski house with a hot tub within five miles of a ski area. For $550,000, there are four-bedroom houses on two to five acres within walking distance of the slopes. Single-family houses line the trails at one of the area’s major downhill ski areas, Timberline Ski Resort. A 5,000-square-foot slope-side home on a quarter-acre lot sold for $975,000 this summer. Not all home buyers, however, opt to be near the lifts. David Platt, a stockbroker from Takoma Park, Md., and his wife, Michelle Smith, a social worker and therapist, bought a three-bedroom Victorian in Thomas last year for $90,000 and are spending another $100,000 to fix it up. Even though they both ski downhill, they wanted their getaway to be in a town. “We like being able to walk to the shops, even though there’s just a few of them,” Ms. Smith said. “Thomas is a very little town.” 577 people lived in Davis last year, according to an estimate by the federal census, and 411 in Thomas. In Tucker County (www.canaanvalley.org), which governs the Canaan Valley, an unincorporated area directly south of Davis, the population was estimated at 6,943. Davis covers 1.1 square miles, Thomas 0.6. Canaan Valley encompasses an estimated 32 square miles, most of which is federal or state park land, according to the Tucker County Convention and Visitors Bureau. Davis and Thomas are less than 200 miles west of Washington, and about 300 miles southwest of Philadelphia. Professionals from metropolitan Washington and Philadelphia.

118-> Troops Burn Houses in Nigerian Oil Port
PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Aug. 25 (AP) — Rampaging troops burned hundreds of homes and shops after gunmen kidnapped at least two foreigners and killed a soldier who was guarding them in Nigeria’s oil-rich southern delta region, witnesses said Friday. The military said the foreigners were seized Thursday during a raid in an impoverished settlement in Port Harcourt, the main oil center. The Italian Foreign Ministry reported that three men were missing in the area, including an Italian. All three were employees of Saipem, a subdivision of the Italian energy company Eni, the ministry said. Residents said troops flew into a rage after the death of their comrade and injury of another, setting fire to hundreds of homes and stores in a poor neighborhood. An Associated Press reporter saw at least three armed soldiers attacking civilians. The troops quickly drove away onlookers. Nigeria’s military, which has carried out reprisals against civilians in the past, denied responsibility.

120-> World Briefing | Europe: Russia: Gorbachev Buys Paper Critical Of Kremlin
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last Soviet leader, announced that he and a wealthy partner had bought a 49 percent share of one of Russia's prominent independent newspapers, Novaya Gazeta. The newspaper, a collective owned by its journalists and editors, has reported vigorously on politics, business and corruption, often challenging Kremlin policies. Published twice a week, it has a circulation of more than 700,000 nationwide. Mr. Gorbachev said he and his partner, Aleksandr Y. Lebedev, a billionaire who has campaigned against corruption, hoped to preserve the paper's independence and continue "to express a wide variety of opinions," Interfax reported. Mr. Gorbachev's announcement came after reports that Roman A. Abramovich, the country's richest man and an ally of President Vladimir V. Putin, was negotiating to purchase another prominent newspaper, Kommersant. STEVEN LEE MYERS (NYT)

121-> Olivia Robello Breitha, 90, Leprosy Exile, Is Dead
HONOLULU (AP)  Olivia Robello Breitha, who shared her story of exile as a leprosy patient on a remote peninsula of Molokai island and strove to dispel myths about the disease, died Sept. 28. She was 90. Her death was confirmed by Janice Okubo, a spokeswoman for the Hawaii Department of Health. Ms. Breitha was brought to the Kalaupapa settlement on Molokai in 1937, three years after she contracted Hansen’s disease, also known as leprosy. Her 1998 autobiography, “Olivia: My Life in Exile in Kalaupapa,” enlightened generations of readers about leprosy, a disfiguring condition that had been feared for centuries. More than 8,000 people were banished to Molokai after the disease became epidemic in the 1850’s. Forced quarantine did not end until 1969, after sulfone drugs were developed to control it. Ms. Breitha continued to live in Kalaupapa even after the quarantine was lifted. Her death brought the number of patients remaining there to 33.

122-> Medical Views of 9/11’s Dust Show Big Gaps
In 2004, Kenneth R. Feinberg, special master of the federal Sept. 11 Victim Compensation Fund, awarded $2.6 million to the family of a downtown office worker who died from a rare lung disease five months after fleeing from the dust cloud released when the twin towers fell. That decision made the worker, Felicia Dunn-Jones, a 42-year-old lawyer, the first official fatality of the dust, and one of only two deaths to be formally linked to the toxic air at ground zero. The New York City medical examiner’s office, however, has refused to put her on its official list of 9/11 victims, saying that by its standards there was insufficient medical evidence to link her death to the dust. Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s case shows how difficult it can be to prove a causal connection with any scientific certainty — and how even government agencies can disagree. With thousands of people now seeking compensation and treatment for dust exposure, the debate about the relationship between the toxic particles and disease will be a central issue in the flood of Sept. 11-related lawsuits. Health experts are starting to document the connections, but any firm conclusion is still years away. Most of the suits involve workers who spent weeks and months on the pile at ground zero and say the city and other agencies failed to protect them from the toxic dust. Others involve residents who say they were made sick by dust that settled in their homes. Mrs. Dunn-Jones was among those downtown office workers caught in the initial fallout. The question that arises in all these cases is straightforward: Can a link between the dust and disease be proved with scientific certainty? The answer is anything but simple. “Certainty is a word we always dance around,” said Joseph Graziano, associate dean for research at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. For him, searching for the cause of disease is like developing film. “At first you see a faint image of what the real picture is,” Dr. Graziano said, “and then, over time, you see it with much more clarity. In these relatively early times, the image is still faint.” It can take decades to approach any degree of certainty. For instance, only after years of observation did doctors agree that there was a strong link between asbestos and diseases like asbestosis and mesothelioma. In legal cases, “a reasonable degree of medical certainty” is considered the gold standard in making a causal connection. Last week, a federal judge cleared the way for thousands of workers’ lawsuits to go to trial. When the cases are heard, any proof that does not meet that legal standard is likely to be challenged. But outside the courtroom, scientists say, even a less rigorous link could be sufficient to warrant expanding the range of illnesses covered by treatment programs, and to serve as the basis for issuing cautions to people in high-risk groups. When the health effects are too new or the evidence is too vague for a strong link, lesser indicators like the concurrence of different studies have to be relied on. For example, nearly every ground zero study shows that workers and residents exposed to the dust in the hours after the collapse have suffered the worst health problems. The consistency in that data has helped doctors monitor and treat people since Sept. 11. And it may also help explain why Mrs. Dunn-Jones, a dynamic civil rights lawyer with the United States Department of Education, became so sick so quickly. As she was swallowed by a whirling dust plume filled with asbestos, benzene, dioxin and other hazards when the first tower fell, all she could do was cover her nose and mouth as she fled from her office one block north of the World Trade Center. It was night by the time she got home to Staten Island. “She was in a state of shock,” her husband, Joseph Jones, recalled. Her clothes were still dusty, but he didn’t pay much attention. “I was just so happy to see her,” he said. For the next few months, life returned to normal, until Mrs. Dunn-Jones developed a cough. In January 2002, the cough grew worse. On Feb. 10, she suddenly stopped breathing and died. Mr. Jones, 54, an assistant manager at a Brooklyn pharmacy, was stunned. Then, when he received the official death certificate months later, he was shocked to see an unfamiliar word — sarcoidosis. “Even though I was in the medical field, I had never heard of it,” he said. After reading several medical reports on sarcoidosis — including one by Dr. David J. Prezant, deputy chief medical officer of the New York Fire Department — Mr. Jones and his lawyer, Richard H. Bennett, wondered if Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s mysterious death could be linked to 9/11 dust because sarcoidosis, which produces microscopic lumps called granulomas, on vital organs, is often associated with exposure to environmental hazards. They took the case to Mr. Feinberg and the victim compensation fund, which gave $7 billion to the families of those killed or injured on 9/11. Mr. Feinberg initially expressed doubts about the claim and demanded to see definitive medical evidence linking Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s sarcoidosis to the dust. Dr. Prezant, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was one of two experts who testified at a hearing conducted by Mr. Feinberg. In the first four years after 9/11, he found 20 cases of sarcoidosis in the Fire Department, a rate of 80 per 100,000 in the first year (with treatment, all are now stable), compared with a national rate of fewer than 6 per 100,000, according to the American Thoracic Society. The other expert was Dr. Alan M. Fein, a clinical professor of medicine at the New York University School of Medicine. He, too, was skeptical at first, but he said he changed his mind after reviewing Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s medical record, including the autopsy report. “I’m comfortable saying her death was caused by exposure to the dust,” Dr. Fein said in an interview. In March 2004, Mr. Feinberg agreed, making Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s death the only dust-related fatality recognized by the fund. Only one other death has been formally linked to the dust: In April, a New Jersey coroner determined that James Zadroga, 34, a New York City police detective, had died of a disease similar to sarcoidosis, also caused by his exposure to ground zero dust. Mr. Jones welcomed the settlement from the victim compensation fund, and believes that his wife was a 9/11 victim as surely as if she had died in the towers. He sent Mr. Feinberg’s decision to the city’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles S. Hirsch, and asked that his wife be put on the official list so that her name could be read on Sept. 11. Dr. Hirsch refused, a spokeswoman said, because the available evidence did not prove the connection “with a reasonable degree of medical certainty”— the highest medical standard generally used in legal cases. Mr. Feinberg’s decision had been based on a different standard: a preponderance of medical evidence. That was proof enough for the Staten Island Memorial Commission, which has engraved Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s name on the bone-white memorial on the island’s north shore. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, who has fought to get medical care for 9/11 victims, said the contradictory conclusions about Mrs. Dunn-Jones’s death underscored the importance of deciding who has the final say on causal links. “They should be medical decisions, not political ones,” she said, suggesting that city officials may have a conflict of interest in making such determinations since the city is a defendant in the ground zero workers’ lawsuits. She has introduced a bill to reopen the federal compensation fund to people whose illnesses became known after the original eligibility period ended in 2003. In the effort to collect definitive data, Dr. John Howard, the federal government’s 9/11 health coordinator, recently circulated a draft set of autopsy protocols that directs pathologists to use a standard of proof that establishes both biological plausibility and unequivocal evidence of a causal connection to the dust. But doctors and elected officials have said those standards are so restrictive that almost no death could be linked to the dust for years to come. A spokesman for Dr. Howard said the guidelines were being refined. In another effort, the Mount Sinai Medical Center, which has screened thousands of ground zero workers, has begun a long-term study of the incidence of diseases to identify any rates that exceed national averages. “Right now we’re in the process of confirming every case of interstitial lung disease, every cancer, every sarcoidosis that has been reported to us by responders in their visits,” said Dr. Jeanne M. Stellman, director of the public health program at Columbia University, is leading the data collection project. “We are actively trying to determine whether Detective Zadroga and Mrs. Dunn-Jones are alone,” she said. “And we are trying to find a way to do this that is scientifically correct while also being responsive to the needs and fears of the communities involved.”

123-> Collaborator
Vichy France — the government that Marshal Philippe Pétain formed in the southern, unoccupied half of the country after the blitzkrieg of 1940 — sought “collaboration” with Germany as a middle way between total occupation and further war. In the end, France got both. Well-meaning citizens gave their active assent to Vichy, whether out of war-weariness, anti-Communism or disgust with the polarization of the 1930’s, when France, as Raymond Aron put it, “no longer existed except through the hatreds French people bore one another.” But by channeling the nation’s energies into a specious program of “national revolution,” Vichy made things worse. France was neutralized militarily at little cost to the Nazis. The interests of victor and vanquished converged. Vichy passed laws that made it easier to hunt down Jews and (eventually) résistants. Those whom Vichy empowered and enriched were often corrupt, traitorous or mentally disturbed. Louis Darquier (1897-1980), made commissioner of Jewish affairs as the first French Jews were being deported to death camps, was all of these. Few books have been written about Darquier in French. It is not obvious that he merits a book in English as long, obsessive and intimate as Carmen Callil’s “Bad Faith: A Forgotten History of Family, Fatherland and Vichy France.” But Callil, the Australian-born founder of the London publishing house Virago, has her reasons. In the early 1960’s, she attempted suicide and was sent to a Jungian psychiatrist, half-Australian herself, who would die at home in 1970 with a “poisonous” amount of alcohol and barbiturates in her body. Only later, and by chance, did Callil find out that Dr. Anne Darquier was the abandoned daughter of one of the monsters of French history. “Bad Faith” tries to weave together French anti-Semitism and fascism, Darquier’s relationship with his Tasmanian wife, Myrtle, and the way the past haunted — and maybe doomed — their daughter Anne. Darquier’s anonymous early years — indolent, embittered and bohemian — bear some resemblance to Hitler’s. The dissipated son of a provincial mayor, he dreamed of being an English gentleman. He styled himself “Baron Darquier de Pellepoix” and affected a monocle and cane. He was fired for embezzlement from his job with a grain merchant, and never stuck at real work thereafter. In London, he and Myrtle ran up vertiginous bar tabs, fled hotels without paying and dunned friends and relatives with letters that were by turns sycophantic and abusive. When Anne was born, they left her with a nursemaid in Oxfordshire. Myrtle had a reputation as a drunkard, although Callil produces little detail on her adult life beyond the hearsay of distant relatives. Nor is there any clue about the texture of her life with Darquier, of her opinions on much besides the British royal family or of Darquier’s reasons for being faithful to her (in his fashion) for decades. Instead, Callil makes do with speculation. “It is hard to see how the Australian Myrtle and the half-caste Anne fitted in with Louis Darquier’s constantly repeated ideas about ‘French roots,’ ” she writes. This is not a particularly successful part of the book. More dramatic is Callil’s account of France’s descent into the anti-Semitic maelstrom. When his credit ran out, in 1933, Darquier abandoned his English dreams (forever) and his wife (for a time), and moved into the Paris apartment of his older brother, a rightwing doctor. Here he underwent a ghastly rebirth. He stopped blaming his problems on stingy benefactors and chance, and started chalking them up to various official liars. He began to attend hard-line nationalist meetings. On Feb. 6, 1934, Darquier was shot during huge antigovernment demonstrations. It was his big break. Convalescing, he founded an Association of the Wounded and Victims of February 6, which kept him in drinking money and served as a springboard to a seat on the Paris city council. Until June 1936, Callil tells us, he had “made no anti-Semitic interventions of any kind.” But he soon embraced anti-Semitism with a convert’s madness, beating up Jews in cafes, referring to a colleague on the city council as a “dirty little Jew” and founding various groupuscules and a succession of vile newspapers. These weren’t particularly successful. The competing Popular Party of the charismatic ex-Communist Jacques Doriot, which was fascist but less obsessed with Jews, had 300,000 members at a time when Darquier’s clubs were struggling to win a thousand. But unlike most French anti-Semitism, Darquier’s was racist, as opposed to cultural or religious. That won the attention of the Nazi Weltdienst, a kind of anti-Semites’ international. Berlin provided generous under-the-table financing to his enterprises. Captured as a soldier when war came, Darquier was sprung by the German authorities almost immediately. Darquier was imposed on Vichy by German fiat. Until his appointment in 1942, the Vichy authorities had drawn sharp distinctions between Jews who were French citizens and those who were not. Even thereafter, the government energetically obstructed certain Nazi attempts to sort, stigmatize and ultimately deport French Jews. (No one wore the yellow star in Vichy, for instance.) Darquier didn’t care about such distinctions. He urged denationalizing those Jews, many of them refugees from Hitler, who had become citizens after 1927 — a way of vastly expanding the pool of “foreign Jews” who could be deported and murdered without formality. But French and German authorities alike froze Darquier out of the most monstrous deeds that occurred on his watch: the roundup of Parisian Jews at the Vélodrome d’Hiver in July 1942 and the workings of the concentration camp at Drancy, which served as a staging point to Auschwitz. This was for want of competence and discretion, not want of anti-Semitic convictions. For what Darquier really excelled at was graft, and Callil’s account of his machinations is superb. Darquier helped the Nazis penetrate the rigmarole and paperwork that Vichy had devised to keep the spoils of “Aryanization” — the looting of Jewish properties — out of German hands. He took kickbacks from old cronies in exchange for permission to take over Jewish businesses, and by 1943 more than half of the 12,000 administrators of Jewish property in the Paris area had criminal records. He also shook down Jews in exchange for certificates of non-Jewishness. At war’s end, Darquier escaped to Spain, possibly thanks to an incident of mistaken identity in which another monocle-wearing collaborator was lynched in his place. Thereafter Callil tells us, “he had only one subject: Jews, about whom he talked continuously, out loud, to his dying day.” In 1978, two years before his death in Spanish exile, he gave a spur to Holocaust deniers in France when he told L’Express that in Auschwitz, Jews were not gassed. “They used gas. Yes. That’s true. But they gassed the lice.” The consensus of historians is that Darquier was an aberration. While most of Vichy’s leaders were Catholic nationalists — willing, culpably enough, to countenance the old evil of exclusion, but not the new one of extermination — Darquier was more extreme, a Hitlerite. Callil wants to present this as a distinction without a difference. “He was the natural inheritor of generations of anti-republican attacks by the old order,” she writes, “of ideas borrowed from strangely revered French intellectuals such as Charles Maurras, of centuries of Catholic anti-Semitism and nationalist myth-making.” It is not to let Vichy off the hook to say that the consensus view, with its more elaborate distinctions, gives a fuller picture than Callil’s. There was indeed something un-French about Darquier. His racism was repugnant even to many of those who betrayed France, and his immorality was remarkable even by the rock-bottom standards of the time. The horror of Vichy is that it was a time when failings well short of Darquier’s were sufficient to send people down a darkening path of evil.

127-> A Little Echo, a Lot of Points
The first two national board-a-match team events at the Fall North American Championships in Hawaii ended on Monday. The Mitchell Open Board-a-Match Teams was won by George Jacobs and Ralph Katz of Hinsdale, Ill.; Bobby Levin and Zia Mahmood of New York; Michael Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; and Steve Weinstein of Andes, N.Y. They scored 17.5 points out of 26 in the final session to win by half a board over Steve Beatty of Mill Creek, Wash.; Drew Casen of Las Vegas; Jim Krekorian of New York; John Onstott of New Orleans; and Terje Aa and Joergen Molberg from Norway. Christal Henner-Welland, Roy Welland and Bjorn Fallenius of New York; Cezary Balicki and Adam Zmudzinski from Poland; and Antonio Sementa from Italy were third. The Marsha May Sternberg Women’s Board-a-Match Teams was won by the leaders after the first day, Lynn Baker of Austin, Tex.; Beth Palmer of Silver Spring, Md.; Lynn Deas of Schenectady, N.Y.; Irina Levitina of Hackensack, N.J.; Karen McCallum of Exeter, N.H.; and Kerri Sanborn of Stony Point, N.Y. Baker, Deas and Palmer were defending the title. Three boards behind, Jill Levin of New York; Jill Meyers of Santa Monica, Calif.; Hansa Narasimhan of Los Altos Hills, Calif.; Rozanne Pollack of Basking Ridge, N.J.; Debbie Rosenberg of New Rochelle, N.Y.; and JoAnna Stansby of Castro Valley, Calif., finished second. Pamela Granovetter of Cincinnati; Linda Lewis of Sioux Falls, S.D.; Sylvia Moss and Judi Radin of New York; Shawn Quinn of Richmond, Tex.; and Pam Wittes of Venice, Calif., were third. The winners of the Nail Life Master Open Pairs on Saturday were Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein of Sarasota, Fla. They scored very well on the diagramed deal. Weinstein (West) bravely used the Unusual No-Trump convention, overcalling two no-trump to promise at least 5-5 in the minors. North’s three-diamond cue-bid showed at least a game-invitational limit raise in spades. North’s jump to five spades asked his partner to bid six with a first- or second-round control in clubs. (North took South’s four-heart rebid as a slam-try. But South was showing his second suit, wanting North to judge whether to double or bid higher should the opponents go to five clubs. South’s interpretation is preferable. In competitive auctions slam bidding must take a back seat.) West opened with the club king. It is normal these days to lead ace from ace-king. But against contracts of five clubs or higher, when the lead of an unsupported ace is not unlikely, starting with the king is sensible. Then, third hand should give a count signal, which Garner did here. West, feeling confident that his partner would not have bid four clubs with only three low cards in the suit, led the club eight at Trick 2. East, on winning with his queen, had no trouble in finding the heart return, which West ruffed with his spade eight. West exited with the club ace. Declarer ruffed and led a trump, West playing his five. West’s echo (high-low) in spades showed that he began with at least three trumps. So East won with his spade ace and knew that he could give his partner a second heart ruff to defeat the contract by three tricks. Plus 150 was worth 62 match points out of 64, and Garner and Weinstein won by only 13 match points.

128-> DINING/ROSLYN HEIGHTS; A Flick of a Disk Starts a Parade of Meat
CHURRASCARIA RIODIZIO is a carnivore's delight, an all-you-can-eat mecca for those who love red meat. The Roslyn Heights newcomer, which opened in June, labels itself a Brazilian steakhouse (churrascaria means steakhouse), but that doesn't tell the whole story. Here customers do not sit down and order, say, a rib-eye or a filet mignon; instead they feast on a fixed-price meal ($38.95 at dinner, $25.95 at lunch, children $15.95 anytime). This consists of a huge appetizer bar of salads and seafood followed by as much meat as one cares to eat, brought to the table on swords, with portions majestically sliced for each person. Floor managers enthusiastically explain the drill: Go to the appetizer bar for salads, grilled vegetables and seafood. When you are finished with the openers, turn over the coaster-like disk at your place setting so the green side shows. Fresh plates then appear, along with a basket of rolls and a half-dozen side dishes. The green circle also sets in motion the parade of meats, which keep coming until you turn the disk to the red side. Those personable floor managers typified the friendly staff. The valet who parked our car wished us a good meal; the hostess greeted us with smiles. At the buffet table, a young woman handed us plates and stood ready to explain any unfamiliar dishes. Churrascaria Riodizio has the same owners (João De Matos, Luis Gomes and Alberico Campana) as two popular restaurants in Manhattan with the same format: Churrascaria Plataforma in the theater district and Churrascaria Riodizio TriBeCa. Their experience shows in the smooth running of the new Roslyn spot. Customers are greeted by a wavy-patterned sidewalk inspired by the sidewalks of Copacabana Beach. Just inside the door is the restaurant's most attractive feature: a seven-foot-high glass wine cellar. To its right is the bar, with a soaring, wood-beamed ceiling and a brick fireplace. To the left of the wine cellar is a small dining room, also beamed, with another fireplace. A succession of rooms flows from here; their focal point is the huge salad bar, crowned with an arrangement of tropical flowers and palm fronds. A large picture window provides views of the kitchen, with rotisseries of turning meats. The rest of the décor runs to paintings of cattle and cowboys. There is more to a meal, of course, than attractive surroundings, pleasant staff and dramatic service. Food is still the No. 1 element, and at Riodizio, it is mixed. There are enough choices to satisfy but also a lot of misses. Some of the buffet salads were underseasoned, the potato salad and the marinated green beans among them. Other offerings were delightful, especially the flaky cod with mustard sauce, the whitefish in wine sauce and the grilled vegetables. A big bowl of cold shrimp with cocktail sauce on the side was the hit of the appetizer bar one night. Among the side dishes delivered to the table, a basket of cheese bread (pão de queijo) was irresistible. These tiny morsels, smaller than golf balls, were served piping hot with crisp exteriors and chewy centers. Everyone at my table loved them. Most of the sides were standard fare: rice, mashed potatoes, fried plantains, broccoli. A few were more interesting: finely chopped onion and peppers in a vinaigrette, and a plate of cassava flour laced with bacon and egg, which was a bit dry but came to life when mixed with the vinaigrette (our waiter also suggested mixing in some black beans, which he brought from the kitchen). The vinaigrette also came in handy in moistening a number of the meats, which sorely needed it at times. Don't skip any meat offered, because you never know: Some, like the pork tenderloin with Parmesan crust, were tough and dry one night, succulent another. The flank steak, sliced beef ribs and top sirloin all made uneven showings, too. The tender prime rib, barbecued ribs, pork sausages, turkey wrapped in bacon and roast suckling pig were good on both my visits. Overcooked salmon, tough leg of lamb and chewy skirt steak were all two-time losers. Desserts are not included in the set price, and they were as inconsistent as the meats. Tough pastry undermined a guava tart, and a dense, delicious chocolate mousse was diminished by a swirl of sweet, sticky topping that looked like whipped cream but didn't taste like it. Cheesecakes were average. The best dessert sampled was a silken flan with caramel sauce.

129-> Buffalo: Cleanup Estimated to Cost $95 Million
State officials yesterday estimated the cleanup cost of a snowstorm in western New York at $95 million, and cautioned that the number could grow. State and federal inspectors spent part of last week assessing the damage as part of an application for federal aid. The snowstorm, which occurred Oct. 12 and 13, deposited about two feet of snow on the area, causing widespread power failures.

130-> Original Intent
GEORGE WASHINGTON was not the most engaging of men. Thomas Jefferson thought he had "neither copiousness of ideas nor fluency of words." The first president "never seemed to have very much to say," Gordon S. Wood notes in his illuminating new book, "Revolutionary Characters." (I should note here that Wood's review of my latest book appeared in The New York Review of Books after I had written this review.) Washington's diary of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 is notable more for its records of the teas he took than for the great questions under debate. Painfully self-conscious and obsessed — the word is not too strong — with his image and how history would view him, he took care to correct old letters. His power over other men was rooted in his apparent humility — he gave up authority when other mortals would have lunged for it, thus making himself all the more attractive — and in his essential good-heartedness. "If he was not really one of the best-intentioned men in the world," Abigail Adams said, "he might be a very dangerous one." What made this comparatively dull Virginian the father of a nation, then, was his character, but the 18th century did not think of character in quite the way we do now. In our time, conversations about character among politicians are often really about an individual's personality — his vices and his virtues but, truth be told, mostly his vices. As Wood, a leading historian of the American Revolution, explains, character in the founding era was about more than personal habits or predilections. For men like Washington, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Madison and Hamilton, Wood writes, the "idea of character was the outer life, the public person trying to show the world that he was living up to the values and duties that the best of the culture imposed on him." And for the founders — many of them the first in their families to be educated and to be considered gentlemen — the ideal cultural values were those of ancient Rome. In a series of sketches of critical figures, from Washington to Thomas Paine to Aaron Burr, Wood charts how important it was in the founders' world not only that they be seen as powerful but that their power be understood to have come to them by merit: "They sought, often unsuccessfully but always sincerely, to play a part, to be what Jefferson called natural aristocrats — aristocrats who measured their status not by birth or family that hereditary aristocrats from time immemorial had valued but by enlightened values and benevolent behavior." Character for the founders was the most public of matters. "To have honor across space and time was to have fame," Wood writes, "and fame was what the founders were after." It was this definition of character that, in the words of Wood's subtitle, "made the founders different." Fame resulted when they acted not as office seekers but as selfless statesmen, summoned from rural splendor to fight in the arena for a time, then retire to their farms — Mount Vernon, Monticello, Montpelier — for the contemplation of philosophy and the cultivation of the land and of virtue. (The contradiction between profiting from slave labor at home while advancing the ideals of human liberty in Philadelphia, New York and Washington did prick some of their consciences — but it was just a prick.) The journey home from the action was a crucial element in the founders' vision of themselves. According to Wood, "they did not conceive of politics as a profession and of officeholding as a career as politicians do today." Yet some of the founders loved the fray, and their public selves speak to us still, across the centuries. "Contention is as much a part of their legacy as their principles," Richard Brookhiser writes in his diverting "What Would the Founders Do?" — an entertaining exercise in posing present-day problems as questions, and then attempting to answer them. Would the founders fight pre-emptive wars? What would the founders do about weapons of mass destruction? Would the founders be in favor of outsourcing? That sound you hear in the background is the groaning of professional historians. But Brookhiser has written an enjoyable and informative book. Brookhiser, an editor at National Review, notes that many Americans long to apply the lessons of history to the conundrums of the moment: "Over the past decade, I have given hundreds of talks about the founding fathers, on radio and TV, and to live audiences. Every time there is an opportunity for Q. and A., there is at least one question of the form, 'What would Founder X think about current event, or living person, Y?' No subject is too trivial, no problem too difficult." Though no historical moment is exactly parallel to another, a judicious examination of what our ancestors confronted and how they handled the challenges of their time can do us no harm, and might just help us, as we make our way through what George Eliot called the "dim lights and tangled circumstance" of the world. To say the past cannot productively speak to the present, at least in part, amounts to unilateral disarmament in the unending war for the future. The hunger for greater men and greater days links these books. Wood's "Revolutionary Characters" is the more important work, but for Brookhiser the founders are more human and more accessible. "They lived and died — some of them (for example, Hamilton) quite literally — by politics," Brookhiser writes. "Some of their own political innovations, such as partisanship, shocked them, but the game of politics always drew them in, for it was the means, dirty or inspiring, by which they secured liberty, prosperity, strength and every other public good." By contrast, there is more than a little nostalgic finality in Wood's tone. "If we want to know why we can never again replicate the extraordinary generation of the founders, there is a simple answer: the growth of what we today presumably value most about American society and culture, egalitarian democracy," he explains. "In the early 19th century the voices of ordinary people, at least ordinary white people, began to be heard as never before in history, and they soon overwhelmed the high-minded desires and aims of the revolutionary leaders who had brought them into being." Wood's book led me to a slightly different conclusion, however: that it would be too hasty to rule out the possibility America may once again produce new generations of similarly transformative leaders. This thought is not sentimental. It is based on Wood's excellent discussion of how the founders defined character. The appetites that drove them — the hunger for fame, glory, honor and the adulation of countless souls yet unborn — are perennial ones. The founders were not intrinsically more virtuous than those who came before or after them. What they managed brilliantly was to marshal ambition in the service of benevolence. That was the special character of the founding era: the application of the insight that one could become great by doing good. Having noble ancestors who were all too human — hypocritical, prideful, lustful, greedy, preening — is heartening, not discouraging, for the fact that such men could master their failings to build, not to destroy, should give us hope that we might be able to do the same. It has happened before: at critical moments in America's past, leaders have emerged like Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan — each of whom was flawed, but each of whom rose to the occasion, in part because they were consciously playing a part in a larger drama, giving of themselves while yearning to shine in history's light. They were, in other words, emulating to some degree the character of the founders. Our task, as always, is to overcome our worst instincts. For all his taciturnity and fussiness, his deadening silences and endless teas, Washington understood much. "The motives which predominate most human affairs," he once said, "are self-love and self-interest." True enough — but he also said this: "The great Governor of the Universe has led us too long and too far on the road to happiness and glory to forsake us in the midst of it."

131-> On the Coast or in the Backwoods, Fault Lines of the Heart
In the book business, short-story collections by emerging writers are a tough sell. Among the heavyweight publishers these books are rarely bought, and when they are, the deal includes a novel in the not-too-distant future. As a result debut collections by only a handful of new writers make their way to a wider reading public each year. Fortunately university presses pick up the publishing slack and distribute collections by emerging writers, often in the form of prestigious awards. Most notable among these are the Iowa Short Fiction Award and the John Simmons Short Fiction Award, both given by the University of Iowa Press and selected through the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. This year’s winners were chosen by the short-story author George Saunders. They are “Permanent Visitors” by Kevin Moffett and “Things Kept, Things Left Behind” by Jim Tomlinson. In the tradition of many classic story collections — from the Deep South back roads of Flannery O’Connor’s short masterpieces to the sleepy towns of Huron County, Ontario, found in Alice Munro’s exquisite work — both of these books are deeply rooted in a sense of place. In “Permanent Visitors” Mr. Moffett assembles his crew of marginalized characters amid the condo-lined coast in and near Daytona, Fla., far removed from the spring-break set of Coppertone-slathered tourists. Mr. Tomlinson’s collection sheds its rust-filtered light on a cast of hardscrabble, hard-drinking folks, many of whom live in the small town of Spivey, Ky. These books also represent distinct stylistic voices from two generations (Mr. Moffett is 34, Mr. Tomlinson 65), providing readers with a window into Mr. Saunders’s wide-ranging fictional aesthetic. In his Floridian collection of nine stories Mr. Moffett demonstrates his true talent for portraying characters of small ambition who hope to eke out a little connection with their fellow humanity. His gift for telling these on-the-fringe fictions transcends the standard story, especially when he writes about characters experiencing varying gradations of grief. For example in “The Fortune Teller,” the title character rides her bike by the home of her “last friend,” M. E. Chaddock, who recently died. An open-house sign is posted on the lawn, so she walks in among a clutch of prospective buyers. Mr. Moffett writes: “Alone on the porch, the fortune teller tried to sew up her grief, for she could feel her eyes beginning to burn as she looked out at the swimming pool, at a boy who straddled the diving board, dipping his toes into the green water. The pool of her last friend, the last of the outlasted.” The fortune teller retreats into the house, steals a miniature crystal bell from her friend’s collection, and quietly leaves. “The Volunteer’s Friend” is told from the perspective of an older man, Tate, who lost his wife to cancer two years earlier and now has been diagnosed with the disease. Living alone in a condo amid his wife’s possessions ( a wig “pinned to a faceless Styrofoam head”), Tate takes up the hospital’s offer for a volunteer, Callie, to visit his home. Their unlikely connection is tender at times, but sadly, it falters. In two stories — “Ursa, on Zoo Property and Off” and “The Newcomer” — Mr. Moffett sidesteps his melancholy tone and embraces the off-the-wall surrealism commonly found in Mr. Saunders ’s dazzling stories. “Ursa” features an odd alliance of office workers who agree to liberate animals from the downtown zoo. After a day of unexpected adventures, “everyone seemed to have totally forgotten about our initial reason for going,” and the narrator manages to convince a bear-suit-clad waitress, Ursa, to return home with him. In “The Newcomer” Mr. Moffett tells of the parallel — and later intersecting — adventures of two recent immigrants, Spiros and Ekaterina, who enroll in the Institute for Advanced American Furtherance. In both stories the author delivers a handful of absurd, laugh-out-loud moments. Now travel a short distance north on Interstate 75, and a reader arrives at the entirely different literary terrain depicted in Mr. Tomlinson’s “Things Kept, Things Left Behind.” Like the landscape, Mr. Tomlinson’s characters in these 11 stories have harder edges than Mr. Moffett’s. Their emotions aren’t bleached by the Florida sun; instead they are soaked in beer and obscured by the smoky haze of cigarettes. Potential eruptions of physical violence are palpable on the page, often leaving the reader uncomfortable. And as in other backwoods towns, many of the characters are related. The collection’s title refers to a pairing of stories that follow LeAnn McCray and her dead-end affair with a former flame, Dexter Chalk, and represent some of Mr. Tomlinson’s strongest writing, particularly his ear for regional, familial banter. In “Things Kept,” LeAnn is summoned home by her sister, Cass, because their headstrong mother has fallen behind on property taxes. When the mother sees LeAnn for the first time, Mr. Tomlinson writes: “The old woman levered herself to her feet and surrounded LeAnn in a hug that smelled like pie spice. ‘Let me look at you, child.’ LeAnn stepped back and twirled a girlish pirouette. ‘Why, look at them bones. You been ailing, LeAnn Marie?’ ‘Been dieting, Mama. I weigh exactly what I should.’ ” In “Things Left Behind” Dexter tries to reconcile his newfound sobriety and his recent tryst with LeAnn: “Unfaithful. How odd, that word. Odd, because he faith now, faith for the first time in years, faith in himself, faith in a future beyond the next drink.” Eventually the story follows LeAnn to her home in Dayton, Ohio, and painfully captures how her unspoken affair splinters her family further apart. Though Mr. Tomlinson’s stories don’t exhibit the same literary finesse as Mr. Moffett’s, he certainly does a first-rate job of bringing his characters to life. He also skillfully packs suspenseful plot turns into these economical stories. For example, in “The Accomplished Son,” Toby Polk, an Army specialist on leave from Iraq because his wife is pregnant, confronts the man who paralyzed his father in an accident more than a decade earlier. It’s not clear until the story’s last sentence if Toby will carry out his own personal mission. With both of these collections a reader will look forward to first novels by Mr. Moffett and Mr. Tomlinson, or if an unusual alignment of the publishing gods occurs, another collection of well-made stories.

134-> OPENERS: SUITS; REALLY GROSS RECEIPTS
Six Flags' chief executive, Mark S. Shapiro, who is already contending with declining attendance and revenue at the company's amusement parks, has a new problem: protests by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals against a promotional stunt that has customers eating live cockroaches. As part of a Halloween celebration, all but one of Six Flags' parks offer customers a chance to swallow a live Madagascar hissing cockroach. Why would anyone, er, bite at the offer? To go directly to the front of the line for popular rides. It's not as icky as it sounds, said Carol Stratford, a Six Flags spokeswoman. The cockroaches, Ms. Stratford said, are farm-raised in the United States, and are low in fat and high in protein. It's been a hit, she added. The three biggest Six Flags parks -- in Springfield, Mass.; Atlanta; and Jackson, N.J. -- ran out of roaches last weekend, she said, having served up 80 critters each. Ms. Stratford said PETA must understand that cockroach crunching is optional. Except, perhaps, for parents driven mad by waiting in lines with antsy children. ELIZABETH OLSON

141-> COMPOSER PRODIGIES; To the Defense of Korngold
To the Editor: A Classical Recordings review [Aug. 27] and a letter to the editor about the teenage composer Jay Greenberg [Aug. 20] both took potshots at an earlier musical prodigy, Erich Wolfgang Korngold. The reviewer Steve Smith even called Korngold "a born genius who struggled long and hard to achieve mediocrity." This is the hoary old critical line on Korngold, whose early triumphs were interrupted by Hitler and Hollywood, and who found himself out of favor in the postwar years. But Mr. Greenberg or any young composer could do a lot worse than to aspire to be another Korngold, whose works, despite the continued carping of certain critics, are now widely praised, performed and recorded around the world.

142-> How to Get the Best
IT is one thing to pay a higher than normal price for a drink on the Champs Élysées, but paying more than you need to exchange currency is a real waste of money. For most travelers, the place to start is with an A.T.M. or a bank, where you are most likely to get the best rate. "We recommend that people use their debit or A.T.M. cards to withdraw money from an A.T.M. as soon as they arrive," said Tom Meyers, editor of www.eurocheapo.com, an Internet guide to inexpensive hotels. "The rates from European banks are almost always lower than going to commercial exchange counters." For example, Thomas Cook on Fleet Street in London recently offered an exchange rate of 2.03 percent for U.S. dollars converted to British pounds with no service charge, yielding £49.26 for $100. The same day, NatWest quoted a rate of 1.9551 percent with no commission, yielding £51.15 for $100, while HSBC quoted a rate of 1.9766 percent with 2 percent commission, yielding £49.58 for $100. One thing to be aware of when withdrawing money from an A.T.M. is that it is difficult to know in advance what the specific exchange rate will be. In effect, you have to wait for the charge to go through or for the withdrawal to be debited. In addition, some A.T.M.'s may have fees charged by both the local bank and by your own bank or credit card company, although some United States banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, have relationships with foreign banks and will waive fees at A.T.M.'s belonging to those banks. But, if you use your Citibank card to withdraw money from your checking account at a foreign Citibank A.T.M., there's still a foreign exchange fee of 1 percent of the transaction in dollars. Even those fees are less than the fees you'd pay using an A.T.M. to withdraw money from your credit card credit line, since these transactions are cash advances and subject to more fees. For example, for a cash advance from a foreign A.T.M. with a Chase Amazon.com credit card, Chase charges a 3 percent cash advance fee (minimum $10) on top of a 3 percent foreign currency transaction fee, along with 23.99 percent variable interest rate accrued daily. As for exchanging money at a hotel? Mr. Meyers said he tells people to avoid it: "You'll get the highest transaction fees and the worst exchange rates." For purchasing goods or services, credit cards frequently offer the best rates, although it can be hard to determine what they are. "The process is not transparent," said Tim Jarrell, publisher of Fodors Travel Publications. "Most people don't know until they get their credit card bill how much they'll be charged for foreign purchases." For example, while MasterCard and Visa charge a 1 percent fee for processing foreign purchases, banks may (and often do) charge an additional 1 or 2 percent. Save money by picking a credit card with the most favorable fees for international purchases. For example, American Express and Juniper Bank charge just 2 percent, and Capital One is especially traveler-friendly, with no additional surcharge, not even the 1 percent charged by MasterCard and Visa. With hard currency exchanges, some on-the-fly research can be particularly valuable. "If you're changing a lot of money, check out rates at the currency exchange centers and the banks," said Colm Hanratty, editor of hostelworld.com. "Ask them what their exchange rate is and how much their commissions are. It's a 60-second question that could save you $5 to $10 each time." You typically want to do as few exchanges as possible. "Each exchange involves processing, servicing and/or administrative fees; some exchange locations even give breaks on larger transactions," said John Brancato, managing partner of V. Puente Currency Services, an operator of a Travelex Worldwide exchange service at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. According to Mr. Brancato, Travelex's currency exchange provides a lower service fee for larger transactions — for a $100 exchange the service fee is 5.5 percent while it is generally about 1.5 percent for transactions over $500. Some exchanges may even offer promotions such as a "buy back" program that allows consumers to sell their leftover currency back to the company at a favorable rate, in some cases waiving the service fees. For example, upon returning from a trip, for a $7.50 fee, a customer can exchange up to the amount of the original purchase without a service fee, guaranteed at the same rate. The return transaction has to take place at the same location as the first. Traveler's checks and the new prepaid traveler's check cards are another option. The American Express Travelers Cheque Card ($14.95 issuance fee) is a reloadable, prepaid card that is not linked to your bank account and can be replaced if lost or stolen. The card requires an initial minimum deposit of $300 and sets a maximum balance of $2,750; the funds can be purchased in dollars, euros or pounds. A.T.M. withdrawals using the card are a relatively low $2.50, excluding individual banks' fees. However, traveler's checks and plastic may not be the solution when traveling to remote locations. WHEN traveling in China, once you leave the large cities, you could have a very difficult if not impossible time exchanging traveler's checks for local currency. In some cases, if you have the wrong types of traveler's checks, merchants may think they're fake and not cash them," said Seth Hishmeh, co-founder of USAS Technologies, a multinational IT consulting firm, and a frequent traveler. "Additionally, when traveling in some countries such as China, the credit card systems outside of major cities frequently do not accept Visa, Amex and other standard cards used in the U.S." Make sure you check ahead to learn what bank cards or traveler's checks will be accepted at your destination, and have a backup plan. "The main thing is to realize that different things work better in different places," said Edward Hasbrouck, author of "The Practical Nomad: How to Travel Around the World." "That's why you should take money in a mix of forms — an A.T.M. card, a credit card, some traveler's checks, some large-denomination bills like $100 for changing, some small-denominations (U.S. $1 through U.S. $20 bills for small purchases directly in dollars), rather than counting on any one method to work everywhere," he said. Of course, cash is still king in many places. "You may be able to get discounts by paying in local currency," Mr. Hishmeh said. "For example, when traveling in India you can often save money by paying in their local currency and getting the local rate; paying in U.S. dollars or traveler's checks will cause you to pay much more."

143-> Childproof
When Christopher Caldwell characterizes "perfectly healthy people annoyed by the din of kickball," he minimizes a growing problem (Aug. 13). The trend toward overindulgent, permissive parenting (as well as neglectful parenting, owing to societal and workplace failures to provide adequate child-care options to working parents) is leading to a generation of young people who are dangerously apathetic to the rest of the world around them. Privileged kids roam the streets with credit cards and cellphones. It's not just playful noise but also a disregard for others. It's small wonder many adults are instinctually retreating: if there are a few kid-free bastions left these days, bring 'em on. Irene Barnard San Francisco Caldwell quotes a typical resident of a child-free community: "When you get to be a certain age, you want to be in a community where people around you are the same age you are." While that is true, there may be deeper reasons. As a 12-year-old, I think children constantly remind the elderly of their mortality. Madeline Ochi Granite Bay, Calif.

147-> Pulling Us Back to the Campfire
PEOPLE swap stories every day, over fences, cubicle walls and dinner tables. But they rarely do it around a campfire anymore. Jimmy Neil Smith, founder and president of the International Storytelling Center and the man often credited for a national storytelling renaissance, wants to bring back the place where cultures gathered, before radio, television and even the printing press, to share tales and anecdotes. "We don't have that central fire like we did once," Mr. Smith said. "We have everything that pulls us away from the simple telling of a told story. So what we're trying to do is bring people once again around the campfire." Every culture in the world has a tradition of storytelling, Mr. Smith said. "Whether you're a cowboy in the South, a cabby in New York, a fisherman in the Northwest or a farmer in North Carolina, we all have our stories. Some may have deeper traditional roots, but the stories are just swirling around us." Thirty-four years ago, in Jonesborough, Tenn., Mr. Smith was moved by a storyteller on a local radio station and decided to have a festival. Sixty people came, sitting on hay bales in front of a farm wagon that served as the stage. The event grew into the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, in eastern Tennessee. Last year, 10,000 people attended and sat under six circus tents. This year's festival will be Oct. 6 to 8. But anyone curious about storytelling can find a festival sooner, and probably close to home. THE Lehigh Valley Storytelling Festival starts on June 23 in Bethlehem, Pa., the high point of the calendar for the Lehigh Valley Storytelling Guild. The guild's other events include a series for children, a celebration of women, a scary story event near Halloween and story swaps every month. The festival in June will include a workshop called "Getting Folks to Lie Well." In South Texas, 8,500 people descend upon George West, population 2,500, in November for the George West Storyfest. Becky Allen, the executive director, said cowboys, ranchers and their descendants share accounts of life on the trail and cowboy poetry. "It takes you back in time," she said. "You go back to the front porch to sitting and listening to grandparents and great-grandparents." New York City, despite its lack of front porches and campfires, has the Storytelling Center, founded in 1982, which offers monthly and special storytelling events of all kinds. On June 14, its annual dessert story party will combine stories, on any theme, and sweets. One member of the center who will perform, Peninnah Schram, is partial to stories from the Jewish folklore tradition and tales about tricksters, folklore's mischievous antiheroes. But she never really knows what story she will tell. "You never know what it is that pulls you to a certain story," she said. "Something happens or somebody says something and suddenly I open my mouth and out comes a story that I need to tell or needs to be told." American Indians have been telling stories on Turtle Island, a common Indian name for North America, for thousands of years. Wisdom of the Elders in Portland, Ore., which promotes Indian cultural preservation and sponsors the Turtle Island Storytellers Network, held its first Northwest Indian Storytelling Festival in January this year and plans to make it an annual event. Rose High Bear, executive director of Wisdom of the Elders, called storytelling the backbone of education and history, in which knowledge is passed orally from generation to generation. "It is taken for granted that our elders are our wisdom keepers and living museums," she said. Salmon, thunderbird and raven stories are big, as are legends about whales and hunting. Coyote stories teach children how not to behave. The aim is to "encourage, preserve and strengthen traditional storytelling and oral cutural arts among tribes in Oregon, Washington and Idaho," Ms. High Bear said. "Our stories are like medicine to us." What: Storytelling Center Dessert Party, 212-613-3117; www.storytelling-nyc.org. Admission $15.

148-> I.B.M. Sues Amazon.com Over Patents
I.B.M., the holder of the largest patent storehouse in corporate America, often finds itself defending itself against patent claims from aggressive plaintiffs, seeking a payout. But I.B.M. became the aggressor yesterday when it filed two lawsuits against Amazon.com, contending that the company has built its big online retail business on technology developed by I.B.M. The suits, filed in two federal courts in Texas, seek unspecified damages, but I.B.M. says that Amazon’s infringement is broad, suggesting the potential for a sizable judgment or settlement. An I.B.M. spokesman said the figure could run to hundreds of millions of dollars. “These patents are core to modern electronic commerce,” said John E. Kelly III, senior vice president for technology and intellectual property at I.B.M. “Most if not all of Amazon’s business is built on top of this technology.” Mr. Kelly said that I.B.M. had licensed the technology covered in the lawsuits to many Internet companies, but he said he would not identify them because the transactions were private business deals. I.B.M. first sought compensation from Amazon for its patented technology in 2002 and made repeated efforts to reach an agreement without success, Mr. Kelly said. Patty Smith, a spokeswoman for Amazon, said the company had not yet seen the I.B.M. lawsuits and would not comment. Amazon has itself forcefully asserted its ownership claims in the field of electronic commerce in the past. Most notably, Amazon patented its one-click checkout method in 1999. The United States Patent and Trademark Office is reconsidering that patent, responding to widespread criticism that it is overly broad. I.B.M. filed its suits in two federal courts in the Eastern District of Texas, in Tyler and Lufkin. The Eastern District courts there are known for handling patent suits quickly and for often awarding large settlements to plaintiffs, said Gregory P. Silberman, a patent lawyer at the firm of Kaye Scholer. The five patents that are the subject of the lawsuits cover software-based techniques for storing, retrieving and displaying information on Internet commerce Web sites, for making buying recommendations, and for handling online transactions. I.B.M. filed for the five patents from 1988 to 1992, based on research that sometimes stretched back for years. Four of the five patents were issued from 1994 to 1998. A fifth patent, for displaying online advertising, was issued this year. Recently, I.B.M. has been a strong supporter of patent reform, intended to make it more difficult to get junk patents, which tend to make sweeping and vague claims but do not represent real technical innovation. And I.B.M. has been critical of some business-method patents as being broad descriptions of ideas, without technical specifics. The business-method patents in the lawsuits against Amazon reflected fundamental technical advances, Mr. Kelly, the I.B.M. senior vice president, asserted, adding that I.B.M. researchers began working on them in the 1980’s when the potential for online commerce was just becoming apparent. “We are not changing our policy,” Mr. Kelly said. “Doing this is very rare for us.” In most business-method patent lawsuits, the plaintiffs are individuals or small companies, often called patent trolls, whose only assets are a patent portfolio. In the current case, the plaintiff — I.B.M. — is as big as they come. “Business-method cases usually involve little guys holding up the big guys,” said Josh Lerner, a professor at the Harvard Business School. “This sort of breaks the pattern.”

149-> A Journalist’s Death (1 Letter)
To the Editor: While reading “Iraq’s Endangered Journalists,” by Ali Fadhil (Op-Ed, Sept. 6), I was shocked by his claim that “foreign reporters ... have the advantage of being considered untouchable by the Iraqi police and security forces.” Might I remind Mr. Fadhil that on Aug. 2, 2005, my husband, Steven Vincent, an American journalist living in and writing from Basra, was kidnapped and killed by five men in police uniforms? Two days before Steven’s murder, The New York Times ran an Op-Ed article he wrote in which he disclosed how the British Army was ignoring both the infiltration of the Basra police force by Iranian-backed Shiite militias, and the resulting spike in fundamentalist violence. He specifically mentioned the white police vehicles used to abduct and kill an ever increasing number of people; two days later, one of those vehicles came for him. Steven thus has the dubious distinction of being one of the few foreign journalists in this Iraq conflict specifically targeted for execution. Lisa Ramaci-Vincent New York, Sept. 7, 2006

150-> Group to Buy MacDermid for $1.3 Billion
MacDermid, a specialty chemicals company, said yesterday that a group led by its chairman and chief executive and several investment funds would buy it for more than $1.3 billion. Stockholders will receive $35 in cash for each common share, the company said. The purchase price represents a premium of about 21 percent over MacDermid’s closing price on Sept. 1, the last trading day before the offer was made. The purchase price includes the assumption or repayment of about $301 million of debt and is expected to close in the first half of 2007, the company said. The buyout group is led by Daniel H. Leever, chairman and chief executive of MacDermid, and investment funds managed by Court Square Capital Partners and Weston Presidio. Joseph M. Silvestri, managing partner of Court Square Capital Partners, is a director of MacDermid and is involved in the deal. The company said its board of directors had approved the deal and would submit it to shareholders. It will be financed through equity from Leever and the investment funds and debt funding provided by Credit Suisse. MacDermid, based in Denver, provides chemicals for the metal and plastic finishing, electronics and graphic arts industries.

151-> Brooklyn: Plane Victims’ Families Sue
Families of the victims of Brazil’s worst air disaster filed a federal lawsuit yesterday against the operator and maker of a business jet that crossed paths with a commercial airliner, which crashed and killed 154 people. The families listed the operator, ExcelAire Service Inc. of Ronkonkoma, and the manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc., as defendants in the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court. A spokeswoman for ExcelAire, Lisa Henrickson, said the company was preparing a reply. A Honeywell spokesman, Bill Reavis, said that the company would not comment because it had not seen the lawsuit. The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said the Sept. 29 crash resulted when the executive jet, flown by two New York pilots, collided with a Boeing 737 operated by Gol Airlines, which plunged into the Amazon rainforest. Although the crash damaged the smaller jet’s wing and tail, it landed safely.

152-> Chief Says Sun Plans to Offer Open-Source Version of Java
SAN FRANCISCO, May 16 — The new chief executive of Sun Microsystems said on Tuesday that the company was working toward making its Java programming language available free as open-source software, providing further evidence that Sun's new management sees it as more of a services company than a network computer maker. In one of his first appearances since taking the helm of the struggling company three weeks ago, the executive, Jonathan Schwartz, told a gathering of software developers here that Sun viewed open-source software as a major part of its turnaround strategy. Turning Java into open-source software would allow outside programmers to examine and modify its underlying code. Java has been one of the dominant programming language of the Internet since its release more than a decade ago and is used in millions of cellphones. But for years Sun's focus was on providing cheaper hardware to compete at the low end of the computer server market with Dell, Hewlett-Packard and other rivals. Last month Sun reported that it lost $217 million in its third quarter, compared with a loss of $28 million a year earlier. On April 24, Sun's board announced that Mr. Schwartz would succeed Scott McNealy, a founder, who will remain chairman and continue to work with large corporate and government customers. Mr. Schwartz has suggested over the years that Sun's future lies in its ability to offer services and fundamental technological tools, rather than just software and hardware. By making more and more of its Java technology open source, Sun hopes to increase the number of Java developers and programs and raise Java's profile in the technology industry. The more prevalent Java becomes, the more customers there will be for Sun's support services as well as its hardware, which runs Java programs, Mr. Schwartz said. "The question is not whether we will open-source Java; the question is how," Mr. Schwartz said in a speech to developers. Mr. Schwartz declined to provide a timeline for delivering an open-source version of the Java programming language, saying the company still faced the considerable challenge of ensuring that it remained compatible with other software programs while inviting participation from the large base of independent Java developers. While the notion that Sun would eventually offer open-source Java came as no surprise, the disclosure was welcome news to developers, whose fortunes are tied to Sun's. Still, developers seemed to agree that turning things around would not be an easy task for Sun. "With the arrival of Schwartz, who's long been a champion of open source, you can see they are trying to build a defensible business model," said Brian Behlendorf, chief technology officer at CollabNet, one of the earliest Java developers. Mr. Schwartz said Sun had had considerable success with an open-source version of Solaris, its once-proprietary operating system for server computers. In the year since it began offering Open- Solaris, there has been a surge in paying customers who still need additional support and service, he said.

153-> Medarex Chief Leaves
Medarex Inc., a drug developer, said yesterday that Donald L. Drakeman, its president and chief executive, had stepped down amid inquiries into the dating of company stock options. Medarex, based in Princeton, N.J., said an internal investigation showed that before 2002, executives were awarded options based on dates when the stock price was low. Medarex said its chairman, Irwin Lerner, would succeed Mr. Drakeman on an interim basis, effective immediately.

155-> Decline Seen in Illegal Immigrants
Border Patrol officials said the number of immigrants entering the country illegally had declined since President Bush announced his plan to send National Guard troops to help secure the border with Mexico. The Border Patrol chief, David V. Aguilar, reported a 45 percent decline in apprehensions of illegal immigrants when comparing the 69 days before Mr. Bush’s speech on May 15 with the 69 days after it. The National Guard deployment is expected to reach full strength by Aug. 1, with about 6,100 troops at the border.

156-> With the Flyers Being Bullied, Clarke and Hitchcock Are Out
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 22 (AP)  General Manager Bob Clarke resigned and Coach Ken Hitchcock was fired Sunday, a drastic breakup designed to jolt the Philadelphia Flyers from their worst start in 17 years. Clarke resigned in his second stint as general manager, unable to match the Stanley Cups he won with the team as a Hall of Fame center in the 1970’s. Hitchcock was fired more than a month after signing a contract extension. The Flyers are 1-6-1. Clarke said: “I no longer wanted to make the decisions general managers have to make. I felt it was time to step back.” The assistant John Stevens was appointed coach and Paul Holmgren, a former Flyers coach, was promoted to interim general manager from assistant general manager. Stevens, a former Flyer who coached the team’s American Hockey League affiliate, will be behind the bench when the Flyers play at home Thursday against the Atlanta Thrashers. “We’re very confident we can turn this thing around,” Stevens said. The Flyers’ chairman, Ed Snider, said he decided to fire Hitchcock after a 9-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres last week.

159-> 36 Hours on Broadway
THE first thing is to ditch the cellphone. This is a theater expedition, and the cellphone is the mortal enemy of the theater. Being at a play means that you have agreed to enter an alternate reality that has nothing to do with Tuesday's squash date or next week's lineup of baby-sitters. Aural reminders of the world you left behind, whether they sound like "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" or "The Godfather" theme song, shatter this implicit contract. And be warned: more and more actors — including, recently, Richard Griffiths of "The History Boys" — are stopping their shows when cellphones sing to reprimand offending audience members. You do not go to theater to be publicly humiliated — unless you are an actor, in which case that's your job. Since the weekend's theatergoing (two plays, two musicals) is confined to that glittery province called Broadway, the writhing humanity-packed area around Times Square, not having a cellphone also allows you to avoid the distractions of conversations that cause you to bump into other cellphone users, sometimes leading to nasty altercations. You do not come to New York to be beaten up, or if you do, there are clubs downtown for that purpose. 6:15 p.m. Baker's Street Get into the mood theatrical by having dinner at Chez Josephine (414 West 42nd Street, 212-594-1925). The kitschy red-velvet brain child of the chinoiserie-wearing — and often conspicuously present — Jean-Claude Baker, this food-serving shrine to the chanteuse Josephine Baker (the adoptive mother of the proprietor) is the perfect place to strike a dramatic pose. Take note of whoever's spinning show tunes at the piano, since his predecessors include Harry Connick Jr. (Mr. Connick, by the way, is starring in a revival of "The Pajama Game," which is swell but almost impossible to get into; ditto, "The History Boys." Life is too short and brutal to fight for tickets, along with everything else.) Eat escargots and boudin noir or whatever strikes your Gallic fancy. But considering the play you'll be going on to, you might want to avoid anything with red sauce. 7:45 p.m. (And not a second later) Blood, Brothers You arrive at the Lyceum Theater (149 West 45th Street) in good time to collect your tickets and find your seats for the 8 p.m. curtain of "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," Martin McDonagh's brilliant farce about Irish Republican terrorism and a show that spurts as much fake blood as a Quentin Tarantino movie. (I told you to stay away from the red sauce.) Against the odds, this is the funniest show in town and a guaranteed adrenaline booster that demands a post-theater cocktail. 10:15 p.m. A Little Nightcap Have a vodka or gin Gibson (you don't have to drink it, but it looks so darn glamorous) at the bar of Angus McIndoe (258 West 44th Street, 212-221-9222), and eavesdrop shamelessly. This is the place you're most likely to hear an insider's post-mortem — by producers, performers, stagehands, showbiz journalists — of plays in rehearsal and perhaps in trouble. Open only since 2001, Angus's (named for the popular, celebrity-savvy red-haired Scotsman who runs and owns it) has already served as the stage for encounters that have acquired the shimmer of legend, including the time an angry director pushed (or was it punched? — accounts vary) a reporter who had been snarky about his show. (It was David Leveaux of "Fiddler on the Roof" and Michael Riedel of The New York Post, for those who need to know.) The actors playing the title roles of "The History Boys" and "The Producers" may well show up for a late dinner. Noon Tea (or Coffee) for Two Wearing dark glasses (since you decided to drink that Gibson, and several others, after all), stumble into the Edison Cafe (Hotel Edison, 228 West 47th Street, 212-840-5000), also known as the Polish Tea Room, below, for coffee and toast. This looks like a generic coffee shop, but it is to Broadway what the Polo Lounge at the Beverly Hills Hotel is to Hollywood — a hub for old-guard producers to cut deals and kvetch. The great playwright August Wilson used to sit here for hours, working on scripts. Neil Simon, an Edison denizen, used the place as the setting for his "45 Seconds From Broadway," which ran for roughly 45 seconds but confirmed the restaurant's immortal stature. 1:45 p.m. (For a 2 p.m. curtain) Demon Barber of 49th Street Attend the tale of "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," the British director John Doyle's smashing revival of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler's musical macabre at the Eugene O'Neill Theater (230 West 49th Street). The most inventively staged production of the season, with the cast members — who include the peerless Michael Cerveris and Patti LuPone — doubling as their own musicians, this show is so compellingly creepy that it is reassuring to know it will still be light outside when you leave the theater. 5 p.m. House of Wax Visit Madame Tussaud's museum (234 West 42nd Street, 800-246-8872), which, with its glazed wax effigies of famous figures, offers a fair approximation of many of the Broadway shows you are not seeing this weekend. 6:15 p.m. Flops on the Walls Join the madding crowds at Joe Allen's (326 West 46th Street, 212-581-6464), where the dining is fast, energized and so very New York. Have a Caesar salad (or if you still want red meat after "Sweeney Todd," a hamburger) and consider the sad fates of the shows advertised in the framed posters on the walls, all big-time flops. (Remember the musical "Breakfast at Tiffany's," starring Mary Tyler Moore and Richard Chamberlain? No? Well Joe Allen's does.) 7:45 p.m. (You know the drill) Ghosts Give yourself over to the spellbinding ghost story of "Shining City," Conor McPherson's gorgeous portrait of lonely lives in contemporary Dublin, starring Brian F. O'Byrne (as an ex-priest turned therapist) and Oliver Platt (as a patient who keeps seeing the specter of his dead wife) at the Biltmore Theater (261 West 47th Street). This contemplative, beautifully acted comic drama happens to feature the most startling curtain scene on Broadway. You will be wide awake when you leave. 10 p.m. Wunder Bar Return to West 46th Street to soothe your jangled nerves (perhaps a shot or two of tequila) at Bar Centrale (324 West 46th Street, 212-581-3130), the tiny, chic offspring of Joe Allen, upstairs from the mother restaurant, and the spot-of-the-moment for post-theater stargazing. The 1940's bistro décor and dim lighting allow you to imagine that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne are about to walk in. You'll have to settle for the likes of Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker. 1 p.m. Everything in the Garden This is the day to clear the mind of the shadows of theater noir and crepuscular watering holes. So you decide to have lunch al fresco in the enchanting garden of Barbetta (321 West 46th Street, 212-246-9171), where you can eat a light pasta, sip a lighter wine and pretend you're skipping midday Mass in Northern Italy. If your appetite for urbane ghosts is still unsated, you should know that John Held — the droll illustrator who gave us the most enduring image of the Prohibition-era, hip-flask-wearing flapper — used to live in the apartment above the restaurant. 2:45 p.m. (For a 3 p.m. curtain) Garden State If you acquired an Italian wine buzz at Barbetta's, that's perfectly appropriate for a matinee of "Jersey Boys" at the August Wilson Theater (245 West 52nd Street). This better-than-average (and much-loved) jukebox bio-musical, about the career of the street-smart pop group the Four Seasons, invites you to wriggle your shoulders to vintage hits like "Let's Hang On" and "Big Man in Town," as the show's title characters ride the bumpy roller coaster of fame. The real intoxication, though, is provided by the magnetic new-born star John Lloyd Young, who wears his heart in his throat and on his face as Frankie Valli. Because of him, you'll be living with "Can't Take My Eyes Off You" in your head for the rest of the week. Because of him, it's worth it. Tickets for the "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," "Shining City," "Sweeney Todd" and "Jersey Boys" are available at the box offices and through Telecharge, at 212-239-6200, www.telecharge.com, or, outside the New York metropolitan area, 800-432-7250. All have been nominated for Tony Awards as best in their categories — "Inishmore" and "Shining City" as best play, "Jersey Boys" as best musical and "Sweeney Todd" as best musical revival. The Tonys will be broadcast Sunday at 8 p.m. on CBS. Same-day discount tickets to many, but not all, Broadway and Off Broadway shows are available at the TKTS Times Square Theater Center, which is temporarily stationed just outside the New York Marriott Marquis hotel on West 46th Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. Discounts are generally 25 or 50 percent, plus a service charge. Hours are 3 to 8 p.m. for Monday through Saturday evening performances; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for Wednesday and Saturday matinees; 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. for Sunday matinees; and starting at 3 p.m. for Sunday evening shows. There is also a booth at the South Street Seaport. Hours are Monday to Friday, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Sunday, 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. At the Seaport booth, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday matinee tickets are available only the day before the performance.

160-> Seduced by the Figurative and the Power of Painting
One of the many services provided by a gallery scene as dense as New York’s is the serendipitous intramural conversation that occurs when artists of related sensibilities have shows at the same time, sometimes on the same street. Take for example the John Currin exhibition at the uptown Gagosian Gallery and the Lucian Freud show at Acquavella less than three blocks away. The back and forth between them sharpens the experience of each. Here are two figurative painters; both paint the nude, but not exclusively, and through it broach issues of sex, shock, relationship, the grotesque and at times the pornographic. Both are fluent in the history of painting, but not without irony. And both are very alert to the medium’s immediate physical demands and its seductive powers. Oh yes: both are men, straight white men, and extremely successful artists. Both, you could say, have the weight of a centuries-long hegemony on their shoulders, there to be unconsciously or consciously evaded or reinforced, and both have reputations and markets to sustain or, if possible, boost. So what are they up to? At Gagosian, Mr. Currin is painting up a storm, demonstrating that he has lots of options under consideration and that lack of commitment to any one big idea hasn’t slowed his production. The 22 smallish paintings that ring the walls range from the sacred to the profane to the banal, forming a Currin medley that also reads as a kind of installation. It is difficult to imagine many of the paintings looking as good alone as they do in one another’s company. For example a portrait of the artist’s young blond son hangs next to one of a dimpled old man, with ungainly glasses and similar wafting hair. The title, “2070,” suggests that the second painting is the son again as a silly grandfather. Sedate images of dreamy, slightly odd looking older women reading books in bed can be found on nearly every wall, as can images of sexual encounters. Some, named for different cities, seem lifted from pornographic magazines and have slightly coarsened surfaces, along with odd touches, like the spindly female legs akimbo in “The Danes.” Others, overtly silken and involving two figures who are, or seem to be, women, alternate between the lush accouterments of Rubens, up to and including a fur cape (“The Dane”), and a throw-back-the-sheets heat suggesting a fusion of Watteau, Boucher and Fragonard. This contrast prevails in two nearly identical versions of the same embrace. “Kissers,” which shows the lovers from the chest up, is acceptable museum fare. “Malmo” extends the image a bit lower to include what centuries of painters have not. Mr. Currin seems at his best — and in some ways his wisest — on familiar ground, as in “Patch and Pearl.” It shows two young women, deflowered Breck girls, whose pregnant bellies aren’t quite where they should be; they stand on a roof trimmed with a bit of Classical egg-and-dart molding — insemination is in the details — where you might expect a gutter. While Mr. Currin flits about the imagined spaces of history at Gagosian, Mr. Freud, who turns 84 today, seems relatively hunkered down and housebound. In a sense the reality of figurative painting itself has always been Mr. Freud’s primary subject. Sexuality, while not absent, is certainly not on display, much less acted out. His best paintings make palpable the claustrophobia of the studio and its harsh light, the dead weight of the people posing and their inscrutable thoughts or blank minds, and the continuous effort on the painter’s part to get things right. The main influence has always seemed to be Cézanne. Although painted in a heavier hand, the faceted surfaces of Mr. Freud’s bodies have a similar built-up point by point articulation. As in Cézanne, the planes of the floor or the wall heave forward unexpectedly; the coverlet on a bed can form into landscapes. The struggle for resolution can be especially agitated around the faces of Mr. Freud’s female nudes, which are sometimes so overworked they seem almost battered. This may be why his portraits of men are often his strongest works. There seems to be a Freud exhibition formula. Most of his works home in on figures or faces in the studio, but occasionally he ventures out, making in this case a painting of his garden or the flank of a pony in a nearby stable. And there is usually a rather startling self-portrait. This time “The Painter Surprised by a Naked Admirer” shows the artist with a naked female model clinging to his leg as he stands (clothed), poised to work on the very painting we are looking at. Behind him is a wall that at first seems covered with heavy, dour vines but is actually stuccoed with years of paint that he has sloughed off his brush. The scene is more than a bit contrived, a marriage of self-mockery and narcissism. There is a lot of naked skin in both of these shows, but the skin of the paintings themselves is the most telling. Mr. Currin paints with a kind of innocent lightness and ease that is open and vulnerable, even joyful, but also a little too easily pleased. His strange juxtapositions, hints of unclear gender and disconcerting physical details, give his paintings an undertow that still feels unformed in its ambiguity, as if it is waiting to be brought out. Mr. Freud’s surface is tough, overt yet closed, almost like a turtle’s shell, but also insistent and dissatisfied. He understands that painting demands physical reinvention: an idea that only occasionally dawns on Mr. Currin. It may be that one artist thinks he has all the time in the world, while the other knows he doesn’t. But Mr. Currin leaves us hanging as to whether the problem runs deeper.

161-> A New Look at the Old West
WHERE does the West begin? That's a matter of opinion. But on the high plains, a good argument can be made that it starts in the Black Hills in western South Dakota. The brick-red soil of the rolling, ponderosa-pine-covered Black Hills also extends into Wyoming, and this part of the region is less well known. Its landscape, and that of the high plains and mountains to the west, holds a fascinating history of settlement and conflicts, from Indians to cowboys to the cavalry, including George Armstrong Custer. A road trip along Interstate 90 that begins on the South Dakota-Wyoming border takes you through wide-open country — a classic Western landscape, with more horses and cows than people and many miles between gas stations and good restaurants. Vore Buffalo Jump: Just over the South Dakota border on I-90 is the tiny, cottonwood-tree-shaded village of Beulah, Wyo. — population 33, the sign says. A few miles east of town, stop and see a large 45-foot-deep hole called the Vore Buffalo Jump, sandwiched between I-90 and the frontage road. It doesn't look like much — a large red hole in the ground with a locked metal door over a hole at the bottom. But a small sign on top says it is one of the most spectacular archaeological sites in the world, and a larger visitor center is planned. Some 20,000 bison were driven over the edge and to the bottom of the pit between about 1300 and 1800 (according to carbon dating), where they were attacked by Indians with spears, arrows and clubs who turned them into dinner and left behind the bones and many weapons. Beneath the door at the bottom lies a pile of buffalo bones, projectile points and other artifacts more than 20 feet deep. The years of accumulation have carefully preserved a record in annual layers and have created an unusually vivid portrait of the lives of the Indians who lived on these rocky plains. While visitors can't see the artifacts — the visitor center hasn't been built yet — you can stand at the top or hike to the bottom and imagine a herd of bison galloping toward you across the sagebrush-studded plains and then suddenly finding, in terror, the ground giving way beneath them. Devils Tower: From Beulah, stay on Interstate 90, exit at State Highway 14 and follow the signs to Devils Tower, the nation's first national monument, set aside by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906. In Steven Spielberg's "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" it was the place where the aliens landed. Even without hovering spacecraft, on a windy and gray day, the tower was still stunning, a dark, almost dreamlike silhouette that resembled a giant tree stump glimpsed through low-lying clouds. Its vertical pillar rises 1,267 feet above the ox-bowing Belle Fourche River. Indian tribes called it Bear Lodge, and legend has it that when seven young girls prayed to be saved from a rampaging grizzly bear, the ground started to push up and the tower grew higher and higher to keep them out of reach of the attacking bear — so high eventually that they became the seven sisters in the sky, the constellation Pleiades. When you leave the tower, follow Highway 14 to Moorcroft and get back on I-90 there, instead of retracing your steps. The trip now winds for many miles through the dun-colored prairie of the Powder River Basin, once the great hunting grounds of the northern tribes. Buffalo, Wyo.: This quaint little town with a historic downtown was a stage where many Western dramas were played out. (In the snow-mottled mountains to the west of town a Western drama of a different kind was set — the Bighorn Mountains are the setting of the story on which the movie "Brokeback Mountain" was based.) Much of historic Buffalo remains, including the frontier-era Occidental Hotel, a carefully restored barbershop, a saloon and the Virginian restaurant, all in the same block. Many of the West's legends stayed at the Occidental, including Buffalo Bill Cody, Calamity Jane, Butch Cassidy, the Sundance Kid and Theodore Roosevelt. It was founded in 1878, the era of gunslingers and vigilantes, expanded and rebuilt in the early 1900's, and meticulously restored almost a century later. The region was always heavily trafficked, and several Indian, trader and exploration routes ran through the area around Buffalo. In the mid-1860's, the Bozeman Trail, a spur off the Oregon Trail that led to the rich gold fields that had recently been discovered in Montana, was established over the same route. Later, in 1892, the Johnson County War took place between cattle barons and small ranchers (who were accused of being rustlers) in the area around Buffalo. Large ranchers, backed by about 50 out-of-state gunmen, attacked the cabin of Nate Champion, a small rancher who operated the KC Ranch. Of the four men staying there, two were killed and two captured. A posse from Buffalo, led by the sheriff of Johnson County, then besieged the cattle barons' men at a nearby ranch. The big cattlemen were eventually rescued by federal troops. All this and more is interpreted at the Jim Gatchell Memorial Museum downtown, part of which is in the town's historic library. Indian Wars Sites: The Cheyenne, Sioux and other tribes deeply resented the invasion of whites into their last great hunting ground and they constantly attacked settlers along the Bozeman Trail. Fort Phil Kearny, named after a Union general, was built in 1866 to protect settlers heading to look for gold in Montana and to keep warring tribes apart. From Buffalo, take I-90 north about 17 miles and follow the signs to the historic site. The huge fort is gone — it was burned to the ground after the Army abandoned it — but a section of the stockade, with its eight-foot-high log walls, with the ends like sharpened pencils, has been rebuilt. Signs all around the grounds show how the fort — which was really a town within walls — was laid out here at the foot of the mountains. This is one of a cluster of sites in the area related to the Indian Wars, all within a short drive of each other. The Fetterman Fight — formerly called the Fetterman Massacre — started when Capt. William J. Fetterman took 80 men from the fort to rescue some wagons that were under Indian attack in 1866. Despite orders not to ride out of view, when he got outside the fort he was lured over Lodge Trail Ridge by a small band of Indians. It was a trap, and Fetterman and his 80 men were done in by 1,000 or more waiting warriors — a setback that presaged Custer's Last Stand. A stone monument marks the site of the fallen on the largely undeveloped landscape. To get there from the fort, follow the signs to Old Highway 87, take a left and go a quarter mile to the memorial. The Army abandoned the fort and the Bozeman Trail in 1868, and the land was ceded to the tribes forever — but forever proved temporary. Gold was discovered in 1874 in the Black Hills, in the heart of Indian territory. In 1875, the tribes were ordered to move to reservations or be treated as enemies. Sitting Bull, Crazy Horse and other chiefs refused, leading to war the next year. Trail End State Historic Site, Sheridan, Wyo.: From Fort Phil Kearny, get back on I-90 and drive north about 20 miles. Take the Fifth Street exit, continue west on Fifth and turn left on Clarendon Avenue. After the last of the tribes were gone, the cattlemen came to the oceans of grass on the northern range. One of them was an orphan named John B. Kendrick. A poor cowpoke hired for a trail drive during the days of the open range, Kendrick married the boss's daughter and became one of the great ranchers in the region — owning more than 200,000 acres in Wyoming and Montana. He would go on to be elected governor of Wyoming in 1914. Two years later, he became the first United States senator from the Cowboy State to be elected by popular vote. Kendrick's stately 39-room Trail End mansion, with its dark wood interior (crafted back East) and its spacious top-floor ballroom, sits high on its four-acre grounds overlooking Sheridan. Built in 1913, the home was an elegant refuge against the harsh and still untamed frontier. The Custer Battlefield: Get back on Interstate 90 and continue into Montana. About 60 miles from Sheridan, in the rolling hills at the foot of the Wolf Mountains you can stand atop the grassy knob of Last Stand Hill at the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument, where it all ended for Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on a sweltering June day in 1876. The overconfident Custer attacked several thousand Indians with a few hundred men. As he led one group of troops splashing across the meandering Little Bighorn River on horseback, however, they were attacked by the Indians and forced to retreat. Surrounded, they made a last stand in the long grass.  Pictograph Cave: A state park and national historic landmark, Pictograph Cave is actually a complex of caves — Pictograph, Middle and Ghost — in an impressive sandstone cliff a few miles south of Billings. To reach it, drive west on I-90 from Hardin, near the Custer Battlefield, heading to Billings, and look for signs. The complex has produced more than 30,000 artifacts going back more than 4,500 years and is considered Montana's most important archaeological site. On the edge of Montana's largest city, a short dirt road takes you a few miles out of town and thousands of years into the past. A trail through a quiet rimrock canyon loops past the mouths of three caves. Most pictographs in Montana are red, but here they are red and black and include a warrior figure with spiked hair and a weeping eye. They were drawn before Rome was an empire. THE trip can be made in either direction. If you start in the east, you would fly into Spearfish or Rapid City, S.D. Billings, Mont., is served by major airlines and car rental companies, with all the major hotel chains. In Billings, the 282-room Sheraton (27 North 27th Street, 406-252-7400) is in the heart of the historic downtown. The tallest building — 23 stories — in Montana, it is within walking distance of restaurants, coffee bars and shopping. In Buffalo, Wyo., the Occidental Hotel (10 North Main Street, 307-684-0451) offers performances by cowboy poets and old-time fiddle players in the summer. Rooms are $110 for a queen to $265 for a three-bedroom suite. A room with a shared bath is $75. The Virginian Restaurant (which is in the hotel) features locally grown buffalo, lamb and beef, as well as salmon and chicken. Entrees are $19 to $25. Reservations recommended; 307-684-5976. In Beulah, Wyo., the Buffalo Jump Steakhouse, 307-643-2297, serves beef and buffalo steaks, and has a full bar. Devils Tower National Monument is open 24 hours a day all year. Admission is $10 a car and camping is $12 a day. The visitor center is open April through November.

165-> Lexmark Shares Fall
Lexmark International, a maker of computer printers, set a forecast for third-quarter profits yesterday that fell short of Wall Street estimates. Its shares fell $2.26, or more than 4 percent,to $50.52. Lexmark, which competes with Hewlett-Packard, also said second-quarter net income dropped to $76.7 million, or 74 cents a share, from $79.9 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time restructuring costs and a tax benefit, the company reported a profit of $1.07 a share. Revenue in the second quarter fell to $1.23 billion, compared with $1.28 billion a year earlier. Lexmark forecast third-quarter earnings per share, excluding restructuring-related charges, in the range of 65 cents to 75 cents. An inkjet component shortage will hurt third-quarter results by about 5 cents a share.

166-> Medicare Payments to Doctors Face Cuts
WASHINGTON, Aug. 8  The Bush administration on Tuesday proposed a cut of 5.1 percent across the board in Medicare payments for services provided by doctors to elderly and disabled patients in 2007. It said the cut was required because spending on doctors’ services was increasing faster than expected, and faster than the annual goals set by a statutory formula. The increase directly affects beneficiaries because their premiums are set each year to cover about 25 percent of projected spending under Part B of Medicare, which pays for doctors’ services and other outpatient care. Dr. Mark B. McClellan, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Tuesday that the premium would probably rise to $98.40 next year, up $9.90 or 11 percent over this year’s premium. The figures do not include separate premiums paid by many beneficiaries for prescription drug coverage. “Our current system of paying for physician services is simply not sustainable, from the point of view of taxpayers or Medicare beneficiaries,’’ Dr. McClellan said. The White House, Congress and doctors have been talking for more than a year about ways to link Medicare payments to the quality of care doctors provide. To date, they have not offered any specific proposals and are still seeking ways to measure the quality of care, particularly for medical specialists. More than 42 million people are insured by Medicare. Officials estimate that the program will pay $61.5 billion to 875,000 doctors and other health care professionals next year. Such spending has increased sharply in recent years, Dr. McClellan said, because of “increases in the number and complexity of services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, including more frequent and intensive office visits, and rapid growth in the use of imaging techniques, laboratory services and physician-administered drugs.’’ Budget estimates are based on the assumption that doctors’ fees under Medicare will be cut in 2007 and later years, as required under the statutory formula. Congress often steps in to block or moderate such cuts, but it normally looks for some way to offset the cost of its action, often by trimming payments to other health care providers. Dr. McClellan said it would cost the government $13 billion over five years if it blocked the cut scheduled for 2007, without giving doctors any allowance for inflation. The costs would ripple through later years because future updates would be computed from a higher starting point. Federal officials contend that many doctors partly offset cuts in their Medicare fees by performing more services. Donald B. Marron, acting director of the Congressional Budget Office, said substantial evidence suggested that “a reduction in payment rates leads physicians to increase the volume and intensity of the services they perform.’’ But, Mr. Marron cautioned, some “are likely to respond to continuing reductions in payment rates by declining to participate in the Medicare program.’’ The Bush administration also announced that it would require hospitals to provide the government with information on their “investment and compensation relationships with physicians.’’ Hospitals that specialize in cardiac, orthopedic or surgical care will have to inform patients if any staff doctors have “an investment interest’’ in the hospital. Hospitals look to doctors as a source of referrals. But Medicare officials said doctors could be violating federal law if they received financial returns out of proportion to their investments  if, for example, a doctor held 2 percent of the stock in a specialty hospital but received 8 percent of the profits. Hospitals that do not comply with the new disclosure requirements will face civil fines up to $10,000 a day.

169-> Queens: Doctor Is Sentenced for Fraud
A physician was sentenced yesterday in State Supreme Court to two to six years in prison for fraudulently billing nine insurance companies for tens of thousands of dollars of services, prosecutors said. The physician, Vladimir Kirkorov, 55, a rehabilitation specialist on Staten Island, was convicted last month of insurance fraud, grand larceny and falsifying business records, said the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. While working at three Queens medical clinics, Dr. Kirkorov submitted false and inflated bills for two dozen car accident victims, Mr. Brown said. He was one of eight physicians charged in connection with Operation Sideswipe, a citywide investigation of automobile insurance fraud announced in 2004. Dr. Kirkorov was also ordered to pay more than $20,000 to the insurance companies he defrauded.

170-> World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Vivendi's Profit Rises
The media company Vivendi, which agreed this week to acquire the BMG music publishing division of Bertelsmann, said second-quarter profit rose 53 percent, helped by pay TV and the sale of a stake in the chemical maker DuPont. Net income increased to 1.16 billion euros ($1.48 billion), or 99 cents a share, from 756 million euros ($968 million), or 65 cents, a year earlier, Vivendi said. Adjusted net income, which excludes one-time items, rose 10 percent, to 750 million euros ($961 million). Its pay TV arm, Canal Plus, added subscribers after Vivendi bought exclusive rights to broadcast the top soccer league, part of a strategy to expand in media and counter slowing growth in its mobile phone unit, SFR. Profit slipped 2 percent at the company's Universal Music Group, but the chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy said the acquisition of BMG would add to income in the first year after the deal was completed.

171-> Bronx: Rare Leopard Bound for Zoo
An orphaned Himalayan snow leopard cub found by a shepherd in Pakistan is bound for the Bronx Zoo, where he will be entered into its captive breeding program. The leopard was discovered in July 2005 in the remote mountains of the Naltar Valley after his mother and other cubs had been killed. Only seven weeks old at the time, he was too young to be left in the wild. The 55-pound cub, named Leo, was handed over yesterday to the World Conservation Union to become part of its captive breeding program for snow leopards at the Bronx Zoo and is scheduled to board a flight for New York today. He will eventually be returned to northern Pakistan, where a snow leopard rehabilitation facility will be set up to help him transfer back into the wild. Snow leopards are in danger of extinction, with only 5,000 to 7,000 left in the wild.

172-> Someone Was Paid $100 in the Time You Spent on This
Time is money, sure. But how much money? That, of course, depends on who you are. Some time is worth more than others. Consider Lloyd C. Blankfein’s time. Mr. Blankfein, the chairman of Goldman Sachs, the big investment bank, learned last week that the company would pay him a bonus of $53.4 million this year. That, of course, is in addition to his regular salary of $600,000 and the $250,000 or so that the company paid for his car and driver and other perquisites. Still, $53.4 million works out to a bonus of more than $1 million a week, or more than $200,000 a day for a regular five-day workweek (but only $146,301 a day if one assumes that he worked seven days a week). Even assuming that Mr. Blankfein worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the bonus breaks down to almost $6,100 an hour, or more than $100 a minute. Every minute. Of every hour. Of every day. For the entire year.

181-> A Sauvignon to Savor
WHEN aficionados debate whether chardonnay or sauvignon blanc is the North Fork's most promising major white, a strong case can be made for sauvignon blanc, especially when the version produced by Macari Vineyards in Mattituck is cited. Like its predecessors, Macari's pale, tangy and stylish 2005 edition ($15.99) is an aromatic, slightly herbal crowd-pleaser intended for immediate consumption. Fans of Macari sauvignon's creamy texture and its lingering grapefruity flavor, which has almost a gin-and-tonic snap, will not be disappointed. Macari has also released two attractive chardonnays: the 2004 regular estate bottling ($14.99) and a more complex 2003 reserve ($24.99). Like the sauvignon, the 2004 is creamy, citric and round. A crisp pearlike flavor dominates its fruitiness. The sauvignon and the 2004 chardonnay are good companions for shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari, oysters, clams and light fish like trout, flounder and halibut. The sauvignon is heaven sent for seafood salads and crabmeat sandwiches. The reserve chardonnay, fermented and reared in oak barrels, is soft and round, with a palate-coating viscosity. Somewhat buttery, and with apple and pear notes, it is a natural with lobster, crabs and fish in cream and butter sauces. As for red wine, Macari's 2003 cabernet franc ($23.99) goes nicely with steaks, lamb, pork chops, chicken, duck breasts and ribs off the grill. The dark-garnet franc is an earthy quaffing wine. It is soft, grapey, spicy, meaty and slightly redolent of tobacco. Afterward, cigar lovers will be tempted to light up.

182-> Here’s Your Syllabus, and Your Condom
AMERICANS generally think of back-to-school as a time for discounts on laptops and backpacks, a mad dash for textbooks and CliffsNotes, a chance to stock up on wool tights and warm socks. Few associate it with latex and lubricant. Yet fall also happens to be back-to-school season for the condom industry. Students are unlikely to find a Sunday circular encouraging them to pick up a Durex Pleasure Pack along with their composition books. But it is a good bet they will find some sort of condom promotion on their college campuses. Some deliver grave messages about sexually transmitted diseases; others are humorous riffs on masculinity. But the goal is the same: to introduce the companies’ products to freshmen, create new health habits and, of course, drive future sales. “If you look at condom sales, there are different peaks,” said Jim Daniels, the vice president for marketing at Trojan, which dominates the United States condom market. He cited New Year’s Eve, Valentine’s Day and even the Fourth of July, but said the back-to-school season is a particularly good opportunity for recruiting young customers. “A third of condoms are purchased by college-age students,” Mr. Daniels said. “Therefore it’s a very important target. Very often people become sexually active during those years.” While some colleges prefer, for religious or other reasons, not to have condoms on campus, college administrators who endorse condom use agree that this is a significant time of year for getting students started on new habits. “Students are, for the first time, out on their own,” said Dr. Lora L. Jasman, the director of student health services at Oregon State University in Corvallis. “And they have to make decisions on their own. It’s critical we find ways to reach out to them.” To that end, she said free condoms are available in “a whole host of places, including condoms that are in a big basket in a student employee office.” Doctors, family planning groups and health organizations are unambiguous in endorsing condoms as the most effective means of reducing the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and H.I.V. infection, as well as a way to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. “Condoms provide an enormously high protection rate,” said Dr. Jeff Waldman, the senior director of clinical services at Planned Parenthood Federation of America. So with condom manufacturers eager to mine a ready market, and with administrators happy to receive free or discounted products that will keep students healthy, condom distribution at many colleges around the country has become as fundamental to freshman orientation as buying textbooks and finding the dining hall. At Oregon State, “safer sex” kits are filled with condoms, lubricant and Hershey’s Kisses; at Stanford, each student receives 12 free condoms from the student-run Sexual Health Peer Resource Center, which is also beginning its annual educational “field trips” on which freshmen are escorted from their dorms to the center for an introductory talk. Over all, condom sales in the United States were $398.3 million last year, up 2.8 percent from 2004, according to the market research publisher Packaged Facts, a division of MarketResearch.com. And although it is not known how much of the increase is due to purchases by college students (many of them receive free condoms, after all), the condom manufacturers are dreaming up ever more creative ways to get their attention. Marketers are increasing their print, television, Web and radio advertising to appeal to students, but their campus appearances generate the most buzz. Pam Piligian, a senior vice president, group account director, at Fitzgerald+CO, which created advertising for Durex condoms, said campus promotions involve young people at a booth or strolling around and handing out coupons, condoms and condom-themed giveaways like bumper stickers and baby-doll T-shirts. Durex also boasts on one of its Web sites that it is “the world’s No. 1 source for penis outfits” and displays an array of printable paper-doll-inspired cutouts, including a red cape and golden crown, and a tuxedo for sorority and fraternity formals. Mr. Daniels said that at Trojan’s live events, students end up chanting the Trojan theme song, high-fiving Trojan representatives and taking posters to slap up on their dorm room walls. Next month, Trojan will sponsor round-table discussions with college journalists about sexual health in Chicago and Los Angeles, something it began last year to gauge the sexual climate of various campuses. Mr. Daniels said last year’s event was so successful that Trojan organized four round-tables this year. The company also increased its fall advertising, both online and in print. Such approaches are sometimes the only way to reach students at certain schools that “have chosen not to allow us on campus to do our programs,” Mr. Daniels said. He declined to name those schools, but on Tuesday Trojan displayed on its Web site results of its Sexual Health Report Card, in which it graded 100 public and private colleges and universities on how they provided information about sexual health to their students. The schools were randomly chosen, and narrow criteria were used. The grade on “condom availability” was determined mostly by whether a school’s Web site showed where condoms could be obtained on campus. “It doesn’t do any good if it’s there and nobody knows about it,” said Bert Sperling, the president of Sperling’s Best Places, a research firm in Portland, Ore., which Trojan hired to gather the information over the phone and on the Web from February through May. No one from the firm visited the campuses. Using that criteria, several schools received a failing grade for “condom availability.” Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, was ranked lowest of all and received an F in all categories. But Carri Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Brigham Young, said the survey’s methodology is flawed, and she questioned the way the schools were scrutinized. “I am concerned that this even be taken seriously at all because it is such an unscientific survey,” she said. The university was also given failing grades in “sexual assault services” and testing for H.I.V. and sexually transmitted diseases, but Ms. Jenkins said it does offer these services. Additionally, she said, “Our students come to the university already having made a conscious decision to avoid pregnancy and S.T.D.’s through abstinence. And it’s very successful.” Donnovan Somera Yisrael, a sexual health and relationship educator at Stanford, said that while students should be taught how to have safer sex, “we want to be sex-positive, not sex-pressuring.” There is plenty of pressure already, he said, with all the parties and alcohol. That is why each fall there is what he called “a big push around health” on campus. “We’re trying to give them the tools,” he said, “not only condoms, but communications skills to negotiate healthy relationships, and part of that is sexual health. Obviously those are skills for life.”

183-> Democrats Outline a Platform for the Fall
WASHINGTON, June 16 — Declaring their party "ready for this election," Democratic leaders in Congress on Friday announced the platform they hope to use to regain the majority in November. Their plan, presented at a news conference, included promises to raise the minimum wage, make college tuition tax deductible, eliminate subsidies for oil and gas companies, negotiate lower drug prices for the prescription plan passed last year, increase stem cell research and restore a pay-as-you-go policy for federal budgets. They noted that Congress had not increased the minimum wage, now at $5.15, since 1997, a fact that Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, declared "immoral." Their proposal to raise it to $7.25, they said, would benefit seven million workers. They rejected the argument that such a raise would shrink the economy, noting that jobs increased after the last raise. The Democratic leaders also pledged a 25 percent reduction in oil use by 2020, largely by developing fuel alternatives in the United States. "We want to send our energy money to the Midwest, not the Middle East," Ms. Pelosi said. Over and over, the leaders contrasted Republican priorities — which they deemed "the wrong direction" — with their own — "a new direction." Under Republican rule, they said, health care, college and gas costs have risen faster than incomes. While Republican leaders vowed Friday to eliminate the estate tax by July 4, Democrats argued that doing so would cost $1 trillion in the first 10 years — more than enough, they said, to pay for every student who graduated from high school this year to go to a public university. A tax cut passed a month ago, they said, would save millionaires $42,000, more than what four minimum-wage earners make in a year. The Democrats sought to link their Congressional opponents to a president whose approval ratings have languished. "Americans can't afford the priorities of this Bush administration any longer," said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois. "Democrats are ready for this election. We have the message, we have the candidates, we're bringing that message to the American people." The Democrats' declaration comes after two weeks that have reversed a run of bad news for Republicans. The Republicans won a special election in the California Congressional district that both sides saw as a bellwether for November; and a special prosecutor investigating the leak of a C.I.A. operative's name announced he would not indict Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, whom Democrats hold up as a symbol of Republican corruption. And the president's trip to Iraq and the killing of the Iraqi insurgent leader Abu Masab al-Zarqawi gave Republicans an opportunity to rebut the argument that the war was going badly. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, insisted that "none of us are running victory laps" for the fall election. "The election is not being held today," Mr. Reid said, but he added, "If it were, the Senate would be tied." Republicans mocked the Democrats' platform, with a spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the majority leader, issuing a one-line statement: "When you're going in circles like the Democrats, it just seems like you're going in a new direction."

185-> The Lawn’s a Fairway
Al Angelo., Jr., 57, a real estate developer from Vancouver, Wash. 3-bedroom house Bend, Ore. I moved into my house in the golf community of Pronghorn in mid-June. I was one of the first to buy a lot here, and I immediately went forward with the building process, which took two years from beginning to end. It’s a one-level timber frame construction house, similar to something you might see in Sun Valley, and she’s a real beauty. I try to golf four times a week. I like to get out on the course by 8 in the morning so I’m done by noon. My wife and I play together all the time, and I just competed with a friend in a member-guest tournament. It was an unusually hot day, so everyone was struggling, but we finally got our game together. Pronghorn has one golf course open for play now, and there is a new Tom Fazio-designed course opening at the end of this month. As part of the tournament we got to walk the front nine, and I think it may be Fazio’s best work yet. I’m a sun person, so I’ll be here from May 15 through October, and when it’s the off-season here, I’ll be at my house in a golf community in Palm Desert. Bend is in the high desert, so it’s dry and usually mild in the summer. I love to raft and hike, and Bend has all of that, in addition to great golf. Another reason my wife and I bought in this community is its accessibility. The kids and grandkids can drive down from Washington and be here in about two hours. To reach the gate house at development from Bend you have to follow a four-mile road surrounded by nothing but forest. It almost feels like you will never get there, but when you do, it has that wow factor. As told to Amy Gunderson

186-> A World in Permanent Flux
Wallace Stevens said “it must be abstract,” William Carlos Williams said “no ideas but in things,” and Charles Wright, even after writing poems for more than 30 years, still can’t decide. Tennessean by birth, Virginian by longtime residence, languid by literary temperament, Wright has written more than a dozen books of poems, including a meditative and elegiac trio of trilogies he’s referred to as “The Appalachian Book of the Dead,” one volume of which, “Black Zodiac” (1997) won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle Award. In the musing, sinuous poems of “Scar Tissue,” his new collection, as in much of his earlier work, Wright sometimes seems to prize the imagination above all else, describing “the absence the two / horses have left on the bare slope, / The silence that grazes like two shapes where they have been” as if the idea of horses were more important to him than the animals themselves. (Even this poem’s title, “Against the American Grain,” advertises its antipathy toward Williams, author of “In the American Grain.”) But elsewhere Wright seems to place far greater faith in things than in their representations (“A thing is not an image, / imagination’s second best”) and to mock the notion that the abstract imagination could ever be preferable to the physical world’s adamant particulars. After all, “How many word-warriors ever return / from midnight’s waste and ruin?” It’s not the transcendent that persists, but the lowly actual: “Whatever is insignificant has its own strength, / Whatever is hidden, clear vision. / Thus the ant in its hide-and-seek, / thus the dung beetle, / And all the past weight of the world it packs on its back.” If, as F. Scott Fitzgerald said, the true test of a first-rate intellect is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas in mind at the same time and still be able to function, Wright passes with ease. That said, his insistence on never insisting on anything can become frustrating. When I picture Wright lolling in a rocking chair during “the almost hour, / almost darkness, almost light, / Far northern dusk dust sifting over the evergreens, / Chiaroscuro at heaven’s walk, / Charcoal and deeper shades where our foot falls and hands hang,” dreamily reflecting that this perfect neither-here-nor-there “is the one place we feel at home, this is our zone,” I feel like poking him with a sharp stick. Restless seeking and venturing I like; cataleptic mugwumpery not so much. When a poet insouciantly asks, “And what does this matter?” in the middle of a poem, he should be prepared for unwelcome answers. And shouldn’t a poem that ends with a slammed door of a couplet like “New skin over old wounds, colorless, numb. / Let the tongue retreat, let the heart be dumb” be the last one its author writes, or at least the last one in the book? Sometimes it seems Wright’s project is to find ever more convincing ways to tell us he doesn’t have anything to tell us. But he may be underestimating his persuasiveness. When he writes, “I write out my charms and spells / Against the passage of light / and gathering evil / Each morning. Each evening hands them back,” it seems fair to ask why he’s trying to fob off evening’s rejects on us. Wright’s paradoxical sentiments come wrapped in gently meandering lines and sentences that seem not to want to end lest they appear to conclude. It would be interesting to get a look at the keyboard where Wright types; I picture his comma key worn down to a nub and the period filmed with dust. When Wright’s hesitancy becomes this exaggerated, it begins to feel to me less like sage circumspection and more like pseudo- Buddhist sophistry. But you could argue that such constant repetitions and reconsiderations are an integral part of Wright’s larger project, which is to record, and praise, the world’s paradoxically permanent flux. At the beginning of “Heraclitean Backwash,” Wright stresses the flux, looking back at his past self as “Strange flesh in a stranger land,” but by the time he repeats that phrase toward the end of the poem, his emphasis has shifted to permanence: the clouds may be “on their way to where they’re not,” but they’re eternally on their way. This sense of continuousness is the most distinctive (and the most pleasing) aspect of Wright’s poetry. A self-proclaimed “God-fearing agnostic,” Wright struggles against his faith and struggles against his doubt, not to vanquish one or the other, but to marvel at the persistence of both. At their best, Wright’s poems form a kind of metaphysical scar tissue; they are “sumptuous barricades” that enforce the separation of the transcendent and the concrete, but also provide an “in-between” where they can at least parley.

187-> Technology's Future: A Look at the Dark Side
AS far as anyone knows, the plight of civilization is nowhere near as dire as in the opening pages of Douglas Adams's "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," where alien spaceships are poised to destroy Earth to make way for an interstellar highway. Still, with resource consumption and environmental destruction rising at unsustainable rates, plenty of people view the future with alarm. That spotlights technologies like nuclear power, genetic engineering and nanotechnology, which are often cited as crucial to heading off economic and environmental disaster. The catch is that any technology powerful enough to improve life radically is also capable of abuse and prone to serious, unanticipated side effects. It's a great time to be a Hollywood screenwriter, but rough on policy makers and business strategists. Mix new technologies with the wide variations in how organizations and individuals behave, and you often have "a recipe for explosion," said Edward Tenner, author of "Why Things Bite Back: Technology and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences." The table setter for fears about potentially useful technology was nuclear power, which emerged as an energy source while images of the waste laid to Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs in 1945 were still fresh. "It's not the probability of a nuclear accident that matters in people's attitudes," said Charles B. Perrow, a risk analysis expert whose newest book, "Disaster Evermore? U.S. Vulnerability to Natural, Industrial and Terrorist Disasters," will be published this summer. "It's the possibility, which is very much there." Despite several close calls, the deadly explosion at Chernobyl in 1986 is the utility industry's sole catastrophic failure. But the costs imposed on power companies to manage risks had already halted expansion of the nuclear power industry in the United States and elsewhere in the 70's. Now, even though the risks of accidents are presumed to be growing as the first generation of plants age, orders are picking up for new plants in Asia. And some American utilities like Exelon, Entergy and Dominion are saying they want to build nuclear plants in the United States alongside existing ones. Those plants currently supply just over 20 percent of the nation's electricity with operating costs far below fossil fuel plants. Advocates for renewed investment in nuclear power say that new plant designs could reduce or eliminate many of the meltdown and contamination risks associated with current plants. Critics say the industry is still too riddled with bad management and lax regulation to allow new plants to be built. "The driver of a car has a much bigger impact on safety than whether it's a Volvo or a Yugo," said David Lochbaum, director of the nuclear safety project for the Union of Concerned Scientists. But some nuclear critics are reconsidering their positions based on the conclusion that of all the proven power-generating technologies, only nuclear power is ready to deliver large amounts of electricity without creating greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. "I see climate change as being so disastrous that increased nuclear energy may be the way to go," Mr. Perrow said. The new designs still do not address concerns about the accumulation of nuclear waste that will be radioactive for centuries unless a new way of dealing with it is devised. And nuclear plants — and the technology to support them — strike some critics as inviting targets for terrorists. Still, many energy experts see nuclear power as the best bridge to an energy future based on renewable sources like solar power. The ambivalence in green policy debates about nuclear energy also runs through talk about biotechnology, especially when it comes to genetic engineering. Arguments that humankind is foolishly "playing God" have been common ever since research breakthroughs in the late 1970's laid the groundwork for innovations like transferring to crops the genes that tell bacteria how to make insect-killing proteins. Pioneering biotechnology researchers sought to prevent accidents and minimize regulation by voluntarily adopting good practice codes for experiments that produced genetically engineered animals and plants. But if confidence has grown as the years pass without any biological Chernobyls, doubts have persisted about the long-term health effects from engineered plants and animals. Some critics also say the technology makes farmers too beholden to giant agribusinesses. More recently, security experts have begun to fret that terrorists could engineer and release novel viruses, bacteria or fungi. Still, the potential environmental benefits of greater use of genetic engineering have excited researchers from the technology's earliest days. The Supreme Court's 1980 decision in Diamond v. Chakrabarty, which upheld the right of businesses to patent engineered organisms, involved a bacterium that General Electric hoped would become a green "product" to clean up oil spills. In the end, G.E.'s oil-consuming microbe proved ineffective when transferred from a flask to slicks on the seas. But bioremediation — using naturally occurring microbes to clean up a wide variety of air, water and soil pollutants — is growing. Backers of the technology argue that accelerated use of genetic engineering offers the only hope of feeding, clothing and housing the growing global population. Skeptics say the financial incentives driving agribusiness leaders like Monsanto, DuPont, Bayer and Cargill — and the political incentives for governments to keep food costs low — continually push all types of biotechnology toward an industrial model of agriculture that is too energy intensive, wasteful of water and dependent on chemicals. The scientific questions underlying debates about biotechnology's risks can be bewildering for nonscientists, but nanotechnology may be even harder to comprehend. The term is derived from the nanometer, or a billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology is often described as dealing in dimensions tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a single hair. But what really matters is that by operating at the nanoscale, researchers can create new materials and extract novel behaviors from familiar ones because they are working with small numbers of molecules, the building blocks of all biology and chemistry. After watching how alarmed activists stopped the nuclear industry in its tracks and slowed the introduction of biotechnology, many nanotechnology advocates propose engaging the public and investing heavily in toxicology research. It is already documented in animal research that some man-made nanoparticles can move easily into the brain and deep into the lungs. "But we don't know how to find these things in the body or how to measure them in the air," said John M. Balbus, a nanotechnology expert at Environmental Defense, an advocacy group that has argued that investment in safety research should be more than doubled and restrictions be imposed on the use of some nanoproducts. "There's a lot of basic gaps in information." Surveys show that most people pay little attention to nanotechnology, which is used in products that make sunscreens invisible, skis lighter and pants stain resistant. Advocates and critics alike thought that might change when Kleinmann, a German subsidiary of Illinois Tool Works, recalled a bathroom cleanser, Magic Nano, on March 28 after nearly 100 customers had trouble breathing. But the brouhaha surrounding the first health-related recall of a "nanotechnology product" subsided rapidly, partly because the later investigation raised doubts whether there were indeed any nanoscale ingredients in the product. If the biotechnology experience is a guide, getting governments more involved in nanotechnology risk management and educating consumers may generate profits in the long term. "Companies need to embrace government oversight that makes consumers comfortable, and they need to offer people choices," said Rebecca J. Goldburg, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense. "Once people are empowered to make choices, they will often take what appears to be riskier options."

189-> Cellphone Ban in Class (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re "School Cellphone Ban Brings, Yes, a Lot of Talk in the City Council" (news article, June 15): When it comes to cellphones in schools, the mayor, the schools chancellor and now the New York City Council may have dialed the wrong number. As a former New York City high school principal, I banned the use of beepers and cellphones. Similar to the military's "don't ask don't tell" policy, our policy was don't show and we won't take it. The decision to ban cellphones in schools should be made at the school level. Principals must have autonomy to make this decision. The mayor, the chancellor and now the City Council must stop micromanaging schools. While the adults fight over this latest political battle, children will continue to be underserved by an educational system that doesn't seem to dial the right number. What a shame that our attention is so misdirected. Bernard Gassaway Jamaica, Queens June 15, 2006

193-> Police and Youths Clash Near Paris
PARIS, Oct. 22 (Reuters)  The French police and youths clashed in a Paris suburb on Sunday as tensions mounted ahead of the anniversary of riots last year that shocked the country and provoked renewed debate about the integration of immigrants into French society. A police spokesman said 30 to 50 individuals were involved in the clashes, in Grigny, south of Paris. He said youths had set several cars on fire and had ordered passengers off a bus and set it on fire, leading to the clash with the police. “There are still some sporadic incidents, mostly stone throwing,” he said. In a statement, the police union urged the government to deploy “a visible and large number” of riot police officers to discourage youths from attacking patrols. Recently, patrols in a number of towns across the country have been hit by gasoline bombs. “This latest clash marks the progressive start of a repeat of the riots of November 2005,” the statement said, referring to the incident in Grigny.

196-> Aging Drugs: Hardest Test Is Still Ahead
A new class of drugs is looming on the horizon that could, if they live up to their promise, avert heart disease, diabetes, cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. By suppressing the common killers of age, the drugs, sirtuin activators, could significantly prolong both health and lifespan. But is the promise a mirage or a serious possibility? The drugs are designed to mimic the effects of caloric restriction, a low calorie but healthful diet known to make laboratory mice live longer and more healthily but is too hard for all but the most ascetic of humans to keep to. One such drug, resveratrol, also a very minor ingredient of red wine, hit the headlines last week with a report by David Sinclair of Harvard Medical School and colleagues that it negates the bad effects of a high-fat diet in mice. Behind the proposed new drugs lies some 15 years of research, much of it by Leonard Guarente of M.I.T. and a talented but fractious group of former students, several of whom have presumed to challenge aspects of his ideas. The research has now reached a point at which at least two companies, Elixir Pharmaceuticals and Sirtris, are trying to develop drugs based in whole or in part on its implications. But success is by no means guaranteed, for several reasons. Caloric restriction has not been proved to improve health or prolong life in people; even if it does, the effect could be much smaller than the 30 percent of extra life and health enjoyed by laboratory mice. Nor is it clear that the genetic mechanism that Dr. Guarente believes is responsible for the effects of caloric restriction, a group of genes known as the SIRT family, is the only one involved. Some biologists suspect that drugs like resveratrol may act not through the SIRT genes but in some other way, which would mean the results reported last week give no support to the idea that the SIRT genes mediate the response to caloric restriction. Finally, the benefits of caloric restriction are assumed to have evolved as a strategy for switching resources between reproduction and tissue maintenance. Such a mechanism would greatly help an organism ride out successive waves of feast and famine. That would explain why mice on caloric restriction generally become infertile. So it is somewhat puzzling that the fat mice fed resveratrol by Dr. Sinclair showed no decline in fertility. Nor have a group of female rhesus monkeys who have been eating a reduced-calorie diet since 1987, scientists at the National Institute on Aging reported recently. If there’s no trade-off between longevity and fertility, the theory of the evolution of caloric restriction could be wrong or incomplete. The road to the discovery of the first SIRT-type gene began in 1991 when two graduate students at M.I.T. asked Dr. Guarente if they could join his laboratory to study the process of aging. They were Brian Kennedy, now at the University of Washington, and Nicanor Austriaco, now a Dominican priest who teaches biology and theology at Providence College in Rhode Island. Aging had long been a difficult and unpromising field for biologists, but Dr. Guarente said his students could have a year to search for genes that might affect aging in yeast. In the event, they took four years just to find a strain of yeast that lived longer than others. A gene called sir-2, for silent information regulator-2, turned out to be responsible for this longevity effect. The lab was then joined by David Sinclair, a young postdoctoral student from the University of New South Wales in Australia, who figured out the unusual mechanism by which sir-2 repressed aging in yeast. Dr. Guarente then found that the gene is activated by a common chemical that reflects the level of metabolism in a cell. He proposed that sir-2 and its counterpart genes in animals were the mediators of caloric restriction: the genes sense when the body is running low on nutrients and direct a wide range of metabolic adjustments, from preserving tissues to burning off fat reserves. Meanwhile a certain amount of tension was developing between Dr. Guarente and Dr. Sinclair, who in 1999 started his own laboratory at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Sinclair published a report that caloric restriction worked through a quite different mechanism in yeast than the one Dr. Guarente had identified. The rivalry was not just scientific. Dr. Guarente, with Dr. Cynthia Kenyon of the University of California, San Francisco, had founded Elixir Pharmaceuticals to develop drugs for greater health and lifespan. Dr. Sinclair started a rival company, Sirtris, to pursue similar goals. “This has run me through so many emotions, some of which I didn’t know I had,” Dr. Guarente told Science magazine in 2004 in an article about the falling out between him and his former student. But continuing research has brought about a realignment of forces. Dr. Guarente and Dr. Sinclair have reconciled, saying their disagreements were technical and never personal. Each of their proposed mechanisms is correct, they say, and yeast uses both to respond to caloric restriction. They have found a common cause in disputing a challenge raised by two other former students of Dr. Guarente, Brian Kennedy and Matt Kaeberlein, who argue that yeast longevity via caloric restriction does not operate through sir-2 at all. These disagreements about the mechanism of caloric restriction are confined to yeast, but may portend future disputes in the far more complex systems of mice and men. Both species possess a gene called SIRT1, which is the counterpart to the sir-2 gene. But they have also evolved six extra SIRT genes, known as SIRTs 2 to 7, which seem to perform related tasks. The protein enzymes made by the genes are known as sirtuins, a word biologists have derived, with a simplicity likely to make etymologists wince, from sir-2. To figure out the role of the seven SIRT genes, both Dr. Guarente and Dr. Sinclair have engineered two sets of genetically altered mice. For each SIRT gene, one strain lacks the gene entirely and another makes extra amounts of the gene’s product. The knockout mice, by their deficiencies, should show what the lost gene does. And its effects will be larger in the overexpressor mice. Dr. Guarente believes that the full suite of seven genes is deployed in response to the stress of caloric restriction. Researchers used to think that the response to caloric restriction was a passive affair, with the organism living longer because it created fewer damaging byproducts of metabolism. This is incorrect in Dr. Guarente’s view. Rather, the seven SIRTs take specific actions to protect the body against insult, including against common diseases of aging. This prompts the hope that approvable drugs could be developed to trigger one or more SIRTs into the actions that ward off specific diseases. The SIRTs intervene in the body’s metabolism in intricate ways that are only beginning to be understood. Mice that overexpress SIRT1 show eight properties of caloric restriction, including low cholesterol and low glucose and insulin blood levels, Dr. Guarente said in a recent talk at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. As for the other SIRT genes, SIRT2 is mostly expressed in the brain, Dr. Guarente said in an interview last month. Its role there is unknown because the SIRT2 knockout mouse appears normal. SIRT genes 3, 4 and 5 are active in the mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles that are part of every cell. They may “vindicate the school of thought that mitochondria are important in aging,” Dr. Guarente said. SIRT6 is active in the nucleus of the cell and SIRT7 in the nucleolus, a compartment of the nucleus reserved for the assembly of ribosomes, the cell’s protein-making machines. A special property of the SIRT1 gene is to increase the number of mitochondria produced by neurons, Jill Milne of Sirtris reported at a recent meeting on the molecular genetics of aging. With extra energy, brain cells may be better able to ward off neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s. The sirtuins could also improve memory, a fact often on the mind of Dr. Sinclair, who has been taking resveratrol for three years. One day last month, he and a reporter spent five minutes searching a Harvard Medical School parking lot for a grimy green Honda Accord. Dr. Sinclair had forgotten where he had parked his car. “So much for resveratrol improving memory,” he grumbled. The car retrieved, he drove to Sirtris’s headquarters in Cambridge, where he shares an office with Christoph Westphal, the company’s chief executive. Dr. Westphal disagrees with his colleague that taking resveratrol is a good idea, saying a therapeutic dose cannot be maintained in the bloodstream. He politely conceded Dr. Sinclair’s position that a lower dose might be effective over the long term. Sirtris has developed a modified form of resveratrol, called SRT501, that reaches high levels in the bloodstream. It is now being tested in people for safety and its ability to control glucose levels. Dr. Westphal plans to gauge the drug’s use in treating diabetes and a rare form of dementia caused by defective mitochondria. Sirtris has also developed several other chemicals that activate sirtuins at doses one-thousandth that of resveratrol. The F.D.A. will approve them, if safe and effective, only to treat specific diseases, but it could be inferred that the drugs might thereby extend lifespan. “We believe this is a new therapeutic modality,” Dr. Westphal said. “We think it can change medical care.” Sirtris has raised $82 million so far. It has a heavyweight group of biotech entrepreneurs on its board and well-known M.I.T. researchers, like Philip Sharp and Robert Langer, on its scientific advisory board. Still, these luminaries could be backing the wrong horse. Across town, that is the view at Sirtris’s rival, Elixir Pharmaceuticals. Elixir has chosen to emphasize leads developed from Dr. Kenyon’s work on a different set of genes that affect aging, rather than on the sirtuin work of Dr. Guarente. “We think the sirtuins are extraordinarily interesting but just don’t yet have the proof that these enzymes will be useful in metabolic disease,” said William Heiden, Elixir’s chief executive. “It’s a proven artifact that resveratrol activates sirtuins,” said Peter DiStefano, Elixir’s chief scientific officer, referring to Dr. Sinclair’s 2003 search for such chemicals. Both Elixir executives argue that the biology of the seven SIRT genes needs to be better worked out before it is worth trying to develop drugs based on them. In their view, it is not even clear if the sirtuins should be activated or inhibited for best effect. Indeed, Elixir has developed several chemicals that inhibit SIRT1’s sirtuin. This has brought about the odd circumstance that Sirtris is trying to activate SIRT1 and Elixir to inhibit it. Can both companies possibly be right? Dr. Guarente’s consulting agreement with Elixir has expired, and he welcomes the interest that Sirtris is now taking in his work. Both activation and inhibition of SIRT1 could be useful, he says judiciously, if during caloric restriction the gene’s activity goes up in some tissues and down in others. The body’s metabolism is governed by such a complex array of genetic circuits that it will be years before the role of the seven SIRTs is fully understood. But if they really embody an ancient mechanism for fortifying the body against disease, then all that is needed is a safe drug that tricks the SIRT genes into thinking feast is famine. The theory is enticing, even if sirtuins and certainty still lie far apart.

201-> Coca-Cola in India (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “For 2 Giants of Soft Drinks, a Crisis in a Crucial Market,” by Amelia Gentleman (Market Place column, Business Day, Aug. 23), about the pesticide row in India: The Coca-Cola Company recognized the serious cultural and political forces involved from Day 1. Our company responded quickly through the industry and on our own. Our third-party test results demonstrated the purity of our products through four press conferences and two rounds of advertising, as well as in dozens of meetings with government officials and concerned stakeholders throughout India. While engaging in a highly politicized and emotionally charged environment is never easy, our actions are guided by doing what’s right for the Indian consumer. We believe our serious approach is bearing fruit by moving the discussion to our sound scientific findings, re-establishing consumer trust and enabling us to continue building a healthy business in India.

202-> Cocktails From the Tomato Crop
This summer’s latest cocktail ingredient is tomato water, the almost clear but flavor-packed juice that drips from chopped tomatoes put in cheesecloth. At Suba, on the Lower East Side, plum tomatoes are diced and marinated with vodka overnight, then puréed and allowed to drip. Its Unbloody Mary, left, is made by mixing three ounces of chilled tomato water with two ounces of vodka and pouring it into a martini glass rimmed with ground white pepper. It’s garnished with a cherry tomato. Savoy, in SoHo, has a version called the Belladonna, below, that involves making tomato water with a purée of tomatoes, celery and jalapeños. The tomato water, mixed with some juice from pickled peppers, is shaken with ice and Polish potato vodka, poured into a martini glass and garnished with a piece of tomato and a pickled pepper.  In the England of yore, dessert meant a bowl of fresh fruit after the main course. So when Edward A. Bunyard, a nurseryman and wine connoisseur, wrote “The Anatomy of Dessert” in 1929, he did not discuss pies and cakes and such, but gave advice, in 14 chapters, on his country’s best fruits. His lovely book, out of print for more than 70 years, has just been reprinted by Modern Library ($14.95, paperback). Mr. Bunyard’s concern was seasonality, and the moment of optimum flavor and texture in a piece of fruit. Who couldn’t understand what he meant by: “the perfect Apricot is not easily come by; too often we find a mealy cotton-wool texture where we looked for a translucent and melting flesh.” He advises peeling fresh figs to avoid a slightly “green” flavor and has trouble understanding why raspberries are not as popular as strawberries with cream. This little book is filled with thoughts, evaluations and bons mots about fruit, with suggestions of wines to serve with them. Bing is what Elizabeth Ting and her partners call their specialty, a four-inch disk of sesame-coated pastry that is filled with tasty meat, vegetables or fruit, some spicy and some not ($1.50 to $1.95). Ms. Ting has sold bings at two stores called Unique Pastry in Flushing, Queens, for the past couple of years. Now she has opened a new bing store and cafe, called Roll and Dough, at 135 West Third Street (Avenue of the Americas) in Manhattan. Bings make great picnic food without reheating and can also be warmed (a minute in the microwave) and cut into wedges to serve with drinks. The store makes roast pork buns and puffy little dumplings, too. More substantial food, and delivery, will be added in coming weeks: (212) 253-2871.

204-> National Briefing | South: Georgia: 3 Toddlers And 2 Mothers Are Run Over
A man ran over three toddlers and two women with his car outside a McDonald's in Covington, southeast of Atlanta, the police said. The man, Lanny Barnes, 36, was in custody, and faces charges including aggravated assault, said Covington Assistant Police Chief Almond Turner. "All indications are that he intentionally hit them," said Chief Turner. Witnesses said the car went over a curb as the victims left the restaurant and hit them and the building before backing up and hitting them again, the police said. A 2-year-old girl was in critical condition, and two boys, ages 3 and 4, were in stable condition, the police said. The women, ages 33 and 36, are sisters and the mothers of the children. Both were in stable condition, the authorities said.

205-> Children: Antibiotics Unhelpful Against Many Ear Infections
Antibiotic treatment for children with ear infections is not helpful in all cases, a new study has found. The report, which appears in the of The Lancet, analyzed data from six studies and included more than 1,600 children from 6 months to 12 years old. In a few cases, researchers found, antibiotics were useful. Fifty-five percent of untreated children under 2 with infections in both ears still had pain or fever after three to seven days, while only 30 percent of those given antibiotics did. The results for children up to 12 with a fluid discharge from the ear were roughly the same. This suggests that it is advisable to use antibiotics in such cases. But treating infants who had infection in only one ear was ineffective — 40 percent of untreated children under 2 still had pain after three to seven days, and so did 35 percent of those who received antibiotics. In children older than 2, antibiotics were generally unhelpful. Twenty-six percent of untreated children still had pain or fever after three to seven days, and so did 19 percent of children who received treatment. The results do not mean that children with ear infections should be left untreated, says Dr. Maroeska M. Rovers, the lead author of the study and an epidemiologist at the University Medical Center in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “Our study showed that not all children benefit from antibiotics,” she said. “But children should be treated with analgesics to control pain and fever. If the symptoms are worsening, or if the analgesics are not helping, parents should call the physician.”

206-> DINING/IRVINGTON; Diner Fare Taken To a Higher Level
DESPITE a couple of changes in name and ownership over the years, many customers still refer to River City Grille as Benny's, opened in 1943 by Benny D'Agostino. And though the facade has been freshened and its chrome bands polished, the structure remains a dining car, with a bit of diner thrown in. Today's patrons seem to like it that way. The restaurant still functions much as it did in the old days; it is a friendly spot with few pretensions, and sometimes it seems that the whole neighborhood has turned out, particularly on weekends, for a convivial drink or dinner. The dishes may not be intricate, but they are surprisingly interesting. The use of appealing accompaniments and garnishes -- truffle oil, corn salsa, spinach, roasted beets, jalapeños, couscous, whipped potatoes, asparagus, fresh herbs or various risottos -- take basic American diner fare to a higher level. Refreshing salads glisten with discrete, well-balanced dressings. Baby greens dressed in a sweet-tart wine vinaigrette and three small cylinders of creamy goat cheese rest atop a bed of sliced beets scattered with walnuts -- a savory combination of salty, sweet and tangy. Sweet and fruity flavors balance pungent Gorgonzola with tomato, buttery pine nuts, apple and mellow balsamico. And the appeal of Thai beef salad -- the small chunks of beef freshly seared, mingled with arugula and endive and treated to a spicy peanut dressing -- is only slightly diminished by the addition of "crispy wontons," the kind on the table of some Chinese restaurants. Some starters at our table were unimpressive: the crab cake could have been hotter and better crisped, the coconut shrimp and the duck spring roll were standard. But others were extremely satisfying. The popcorn shrimp -- fresh, crisp and juicy little morsels, offered as a special one night -- deserve a permanent place on the menu. A bowl of small Prince Edward Island mussels, showered with roasted corn and a fine vegetable julienne, packed a bit of jalapeño heat and left lots of terrific mussel broth for sopping. When we requested a half-order of the entree "simply grilled" shrimp as an appetizer, we were brought a delicious improvisation of three perfectly grilled jumbos placed on a dainty well-dressed salad of baby greens; ginger-orange dipping sauce came on the side but was unnecessary. Like the shrimp, fish entrees were cooked to the precise moment. Delicate, glossy cod flaked beautifully. A sprinkling of balsamico and a fistful of fresh oregano brought out the meaty flavor of wild salmon, and the firm flesh of swordfish remained moist under a light grilling. The beef-eaters among us were also well taken care of. A tender piece of filet mignon, done as requested, came juicy and flavorful, though the onion rings, like the fries here, were flaccid, fried too far in advance. Among items that could be ordered "simply grilled," shrimp were standouts, but darkened scallops had lingered too long on the grill. The big disappointment, the clunker in the crowd, arrived as chicken "under brick," one of our favorite methods of cooking chicken. But instead of being seared and succulent, the portion was dry and grossly thick, with no indication of having been flattened, as though the bird had been overcooked by some other method at an earlier time. Except for decent enough gelato, desserts proved sweet and unimpressive: doughy berry cobbler, ricotta cheesecake with strawberry topping, overly sweet Key lime pie. Not one of them was in keeping with the subtlety of some of the main dishes. Still, for comfort food, some may like the excessive brownie sundae overloaded by a mountain of whipped cream. River City Grille 6 South Broadway Irvington (914) 591-2033 GOOD THE SPACE -- An odd jumble of additions -- back dining room, bar and lounge -- branch out from the original, 1943 dining-car restaurant.

Moderately priced wine list with handy descriptions. A few interesting wines of the day are offered by the glass for about $7 to $11. THE BILL -- Lunch entrees, $13 to $27. Dinner entrees, $18 to $27. Brunch entrees, $14 to $17 (breads and fruit salad included). Children's menu, $7 to $9.

207-> No Longer Avoiding That Talk About the Inevitable
JOSHUA SLOCUM, executive director of the Funeral Consumers Alliance, often says, “It’s time to have death at the dinner table.” I have had some dinner parties that felt like a slow death. But what Mr. Slocum means is being able to talk about planning a funeral just as we talk about, say, that coming class reunion. “There’s some socially outmoded idea that it’s not a polite topic of conversation,” Mr. Slocum said. We were having this conversation because I wanted to know how children — meaning middle-aged children like me and my sisters — bring up the topic of what kind of funeral parents want when that (hopefully) far-off time comes. The first step, and perhaps the most difficult, is to actually raise the topic. “Humor works 75 percent of the time,” he said. Then he told me a cremation joke. I decided that although my parents enjoy a hearty laugh as much as anyone, that probably was not the best approach. According to a poll commissioned two years ago by the National Funeral Directors Association, 57 percent of Americans have preplanned their own funeral or intend to. Close to a year ago, I e-mailed my father, asking if he had ever thought about the issue. (I find that in my family heavy issues are sometimes handled best over the Internet.) He said he and my mother planned on being immortal. I spoke to my mother. She said it was really up to us, because she believed funerals were for the living. Then she told me about some things she would prefer not to have at her funeral. “See, we wouldn’t have known that,” I told her. The tone of the conversation became slightly tense. I changed the topic. Recently, I decided to bypass the computer altogether and picked up the phone to call my father. I knew that my parents wanted to be cremated, as my grandmother had been. Not surprisingly, because he is über-organized, my father had already bought and paid for the plots, urns, black granite markers and endowment care for the two sites — about $2,835 for both in 1999 dollars. “It’s about as budget as you can get,” my father said. That is true: the median cost of a funeral with cremation is $3,500, according to the National Funeral Directors Association, while the median price of a regular funeral is $6,500. That includes a coffin, the services of the funeral director and embalming, but not the opening and closing of the burial site, since that varies so widely by state, said Celine Clark, a spokeswoman for the association. A word of warning. Paying for cemetery plots is one thing that makes good sense, especially if your family wants to be buried together and space is at a premium. And preplanning a service with a funeral home — the transportation, the music, the church or synagogue, the flowers — can be a good idea. But prepaying for the service is not always the best idea. Laws vary by state about what happens if you prepay and the funeral home goes out of business, so it is important to check your protection. “Our advice to consumers if you prepay is to go over all available options,” Ms. Clark said. Are you locked into a price or does it vary with inflation? Are the services portable if you move to another state? A better option, if a parent is worried that a funeral may be a financial burden on offspring, is to put the money in a trust. But back to me and my parents. The question of who the funeral is for, those who have died or those left behind, is an ancient one, said Rabbi Jeffrey Sirkman of Larchmont Temple in Westchester County, New York. “In the book of Genesis, when Abraham buries his wife, Sarah, the rabbis of old ask, ‘Is the eulogy for the living or the dead?’ And we say, ‘You’re right and you’re right.’ ” My parents said it was up to us, their daughters, to decide what kind of funeral or memorial service we wanted to give them. But while talking about it, I found out that my father had asked cemetery officials to ensure that he has a military honor guard at his burial for his service in World War II and the Korean War. And I learned that neither he nor my mother wanted anyone, including rabbis, to officiate at a service. They would prefer that close friends share their memories. “But I guess I would add a proviso that anything that would comfort the survivors would be O.K.,” my father told me. “I wouldn’t turn over in my grave.” The trouble is, Mr. Slocum said, that “many parents assume they know what their kids want, like an open casket, but they never mentioned it to their kids.’’ “They say, ‘It’s all taken care of, honey,’ but that doesn’t mean a darn thing,” he added. “What’s been taken care of? Kids usually want to honor their parents, and that can lead to a lot of guilt — I don’t know what Mom would want.” My friend Carol thinks it is a great idea to discuss all this when your parents are still healthy. Her mother died five years ago from a recurrence of cancer, and “when the end was near, my job was to be cheerleader-in-chief,” she said. “In the last three months, I could not say, ‘Let’s talk about the end.’ ” Sometimes that is the role of the clergy. Rabbi Sirkman said that when attending to the terminally ill or the elderly, he may say, “ ‘Is there anything you would like me to say in tribute to you when we say our good-byes?’ I try to phrase the question in such a way to bring up options.” Carol said she felt that the service had done her mother proud, but, “Of course you feel you would have liked to have known more.” On the other hand, she said, “If it had been important to her, I think she would have led me to that discussion.” The best thing to do after making decisions about your burial and funeral is to write them down. The Funeral Consumers Alliance provides a booklet through its Web site (www.funerals.org) enticingly called “Before I Go, You Should Know.” It is a pamphlet in which you can write phone numbers, vital statistics, where funeral plans are on file and whether or not you want, for example, embalming, viewing, a private family service or a graveside service only. You can write in what you want and do not want at your funeral/memorial service and your options of a coffin (check one: plain pine box, buy the best, buy the cheapest, wood, metal, fiberglass, use a rental casket, shroud only.) The details go on. Mr. Slocum suggests that the information be kept handy, not in a safe deposit box, where it will probably be seen only after the burial. “If your kids aren’t sure, the default will be the most elaborate and the most expensive,” he warned. “Most cave into real or perceived social pressures.” I guess I should not feel too bad about the difficulty of discussing the issue. It turns out that even those who deal with death every day may not always prepare their own families. Jack Hogan, funeral director of Quinn-Fogarty Funeral Home in Flushing, Queens, said his father, who was also a funeral director, did not make any preparations. “I remember when it came time to select a casket, my mother was lost,” he said. “I’ve always found it ironic.” The only directive his father gave, Mr. Hogan said, was that “anyone who came to the funeral should be invited out to eat and drink all they can, and everyone was.’’ “That was quite a bill at the restaurant,” he said. Mr. Hogan, on the other hand, has his arrangements clearly mapped out. “I want to have a bagpiper,” he said. “And I want to make sure everyone is taken out to lunch.”

The Republican chairman of the Senate commerce committee said he was drafting a bill to ban excessive gasoline price increases, a day after the Federal Trade Commission said it had failed to find any illegal manipulation of prices. The chairman, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, disclosed plans for the legislation at a hearing in which lawmakers voiced frustration about rising fuel prices. Mr. Stevens said specifics of the bill, including a precise definition of price gouging, had yet to be determined. Testifying at the hearing, the trade commission chairwoman, Deborah Platt Majoras, said a definition should consider local market conditions.

210-> Profit Falls by Half at Dell
Three days after its announcement of a vast safety recall, Dell reported little but bad news yesterday: profits down by half, and an informal Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting. Speaking from China to Wall Street analysts in a conference call after the earnings announcement, Michael S. Dell, the company’s founder and chairman, said, “We are not satisfied with our performance, and we will do better.” While the company has told analysts for more than a year that it will do better, it has not been able to follow through. In a changing market, Dell has been unable to gain traction against competitors as it has in the past, when it has cut prices to gain market share. The chief executive, Kevin B. Rollins, said yesterday that the company had cut prices “too aggressively” in a number of markets to win market share, which hurt its profitability. “We didn’t do a good job of it,” he said. Analysts remained frustrated. Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers asked Mr. Rollins, “Why should we believe that your actions will be any better than they have been?” Investors were also frustrated, with Dell shares dropping more than 5 percent in extended trading after the earnings report. Dell said net income dropped 51 percent, to $502 million, or 22 cents a share, from $1.02 billion, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 5 percent, to $14.09 billion, from $13.43 billion. The company warned four weeks ago that its earnings would be weaker than expected. Dell also revealed that it had received a notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission in August of last year that the S.E.C. was conducting an informal investigation. The company said it involved “revenue recognition and other accounting and financial reporting matters.” The company refused to give any further details, but a spokesman said it did not involve the backdating of options, a problem affecting many technology companies. James M. Schneider, the chief financial officer, said the audit committee of the company’s board was conducting an inquiry. He said that after an exchange of letters with the S.E.C., Dell found “something that warranted further investigation” in its accounting of about 18 months ago. He refused to give details. The company also announced Thursday that it would use processors from Advanced Micro Devices in some of its desktop PC’s. Dell had exclusively used Intel processors for its PC’s; it announced in May that it would begin using A.M.D. chips in some servers. It said the use of the A.M.D. processors would help lower the cost of the computer components. Dell has been pressed to reduce its component costs to improve its profit margins. Operating margins have dropped to 5.1 percent from 8.7 percent a year ago. “It’s a staggering sequential decline in margins,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Dell has cut prices but has not gained market share from its competitors. “The pricing riddle was not clarified,” Mr. Sacconaghi said. “What it does say is that the price cuts were ineffectual.” From a 52-week high of $37.05, Dell’s shares closed Thursday at $22.80, up 7 cents on the day, but fell to $21.64 in extended trading after the earnings announcement. Mr. Rollins said it was “a little early to tell” if the recall of 4.1 million notebook computer batteries would have any impact on sales. “We are not anticipating anything,” he said. He said the sweeping safety recall, the largest in the history of the consumer electronics industry, was done “so customers have trust that we always do the right thing.” The cost of the recall, which could exceed $300 million, is being shared with Sony, whose manufacturing was cited in the battery flaw. The company’s Web site with details about the recall had 1.26 million visitors on Tuesday, the first day of operation, according to ComScore Networks, a market research firm. By Wednesday, 150,000 orders for replacement batteries had been received, said Bob Pearson, a Dell spokesman. Mr. Rollins said the company saw signs that its customer service, another area of concern, was improving. But he said Dell would spend another $50 million in this area beyond the $100 million already committed. The cost of hiring more operators for call centers and other personnel is having an effect on earnings. The company has 22 percent more employees and its operating expenses rose 19 percent from a year ago. Dell’s basic problem is that it is set up to sell the bulk of its computers in the market showing the slowest growth: United States corporations. Sales in Asia were up 27 percent year over year and in the Americas, outside of the United States, up 29 percent. But in the United States, sales grew only 3 percent. Worldwide sales of desktop PC’s fell 4 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. But Dell said revenue from notebook computer sales rose 8 percent, as unit shipments rose 22 percent. But analysts said that really underscored another weakness for Dell. While the overall PC market is slowing, to annual unit growth of about 6 percent, the market for notebook PC’s in the United States has hardly slowed at all. It is expected to grow about 41 percent this year, compared with 47 percent last year, said Samir Bhavnani, an analyst with Current Analysis. Consumers prefer to buy notebooks in stores rather than online, said Ted Schadler, principal analyst for consumer technology at Forrester Research. Dell sells online direct to consumers, though it displays its models in mall kiosks and is experimenting with displays in larger spaces in malls. He said consumers seemed to want to feel the notebook before they bought it. But Mr. Rollins, the chief executive, said, “We disagree with that.” According to data from I.D.C., Dell’s market share in the United States for notebook computers rose to 31.9 percent in the second quarter from 29 percent in the first quarter. “The Dell model is a vibrant model,’’ Mr. Rollins said. “We are really going to stick with the Dell model.”

212-> DINING/COLD SPRING HARBOR; Restaurant, Reinvented, Plays a New Tune
EVERYONE loves a makeover. Turn on the television and somewhere a poor soul is getting an overhaul of his wardrobe, his body or his home. Restaurant renovations are just as popular, a case in point being Trattoria Grasso, which reinvented itself in July as Grasso's Fine Dining and Jazz. The changes here are more than cosmetic. This is no longer a casual Italian cafe but an upscale American restaurant. The menu features steaks, chops and fish with a few Asian spins, like ahi tuna crusted with sesame seeds and accompanied by mango relish and wasabi mashed potatoes, or an appetizer of mussels steamed with coconut milk, red curry paste and lemon grass. At the bottom of the menu, almost as a postscript, are five entrees labeled "always-available favorites." These holdovers from the old menu include tagliatelle Bolognese; the pasta has a stand-up-and-take-notice meat sauce touched with cream. At one time, Jim and Gail Grasso had an empire of three restaurants, in Huntington and Roslyn as well as Cold Spring Harbor. But the two others closed in the late 90's, and since the couple's divorce in 2000, Ms. Grasso has been the sole owner of the remaining restaurant. The chef, Tony Canales, had worked for the Grassos since 1993 and came to Cold Spring Harbor in 1998. Now completely renovated, Grasso's is a sophisticated beauty. An attractive granite-topped bar and an arrangement of birds of paradise and ginger blossoms are the first things patrons see as they enter. Behind the bar is a room dominated by a baby grand piano, where live jazz plays Wednesday through Saturday nights. On a recent Saturday, a talented trio and singer turned dinner out into a special evening. In a second dining room, the music can be heard but is not the focus of the meal. Both rooms have been beautifully decorated with beige sponge-painted walls dotted with large framed mirrors and agreeable art: landscapes, still lifes and a few tributes to jazz. Each table is crowned with a single rose and white napkins with "Grasso's" embroidered in dark red. Both the memorable food and the smooth service are as elegant as the surroundings. On one of my visits, the appetizers included as a special some very tasty baked oysters topped with horseradish, bread crumbs and herbs. From the standing menu, my tablemates and I also enjoyed the pan-seared diver sea scallops over a sweet pea purée; the jumbo grilled shrimp in spicy chipotle barbecue sauce; and those Thai-inspired Prince Edward Island mussels. Salads were also good picks, whether a classic Caesar or the more fanciful Gail's peach salad, a delightful toss of mesclun, grilled peaches, walnuts and goat cheese. With so much strong competition, the bland roasted garlic-goat cheese flan and the chilled beet timbale, a tower of underseasoned shredded beets, were also-rans. Among the entrees, it's hard to choose between the hearty meats and pastas and the lightly turned out fish. Grasso's serves a velvety filet mignon with a pat of red wine-herb butter. Also outstanding were a moist wild-mushroom-stuffed chicken breast and a pork chop filled with prosciutto and fontina in a shiitake mushroom sauce -- another special. Among the seafood offerings, top honors went to the pan-roasted monkfish with fried capers and to two specials: creamy risotto with sea scallops, peas, fresh tomatoes, white truffle oil and sage, and a whole branzino, boned at tableside. But pan-roasted red snapper was inexplicably tough. A restaurant of this caliber should have a more interesting bread basket, possibly one with housemade rolls. Instead, it held half slices of unexceptional Italian bread. Its accompaniments, though, were special: black olive tapenade, olive oil infused with garlic and basil, and grainy mustard butter. Desserts were housemade beauties that ended the meal on a high note, especially the moist white chocolate bread pudding topped with cinnamon ice cream, the tiramisù (heavy on mascarpone, as it should be) and a sensational napoleon of phyllo pastry, whipped cream and mixed berries. That is not to slight the triple mousse cake, a chocolate lover's dream. Grasso's 134 Main Street (Route 25A) Cold Spring Harbor (631) 367-6060 VERY GOOD THE SPACE -- Lovely double storefront. Although it is completely wheelchair accessible inside, it has a few steps outside. THE CROWD -- Couples and small groups. Live music Wednesday through Saturday nights and on the terrace Sundays from 3 to 6 p.m., while the weather holds. THE BAR -- Beautiful stone-topped bar. Around 50 bottles on the international wine list ($18 to $250). A dozen wines by the glass, $7 to $10. THE BILL -- Lunch entrees, $10 to $16; dinner entrees, $19 to $33. WHAT WE LIKE -- Baked oysters, mussels with coconut curry sauce, grilled shrimp, pan-seared sea scallops, peach salad, Caesar salad; stuffed pork chop, stuffed chicken breast, monkfish, filet mignon, tagliatelle Bolognese; all desserts. IF YOU GO -- Lunch, Monday to Friday, noon to 3:30 p.m.; Saturday, 1 to 3:30 p.m. Dinner, Monday and Tuesday, 5 to 9 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday, till 10 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, till 11 p.m.; Sunday, 2 to 9 p.m. Reviewed Sept. 24, 2006

215-> If You Build It, Will They Come?
Jean Nouvel is standing on an industrial bridge over the Mississippi River clutching a fat cigar. Water rushes through the locks underneath. Wisps of white smoke rise from the smokestacks of an electric plant a hundred yards downstream, alongside the sad concrete silos of an abandoned grain elevator. Just beyond it, the gleaming blue form of Nouvel’s new Guthrie Theater complex in Minneapolis is the latest addition to this haunted panorama: a monument to culture conceived on an industrial scale. To a contemporary architect like Nouvel, few sites are likely to conjure more conflicting emotions. In the 1920’s, when Le Corbusier famously described the industrial icons of the American Midwest as the “magnificent first fruits of the new age,” it was both a battle cry for a new architectural order and a jab at a complacent bourgeoisie. Today, Modernism’s utopian agenda is long dead. The industrial warehouses that line the Mississippi have been transformed into plush lofts for yuppie couples. And the industrial aesthetic has been reduced to a matter of personal style. “The references to silos and mills — I was nourished on that,” Nouvel said. “At the same time, this was exactly the site of the birth of the city. The boats stopped to load and unload here. So it was very important for me to create a kind of belvedere where you can see this story of the city. The other materials are a contradiction: the blue exteriors, the reflective surfaces. It is a commentary, if you like, on the evolution of architecture.” Architects like Nouvel contribute to that transformation. If the Guthrie Theater celebrates the city’s industrial legacy, it is also part of a familiar formula that draws on a blend of cultural institutions, convention centers, sports venues and brand-name architecture in an often desperate attempt to resurrect dying urban centers. This can turn living cities into Potemkin villages: sanitized shopping environments for the global consumer. Still, however fashionable it is to attack the wave of new architectural monuments as part of a shallow effort to attract tourist dollars, many of these designs involve some sort of sincere effort to repair a torn urban fabric. What’s more, in cities like Minneapolis, Denver and Toledo, Ohio, where the death rattle of the middle class is still comparatively faint, the civic spirit often feels more vigorous than in global cities like Los Angeles and New York, which increasingly resemble playgrounds for the rich. The result is often a more experimental brand of architecture. The cultural landscape of much of America was shaped by civic-minded business leaders at the end of the 19th century; they saw culture both as a symbol of a more cultivated way of life and as a way to compete with great cultural centers like Chicago. That shift was prompted by the World’s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893, a demonstration of cultural ambition that the architect Louis Sullivan said would spread like a disease through the country. In Minneapolis, a city with a particularly powerful philanthropic tradition that dates back to the ambitions of two dueling Midwestern aristocrats, a lumber baron and a railroad czar, this awakening also created a climate that was unusually open to architectural experimentation. Ralph Rapson’s 1963 Guthrie Theater, for example, which is slated for demolition this month, was a progressive view of conventional theater design for its time. Its open facade, pierced by oval apertures, presented the interior life of the theater audience as a form of civic spectacle; its “vineyard terrace” seating pattern thrust the actors into the center of the audience, so that the two formed part of a shared community. Similarly, the stepped interior spiral of the original Walker Art Center, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes in the 1970’s, not only made for a wonderful place to view art, but its blank brick exterior was also a model of restraint, reflecting an age when the spirit of civic responsibility was expressed through stoic reserve, not architectural flamboyance. At the same time, both buildings were expressions of a society willing not only to engage in contemporary cultural life, but also to take the risks that are a necessary part of pushing it forward. That began to change with the erosion of urban centers across America in the late 70’s, a phenomenon fueled by so-called white flight and a sinking national economy. And it has since been replaced by a more developer-driven formula: the insipid blend of cultural tourism and corporate homogeneity that can produce urban centers littered with a range of architectural statements yet nonetheless hollow at the core. As Richard Flood, a former curator at the Walker who moved to New York last year, put it: “The people who were backing the cultural initiatives of the 1950’s and 60’s are still the best people out there, but they’re dying off. These people had very elegant ideas about promoting and supporting culture. They were also the ones who helped create it, which is a very different situation than the ones who simply inherit their vision. Now the goals of these institutions and their boards are very different. It’s no longer about the joy of bringing culture to a community. It’s about the needs of the institutions to pay off their debts.” The trustees, he added, want to hear how you’re going to get people in the door. Even so, it is hard to deny that the recent boom in civic building, almost all of it financed by private institutions, has produced some major architectural achievements. (Nouvel’s Guthrie is joined in Minneapolis by an array of lesser but still notable projects, like a public library by Cesar Pelli and expansions of the Minneapolis Institute of Art and the Children’s Theatre Company, both by Michael Graves. And Frank Gehry recently began working on an addition to his 1993 design for the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, a city landmark a mile downriver from Nouvel’s.) What’s more, these works often reflect a tradition of egalitarianism that harks back to the middle-class values of a younger, more tolerant America. In creating a strong visual link between his big blue boxes of the Guthrie and the industrial landscape that surrounds it, for example, Nouvel is making an aesthetic statement as well as asserting a cultural vision that, like the mass productions of an assembly-line age, is for and of the masses. That romantic, populist message is reinforced by the enormous cantilevered form that projects out from the building’s facade more than 175 feet toward the river. Precariously suspended above the riverbank, the bridgelike structure is a viewing platform where theatergoers can wander out and take in a romantic view of Minneapolis’s heroic industrial roots. At the other end of the building, a similar bridgelike structure links the theater complex to the scene shop on top of an aboveground parking ramp. The bridge conjures the network of skyways that, in winter, is the connective tissue of the city’s urban core. Across town, Herzog & de Meuron’s recent addition to the Walker reveals a similar sensitivity to the urban surroundings. Along Hennepin Avenue, a main thoroughfare to downtown, the facade is entirely transparent, so that visitors on their way to the galleries remain on view as part of the urban experience. In back, the museum will open onto a garden (yet to be completed) anchored by a James Turrell light sculpture. The contrast between the emptiness of the street and the tranquillity of the grounds evokes the museum as both a corrective to social alienation and a place of emotional reflection. Yet in transforming the museum’s interior life into public spectacle, the design also suggests how art can change the world. In case you miss the point, the structure’s five-story aluminum-clad tower is set slightly off balance, conveying the dynamic energy of a vibrant, living culture rather than the static energy of a museum where dead cultural relics are buried. Both the new Guthrie and the expanded Walker aggressively seek to engage the urban context around them. They present a similar antidote to the insularity of cities whose main public space is often the mall: the city as public spectacle. And they do so by making visible a beauty that was already there. The revival of Denver’s downtown cultural district may represent a more concentrated example of this trend. The city’s historic core already is etched with the memories of abandoned urban visions. It is a model of the City Beautiful movement first promoted by the Chicago exhibition, anchored by city hall and a series of symmetrical flowering gardens that form Denver’s main axis. In the late 1960’s, the city invited Gio Ponti to design its art museum. Ponti, best known for his design of Milan’s sleekly beveled Pirelli Tower, a monument of postwar Italian style, was entering a period in his career when the relationship between modern and classical worlds was no longer clear. Clad in shimmering gray glass tiles, the Denver Art Museum is one of his most bizarre structures: a vertical museum that is pierced by slotlike openings and is a picture of monastic seclusion. “It is like he wanted the museum to be a castle,” said Daniel Libeskind, who is now completing the design for a major addition to the museum. “It has defensive walls and an elevator core, very utilitarian. It is very interesting that this was his view of Denver. He said, if this is really Middle America, I’m going to create this fortress of art.” Denver’s solution to this approach seemed to be to pile on more architectural imagery. Fifteen years ago, Michael Graves was hired to design a major expansion for the public library across from Ponti’s museum. As a composition, the project is not Graves’s worst. Its geometric forms (a cluster of cylinders and squares capped by an array of decorative roofs) has some of the haunting qualities of the designs of Aldo Rossi, who saw cities as repositories of memory as melancholy as a de Chirico painting. But the overblown scale of the library gives it a more sinister edge, like a Disney interpretation of Albert Speer’s designs for the Third Reich. When the city hired Libeskind to design the museum addition in 2000, it seemed as if it were trying to heal a deep urban wound by piling on yet more architectural forms. And Libeskind’s plan soon expanded to include an adjoining residential project, one of the clichés of contemporary urban revitalization. Yet it would be wrong to say that he produced a work that is insensitive to its context. The museum, clad in titanium, sits on a critical site midway between the old Civic Center Park and the Golden Triangle, a historic district that has become a center of restaurants and galleries. Its jagged forms are a reflection of the two different street grids that collide there, a remnant of Denver’s origins as a collection of small Western towns. Libeskind positioned his building at the edge of the site to create a public plaza that connects the two main districts. The pointed form of the upper-level gallery shoots out over 13th Avenue, as if straining to connect to the old historic core to the north. A bridge spans the street, piercing Ponti’s building and pulling it into the composition. The residential component also has an urban function: it wraps around three sides of a large public parking structure, enlivening what could otherwise have been a deadening black hole. “They have an ambition to not just be a cow town in the Rockies,” Libeskind said. “And so people began to see the museum not just as a building but as part of a whole city. The synergy of these buildings is more important than any one by itself.” It is also the mark of a young city. In Europe, as he says, the growth patterns of a place like Arles, France, are guided by its ancient Roman grid. The roots of a city like Denver lie elsewhere: in the collision between small-town America and the car culture that erupted in the latter half of the 20th century. In some sense, architects today still try to resolve that conflict. Their success will largely be determined by whether it is possible to wed their aesthetic aims to a larger urban purpose, and, more pointedly, by whether it is possible to manufacture urban diversity through aesthetic diversity. If there is a project that revives one’s faith in the ability of architecture — in its purest form — to have lasting impact on how we experience our cities, it is the recently completed Glass Pavilion at the Toledo Museum of Art. A century ago, this was a major industrial city, mostly known for its production of high-quality glass. But industry fled long ago, and the city’s core is largely abandoned and derelict. Designed by Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa of the Japanese firm Sanaa, the pavilion is set within a small garden opposite the brooding, columned facade of the Beaux-Arts museum, a monument to the cultural aspirations of a once-thriving city. The project is comparatively humble. The glass used to build it was manufactured in Germany and molded in China; most of Toledo’s glassworks closed long ago. Its low form is composed of a series of curving glass walls, creating the occasional illusion that it is dissolving into its surroundings. Yet it is also a perfect work of art, one of the most delicately conceived I have seen in years. The layers of glass create a series of interstitial spaces that are used to regulate the climate inside the building. These cavities also create the illusion that you are constantly sliding between spaces that you can see but cannot enter, which gives them an added seductive pull. The entire composition has been placed within its garden setting with exquisite care, just off axis from the art museum across the street, as if the architects’ aim were to not disrupt the surrounding cityscape. The pavilion is proof that a single architectural moment, created out of the deepest sense of humility, can have an impact more resonant than a major planning campaign. It reminds us that there are greater urban values than an endless cycle of consumption. And it begins to create a sense of place within the larger fabric of the city, something that to an architectural tourist may be more important than where you can buy a handbag.

218-> Trained by Inmates, New Best Friends for Disabled Veterans
CONCORD, Mass., Oct. 27 — Rainbow looks like any other Labrador retriever, but she is not a pet. Trained by a prison inmate, her mission is to help Roland Paquette, an injured veteran of the conflict in Afghanistan, stay on his new feet, the ones he got after an explosion destroyed his legs. While veterans who lose their sight or hearing or must use a wheelchair have long had “service” dogs as companions, Rainbow is one of the first dogs in the country trained to work with someone who uses both a wheelchair and prosthetics to get around. Mr. Paquette’s hope is that eventually Rainbow will allow him to abandon his canes altogether and rely only on the metal handle attached to the harness she wears around her torso. “I’d much rather be able to walk with her at my side than with the canes,” said Mr. Paquette, who is 28. “It makes me less obvious.” Rainbow is the first graduate of a new program, Canines for Combat Veterans, at a tiny nonprofit group here called Neads, or New England Assistance Dog Services. The organization has been training service dogs for the disabled since 1976. “I think we’re going to have to double the number of dogs we train to meet the need,” said Sheila O’Brien, Neads’s executive director. “Because of advances in medicine, a lot more veterans are surviving their injuries than ever before, and we want to be able to help as many of them as we can.” In late 2001, President Bush signed a law authorizing the Veterans Administration to underwrite programs like Canines for Combat Veterans. But the Veterans Administration is still studying the matter, so Neads must raise all the money for its program from private sources. It sells naming rights for its dogs — Rainbow got her name after a group of Rainbow Girls from Rhode Island, an organization affiliated with the Masons, held pancake breakfasts and other events to raise $500 for the right. That fund-raising has proved so successful that Ms. O’Brien has doubled the price to name a dog, but she said it cost up to $17,000 to buy and train a dog. Recipients of dogs are expected to raise about $9,500 for their animal with the help of the organization. Ms. O’Brien also hopes to double the size of a program in which service dogs are trained by prison inmates. Puppies begin their training in the Neads “nursery,” where they are housebroken and introduced to basic skills. Then about 80 percent of the dogs go to live in a prison cell with an inmate who completes their training. It takes about half the time to train dogs in prison as it does in foster homes, Ms. O’Brien said, because of the more intensive training they get from inmates. Inmates are enthusiastic about the program. “It’s great to do something that really helps someone else, especially a guy like him,” said Thomas Davison, who trained Rainbow at the Northeast Correctional Center here. “I’ve never had a chance to do that, and I wasn’t sure I could handle the responsibility.” Kathleen M. Dennehy, the state correction commissioner, said the program had profound effects on the culture of a prison. “Officers stop by to pat the dogs, they smile, maybe they strike up a conversation with the inmate training the dog,” Ms. Dennehy said. “It establishes a basic human connection.” James J. Saba, superintendent at Northeast, is unsure, however, whether the program, already in six prisons in Massachusetts, can be expanded. “We have 268 inmates in this prison alone, which is already too many,” Mr. Saba said. “And for every puppy, we lose a bed because the dogs take the place of an inmate in the cell.” Mr. Paquette and Rainbow visited Mr. Davison and the four other inmate trainers at the prison on Thursday. Mr. Davison gave him a few pointers and handed over the toys he had bought the dog with the $28 a week he received for training her. “She was ready to do this at 9 months,” Mr. Davison said proudly. “She’s a good dog.” Mr. Paquette promised, “I’ll take good care of her.” Mr. Paquette joined the military several months after the Sept. 11 attacks, leaving a job he had recently taken. “I felt like a hypocrite sitting around on the couch in front of the TV and saying, ‘Go do it,’ when I wasn’t,” he explained. He became a medical sergeant on a Special Forces team and headed for Afghanistan in the spring of 2004. He said he treated hundreds of soldiers and thousands of local residents for “everything from the common cold to gunshot wounds.” On Dec. 28, 2004, an explosion went off under the vehicle in which he was riding, severely injuring his legs. Yet he considers himself lucky that the impact was muted by the engine block, that an orthopedic surgeon happened to be on hand to perform the initial amputation and that new medical techniques have calmed the irritated nerves in his legs that threatened to keep him from walking. “At least I’m here, and I’ve got Rainey,” he said, using his nickname for Rainbow. He said that he had been nervous about meeting her — “sometimes chemistry just doesn’t work” — and that the first day of their partnership had been difficult. He had expected to get a bigger dog, who could support his weight, and Rainbow accidentally pulled him over when he was walking with her. The next day, however, Rainbow and Mr. Paquette clicked, taking turns outdoors using just a cane and her harness. The dog appeared to respond well to Mr. Paquette’s commands and looked to him more and more for direction. He stayed in his wheelchair during his visit to Mr. Davison the next day because the Neads trainers were worried that Rainbow would pull him down again in her excitement to see her prison trainer. She was indeed happy to see him but largely remained at Mr. Paquette’s side. The next challenge will be introducing her to Mr. Big, the German shepherd-Great Dane mix that is the Paquettes’ pet. He has been sent to obedience school in preparation for her arrival. In about 10 days, Mr. Paquette and Rainbow will take off for their new life together, first in Albuquerque and then in San Antonio, where Mr. Paquette and his wife, Jennifer, and their daughter, Kristen, 17, and son, T. J., 11, are moving for his new job with an intelligence and security firm. The Army has recently completed a new center in San Antonio specializing in amputation, the Intrepid Center, and Mr. Paquette expects to be an advertisement for service dogs. “I’ve got a feeling that lots of guys who see me with Rainbow are going to want a dog,” he said.

(Ages 5 and up) Smith's witty text and illustrations bring new life to a few old chestnuts, depicting the Fab Four of the American Revolution — John Hancock, Paul Revere, George Washington and Benjamin Franklin — through the founding myths we know them by. Beautifully designed by Molly Leach (the artist's wife), the book incorporates reproductions of 18th-century materials and typefaces for a series of truth-stretching history lessons. (Paul Revere really did belong to a bell-ringers club, though there's no evidence that a "special talent" for shouting helped him on his midnight ride.) ONCE I ATE A PIE. By Patricia MacLachlan and Emily MacLachlan Charest. Illustrated by Katy Schneider. Joanna Cotler/HarperCollins. $15.99. (Ages 4 to 8) In the authors' comical conceit, a series of dogs introduce themselves in dignified, haiku-like lines. Each oil painting is as individual as a human portrait, and more endearing; a tired dog named Sugar is presented in three curled-up poses ("I only get out of bed to chase the cat. And he's not around. Is he?") The title comes from a pug named Mr. Beefy: "I am not thin, but I am beautiful. When no one is looking, I steal tubs of butter off the table. I take them to the basement to eat in private. Once I ate a pie." The faint berry-stained pawprints in the background already gave him away. WHOSE KNEES ARE THESE? and WHOSE TOES ARE THOSE? By Jabari Asim. Illustrations by LeUyen Pham. Little, Brown. $6.99 each. (Ages 0 to 3) This pair of board books is perfectly pitched to its likely audience: babies and their admiring parents, two groups who could devote hours to studying chubby knees and toes. (Make that three groups: grandparents.) The playful rhymes — "Knees like these don't grow on trees. So brown and so strong, to whom do these fine knees belong?" — and close-ups are perfectly suited to the books' small format and simple design. MOM AND DAD ARE PALINDROMES. By Mark Shulman. Illustrated by Adam McCauley. Chronicle. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 10) "My name is BOB. That might not sound like a problem to you. But yesterday it almost DID me in," when the teacher pointed out that there was "a palindrome right here in class" — him. Bob becomes more and more anxious about the tricky words in his life ("Even NAN! Our little SIS! She's just a TOT!" ) until he decides it's safe to use his full name: Robert Trebor. The joke builds nicely, and the illustrations are handsome. THE GREAT AMERICAN MOUSICAL. By Julie Andrews Edwards and Emma Walton Hamilton. Illustrated by Tony Walton. The Julie Andrews Collection/ HarperCollins. $15.99 (Ages 5 to 9) Julie Andrews teams up with her daughter, a theater director, to tell an entertaining story about what happens when the leading lady of a new Broadway musical winds up in a Havahart trap before the premiere — the lady being a pampered mouse named Adelaide. You can be sure the cast rises to the challenge, while Adelaide battles her way back to wintry Times Square by snowplow, bicycle, pretzel cart and delivery truck of a certain large metropolitan daily. Like Lydia and Don Freeman's classic "Pet of the Met," "The Great American Mousical" imagines the small denizens of a venerable theater having all the ambition and charm of the humans who share the stage.

220-> Confidence Index Up
By Reuters Consumer confidence rose in July amid cautious optimism about job prospects, but overall sentiment in months ahead will most probably stay below levels touched earlier this year, a survey showed yesterday. The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment climbed in July to 106.5, up from 105.4 in June. Sentiment reached a high for the year, at 109.8, in April. The business research group’s present-situation index rose to 133.0 from 132.2 in June, while the expectations component increased to 88.8 from 87.5 in June. Labor market conditions were little changed in July, according to the panel. Consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” increased to 27.6 percent in July from 26.6 percent in June, while those who said jobs were “hard to get” remained unchanged at 19.9 percent.

221-> When It Comes to Lung Cancer, She Doesn’t Believe in Waiting
Even people who think she’s wrong hope she turns out to be right. Since 1999, Dr. Claudia I. Henschke, a soft-spoken professor of radiology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, has been waging a relentless campaign. She has been trying to convince the medical establishment that smokers and former smokers should be offered routine CT scans to detect lung cancer when tumors are still small enough to be cured. By her estimate, the scans could prevent 80 percent of the 160,000 deaths a year from lung cancer in the United States. She and her colleagues have had their findings published in prestigious medical journals like The Lancet and, last week, The New England Journal of Medicine. The day their study appeared in The Journal, doctors stopped in the corridors to shake her hand, a waiter in the faculty dining room said, “Dr. Henschke, you’re all over the TV and radio!” and an assistant collected newspapers reporting on her research. “She has singlehandedly brought this issue of the disease and early detection and prevention to the forefront,” said Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonologist and epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and a cancer policy adviser for Medicare and Medicaid. “People had completely given up on it. She has rejuvenated interest in early detection. That alone is a tremendous achievement, regardless of anything else.” Anything else? Well, said Dr. Bach, who considers himself a friend, Dr. Henschke’s estimate that CT screening could reduce deaths by 80 percent is “an outrageous and implausible claim.” But, he added, “it really got people to pay attention.” Even so, much of the cancer establishment says that Dr. Henschke has yet to prove her point. Sure, they say, CT scans are great at picking up small tumors, but do they really save lives? Could they harm people by raising false alarms that prompt lung biopsies or even surgery? Until those questions are answered to their satisfaction, influential bodies like the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute have refused to endorse the scans, and have thrown the giant wet blanket of “needs further study” over her results. “I don’t get what the resistance is,” Dr. Henschke said.To her, it is a matter of simple logic: the earlier cancer is found, the better the odds of a cure. CT finds lung cancer early. So why not use it? No one disputes that the scans find small tumors. The study published last week involved 31,567 people scanned at more than 30 hospitals around the world. The scans found cancer in 484, often early; 85 percent were at Stage I. Without CT scans, lung cancer is usually found later, too late to cure. With surgery, the researchers estimated the patients’ 10-year survival rate at 88 percent — a huge increase over the usual survival rate for Stage I, 70 percent at 5 years. Eight patients in the study who had Stage I tumors but refused treatment died within 5 years. Other experts want the one thing that Dr. Henschke and her team have not provided — a study comparing two sets of patients, a group given CT scans and a control group given chest X-rays or no screening at all, to see whether the scans really do lower the death rate from lung cancer in the long run. Such studies, randomized controlled trials, are generally considered the gold standard in medical research. “They are standard,” Dr. Henschke said. But she and her colleagues argue that randomized controlled trials are not the best way to study lung cancer screening because they require too many patients, cost too much and take too long to provide answers. In addition, Dr. Henschke said, CT technology is advancing so rapidly that scanners can become obsolete even before a study is done. Some experts agree that studies of screening take too long. Dr. Robert Smith, director of screening at the American Cancer Society, said, “Those of us who have the responsibility to evaluate have to find a way to get answers about efficacy much faster than in 10 to 15 years.” It may be reasonable to insist on randomized controlled trials for treatments, but not for diagnostic tests, Dr. Henschke says. Her views are unconventional, to say the least. Some researchers say she is trying to rewrite the rules of science.Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for Disease Prevention at the National Institutes of Health, took vigorous exception to her assertions, insisting that randomized controlled trials are the only way to find out for sure whether a test or a treatment really works. “This could affect so many people,” he said. “You want to be sure you have your answer right.” Dr. Henschke’s career has not exactly been conventional or rule-bound. She comes from a family of doctors and scientists. Her parents were radiologists, and her father had a doctorate in physics as well. Her family moved from Germany when she was a child, first to Ohio and later New York, where her father worked at Sloan-Kettering and her mother at St. Vincent’s Hospital. Her father kept a seaplane in the Bronx and taught her to fly. She graduated from high school at 16, and her father urged her to become a doctor, but she refused. Instead, she went to college in Texas, in part because it was a good place to fly, and majored in math and French. By 19, she had a flight instructor’s certificate and gave lessons to help pay her way through school. She earned a master’s degree from Southern Methodist University and, in 1969, a doctorate in mathematical statistics from the University of Georgia.During the 1970s she flew her father from clinic to clinic in Africa, where he set up equipment to provide radiation treatment for cancer patients. She also began working as an adviser in statistics at the National Institutes of Health. But she said, “Nobody would listen to you unless you had an M.D.” By then, her father was teaching at Howard University in Washington, and her sister was already in medical school there. She enrolled, graduated in 1977 and did her residency in radiology at Harvard. She still found time to travel to Africa with her father and got some medical training in Tanzania. On a trip there without her in 1980, her father was killed when the small plane on which he was a passenger crashed into the Ngorongoro crater. In 1983, Dr. Henschke joined the Cornell medical school and New York Hospital as a specialist in chest radiology. Around 1990, a colleague there, David A. Yankelevitz, approached Dr. Henschke to discuss research from the 1970s on using chest X-rays to detect lung cancer. Over all, the studies had suggested that X-rays did not find cancer early enough to help patients, and the medical profession had quit recommending them. But CT was more sensitive, and so they began studying the scans. Dr. Yankelevitz also became convinced that they could prevent deaths. Some experts worry that screening tests like this one can take hold without anyone knowing for sure whether they really save lives. The issue is not just the scan itself, but the mounting risks and costs of the biopsies and operations that follow when tumors are found. Once they hear that a test can find tumors early, many people want it. And then the test can become hard to study, because nobody wants to be in the control group. Cancer experts say lung CT screening has two major pitfalls. One is that it may detect tiny cancers that would never have progressed and lead to risky procedures like biopsies and lung surgery that are not really needed. Some patients could die from the surgery, or have their lives shortened by complications. But Dr. Henschke’s team has tried to minimize needless biopsies, by using certain traits like size, growth rate and appearance to decide which abnormalities should be tested and which ones left alone. “It’s one thing I think they deserve a lot of credit for,” Dr. Smith said. The second pitfall is harder to address. Some tumors, despite being tiny, may be so aggressive and deadly that surgery simply cannot be done soon enough to prolong a person’s life. As a result, lung CT is not likely to save as many lives as its proponents claim, Dr. Smith said. But, he said, it does have “potentially an opportunity to reduce deaths.” Aware of the concerns — and prodded by Dr. Henschke’s work — the National Cancer Institute is spending $300 million on a study to compare CT and chest X-ray in 50,000 people. Some results are expected by 2009. But Dr. Henschke questions whether the study will be definitive. It may be too short, and even 50,000 patients may not be enough, she said. She has also challenged the study on moral grounds, asking if it is ethical to give some patients only chest X-rays when it is already known that CT picks up more tumors. “She is smart, passionate, serious,” Dr. Bach said. “She has worked so hard on this. You can’t imagine the logistical challenges of coordinating a study like she’s coordinated. I am incredibly impressed by her devotion to this, and I hope she’s right. But we differ on what needs to be done to find out if she is right. It’s an honest disagreement.”

223-> All About Friends, Those Acquaintances Whose Calls You Want to Take (Usually)
The telephone rings at 2 a.m. It’s your best friend, and he has a small favor to ask. Would you mind helping him bury a dead body? Sorry, no time for details at the moment. Just say yes or no. Joseph Epstein would say yes. That’s just one of several revelations in “Friendship: An Exposé,” his rambling, shambling, highly personal survey of a universal relationship whose fluidity and changing nature — through history and through the stages of a single life — make it rich pickings for an erudite essayist of Mr. Epstein’s caliber. The title is odd. “Friendship” is an inquiry rather than an exposé. Mr. Epstein, a former editor of The American Scholar and the author of “Snobbery,” offers a thoughtful consideration of the pleasures and obligations of friendship and a learned tour of the best that has been written on the subject, from Aristotle and Cicero to the touching late-life correspondence between the theologian Karl Barth and the playwright Carl Zuckmayer. Along the way, he examines his own friendships, weighing their successes and failures, and judging his own performance as a friend. This is no easy task. Friendship, although universal, is an elusive, slippery concept. It is the neglected first cousin of romantic love, whose phases and quirks, obsessively studied by writers throughout the ages, are much better understood. For Mr. Epstein friendship is “affection, variously based on common interests, a common past, common values, and, alas, sometimes common enemies, in each case leading to delight and contentment in one another’s company.” He makes the point more economically, describing a real-life best friend: “I’m never disappointed when it is he who calls me on the phone.” Back to that dead body. Yes, Mr. Epstein would grab a shovel and dig. But he would not mortgage his house for the guy, one of the other tests proposed in Stuart Miller’s “Men and Friendship.” So there are limits. The problem is, no one really knows what they are exactly. This can make friendship an endless series of vexations. Friends impose and presume. Even worse are acquaintances who may or may not qualify as friends, but who claim the same prerogatives. Mr. Epstein spends an enormous amount of time dealing with these competing demands, detailed in the weeklong friendship log that makes up one of his chapters. Mr. Epstein, who describes himself as “a gregarious melancholic, a highly sociable misanthrope, a laughing skeptic,” counts an impressive total of 75 friends. They come in many varieties, as they do for everyone. There are everyday friends, once-a-week friends and once-a-year friends. There are card-playing friends and workplace friends. Mr. Epstein has maintained a warm, fully satisfying relationship for 20 years with a man he has seen in person only three times. “The first rule of the art of friendship, I have come to believe, is that not all friendships need to be deepened.” Not all friendships need to be equal either. Mr. Epstein himself has on occasion played the role he describes as “best supporting friend,” entering into an unequal relationship with an older man, like Saul Bellow, to gain access to a superior mind, not to mention a rise in status. A self-avowed enemy of Freud and modern therapy culture, Mr. Epstein subscribes to an old-fashioned code of manly stoicism. Men do not share their innermost secrets and unload their worries and woes. “Reticence is of the essence in masculine friendship, long has been, and probably ought to continue to be,” he writes. Yet “Friendship,” for long stretches, is a confessional binge and an extended session on the therapist’s couch. Mr. Epstein discloses his own talent, displayed at an early age, for selling himself as a friend, a character trait that guaranteed him a lively social life but also saddled him with dozens of unwanted acquaintances who imagine themselves to be friends. At times, he looks in the mirror and judges himself, often harshly, for underperforming as a friend. “I sometimes think I no longer have the makings of a best friend,” he writes, in a characteristically tough-minded aside. “I am, I think, a decent listener, but not much of a confessor.” The cantankerous, cant-busting persona that Mr. Epstein has carefully cultivated over the years turns out to be something of a fraud. By the evidence on display in “Friendship,” Mr. Epstein is soft at the center. To use language he would hate, he is caring and supportive and there for his friends. He puts up with a lot, makes time, does favors and in general makes the rounds and performs the time-consuming maintenance work that keeps friendships in good working order. “Friendship,” like friends, can be annoying. Mr. Epstein spends an awful lot of time tripping down memory lane and describing in great detail his relationships with friends who by definition (and because their identities are disguised) cannot be as fascinating to the reader as they are to Mr. Epstein, who really does go on and on. The quality of the discussion varies. Mr. Epstein can be acute, as in his distinction between reciprocity and equality in good friendships, but he can also be self-indulgent and fatuous. He often writes like an academic fussbudget, seasoning his prose with words like “lucubration” and “propinquity,” and occasionally knitting some real syntactic doilies. (“Without many of the ordinary virtues though Waugh was, gratitude appears to have been one he never abandoned.”) Unforgivably, for a rooter-out of cultural clichés, he refers to one admired colleague as having “a true gift for friendship.” Well, as Samuel Johnson once remarked, we take our friends as we find them, not as we would make them. Mr. Epstein, in an unfamiliar introspective vein, is quite appealing, warts and all. He’s warm, if crusty on the outside, honest, unsparing and brimful of illuminating literary anecdotes. He makes an engaging companion. Who knows, he could even be a friend.

The Islamists who control much of the country have banned Somalis from marrying without the consent of their parents, saying such unions violate Islam.

A campaign inspired by a YouTube video hit the streets of Beijing, Changsha and Xian over the weekend, intended to cheer up strangers by offering hugs on the spot. Participants opened their arms to embrace passers-by and brandished cards saying "Free hugs" in English and "Care from strangers" and "Refuse to be apathetic" in Chinese, The Beijing News reported. In the ancient capital of Xian, home to the terracotta warriors, no more than 20 people, mostly children, accepted the free hugs over two hours. "Passers-by showed interest and curiosity, stopped and asked, but most of them walked away after hearing the explanation," The New China News Agency said. In Beijing, the police moved in and took four huggers on one of the city's most popular shopping streets away for questioning.

228-> Embracing a Proud Past, Joan Jett Keeps It Simple
In the 1980's, when she ruled Top 40 radio, Joan Jett was the perfect embodiment of rock's primal qualities. She was young, cocky, sexy, rebellious and knew how to rock a pair of leather pants. She had a signature look (shag haircut and heavy eyeliner), a jailbait past (she joined the Runaways at age 15) and a punk-rock pedigree (she was friends with Sid Vicious and produced the Germs). It's hard to think of a cooler 80's rocker — maybe Axl Rose? But unlike Mr. Rose, with his odd behavior and even odder new face, Ms. Jett has aged with grace. At 47, she seems eerily youthful and unjaded. Let's see Madonna pull this off: Ms. Jett arrived in a skimpy bikini top and black leather pants worn so low you could see her hipbones. Her tattooed arms were toned and sinewy; her face was girlish, as if she had just stepped out of the "Bad Reputation" video. Her fitness regime probably involves airborne kicks and rooster strutting. "Joan, you are obscenely sexy, and I want to marry you!" a woman in the audience shouted as Ms. Jett swaggered to the Runaways' classic "Cherry Bomb." Later a female fan rushed the stage and tried to kiss her. Ms. Jett seemed revolutionary in the 80's because she acted as if being a (rare) female guitar virtuoso was no big deal. She proclaimed "I Love Rock N' Roll" with the casual sense of entitlement of a male legend. Over the years Ms. Jett grew more political, and she is now hailed as a groundbreaking feminist hero. The sold-out show at the Brooklyn club Southpaw on Tuesday was packed with adoring women in their 30's and young, hand-holding lesbian couples. When Ms. Jett sang "Do you want to touch me there?," she was rewarded with deafening screams of "Yeah!" Joan Jett and the Blackhearts are touring to support the new album "Sinner," Ms. Jett's first studio effort since the 90's. She is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her label, Blackheart Records, by reissuing her early work. And Ms. Jett has joined this summer's Vans Warped Tour, where she is likely to upstage artists almost three decades younger. The simplistic new punk song "Change the World" is tailor-made for that audience, with its plainspoken call to arms. The lyrics to The Replacements' "Androgynous" sounded especially clunky live ("She's happy with the way she looks/she's happy with her gender") but still generated cheers. At times it sounded as if Ms. Jett had been kidnapped by a bland Midwestern bar band. But as she and her all-male backup obliged the crowd with nearly all of her hits (including her excellent "Crimson and Clover" cover), it didn't really matter. Even her voice is remarkably young, untainted by bitterness or ennui. Ms. Jett ended the show with Sly and the Family Stone's "Everyday People," thrusting her pelvis against her low-slung guitar. There is nothing everyday about her: she is the hard-rock Dorian Gray.

231-> Dorothy Gallagher’s Clear-Eyed Self-Revelations
Reading the first autobiographical story in Dorothy Gallagher’s new collection, “Strangers in the House,” is like sitting next to a charmingly garrulous stranger at a dinner party who proceeds to reveal the most intimate details of her life. It’s fascinating, but also a bit disconcerting. The second is more like being at the next table, overhearing two former lovers reminisce about affairs, apartments and addictions. By the time you’ve read the fourth or fifth story, you’re comfortably settled in for a polished magazine writer’s take on people who live in a world far different from her own. What these pieces share is engaging prose, a wicked sense of humor and honesty so glaring it makes you squint. Less clear is what they are all doing in the same book. (As it turns out, 4 of the 10 pieces were previously published in one form or another, going back to 1977, adding to the impression that they were included to round out an already slim volume.) Ms. Gallagher’s reporting and writing skills are familiar to readers of her three previous nonfiction books, including “How I Came Into My Inheritance: And Other True Stories,” a memoir of her family, Jewish radicals who emigrated from the Ukraine in the 1920’s and settled in Washington Heights, published in 2001. Her new book is largely taken up with stories from her life that are delivered as straightforward confessionals or that slyly slip out during short, novelistic vignettes. “Stay” is ostensibly about Harry, a wild, shaggy mutt she hates and loves. But it is also about her husband, the writer Ben Sonnenberg, whose paralyzing multiple sclerosis causes the same mix of emotion (“never again to turn over in bed — just for the sake of turning, mind you, not necessarily to put his arms around me”). When Harry dies, Ben is devastated: “No wonder. That weekend when we drove to Massachusetts and came home with Harry was the last time Ben would ever drive, and Harry was the last dog he would every walk.” Ms. Gallagher is never sentimental or maudlin, and she never fails to see the humor in even the blackest situation; she’s a bit like Nora Ephron, but with more jagged edges. In the title story, the most piercing in the collection, she chronicles how a young blonde — called B — hired to help Mr. Sonnenberg when he is paralyzed, ends up stealing and scamming tens of thousands of dollars from them over the course of eight years. “Our lawyer says I should not name her, but I feel somehow compelled to reveal that her real name is A.” How could a betrayal of this magnitude go on for so long undetected by someone as insightful as Ms. Gallagher? She explains: “Every day when I am off working, B is offering Ben a life. Sometimes they go to movies together, to museums.” He finances B’s documentary film project (not realizing she is also stealing from them), gives her access to his friends and gets a credit as a producer on her film. “And by the way, Ben is happy,” Ms. Gallagher writes. “I didn’t interfere. I had no right.” Ms. Gallagher has an antenna for human vanity and weakness, which she gleefully chronicles in many of these “life stories,” whether about an ex-lover, a congenital liar who was intrigued by the idea of catching AIDS from Foucault or a friendship that falters over what she thinks is a badly written script. But as stinging as Ms. Gallagher can be about others, she is even more so about herself. Amid these self-revelations, though, a couple of the stories here seem strangely out of place. One is the tale of Juliet Poyntz, an American who in the 1930’s seems to have become a Soviet agent, only to mysteriously disappear in 1937 after becoming disenchanted with Stalin. Ms. Gallagher probably came across the episode while researching her biography of the anarchist Carlo Tresca (not to mention her own family’s radical past). It’s a classic cold war tale with intriguing, half-explained twists, but it isn’t Ms. Gallagher’s life story. And then there is an essay about being on the jury for a 1976 murder in Morningside Heights (originally published in a different form in The New York Times Magazine). Jury duty is a subject that scores of bored writers who have served try to turn into articles. What distinguishes Ms. Gallagher’s are the reporter’s instincts that push her, after the trial, to investigate all the details that weren’t permitted to come out in court. What serves as a perfect endpoint to the book, though, is “Dumb Luck,” about a trip in 2004 to visit Liya, a distant cousin in Moscow. A daughter of the only one of seven siblings not to make it to America, Liya lived through the 20th century’s worst catastrophes: famine, purges, pogroms and genocide. Now she is sick, hungry and paranoid, living alone in a dirty, roach-filled apartment. During her visit Ms. Gallagher discovers that Liya has piles of books and photographs of Ms. Gallagher surrounded by loving friends and family in comfortable homes: “What did Liya think as year after year her cousin’s life was placed before her? Did she see what I see now? Did she see my great, good, pure dumb luck? Did she see that my road had always been clear and open before me? Why didn’t know that?” The series of snags and calamities that Ms. Gallagher has bumped up against throughout her life — the ex-husband who carried brass knuckles, the psychiatrist who seduced her, her current husband’s total paralysis — reminded me of an essay she wrote a few years ago for The Times about writing: “Truly, life is just one damn thing after another. The writer’s business is to find the shape in unruly life and to serve her story. Not, you may note, to serve her family, or to serve the truth, but to serve the story.” It is the reader’s good fortune that Ms. Gallagher has served her stories so well.

232-> 'WORLD TRADE CENTER'; Problem Solved
To the Editor: Re "Searching for Truth in the Rubble" by David M. Halbfinger [July 2]: Revisiting historical events through film can be a powerful tool to help people cope with tragedy. I do not berate anyone involved in the making of Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center"; I think it probably helped them and may help others. But it is our right to choose whether it is a form of therapy that interests us. Showing the trailer to movie audiences without any warning is an emotionally offensive assault on those who lived through 9/11. For me, the visual images are too strong and the preview brings me to my knees. The article asks, "How do you market a movie like this without offending audiences or violating the film's intentions?" How about as simple a gesture as warning us when the trailer will be shown? That may buck Hollywood norms and marketers' conventional wisdom, but then, so does this film.

Microsoft said yesterday that Vista, the much-delayed new version of its Windows operating system, was ready for its last and broadest round of testing. Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, announced the release of the final test version of the program, along with test versions of its Office business software suite and Longhorn server software, at the company's annual conference for hardware developers in Seattle. In a speech that was broadcast on the Internet, he called the release "a significant milestone." By showing it can stick to its latest development schedule, Microsoft is clearly hoping to win back the allegiance of developers. Many were disappointed when the company conceded in March that Vista would not be ready for consumers until January, missing the holiday sales season. Microsoft holds 90 percent of the PC operating system market, and more than 300 PC manufacturers install Windows on their machines at the factory. The software accounts for nearly a third of Microsoft's revenue. The company had originally said it would release Vista in 2005, then delayed it until mid-2006. Jim Allchin, co-president of Microsoft's platforms and services division, said in an interview yesterday that he was confident that the software would be ready for consumers by January and for corporate customers this November. "This is a call to action to make sure everybody is prepared," Mr. Allchin said, referring to the thousands of hardware and software developers whose livelihoods depend on Vista's success. But Michael Silver, an analyst with Gartner Inc., a technology market research company, said that the shipping schedule was overly ambitious and that Vista was not likely to reach consumers before next March. "We think they are underestimating how long it's going to take to respond to the problems that two million people find," he said, referring to those who are likely to test Vista. The announcement comes less than a week after Symantec, a longtime Microsoft partner, filed suit against the company, claiming that it violated the terms of a licensing agreement with Veritas, which Symantec acquired last year. The suit, which was filed in federal court in Seattle, charges that Microsoft improperly used Veritas technology in Vista and other software. It seeks an injunction to stop Microsoft from selling Vista until the technology is removed. Mr. Allchin said he was confident the suit would not affect the release of Vista, and called the dispute with Symantec "a sad state of affairs."

234-> Gay Brother, Straight Brother: It Could Be a Play
In his wrenching autobiographical play about AIDS in New York in the 1980's, Larry Kramer made his brother the face of evil in an uncaring world. The conflict between the brothers in that play, "The Normal Heart," was the consummate coming-out story, a tale reflected in many families. The straight brother couldn't find it in his heart to renounce his gay sibling, yet couldn't wholeheartedly accept him as normal, either. Their story came to define an era for hundreds of thousands of theatergoers. More than 20 years after the play opened, Larry and Arthur Kramer are talking again. Their lives have trumped art. Their relationship has gone through a series of changes, and in the last decade, the brothers have become close collaborators on gay rights issues. Last month, Arthur Kramer's law firm was among those arguing for gay marriage before New York State's highest court, and a decision in that case could come as soon as this week. His firm has spent countless hours of overtime working on other gay causes across the country, from adopting children to serving as scoutmasters. How true was the fictional account of Kramer v. Kramer? Have times changed at the same pace as the brothers? In some ways, the arc of their relationship is, writ small, the arc of the culture war raging across the stage of American life and politics. The changes didn't happen overnight, like a religious awakening. They happened slowly, almost imperceptibly. "It was me learning through my activism and growth that being gay wasn't bad, and I wasn't going to let it be bad," Larry said. "And having to convince him and the world it wasn't bad, and him coming around." Now, he said, "He and my lover are the two most meaningful people in my life." For Arthur, the reconciliation came as he accepted that his brother was not going to change, and that being gay was a matter of biology, not choice or family dysfunction. "I was persuaded over time that there was nothing you could do about it, and it was my problem," Arthur said. "That's the way he is." In the play, first produced at the Public Theater in 1985, Larry is Ned Weeks, the Cassandra of the nascent AIDS epidemic, and Arthur is Ben, his diffident brother, more concerned with building his $2 million house in Connecticut than with taking to the ramparts. Arthur recalls that Calvin Trillin, the humor writer and a friend of both brothers, once called "The Normal Heart," "the play about the building of your house." Sitting in his living room the other day, with a majestic view of the Washington Square Arch, Larry, who found out in 1987 that he was H.I.V. positive, said he still gets "the shivers" from the scenes between the brothers, which he pronounces "the best written stuff in the play." He is so fond of his alter ego that he uses Ned Weeks as his e-mail identity. His brother and two lawyers from his brother's law firm joined him for the interview to talk about gay marriage and the family drama in "The Normal Heart," which Larry said was "true, all true." Sinking into a black leather couch, Larry nestled his head against Arthur's shoulder. They still bicker affectionately over the smallest things, like how old they are. "I'm nine and a half years older than Larry," said Arthur, who is 79. "Eight and a half," corrected Larry, who is turning 71 today. How did they get to this point? "You have to take it back further in our relationship," Larry said. "Arthur more or less brought me up, and looked after me, because we both shared a mutual distaste for our parents." "No," Arthur begged. "What, you don't want to see that in print?" Larry insisted. "They're both dead." Capitulating, Arthur explained that Larry was the unwanted second child of a lawyer who was a Phi Beta Kappa member at Yale but never lived up to the promise of his early brilliance. Arthur became Larry's protector. As a lonely Yale freshman in 1953, Larry tried to kill himself by overdosing on aspirin. He confessed to his brother that he was gay, and Arthur hired a psychiatrist to cure him. Thinking Larry needed to be cured, Arthur says now, was the well-intentioned mistake of someone taken in by the prevailing psychoanalytic wisdom of the time. Larry forgives him because the psychiatrist  one of many  did some good. The brothers wear their differences on their sleeves. Arthur sticks to his lawyer's uniform, a gray suit and a blue oxford shirt. He retired from Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel 10 years ago, but maintains strong emotional ties to the firm, which still bears his name. Larry has a "Queer Eye" fashion sense, mixing denim overalls  to hide a waistline misshapen by the liver transplant he got because of hepatitis B  with an incongruously GQ pair of tasseled brown loafers. His hooded Eskandar T-shirts, to ward off chills, make him look like Peter O'Toole in "Lawrence of Arabia." To his delight, they have attracted stares in Muslim neighborhoods of London. Being an outsider becomes him. When Larry was studying English at Yale, a fortune teller told him turquoise would protect him, and he has followed her advice ever since, adding more rings and bracelets as his health has worsened. "When the photographer comes, I have to put on my 'Where is the outrage' T-shirt," Larry said. Not just any T-shirt: This one is sold by Marc Jacobs. They have clashed over Larry's outrage, and Arthur's lack of it, many times. In the 1980's, when Larry asked his brother to take on Gay Men's Health Crisis, the fledgling nonprofit organization he helped found, as a client, Arthur said he had to run it past his firm's intake committee, an answer which Larry saw  "rightly," Arthur says now  as a dodge. Behind Arthur's back, Larry went to another partner, Maurice Nessen, who said, basically, 'Why not?' Larry, furious, stopped talking to Arthur in the first of many rifts. Around the same time, Larry threatened to call a gay boycott of MCI, one of the Kramer firm's most lucrative clients, because MCI was being accused of discrimination by a former employee who was gay. "I thought this was a hostile act towards me," Arthur said. He stopped speaking to Larry. In the 1990's, after Colorado voters passed an anti-gay rights referendum, Arthur refused to cancel a ski trip to Aspen. Once again, Larry stopped talking to him. Yet in 2001 Arthur gave $1 million to start a program in gay and lesbian studies in Larry's name at Yale. Times had changed, says Arthur, also a Yale alumnus, and so had he  and Yale, which had rebuffed Larry's previous attempts to do something similar. "Act 1 is me screaming at him to be our lawyer, and Act 7 is him giving $1 million to Yale," Larry said. At the end of "The Normal Heart," a sympathetic doctor symbolically marries Ned and his dying lover, Felix, in Felix's hospital room. Gay marriage, however, is an unfinished act of the play that is the brothers' life. To the consternation of Jeffrey S. Trachtman, co-counsel with Lambda Legal on Hernandez v. Robles, one of the gay marriage cases now before the Court of Appeals, and Norman C. Simon, a gay associate working on the case, Larry Kramer is not their biggest advocate. His ambivalence is surprising for someone who has been portrayed by detractors as the gay Jerry Falwell, hectoring gay men to "grow up" and repent their hedonistic ways. At the moment, he says, he is interested in marriage only to take advantage of federal estate tax laws, which the piecemeal, state-by-state approach to gay marriage will do nothing about. "I want to get married if it means the U.S. government will allow me to pass along my estate, which is not inconsiderable, to David," he said, referring to his partner, David Webster, an architect. They have been together for 15 years. What about marriage as a publicly sanctioned declaration of love? Mr. Simon asks. His parents' strained marriage was hardly the model of a loving relationship, Larry says. "Why are we perpetuating such a terrible thing?" he said of the institution of marriage. "I'm amazed by how little support for gay marriage comes from gay people." Maybe, he concedes, if David  who has been resistant  agrees to marry him, he will feel differently. Arthur, married 53 years, with four children, derides the opposition to gay marriage as politically driven "hoo-hah." But Arthur pointed out that Larry once thought about getting married to David. "You asked me to ask Nick," Arthur said, meaning Eugene H. Nickerson, a former partner at Kramer, Levin, who became a federal judge in Brooklyn. "As a federal judge, he had the power to marry people. It was not an appropriate request to make, but I did it. You were trying to establish the principle." As Arthur remembers it, Judge Nickerson, who has since died, said he didn't perform marriages of any kind. Larry remembers his saying it wouldn't work, because it would not be legal. Later, Larry consulted Eve Preminger, a friend and surrogate judge at the time. "She offered to do it anyway and see what would happen, but that didn't come to pass," he said. Yet for all his cynicism about marriage, Larry is delighted when Mr. Simon tells him that he and his partner have been together for 13 years. "Holy moly," he said, making it sound like congratulations. For a famously angry man, he can be awfully sweet. "Everybody says that," he agreed, and then proceeded to bait his brother. "Benjamin Disraeli was gay," Larry said to Arthur, as they went out to lunch. "He was married," Arthur retorted. One has the funny feeling they have been down this road before.

235-> Captain Fantastic Revisited
Thirty years can make a rock star reconsider the past. Bruce Springsteen turned the anniversary of his pivotal 1975 album “Born to Run” into an expanded reissue with a documentary and vintage concert video. Now Elton John has made a sequel to his 1975 album “Captain Fantastic & the Brown Dirt Cowboy,” and on Wednesday night at Rose Theater he and his band played songs from that album, “The Captain & the Kid” (Rocket/Interscope), in public for the first time: nine of them in a row, bookended by a dozen 1970’s hits. It was a benefit concert for the Elton John AIDS Foundation. Playing the 1,200-seat theater rather than his usual arenas, Sir Elton was cozy enough with the audience to offer what few of the new songs needed: explanations. He said that “Captain Fantastic” was about struggling to make it before his 1970 pop breakthrough, while “The Captain & the Kid” is about “the next 36 years” and “struggling with success.” Deniability was always part of Sir Elton’s charm. Since he doesn’t write the words to his songs — Bernie Taupin does — most of what he has sung through the years isn’t necessarily about him, leaving listeners to read in as much confession as they wish. He wasn’t an astronaut in “Rocket Man,” or a brawler in “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting,” just a tunesmith singing about characters. In songs like “Take Me to the Pilot,” an irresistible chorus sweeps through confusing verses. The team’s love songs stay general, in a fine pop tradition, while the autobiography on “Captain Fantastic” was obscured in extravagant metaphors. The new songs are different. They’re clear, detailed reminiscences of Englishmen crossing America in a blur of fame and excess; of conflicts and reconciliations between the songwriters; of loss in the era of AIDS; and of gratitude and surprise at their longevity. Sir Elton was in New York City for Fashion Week — he was also curator of the “Fashion Rocks” extravaganza on Thursday night — and he looked flamboyant enough at the Rose Theater. He wore a glittering cross around his neck and a black tailcoat with the words “Elton John” and “Stardust Kiss” emblazoned on it in red. But while fashion is transient, his music hasn’t budged. Two members of his band, Nigel Olsson on drums and Davey Johnstone on guitar, have been with him for decades. “Our day in the sun has gone as far as radio play goes,” Sir Elton said bluntly as he introduced “Old ’67.” “We realize that. It’s O.K.” But he and Mr. Taupin are sticking to their familiar style. Now as in the 1970’s Sir Elton’s music is an Anglo-American hybrid, merging classical arpeggios, Beatles harmonies and the stolidity of English hymns with splashy American barrelhouse piano, touches of the blues and an occasional turn toward country. The new tunes held their own reminiscences; as “Tinderbox” compared fame to a rocket, the band played the upward swoop from “Rocket Man.” Sir Elton’s robust voice has roughened slightly, and he has begun to use scratchy notes strategically like Ray Charles. In his old songs he lets his band members sing the high notes. Writing so directly about the John-Taupin partnership is a gamble; it presumes that listeners care about hit makers’ bygone times and don’t mind feeling their own age. The pair’s pop instincts haven’t deserted them; they aim for inspiration in songs like “The Bridge,” which insists, “Every one of us that ever came to play has to cross that bridge or fade away.” Meanwhile the piano part reaches back to their 1970 hit “Your Song,” from a time when they revealed less while conquering the pop world.

236-> Bullpen Can't Hold Lead for Yankees
ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Mike Napoli hit a bases-loaded sacrifice fly in the ninth inning, lifting the Los Angeles Angels over the New York Yankees 6-5 Friday night. After Angels center fielder Chone Figgins made a running catch to rob Melky Cabrera of extra bases and end the top of the ninth, Los Angeles won it. Mike Myers (1-1) faced only one batter, giving up a leadoff double to Garret Anderson. Octavio Dotel relieved and ex-Yankee Juan Rivera singled, sending pinch-runner Reggie Willits to third. An intentional walk to rookie Howie Kendrick loaded the bases, and Adam Kennedy popped out. Dotel just missed on a 2-2 pitch to Napoli, who then hit a fly ball to left field that easily scored Willits. The AL East-leading Yankees stayed 5.5 games ahead of Boston in the AL East. The Angels remained 5.5 games behind Oakland in the AL West.

237-> One Feisty Woman Takes On the Art World
“The art world is a ‘through the looking glass’ experience,” declares Tod Volpe, a suave wheeler-dealer in Harry Moses’ entertaining documentary “Who the $#%& is Jackson Pollock?” It is, he says, an environment of “illusory costumes and disguises by people who are masquerading.” “It’s all about money,” he adds. ”It’s a dog-eat-dog shark tank experience.” Mr. Volpe should know. He was a high-end art dealer who serviced the Hollywood elite until the bottom dropped out of the market and, strapped for cash, he sold paintings belonging to others. He ended up serving two years in prison for fraud. In the movie Mr. Volpe, back in business, is the prime mover for a group of beady-eyed investors working with Teri Horton, a former truck driver whose $5 purchase of an unsigned painting that may or may not be a Jackson Pollock could reap them a fortune. Ms. Horton, a salty, outspoken woman who lives in a trailer and whose hobby is rooting through Dumpsters in search of buried treasures, has less delicate words to describe the world beyond the looking glass: “The whole art world is a fraud.” And as she jumps through hoops trying to prove the authenticity of the canvas she purchased at the Dot Spot Thrift Shop in San Bernardino, Calif., now defunct, you are inclined to agree with her. Ms. Horton, the farthest thing from an art-world aesthete, had never heard of Pollock when she purchased a canvas she describes as so ugly that she tried to give it away to a friend (“We were going to throw darts at it,” she recalls), but it wouldn’t fit through the door of her friend’s trailer. At a garage sale a local art teacher spotted the painting and suggested it might be a Pollock. Her curiosity whetted, Ms. Horton began calling Los Angeles art dealers. Her son, Bill Page, joined the search, which became a decade-long quest for validation of her purchase. As this smart, hard-bitten woman with an eighth-grade education pursues her quest, the documentary portrays the debate between connoisseurship and science as a culture war. Among the connoisseurs who insist that a refined eye is the ultimate judge of authenticity is Thomas Hoving, the former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, exuding contempt and superciliousness. He is the most outspoken in his rejection. Shown the painting, he dismisses it as “pretty, superficial and frivolous.” Leading the scientific side is Peter Paul Biro , an equally self-satisfied forensic specialist from Canada who matches a fingerprint on the back of Ms. Horton’s painting to fingerprints found on a Pollock painting in Berlin and in Pollock’s former studio in East Hampton, N.Y. In a frivolous side trip, the film travels to England to consult John Myatt, one of the world’s most notorious art forgers, who also believes the work is not a Pollock. As Mr. Volpe puts it: “The painting is like Heathcliff in ‘Wuthering Heights.’ He didn’t get his inheritance until he got a title.” Now and then, you wonder if the movie itself might be a public-relations maneuver preparatory to an auction. By the end of the film, you have the unpleasant sense that the snobs have drawn their wagons into a circle to keep out hicks like Ms. Horton and her experts, and that these smooth-talking guardians of an insular world that enriches itself through a kind of legal insider trading are deeply threatened by the intrusions of forensic science. The movie calls into question the determination of provenance, in which a history of a painting’s ownership is used for certification. Half buried in all this detective work is a sketchy biography of Ms. Horton, who grew up in the Ozarks without modern conveniences and at 18 married a man who took the children when the marriage ended three years later. She is quite a character. She turned down a $2 million offer for the painting, no questions asked. And since the film was completed, she has also refused a $9 million offer from Saudi Arabia. Authenticating the work, she says, is not a matter of money, but of principle. Written and directed by Harry Moses; narrator/interviewer, Mr. Moses; director of photography, William Cassara; edited by Jay Freund; music by Terence Blanchard; produced by Steven Hewitt and Mr. Moses; released by Picturehouse. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 74 minutes.

238-> Arts, Briefly; Whitney Expansion Is Approved
The city's Board of Standards and Appeals granted seven waivers to zoning rules yesterday for an expansion of the Whitney Museum of American Art, eliminating the last major barrier to construction. The addition, by the architect Renzo Piano, below, includes a 178-foot, nine-story tower that would rise behind brownstones in a historic district on Madison Avenue between 74th and 75th Streets, connecting to the museum's original 1966 Marcel Breuer building with a series of glass bridges. The public approval process involved heated debates before the Landmarks Preservation Commission, the neighborhood Community Board and the Board of Standards and Appeals. "I'm very pleased; it's been a long road," said Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director. He said that a construction date had not been set. Some Upper East Side residents had objected to the tower on grounds that it was too large and did not fit into the neighborhood fabric. Earlier, they succeeded in requiring Mr. Piano to halve the width of a proposed new entrance for the Whitney so that the facade of a brownstone could be preserved. ROBIN POGREBIN

240-> The Bloomberg Vista
Jonathan Mahler's article on Mayor Bloomberg was thoughtful (Sept. 10). The mayor is willing to stake out politically unpopular positions and believes that financial issues must be factored into any publicly financed projects. The World Trade Center site is fraught with emotion, and the mayor's positions may be deemed unsentimental, but I don't believe he is insensitive to the public's need to remember 9/11 in an appropriate manner. Since he has no legal authority over the site, it makes sense that he concentrate on the surrounding area. The atmosphere of Lower Manhattan before 9/11 was anachronistic, and the migration of business uptown made sense. Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff accurately stated the Bloomberg approach: create an opportunity out of a problem. The quality of downtown life has been enhanced by TriBeCa, and now Lower Manhattan can become another hub of New York City life by including office and residential buildings, parks and a waterfront that is a magnet rather than an eyesore.

245-> This Old Downtown’s a Model for Copycats
DEVELOPERS and government planners seeking to create a small-town atmosphere in the middle of suburban sprawl could do a lot worse than choose Bordentown City as a model. In fact, according to one longtime resident and local broker in this tight-knit community in northern Burlington County about 65 miles from New York, that is exactly what happened a few years back, when a major developer asked a group of real estate agents from several communities for their thoughts about the planning of the much-talked-about Town Center project in nearby Washington Township. “They were trying to get a sense of what people would need in a town center, and I said, ‘That sounds very familiar,’ ” said Pam Erickson, a second-generation Bordentown resident. “When I told him where I lived, he said that Bordentown was where they had in mind. A place where a mix of people live, where the downtown supports the homes, and the homes get fixed up to support the downtown.” The one difference is that Bordentown City is the real thing rather than a modern reinvention. A quaint urban enclave of about 4,000 residents surrounded on all sides by Bordentown Township, an unadulterated suburb of almost 16,000, this miniature city is situated at the confluence of the Delaware River and Crosswicks Creek. It began life 300 years ago as a trading and transportation site, and much of that past is architecturally evident in its single square mile — in the eclectic mixture of housing styles and the old-fashioned downtown shopping area. As in many such towns in the Northeast, Bordentown City’s prosperity has followed the fortunes of industry and commerce. Nicknamed the “little city with a lot of charm,” it is enjoying a new wave of popularity, because of a resurgence in interest in old urban areas, because it is within commuting distance of both New York and Philadelphia and because a new rail line simplifies that trip. With the new light-rail line, which takes passengers to Trenton in 11 minutes; its proximity to Interstate highways; and both public and private boat ramps on the river, Bordentown has been attracting an increasing number of home buyers from northern New Jersey and New York, according to Joan Richio, a broker who moved here from New York City in 1999 to accommodate her job in Delaware and her husband’s in Manhattan. “A lot of people from New York are coming into this area,” said Ms. Richio, now with Weidel Realtors in Bordentown Township. A big push to rejuvenate Bordentown City’s shopping area has helped attract home buyers and retail business owners who, five years ago, might have been reluctant to take a chance on a community of this size. Merchants in particular have been persuaded by the fact that commercial space in other small New Jersey metropolises like Red Bank, Princeton and Lambertville, has become untouchable by comparison. C. J. Mugavero opened the Artful Deposit, an art gallery on Farnsworth Avenue, 11 years ago. In Red Bank or Princeton, she said, her gallery space would cost four or five times as much. Ms. Mugavero, the president of the Downtown Bordentown Association, has seen many new restaurants and shops move into the town center in the last few years. “I’d say, for the last three years, you could pretty much do all your Christmas shopping here and not have to go to the mall,” said Ms. Mugavero, who four years ago decided to live here too. She says there is still room to grow. “If you ask have we peaked yet, I’d say no. But we’re well on our way.” Bordentown City offers a variety of older housing, mostly on smaller lots, attracting buyers who are more appreciative of historic architecture than of owning a giant spread. This community has particular appeal for urban dwellers, who see prestige in its quaintness and atmosphere — though that has not always been true. “When I was in high school in the 70s,” recalled Ms. Erickson, “it was not considered upscale to live in the older houses in Bordentown City. If you had money, you had to live in Bordentown Township. Now it’s almost the opposite. You have professionals who want to live in the city.” Several grand Victorians and colonials sit on larger lots on the city’s perimeter, on the residential ends of Farnsworth Avenue and on streets facing the Delaware, like Prince and Bank. Because Bordentown sits on a bluff 40 feet above the river, the city has not suffered from the kind of flooding that has severely affected neighboring towns. Moving toward the center of town, row houses and smaller single-family houses line the narrow streets. This more-affordable housing stock makes it possible for younger generations to continue to live in Bordentown City, which many do. Maxine Brimmer, another local broker, is a third-generation resident. Her grandfather settled here in the early 1900s, she said, and her father was born here. Ms. Brimmer, 55, has been here her whole life; she grew up at one end of Union Street and now lives at the other. “There’s such a strong sense of community here,” she said, adding that her neighbors often mow her lawn and shovel snow for her. “Everybody says hello to each other. If someone doesn’t say hello back, we say they’re not from Bordentown.” Of the roughly 1,200 residences on the tax rolls in Bordentown City, about 25 to 30 are on the market at any given time, according to Ms. Richio. The larger, more historic homes are generally in the $450,000-to-$550,000 range. According to Megann Tunney Cobbs, a broker for ERA/Advantage, perhaps one or two of the city’s most desirable homes come on the market each year, listing at $600,000 to $700,000. For instance, a grand Victorian at the end of Prince Street, opposite the Thomas Paine memorial statue, recently sold for $640,000. A couple of blocks down on Prince Street, two large homes, both more than 170 years old, are on the market for just under $500,000 each. Annual taxes are $7,200 for one and $9,125 for the other. And on Spring Street, a 19-year-old three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath semiattached house is for sale for $259,900, with taxes of $5,356. The price is typical of row houses in the city. There are no hard-and-fast preservation rules in the zoning law. “Homeowners are sort of encouraged to restore what they’ve got to whatever style it happens to be, but it is still all voluntary,” said Mayor John W. Collom III. For those seeking something built more recently, there is the four-year-old Kings Gate complex on East Park Street, where two-bedroom, two-bath condominiums sell for about $200,000. With almost no vacant land, the community has little room to build any more new houses. The rental apartment market is limited to a few small units and the larger Chestnut Village Apartments, where rents are $650 to $800, according to Ms. Richio. New Jersey Transit’s three-year-old light-rail River Line runs from Bordentown to Trenton, where commuters can get a New Jersey Transit train to Penn Station. The trip takes 80 to 90 minutes. Driving to New York via Route 130 and the New Jersey Turnpike takes just over an hour — if there are no traffic jams. The downtown comes alive on the weekends, when restaurants ranging from upscale Italian to pubs draw both residents and tourists, who come to visit the art galleries, antique shops and bookstores. In May, the downtown business association organizes an iris festival and art show, and in October a cranberry festival. There are two private yacht clubs serving the city, as well as a public boat launch. Hikers can meander along riverbank trails and bikers will soon be able to enjoy an uninterrupted trail along the Delaware, more than 20 miles long, from Bordentown to Lambertville. The schools are part of the Bordentown Regional School District, and city students share the high school and middle school with children from neighboring Bordentown, Fieldsboro and Florence Townships. Bordentown Township High School, which has 625 students, moved to a new building in the fall. Average English SAT scores for the school’s students were 495 for the academic year ended in 2005. The state average was 501. In math the local average was 515, the state’s 519. Opening the new high school building led to realigning all the other schools as well: the old high school became the Bordentown Regional Middle School, for Grades 6 through 8; the former junior high school is now the McFarland Intermediate School, serving Grades 4 and 5; and the Clara Barton Elementary School, which has added a full-day kindergarten, also has Grades 1 through 3. A private alternative is St. Mary’s Elementary School. The city was settled in 1682 by Thomas Farnsworth, who was drawn by the bluff, overlooking a broad bend in the Delaware. It soon became a major trading center, serving boats and stagecoaches traveling along the coast. During the Revolution, it was a strategic site, ultimately burned by the British. Bordentown was home to several patriots, including Francis Hopkinson. Other famous residents included Joseph Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon and the former king of Spain — an exile who is said to have bought land here because of its proximity to both New York and Philadelphia. Along with lots of small-town charm, there is a hipper atmosphere, thanks in part to one-of-a-kind shops and restaurants and a population that blurs race and class lines more broadly than in the surrounding suburbs. Residents seem to respect the history of their properties, choosing to restore them rather than tear them down and start over. While most homes in town show signs of caring owners, some streets could use sprucing up. In its inviting commercial district, Bordentown City has already proved it has a way of achieving this. Why not apply the method farther afield?

WILLIAMS--Ray. Died May 14 at NYU Medical Center which was a part of most of his life. Ray was the Administrator of the Department of Surgery under Frank Spencer, MD. About 40 years ago when his son Shawn had to tell his classmates what his father's work was, he said, "My Dad tells doctors what to do." Well, that somewhat overstates it, but all at NYU who had contact with him knew he could things done and was so highly regarded for his ability as a facilitator. The general word was "Go see Ray." Ray was born in Atlanta, GA and a graduate of Grady High School and Georgia Tech. He was enormously popular as a young man and was relied upon to be the organizer. This ability continued throughout his life. He organized numerous cruise trips among so many other activities for multiple friends. Ray was also a generous contributor to all equality causes. Ray is survived by his life partner of 40 years, Frank Folisi, his son, Shawn, daughter-in-law, Jasmine, and their children, David and Jennifer, and a brother, Graybill, of Orlando, FL.

250-> (Insurance) Policy Shift
To the Editor: Re "Late in Life, Finding a Bonanza in Life Insurance" (front page, Dec. 17): Insurers who are concerned about this do have a weapon to fight back: the policy. They, along with legislation regulating the industry, write the terms of the policy agreement and can choose how, and to whom, a policy may be issued, sold or paid out. If insurers are really concerned, they need to change the way policies are written. Brandon Savage Yuba City, Calif., Dec. 17, 2006

251-> World Enough and Time for ‘a Good Death’
As sudden deaths from heart attacks continue to decline and more people leave this life after a protracted illness, the concept of “a good death” has become ever more important to both the dying and those who survive them. But what is a good death, and is it really the same for everyone? And what are the consequences of different approaches to death for those left behind? Nearly four decades ago, Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross outlined what she recognized as five stages people go through after the diagnosis of an incurable illness: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and finally acceptance of their impending death. She recognized that people approaching the end of life might seesaw between the various stages, but that those who reached “acceptance” were most likely to die in peace with the least trauma to their survivors. Indeed, hospice care practically demands that people who are dying reach acceptance, since they must accept only comfort care and give up all treatments aimed at staving off their demise. Still, there are many people who choose to continue fighting for life, leaving no therapeutic stone unturned, until they take their last breath. There are people who will not acknowledge that they have a fatal illness, remaining in denial even as their bodies shrink under the onslaught of disease. There are people who weather their medical storm in fury because they are being robbed of their future. There are people who cannot emerge from depression over the prospect of losing everyone they love. Can these people, who never achieve acceptance, also have a good death? The answer seems to be yes, although the consequences for survivors may sometimes be less than desirable. Dr. Joseph Sacco, a palliative care specialist at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center in New York, tells about a patient, Mrs. Santana, in his book, “On His Own Terms,” the story of his father’s losing battle against lung cancer. Mrs. Santana had terminal cancer and was near death, but she never uttered the words “cancer” or “death.” During her final hospital stay, she maintained her lifelong elegance and dignity, polishing her nails, grooming her hair, always cheerful and calm, until the day she died. Dr. Sacco’s father, Joe, on the other hand, kept insisting he would “beat this thing,” even as his breathing became ever more labored and his weight dropped by half. Though Dr. Sacco, based on his training, thought his father should come to accept his fate, he felt he had no choice but to humor the dying man and play along. Joe’s death was peaceful enough, occurring as it did on his terms. But it took its toll on Dr. Sacco, who laments: “Had my father not been frozen by fear, he might have been able to talk openly and reaffirm his knowledge that his son really did love him. Instead, paralyzed by the implication that death was imminent, he brushed me aside with a wave of the hand and the comment that he wasn’t going to die.” Dr. Greg A. Sachs’s father-in-law, Al, who also had lung cancer, chose to have no treatment for his disease and spent not one day of his remaining 18 months in the hospital. As Dr. Sachs told it in The Journal of the American Medical Association (Nov. 15, 2000), Al spent the year “straightening out files; reconciling accounts and labeling everything in the house, including fuse boxes and cabinet drawers, so that his wife would be able to find everything when he was gone.” According to an agreed-upon plan, Al died peacefully at home surrounded by his loving family, with his distressing end-of-life symptoms assuaged by morphine, anti-anxiety medication and oxygen. But as Dr. Sachs tells it, Al’s equanimity about dying, his methodical preparations and his gentle demise did not ease the family’s pain as he lay dying, for they knew Al didn’t want to die and nobody in the family wanted to lose him. Dr. Sachs explained that for survivors, “some of the suffering is existential or spiritual” and even the best end-of-life care cannot ease that kind of suffering. He cautioned his fellow physicians against “painting too rosy a picture of end-of-life care” and creating unreasonable expectations of “spiritual growth” and “transcendence.” But while no one is likely to rejoice at losing a loved one, having people die in accordance with their wishes is, in my experience, far less painful than the alternative, which all too often involves futile medical rescue efforts that patients do not want and that can get in the way of comforting end-of-life conversations and reconciliations. When my mother-in-law’s cancer recurred four years after treatment, she chose, at 84, not to have anything done that might prolong her life. And no one dared to contradict this decision by a woman who had always lived life on her own terms and was determined to die that way. Living will in hand and fully in control of her faculties, she entered the hospital hemorrhaging, and at her request a “Do Not Resuscitate” notice was posted on her door. The family was called, and all had a chance to say goodbye unimpeded by machines, tubes and medical personnel. Twelve hours later, she was gone, leaving behind a sad but grateful family. Her minister, at her bedside until the end, said he had never before seen such a peaceful death. Dr. Karen E. Steinhauser and colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham, N.C., examined the constituents of a good death for patients, their families and health care providers. The 85 study participants had no trouble describing a “bad death” — having inadequately treated pain while receiving aggressive but futile cure-directed therapy. Patients felt disregarded, family members felt perplexed and concerned about suffering, and providers felt out of control and feared that they were not providing good care. Decisions not previously discussed usually had to be made during a crisis. Families unprepared for what happens when death is imminent often panicked and rushed the patient to the hospital, where last-ditch and usually futile attempts at resuscitation were made, when both patient and family would have preferred a home death. The study identified six components of a good death, described in The Annals of Internal Medicine of May 16, 2000: ¶Pain and symptom management. Pain, more so than dying itself, is too often the cause of acute anxiety among patients and their families. ¶Clear decision making. Patients want to have a say in treatment decisions. ¶Preparation for death. Patients want to know what to expect as their illness progresses and to plan for what will follow their deaths. ¶Completion. This includes reviewing one’s life, resolving conflicts, spending time with family and friends, and saying good-bye. ¶Contribution to others. Many people nearing death achieve a clarity as to what is really important in life and want to share that understanding with others. ¶Affirmation. Study participants emphasized the importance of being seen as a unique and whole person and being understood in the context of their lives, values and preferences. This study says that dying can, and should, be a much less painful experience for many more people and their loved ones than it now is.

252-> News Museum Receives Gifts of $52 Million
WASHINGTON, May 23  The Newseum, an interactive museum of journalism history that seeks to show how and why news is made, announced Tuesday that it had received $52 million in gifts from eight media companies and families with ties to newspapers, as part of an effort to complete the construction of a new building near the National Mall. The donations include $10 million from The New York Times Company and the Ochs-Sulzberger family, which controls the Times Company, and $10 million from News Corporation, which owns the Fox News Channel and The New York Post. The money will help pay for a $435 million building scheduled to open in fall 2007 on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and the Capitol. The building will have seven levels of galleries, theaters and retail space; its facade will feature a 74-foot-high marble engraving with the wording of the First Amendment. The Newseum was developed by the Freedom Forum, a nonpartisan foundation devoted to a free press. The original museum, in Arlington, Va., was open from 1997 to 2002. "Great journalism does more than record history; it changes history," Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., publisher of The Times and chairman of the Times Company, said at a news conference. "Great journalism protects our fundamental freedoms. And, most importantly, great journalism plays a central role in today's global society." Newseum officials said contributions also came from NBC Universal; Time Warner Inc.; the Hearst Corporation; ABC News/Walt Disney Company; the Greenspun family, which owns The Las Vegas Sun; and the Pulliam family, which once owned 46 newspapers. Jim Kelly, the managing editor of Time Inc., said, "Journalists around the world are harassed, jailed and sometimes killed for trying to report the news, and it is their legacies that the Newseum honors." Organizers said the museum's mission was to explain how the media had covered historic events and to educate people. "The First Amendment is a very fragile thing right now," Charles L. Overby, chairman of the Newseum, said in an interview. "We want to take people beyond the musty, dusty facts and make them understand why a free press is so important."

253-> World Briefing | Americas: Canada: Agents Asked Terror Suspects' Parents For Help
Months before arresting 17 suspects in an alleged terrorism plot this month, agents of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service warned some of the suspects' parents that their sons were adopting "extremist ideology," The Globe and Mail reported. The accused, mostly in their late teens and early 20's, face charges of participating in a plot to attack Canadian landmarks and behead the prime minister. The approach taken by the agents to speak to the suspects' parents was in line with a strategy to scare off the accused by not hiding the fact that they were being monitored. "C.S.I.S. officers had approached some parents to let them know that C.S.I.S. suspected their children were becoming adherents to an extremist ideology," a spokeswoman for the service, Barb Campion, told the newspaper.

254-> Moonlight and Muddle for a Loopy New Orleans Family in 'Ridiculous Fraud'
PRINCETON, N.J., May 13 — Southern eccentrics come in many varieties, and it seems that Beth Henley has generously included at least one specimen of each in her new play, "Ridiculous Fraud," which is having its premiere here at the McCarter Theater. Oddballs kooky, sad, violent and dreamy wander through the latest crackpot comedy from the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Crimes of the Heart." But this confused play, which follows the wayward fortunes of a genteel but down-at-the-heels family in New Orleans, seems to be all cracks and precious little comedy. The play's manifold events take place over the course of a year, beginning with the suddenly canceled marriage of Lafcad (Daniel London), the youngest of the three brothers Clay. The news comes as a blow to Lafcad's older brother Andrew (Reg Rogers), the coolest head in the family, who is embarking on a campaign for state auditor and doesn't think another blot on the escutcheon will do much for his chances. It's bad enough that the family patriarch has been imprisoned for fraud, after all. But the quirky Lafcad just decided he couldn't face married life. He's always been given to strong feelings: the boys' mother, now deceased, had to stop making scrambled eggs when he evinced a revulsion at watching people eat them. Then again, maybe his aversion to matrimony is genetic, says the daffy Uncle Baites (Charles Haid). He himself hit the highway on his wedding day years back. "I have endured years of loneliness since, and all I dream of is love," he says. It appears that the impending nuptials inspired him to take a chance again. At the train station, en route to the festivities, he picked up a young woman, Georgia (Heather Goldenhersh), with a wooden leg and nothing better to do than attend a stranger's wedding. So it goes in the whimsical world of Ms. Henley, where the lonely and the lost are prey to strange urges and violent changes of heart. She seems to be striving to imbue her regular Southern-fried freakishness with a vaguely Chekhovian mood. Most of the play's characters are dreamy, dissatisfied, unfulfilled or convinced that they are living a fraudulent emotional life. But the various strands of Ms. Henley's plot never twine themselves together very effectively, and the characters' passions often seem as arbitrary as their idiosyncrasies seem pasted on. The quirks and ill-fated affairs of the heart begin to seem randomly distributed among the play's characters, not expressions of their confused and complicated souls. Andrew's wife, Willow (Ali Marsh), has a moony yen for her taciturn, duck-hunting brother-in-law, Kap (Tim DeKay), but it evaporates mysteriously. Just as mysterious is the sudden emergence of her fey nature, which announces itself in the play's last scene, when it appears that she has lived in ignorance of the fact that Coca-Cola is carbonated in bottles as well as in cans. The seemingly level-headed Andrew strikes up a romance with his wife's stepmother, Maude (Barbara Garrick), whose battle with cancer forms another superficially explored strand in the plot. Maude's husband, Ed (John Carroll Lynch), is neglectful and cruel in one scene, takes violent revenge for her betrayal in the next scene and plays the placidly loving husband in the one after that. The director, Lisa Peterson, is at a loss to find a compelling dramatic arc for a play that lacks focus and never settles on a resonant theme, unless it's the general idea of dishonesty and fraud that takes various forms in the characters' lives. And, for the most part, the actors are unable to imbue their characters with enough emotional substance to give ballast to their strange and sketchy natures. (A few are not good matches for their roles, either. Why cast Mr. Rogers, a naturally eccentric actor even without a ripe Southern accent, in the role of the straitlaced brother?) "Ridiculous Fraud" does boast a reasonably successful stretch of slapstick in the second act and could be improved by tightening and by eliminating extraneous material. The kooky girl with the wooden leg, affably played by Ms. Goldenhersh, could comfortably be excised, as well as the dumb bug-eating business. (Long story.) And it is heartening to note that Ms. Henley's gift for dialogue variously lyrical and comic is still in good form. Recoiling from Willow's confession that she has fallen out of love with her husband, Lafcad pleads, "Don't tell me, really, it's still morning." By Beth Henley; directed by Lisa Peterson; sets by Michael Yeargan; costumes by Jess Goldstein; lighting by Peter Kaczorowski; sound by Martin Desjardins; dramaturg, Janice Paran. Presented by the McCarter Theater Center, Emily Mann, artistic director. At the McCarter Theater, 91 University Place, Princeton, N.J., (609) 258-2787. Through June 11. Running time: 2 hours 30 minutes. WITH: Daniel London (Lafcad Clay), Reg Rogers (Andrew Clay), Ali Marsh (Willow Clay), Tim DeKay (Kap Clay), Charles Haid (Baites), Heather Goldenhersh (Georgia), Barbara Garrick (Maude Chrystal) and John Carroll Lynch (Ed Chrystal).

TSUCHIYA--Maureen Keating, suddenly in Manhattan on October 28, 2006. Beloved wife of Takashi and mother of Hannah Meagan, age 15. Born November 1, 1954 in Atkinson, Nebraska, Maureen was the daughter of John and Dolores Keating, the second of eight children. A resident of Chappaqua, NY since 1997, Maureen lived in Tokyo (1991-1996) and Manhattan (1987-1991); she attended secondary school in Atkinson, Nebraska and moved to Minnesota to attend St. Benedicts University in St. John. She earned a bachelors degree from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas where she pursued a Master's degree in public Administration. Stricken as a toddler with a particularly severe strain of polio in 1956, Maureen developed an amazing ability to face hardship and triumph over adversity. She did not just deal with this lifelong disability, which worsened over time, she used it to propel herself and others forward--always with vigor, grace, dignity, a rapier wit and wicked sense of humor. Besides her family and her friends, her PASSION WAS POLITICS. Maureen, a lifelong active Democrat and fierce proponent of equal opportunity, was widely respected for her forcefulness and skill. A powerful change agent, she worked tirelessly for the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and witnessed the White House signing in 1988. While in Tokyo, as President of Democrats Abroad, she invigorated the party globally and was elected to attend the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Her skills as a political operative are widely valued and will be sorely missed in New York State. Maureen is survived by her husband Takashi and daughter Hannah of Chappaqua, parents John and Dolores Keating of Atkinson, Nebraska; mother-in-law Misuzu Tsuchiya of tokyo; Irish twin Mary Rose and husband Gene Schaaf of Bassett, Nebraska; brother Phillip of Omaha, Nebraska; brother Patrick and wife Eliza of Istanbul, Turkey; brother James and wife Natalie of Cody, Nebraska; brother Matthew and wife Jill of Kearney, Nebraska; brother Gerard and wife Janet of Geneva, Illinois; sister-in-law Kumi and husband Toshiyuki Misu of Tokyo; nieces, Sarah Schaaf, Yuria Misu, Kaitlin Keating, and Reese Keating; nephews Mark Schaaf, Andrew Schaaf, Ian Keating, Taiki Misu, Jake Keating, Zach Keating, Adam Keating, Alec Keating, Jack Keating and Dalton Keating; great-nephew Taylor Schaaf and great - niece Hailey Schaaf.

260-> ‘10th and Wolf’: Welcome Home From the War. Now Here’s an Offer You Can’t Refuse.
A gangster movie that tries harder, “10th and Wolf” is the directorial debut of Bobby Moresco, a writer and producer of “Crash.” It desperately wants to matter in the same way that its Academy Award-winning forerunner tried to matter: by trafficking in a blunt, populist morality that insists we’re all in this mess together. The mess, in this case, isn’t the stew of simmering ethnic and class antagonisms addressed in “Crash,” but a pervasive feeling that there’s not much difference nowadays between the good guys and the bad; everyone is tainted. If that message is moldy, “10th and Wolf” gives it a meretricious new twist. Without thinking very hard, it compares America’s exit from the first Persian Gulf war to gangster morality in a shabby neighborhood of an Eastern industrial city. That comparison doesn’t add up, except in the mind of the movie’s putative hero, Tommy Santoro (James Marsden). In a solemn voice-over narration, he analogizes his reaction to the United States withdrawal from the gulf in 1991 to his traumatic disillusionment at age 12, when his father was shot dead on the front lawn. It was then that he realized that his beloved dad was a mobster who probably deserved what he got. Because the movie, filmed in Pittsburgh, is loosely based on real events that occurred in Philadelphia in the 1980’s and early 90’s, its particular circle of urban hell is an unidentified hybrid of the two cities. Filmed in shades of brown and gray and slathered in blood, its world is as drab and menacing as that of “Donnie Brasco.” In a diabolical touch, mob colloquies take place in a giant meatpacking cellar amid the hanging carcasses. The movie is narrated by Tommy, its only male character with a glimmer of nobility. (The women are the usual long-suffering, silent partners who know too much and occasionally erupt in hysterical fits.) A handsome, tarnished angel, Tommy, the one member of his family not caught up in a life of crime, returns to his hometown in 1991 after serving as a Marine in the gulf. Initially gung-ho to fight the good fight, he decided that the war made no sense when Saddam Hussein was left in power. Running amok, he stole a jeep, beat up an officer and served time in the brig. With no clear future in view, he stays with his aunt Tina (Lesley Ann Warren) and exerts a good influence on his dimwitted younger brother, Vincent (a dissipated-looking Brad Renfro). Almost immediately he is accosted by Horvath (Brian Dennehy), a hulking, corrupt F.B.I. agent who threatens to put him in prison for years unless he infiltrates the family business and wears a wire to record negotiations between his cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi) and a Mafia drug lord (Francesco Salvi) moving in on family territory. Because “10th and Wolf” is set in gangland, it falls back on mob family values to provide whatever sympathy it can scrounge up for its lowlifes. The movie is full of the usual scenes of hugging, grieving and vowing of loyalty that signal that these people have feelings too: operatic ones. But the characters never transcend the clichés embedded in the culture since “The Godfather.” Except for Tommy, who doesn’t seem to belong to the family, the men are raging, foul-mouthed beasts who exact revenge with the sadistic relish that Brian De Palma’s “Scarface” made into a mob movie imperative. Early on, a one-legged sociopath (Dash Mihok) bludgeons another man to a pulp with his prosthesis. If you can’t technically fault the hot-wired performance of Mr. Ribisi as a rising mob boss, his character amounts to little more than a reheated Joe Pesci-Harvey Keitel stereotype. For efficiency’s sake, the screenplay crams all the information about its characters’ backgrounds and the neighborhood history into its first 20 minutes. As the consequences of this rushed introduction play out, you are at a loss to recall the details shoehorned into that gory lump of exposition. Amid all the violence, a half-baked love story wobbles into view, as Tommy connects with Brandy (Piper Perabo), a beautiful, embittered bartender in the seedy stripper club run by her husband’s killer, Willie (Ken Garito). She and Willy coexist warily until a showdown on top of the bar that begins as an attempted rape and explodes into ultraviolence. Forget the movie’s spurious moral agenda; scenes like this quasi-pornographic set piece show what trying harder really means in the gangster movie business. Written and directed by Bobby Moresco; director of photography, Alex Nepomniaschy; edited by Harvey Rosenstock; music by Aaron Zigman; production designer, Rando Schmook; produced by Leo Rossi and Joe Murphy; released by ThinkFilm. Running time: 110 minutes. WITH: James Marsden (Tommy), Giovanni Ribisi (Joey), Brad Renfro (Vincent), Piper Perabo (Brandy), Dennis Hopper (Matello), Lesley Ann Warren (Aunt Tina), Brian Dennehy (Horvath), Dash Mihok (Junior), Tommy Lee (Jimmy Tatts), Val Kilmer (Murtha), Ken Garito (Willy) and Francesco Salvi (Reggio).

261-> Pat Corley, 76, Actor on ‘Murphy Brown’, Is Dead
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 15 (AP) — Pat Corley, the character actor who served sage advice along with drinks as Phil the barkeep on “Murphy Brown,” died here on Monday. He was 76.

Pat Corley’s five-decade career included roles in the films “Coming Home,” “True Confessions” and “Against All Odds.” He appeared on “Murphy Brown,” the CBS show starring Candice Bergen as a television newswoman, from 1988 to 1996. Among his other television roles was a baseball team owner on “The Bay City Blues” and the coroner Wally Nydorf on “Hill Street Blues. ” Mr. Corley, a native of Dallas, got his start in theater. He appeared in summer stock in California, where he met his wife, Iris, also an actress. After moving to New York he appeared on and off Broadway. Besides his son Jerry, he is survived by another son, Kevin; two daughters, Troy Corley and Christina Pratt; and 12 grandchildren. His wife died a year ago, and a daughter, Michelle, died about 10 years ago.

263-> Sarah Feinberg, H. Daniel Pfeiffer
Sarah Elizabeth Feinberg, the daughter of Mary Elizabeth Stanley of Charleston, W. Va., and Lee Franklin Feinberg, also of Charleston, was married last evening to H. Daniel Pfeiffer, a son of Lear Pfeiffer and Gary Malick Pfeiffer of Wilmington, Del. The Rev. Mary Adelia McLeod, the retired bishop of the Episcopal Church of Vermont, performed the ceremony at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Charleston. The bride, 28, will continue to use her name professionally. She is the press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington. She graduated from Washington and Lee University. Her father, a former member of the West Virginia Legislature, is a senior partner in Spilman Thomas & Battle, a Charleston law firm. Her mother is a magistrate judge assigned to Federal District Court in Charleston. The bride is the stepdaughter of Susan Riggs Feinberg, who is also a partner in Spilman Thomas & Battle. The bridegroom, 30, works in Washington as the communications director for Senator Evan Bayh, the Indiana Democrat. He graduated magna cum laude from Georgetown. His mother retired as a learning specialist at Wilmington Friends School in Delaware. His father retired as a senior vice president and the chief financial officer of DuPont in Wilmington. Ms. Feinberg and Mr. Pfeiffer met in 2000 while working for Al Gore’s election campaign. He was the northeast communications director, based in Nashville, and she was in Charleston as the West Virginia press secretary. They spoke on the phone about 10 times a day for four months, but did not meet until that December, at a postelection reception for the campaign staff at the vice president’s mansion in Washington. “I was immediately interested,’’ Ms. Feinberg said. “I thought that Dan was brilliant and funny, and he made me feel at ease. But he was a little distracted at the time: he was seeing someone else.’’ They began dating in August 2002, when they worked side by side, in Sioux Falls, S.D., for the successful re-election campaign of Senator Tim Johnson. “I thought the world of her as a colleague and a friend, but in terms of a relationship, I didn’t put two and two together for a long time,’’ Mr. Pfeiffer said. “But sitting four feet away from her, well, it wasn’t very long before I wanted to go out with her.’’

265-> On the Barstool Again, With One for His Muse, in ‘Factotum’
FOR years the boozy, beautiful world of Charles Bukowski has proved catnip to European filmmakers and a few American actors happy to go along for the rough ride: Ben Gazzara, Mickey Rourke and now Matt Dillon. Bukowski’s own story (his parents moved to Los Angeles from Germany when he was 3) clearly holds attraction for certain creative types, as do all his tales of ordinary madness. That many of those stories take place in Los Angeles may be particularly seductive, since few images telegraph the paradox of the American dream better than a drunk passed out in the shadow of Hollywood. Hollywood, as sign or guiding principle, is nowhere to be found in “Factotum,” and there isn’t a palm tree in sight. Shot in a seedy, forlorn Minneapolis, far from that city’s green-canopied streets and Prairie School architecture, the film was directed by the wonderfully named Bent Hamer, a Norwegian whose earlier features include the deadpan comedy “Kitchen Stories.” Working with the producer Jim Stark, Mr. Hamer adapted the screenplay from the 1975 novel of the same title, with snippets from three other, more characteristically Bukowskian sounding volumes: “The Days Run Away Like Wild Horses Over the Hills” and the posthumous “What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire” and “The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship.” Published when Bukowski was in his mid-50’s and starting to reach a wider readership, “Factotum” presents the age-old struggle of man against mediocrity. Henry Chinaski (Mr. Dillon), Bukowski’s familiar alter ego, is the heroic survivor of countless benders, brawls, rejection slips, crazy women and soul-killing, mind-deadening jobs. Or, as he puts it so nicely in the novel: “How in the hell could a man enjoy being awakened at 6:30 a.m. by an alarm clock, leap out of bed, dress, force-feed” — there is, naturally, a scatological dimension to this list — “brush teeth and hair, and fight traffic to get to a place where essentially you made lots of money for somebody else and were asked to be grateful for the opportunity to do so?” In “Factotum” Henry answers this most reasonable question mostly by trying to avoid working, or at least working too hard, for other people. (Bukowski himself toiled for the Postal Service for more than a decade.) To that end, he takes a succession of menial jobs that require him to polish the vainglorious décor of a newspaper building (he holds out hope, briefly, for a job as a reporter), jackhammer ice and sort pickles. He does all of this with degrees of competency and just enough interest to keep him from collapsing into a stupor, though on occasion he does drop into the nearest bar. There, in a flood of alcohol, he casts a bloodshot eye on the adjoining flotsam and jetsam, taking notes on the human condition. Of course Bukowski-Chinaski was always working, even when he could barely hold down a job, sending out manuscripts and collecting, for many lean years, rejection notices. In “Factotum” Mr. Hamer shows us Henry coiled over a dimly lighted table, pressing his pen hard into sheets of paper, as the words float on the soundtrack. Mr. Dillon, wearing a beard and the flushed cheeks of a committed lush, sounds as persuasive as he looks. Whether he’s nuzzling another drunk (Lili Taylor and Marisa Tomei take turns baring necks and psyches) or swapping philosophies with another shirker (Fisher Stevens), the actor delivers much of his dialogue with the hushed deliberation of a man who spends a lot of time in his head, which makes sense, given the company he generally keeps. Like the film itself, Mr. Dillon’s performance works through understatement. It’s easy to go big with Bukowski, the way that Barbet Schroeder did in his 1987 film, “Barfly,” in which a freewheeling Mickey Rourke plays a skid-row Puck in a theater of the damned. There are intimations of soul amid this film’s bloody grins and barstool gargoyles, but what it lacks is an appreciation for Bukowski’s tenderness, for those sighs of feeling that rise up when life is this hard, but the soul enduring it has not hardened in turn. Mr. Dillon’s phrasing carries the weight of such feeling, as does the hypnotically slowed gestures that give him the aspect of a man sitting at the bottom of a pool and thinking about drowning. Henry doesn’t drown, though, as played by Mr. Dillon and interpreted by Mr. Hamer, he does wallow magnificently and often rather hilariously. “Factotum” is a film about the horrors and occasional comedy of work, as well as gutting through life on your own terms, which in Bukowski’s case meant turning both that horror and that comedy into literature. Even now, more than a decade after his death and well along into his canonization, there remains something genuinely liberating about his refusal to join the clock-puncher’s lockstep. Subversive might not be the right word with which to characterize his commitment to his art, his muse, his hip flask and the Big No, as in no to the straight and narrow, no to the clean and tidy. But it does have a nice ring. Directed by Bent Hamer; written by Mr. Hamer and Jim Stark, based on the novel by Charles Bukowski; director of photography, John Christian Rosenlund; edited by Pal Gengenbach; music by Kristin Asbjornsen; production designer, Eve Cauley Turner; produced by Mr. Stark and Mr. Hamer; released by IFC Films. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 94 minutes. WITH: Matt Dillon (Henry Chinaski), Lili Taylor (Jan), Marisa Tomei (Laura), Fisher Stevens (Manny), Didier Flamand (Pierre), Adrienne Shelly (Jerry), Karen Young (Grace) and Tom Lyons (Tony Endicott).

266-> A Family’s Psychic Journey to an Unreachable Horizon
The story in “Bhutan” may be awfully familiar, but it’s also awfully well told, which you would expect from the pedigrees involved. Now if only someone would rein in those Down East accents a bit. The play, at the Cherry Lane Theater, is named for the kingdom in the Himalayas, but everyone in it talks like a caricature of a Maine lobsterman, since it’s set somewhere in New England, and that exaggerated drawl (done inconsistently here, as it almost always is) is theatrical shorthand for “poor and undereducated.” Happily, there comes a point not too far into this 90-minute drama when you stop being distracted by the accent and start listening to the story, written by Daisy Foote, directed by Evan Yionoulis and enacted by a fine cast of four: Tasha Lawrence, Sarah Lord, Amy Redford and Jedadiah Schultz. Ms. Lawrence plays Mary, a youngish widow with a good-hearted teenage son, Warren (Mr. Schultz); a smart but socially awkward daughter, Frances (Ms. Lord); and an unseen neighbor whose adventures in places like Bhutan have captured Frances’s imagination. Probably you’ve already worked out the dynamics from that little description. Each character (the fourth is Mary’s brassy sister, Sara) has some personal Bhutan, an unattainable goal that is seen as a ticket out of the dreary life that looms ahead. Ms. Foote, no doubt realizing that the theme is not exactly fresh, finds a captivating way to deliver it: The characters have barely been introduced when she flashes forward, showing Warren in a prison jumpsuit and Mary’s modest domestic tranquillity shattered. Back and forth in time the story goes, with Ms. Foote, who learned something about playwriting from her father, Horton, expertly trickling out the details of the familial meltdown. This is a well-made play, with all four characters experiencing emotional journeys, and so the time-jumping gimmick requires deft acting, the performers alternating between their early and later personas. Mr. Schultz covers the most distance and does so nicely. Ms. Redford, daughter of Robert, is the most entertaining. But it’s Ms. Lord who quietly anchors the play with an understated teenage longing that’s completely believable. The denouement turns out to be fairly ordinary, and later you realize that had the story been told in straight chronological fashion it wouldn’t have been much of a story at all. There’s also a hokey metaphor involving a rumbly furnace that ought to be excised. But even with the flaws, it’s a gratifying hour and a half.

268-> Japan’s Arms Exports (1 Letter)
To the Editor: “The Toll of Small Arms’’ (Op-Chart, Sept. 5) identifies Japan as one of world’s largest exporters of small arms. An implication might be that Japanese small arms are used for military purposes, something that is generally prohibited by our peace Constitution. Instead, Japan’s small-arms exports are largely pistols and rifles used for sports and hunting, with performance specifications significantly different from military weapons. Japan takes a leading role in addressing small-arms issues in the United Nations. Jiro Okuyama Director Japan Information Center Consulate General of Japan New York, Sept. 12, 2006

269-> Dell to Open Stores in 2 Malls as Experiment
Dell, which built its business selling PC's and other electronics directly to customers by phone and online, has decided to try something new: a storefront. Dell said yesterday that it would open two mall stores this summer as a test, making them a hybrid of Dell's direct model and a conventional electronics store. Dell's products will be on display, but customers will order a PC, television or printer online from the store. Products will be delivered to the customer as if they had ordered from a PC at home, as most of its customers do. The Dell statement came after an analyst called attention to the plan, which was reported in Texas newspapers on Sunday. Dell insists that it is not losing confidence in the direct-sales model that has made it the world's biggest seller of PC's. "The tenets of the model remain the same," said Venancio Figueroa, a Dell spokesman. Dell has been selling its products from free-standing booths or kiosks in malls since 1994. The mall stores are just bigger versions of those kiosks, the company said, and will be able to display far more merchandise. Cindy Shaw, an analyst with Moors & Cabot Capital Markets, said consumers and small businesses, which together account for 20 percent of Dell's revenue, would be typical shoppers in such a store. The move is a sign that the company is willing to experiment to reinvigorate its slowing PC sales. In the first three months of the year, Dell lost market share in the United States to companies that sell in stores. Gartner, the market research firm, said that was the first time Dell had lost market share since Gartner began tracking PC data in 1989. Dell has also been cutting prices of its PC's to increase sales. Dell's shares closed yesterday at $24.09, down 29 cents, and near the 52-week low recorded last week. Dell's direct model does have limitations. As it sells more products like big-screen TV's and notebook computers, the company is finding that customers prefer to see or handle those products before buying. Dell has felt this most acutely with notebooks; notebook sales at Hewlett-Packard, Dell's chief rival, are growing more rapidly than at Dell. Hewlett, which sells computers directly as well as through retailers, has long argued that its mixed sales channel holds an advantage because it gives its customers a chance to test products. Dell said it would open two stores this summer, the first in NorthPark Center in Dallas and the other in Palisades Center in West Nyack, N.Y. It plans to display about 36 products, including big-screen TV's and printers as well as desktop PC's and notebook computers, in about 3,000 square feet of floor space. The stores will have ordering stations, but will carry no inventory. By sticking to the build-to-order model, the company avoids the risk of stocking too much of a particular product at the stores. But the selling through the stores will be less efficient than selling online because Dell will have to pay for store staff. The company would not say how many people will be employed at each store. "It is not clear to us how cost-effective Dell's stores might be for build-to-order," Ms. Shaw said in a research report issued yesterday. Dell has experimented with retail before, but has always avoided having to hire sales representatives. In the early 1990's, it sold through a number of mass merchants like Best Buy, Costco and Sam's Club, but it ended that practice in 1994, citing low profit margins on the business. Later that year, the company began opening the free-standing booths in malls. Those kiosks, which are now about 120 square feet in size, display about a dozen products. Customers place an order directly with Dell through a computer in the booth. The kiosks have been successful enough that Dell now has 160 kiosks in malls.

270-> Italian Banks in Merger Discussion
Banca Intesa of Italy may buy a smaller rival, Sanpaolo IMI, to create a bank with more than 6,300 branches, the most in Italy. The boards of the companies will meet to discuss a possible merger by the end of the week, Intesa and Sanpaolo said in a brief statement. Intesa and Sanpaolo are under pressure to merge as foreign lenders enter the Italian market, increasing competition. With a combined market value of more than 60 billion euros ($77 billion), the new company would rank among the top 10 banks in Europe by market value. Shares of Intesa, based in Milan, jumped 7.6 percent, the most in more than three and half years. Shares of Sanpaolo, of Turin, climbed 6.1 percent.

271-> Always Ready With a Joke, if Not a Feather Duster
An elaborate joke told in Portuguese, without translation. A consideration of the meaning of dust. A trek to Alaska to retrieve a cancer-curing tree. These would not seem promising building blocks for a contemporary American stage comedy. In fact, it’s hard to fathom how they comfortably fit into the same play. And yet thanks to the alchemical imagination of Sarah Ruhl, the gifted author of “The Clean House,” this strange grab bag of ideas and images, together with some more exotic ingredients, magically coheres to form one of the finest and funniest new plays you’re likely to see in New York this season. I’m not just playing prophet here. There is evidence to support that bold assertion. Ms. Ruhl’s play has been produced to widespread acclaim at various regional theaters over the last couple of years and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2005. My confidence derives in small part from the general paucity of seriously good new plays. But this is hardly the time to lament the state of playwriting, or to wonder why inhabitants of the country’s theatrical capital should be last in line at the punch bowl. As Ms. Ruhl’s compassionate comedy argues, the best things in life — a sublime joke, a fulfilling purpose, a soul mate, even a satisfactory death — are infinitely worth waiting for. And it is our good fortune that “The Clean House,” which opened last night at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, has arrived in a gorgeous production that fully taps its tart humor, theatrical audacity and emotional richness. The play opens with that tantalizing untranslated joke, told with a raunchy exuberance that transmits a fair amount of its humor by a young woman from Brazil named Matilde (Vanessa Aspillaga). When she is not thinking up jokes, Matilde gets depressed. And when Matilde gets depressed, she doesn’t like to clean. Which would not be a problem if Matilde were a privileged woman like Lane (Blair Brown), the driven American doctor who is her employer. But Matilde has been hired to clean Lane’s house, and her allergic reaction to Windex and feather dusters has the even-tempered Lane on edge. “I’m sorry,” she tells us, with little apology in her righteous tone, “but I did not go to medical school to clean my own house.” Fortunately for both, Lane’s unhappily idle sister, Virginia (Jill Clayburgh), sees the quintessence in dust, the metaphysics in mold. “If you do not clean,” she asks, “how do you know if you’ve made any progress in life?” The daft sparkle in Ms. Clayburgh’s eye glows brighter as Virginia says, “If it were not for dust I think I would die.” And so Virginia persuades Matilde to let her clean her sister’s house on the sly, thereby setting in motion a series of events that gradually reorders — and ineluctably deepens — the relationships among the play’s characters, who include Lane’s husband, Charles (John Dossett), a surgeon, and his new mistress, Ana (Concetta Tomei), on whom he recently performed a mastectomy, just after falling instantly in love with her during a brief consultation. If that sounds a little preposterous, that’s because it is. Ms. Ruhl is not content to present a smart little satire of labor relations between the entitled and the immigrant underclass in contemporary America. Sociology is just one small thread in the multihued tapestry of “The Clean House,” a play that keeps revealing surprising insights, whimsical images and layers of rich feeling as it goes along. Its kaleidoscopic sensibility embraces an operatic love story that ends as operatic love stories tend to do; a balletic feat of physical comedy from Ms. Clayburgh, in which Lane’s pristine living room is reduced to merry disorder by the woman who so lovingly cleaned it; and perceptive reflections on our need for order in life and its painful conflict with the chaos of real passion and the messy paths of circumstance. The key to its success is the fullness with which Ms. Ruhl’s sees her characters, who all possess complicated interior lives that begin to impinge upon one another in mysterious ways as their fates become intertwined. “Who are they?” a startled Matilde asks, entering Lane’s pristine living room unexpectedly and seeing an unknown couple embracing. “My husband and the woman he loves,” Lane responds coolly. “Don’t worry. It’s only my imagination.” Bill Rauch, who directed the play’s world premiere at the Yale Repertory Theater two years ago, blends its contrasting tones with subtle precision. His cast displays the same keen understanding of Ms. Ruhl’s ability to see the absurdity in extremes of emotion, but the authenticity too. At the end of the first act, Lane succumbs to one of those laughter-dissolving-into-tears moments that you’d think would be an unplayable cliché by now. In context, and as performed by an actress of Ms. Brown’s trenchant gifts, it feels as honest as it is painful, as painful as it is hilarious. Ms. Clayburgh has hardly left the stage since she returned to it last fall after a long absence. This is her fourth performance on a New York stage in a mere year, and it is her finest by far. The poignance and dithery charm in her portrayal of Virginia are perfectly calibrated, as unhappiness and sororal envy evolve into compassion. With her insistence on the transformative — not to mention fatal — charms of a good joke, the character of Matilde might seem dubiously quirky, but Ms. Aspillaga humanizes her with ease, tempering warmth with a deadpan sense of timing. Ms. Tomei also finds the rooted truth of her exotically spiced character, an unlikely Latina temptress at 67. “The Clean House” is a play concerned primarily with the complex intimacies among women. Reflecting on her marriage, Virginia says, with satisfaction and just a little disappointment, “My husband is like a well-placed couch.” Mr. Dossett is thoroughly effective as the resident sofa. But even the furniture is granted a full measure of feeling in Ms. Ruhl’s empathetic vision. Charles’s apology for the mess he’s made of his wife’s life (“There are things, big invisible things, that come unannounced — they walk in, and we have to give way”) may be self-serving, but it is sincere, and painful but true. That’s small comfort to Lane. The chilly silence that follows this explanation is broken by Matilde, ready with her usual remedy: “Would anybody like to hear a joke?” Of course it’s told in Portuguese, so you probably won’t get it. But this peculiarity epitomizes a fundamental message of Ms. Ruhl’s odd and enchanting play: We may never come to a full understanding of the jokes life plays, but the wisest and possibly noblest response is to have a good laugh anyway.

272-> Justice Dept. Fraud Unit Is Looking at Michaels Stores
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7 (Dow Jones) — An investigation of the stock option practices of Michaels Stores Inc., the arts and crafts retailer, was transferred to the Justice Department’s fraud section, the company said Thursday in a regulator filing. The company began an internal review of its stock options practices this year. An Aug. 25 report from the company audit committee’s independent legal counsel did not support a conclusion that there had been intentional misconduct, Michaels said. But the S.E.C.’s enforcement unit in June asked Michaels to preserve all documents concerning stock option grants from 1990 to the present. Michaels Stores also received a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court in Manhattan requesting stock options documents from 1996 to the present. The United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York said on Wednesday that it had withdrawn its grand jury subpoena request. The subpoena withdrawal is in connection with the transfer of the case to the Justice Department, the company said.

273-> Texas: Kindergarten Assault Claims Lead to Suit
Two parents have filed a lawsuit accusing school officials of failing to protect their daughters from sexual assault by a girl in their kindergarten class. The suit claims both girls were subjected to repeated sexual abuse by the third girl during nap periods and on a playground in the fall of 2005. It says the assaults took place even though the mother of the accused girl had warned a school official that her daughter had been a victim of sexual abuse and might be a threat. The lawsuit, filed last week in Federal District Court, names the Eanes Independent School District in Austin and an elementary school principal. It seeks unspecified damages. The district superintendent, Nola Wellman, denied the accusations, saying administrators took “immediate and appropriate action” to deal with the assault claims.

274-> Weighing Hubble's Worth
To the Editor: Re "Hubble, NASA's Comeback Kid, Survives to See a New Dawn http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/07/science/space/07hubb.html Read the Article. " (Nov. 7): Dennis Overbye strikes an optimistic note concerning NASA's decision to extend the life of the Hubble Space Telescope. Another view of this is that fixing the Hubble, for all the good work it has done in the past, represents sticking with the status quo and resistance to technological change. As ground-based telescopes have gotten much bigger than Hubble and are rapidly getting the capability to cover most of the sky with atmosphere-piercing adaptive optic systems, Hubble is losing its competitive edge, particularly in the scientifically important infrared wave lengths. We know we have the technology now to build space-based telescopes bigger and better than Hubble to view wavelengths that can never be seen from Earth, or by the Hubble for that matter. Is continuing with Hubble really the best way to spend our scarce science dollars? James F. McManus Jr. Phoenix

275-> Pujols Pursues a Scorched Pitcher Policy
YOU knew if you searched long and hard enough, you would find a flaw in Albert Pujols's game. No one can be that good, right? So I searched and searched and finally came up with it. The man has not hit a triple this season. What? Just because he has 105 total bases and an .833 slugging percentage, we should overlook the lack of a triple? No way. Triples are important. Just ask the Mets and José Reyes. No triples? What kind of a hitter is this guy? Actually, it's good that they don't make many players like Albert Pujols, because if there were more, he wouldn't be so special, and Albert Pujols is very special. Pujols is demonstrating his special talents this season, but they are nothing new. He demonstrated them in each of his first five seasons, too. In that period, he had a batting average ranging from .314 to .359, he hit 34 to 46 home runs — including more than 40 in each of the past three seasons — and he had a total of 117 to 130 runs batted in. In addition, in only one season did he fall short of 1.000 in the total of slugging and on-base percentages. The exception came in Pujols's second season, 2002, when he had a total of .955. Plenty of players would like to fall short like that every year. This season, Pujols has an .833 slugging percentage and a .469 on-base percentage for a 1.302 total, best in the major leagues. Every player would like those statistics, but in recent seasons, Barry Bonds was the only hitter with numbers like those. Pujols, though, is the anti-Bonds. He has achieved his numbers free of the suspicion of the use of steroids or any other illegal performance-enhancing substances. In that sense, he is a refreshing superstar who can say, "I don't cheat." Pujols is the model of the post-steroids era, if you are willing to believe that this is the post-steroids era. If you're not, let's call it the steroid-testing era. In pursuing a scorched-pitcher policy, Pujols is outperforming himself this season. He has 19 home runs, reaching that total in the fewest games (37), and he has driven in 48 runs. Both numbers lead the majors. He also leads the majors in runs scored (39), slugging (.833) and total bases (105). He is second in on-base percentage to Bonds by 8 points and is tied for sixth in the National League in hitting (.333), and tied for third in walks (33). It's probably a tribute to the Cardinals' lineup that opposing teams don't walk Pujols more often. He is at least as likely as Bonds to beat the other team. In a four-season stretch, 2001 through 2004, Bonds drew 755 walks, or an average of 189 a season, or 1.32 a game. Even this season, when he has had problems hitting, Bonds has been walked a league-leading 39 times. Should Pujols continue his ferocious assault on N.L. pitchers, they may, in self-defense, begin walking him more often. His hitting apparently has no bounds. He is unlikely to hit 83 home runs, which was the mathematical projection Saturday night after he hit his 19th in the Cardinals' 37th game. Home run pace, a popular figure with the news media, is rapidly changeable. Pujols, for example, did not hit a home run in his team's 38th game Sunday, and suddenly he was on a pace to hit not 83, but only 81. Unless he continues his barrage of home runs, his pace number will continue to fall. On the other hand, Pujols, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound right-handed batter, is capable of hitting tons of home runs. He is the only player to hit more than 30 home runs in each of his first five seasons, and he hit 200 faster than anyone except Ralph Kiner, reaching 200 with a flourish by hitting a grand slam last Sept. 30. Can Pujols hit enough home runs to break the single-season record of 73 that Bonds set in 2001? Can he eclipse Mark McGwire, who broke Rogers Maris's record with 70 in 1998? Can he hit more than Sammy Sosa, who is the only player to hit more than 60 three times? Not very likely. But imagine what this guy could do with a little help from steroids. Where Pujols has to be watched is the home runs he hits in his career. Whether or not Bonds passes Henry Aaron's career total of 755, Alex Rodriguez, with 438 career home runs, is considered the next most likely hitter to challenge the record. But Rodriguez, soon to be 31, is in his 12th year in the majors. Pujols, with 220 in his sixth, is more than halfway to Rodriguez's total, and he is 26. Pujols, of course, doesn't only hit home runs. Last season he joined Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio and Al Simmons as the only players who drove in 100 runs in each of their first five seasons in the majors. Pujols, not surprisingly, was named the N.L.'s most valuable player last season, demonstrating his overwhelming value in the face of the absence for most of the season of Scott Rolen, the Cardinals' other M.V.P.-type player. Only six weeks into this season, Pujols already has a huge lead in this year's M.V.P. race. As if the Mets haven't had enough trouble recently, losing five of their past seven games, they encounter Pujols for the first time tonight in St. Louis. He has hit .331 against them with 11 home runs and 28 runs batted in. Their trouble could continue.

276-> Dance Tunes in Rapid Flux, From Funk to Chanson
Dance music runs on rhythm and desire, and Brazilian Girls put twists in both of them. This New York band — whose lone female member is an Italian singer, Sabina Sciubba — is poly-everything, with lyrics in half a dozen languages and songs that refuse to stay in any style for long. Brazilian Girls have just released their second album, “Talk to La Bomb” (Verve Forecast), and the band played most of the new songs on Thursday night at Spiegeltent, the carousel-like temporary club at South Street Seaport. Clubs are the natural habitat for Brazilian Girls. They shaped their music as one of the resident bands at the Lower East Side club Nublu, and their music embraces multiple grooves as tools for seduction. Didi Gutman on keyboards, Jesse Murphy on bass and Aaron Johnston on drums, abetted by samples and loops, keep shifting styles and genres, between and often within songs. During Thursday’s set the band invoked funk, reggae, house, samba, 1980’s electro and something like a hora, along with some eerie electronic textures Radiohead wouldn’t have disowned. In the crowd-pleasing centerpiece of the set Ms. Sciubba got the crowd shouting, “Give it to me!” Where many dance-music bands are satisfied with a beat, two chords and a come-on, Brazilian Girls are far more ambitious. The songs on their second album are more fully formed and thornier than those on their debut. They can veer toward new wave, electropop or French chanson as reimagined in a 21st-century lounge, where a suave melody could be peppered with a double-time break beat. And while dance music often promises a simple-minded escape into pleasure, Brazilian Girls place their newer songs in a world that can also be ominous and filled with strife. Ms. Sciubba’s voice blithely lilts through lyrics like the ones in “Never Met a German,” about the lure of power and violence. Onstage, Ms. Sciubba was both a party girl and a tease. As the set began her face was covered with a white cloth that she sang through; later, when she doffed it, she used a headband to hide her face in her hair. But she was hardly aloof; she stepped off the stage to wander through the crowd, sharing her microphone with fans. She made herself the embodiment of Brazilian Girls’ songs: a not-so-simple object of desire.

277-> Nebraska: Casino Measure Can’t Be on Ballot, Court Says
The state’s highest court said that a plan to legalize casino gambling in Nebraska could not appear on the November ballot because it was too similar to measures rejected in 2004. The ruling, which overturned a lower court decision, said the casino petition violated the state Constitution’s limit on submitting similar ballot proposals more than once in three years. Nebraska voters turned down two casino plans in November 2004. The newest proposal would allow one casino in each of the state’s three Congressional districts.

We believe it’s in the industry’s best interests.” The federal government has given companies until Aug. 21 to support the tentative agreement, which would end a four-year dispute between the world’s two largest trading partners.

280-> In 'Spring Awakening,' a Rock 'n' Roll Heartbeat for 19th-Century German Schoolboys
As species go, the rock star is relatively young. Carbon dating has fixed its emergence from the primordial ooze of postwar pop at sometime in the 1950's, somewhere in the continental United States. So it is disorienting to find the 19th-century German schoolboys in the new musical "Spring Awakening" yanking microphones from inside their little woolen jackets, fixing us with baleful gazes and screaming amplified angst into our ears. It is also exhilarating. When was the last time you felt a frisson of surprise and excitement at something that happened in a new musical? For that matter, when was the last time something new happened in a new musical? A fresh breeze of true inspiration blows steadily through this ambitious if imperfect show, which features alluringly melancholy music by the pop singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik and book and lyrics by Steven Sater. "Spring Awakening," which opened last night at the Atlantic Theater Company, is an adaptation of the once-scandalous 1891 play by Frank Wedekind, the German playwright who is probably best known as the author of the source material for the Alban Berg opera "Lulu." But Mr. Sheik and Mr. Sater have not transposed Wedekind's fragmented meditation on the pleasures and dangers of hormonal efflorescence to a suburban American junior high school, circa yesterday, as you might expect. Nor do they traffic in pastiche, the lingua franca of contemporary musicals. Instead, they invest Wedekind's young boys with the anachronistic souls of would-be rock 'n' roll stars, dreamers and screamers strutting on stages in their minds, even as they insist we see them in their original historical context. Now that a proper language has been created to channel the slashing torments of teendom, they imply, it would be folly to employ any other musical idiom. After all, you wouldn't try to revisit "Oklahoma!" by turning it into a Sex Pistols jukebox musical, would you? The conceit is bold, funny and inviting, and it is matched by a vibrant production from the director, Michael Mayer, that is all of those things, too. We are swept into the show instantly in an early scene in which a roomful of fidgeting schoolboys erupts in irritation at their stern Latin teacher. They continue to recite passages robotically from that famously dead language, but they do it to the lively sounds of a new one, expressing their inward rebellion by stomping around as drumbeats clatter and a guitar strums. While rock may have not yet been invented in the late 19th century, its confreres in the celebrated nose-thumbing slogan against conformity — sex and drugs — were already on the scene, as Wedekind's play uncomfortably reminded audience in the early decades of the 20th. (The play was not produced until 1906.) "Spring Awakening" depicts or discusses adolescent sexuality in a variety of guises, including (possible) rape, masturbation and homosexuality. It explores the confusion and desperation that ensue when the onrushing tide of hormones meets the ignorance of children raised by parents too embarrassed or prudish to discuss what those new urges signify. Two of the three lead characters are sacrificed on the altar of propriety: one tormented by shame over sexual fantasies and bad grades, the other, a girlfriend, the victim of a botched abortion. (Drugs, of a nonrecreational kind, cause the young woman's death in the play, although it is left vague in the musical.) The play could be — and has been — reduced to a tract ballyhooing the importance of sex education for minors. But that's a drastic oversimplification of its richness. The forces that assail the play's young characters are not just those of repression and rectitude. More potent than those are the seductions that adolescents will always have to grapple with in their anxious souls, no matter how edified they may be on the subject of birds and bees: the alluring chant of nihilism, the animalistic impulses toward violence, the thought-obliterating joys of sex. Wedekind's play is about the difficulty of finding a place of equilibrium in a world that, round about 13, starts to look strange and terrifying through the distorting prism of puberty. Despite the craft and integrity of much of their work, Mr. Sheik and Mr. Sater's musical falls into some of the usual traps accompanying attempts to translate a work of art from one medium into another. It tends to simplify the emotional textures in the play. All the adult roles are played by two actors (Mary McCann and Frank Wood), for example, which tips the play too firmly in the direction of a standard tale of generation-gap conflict between collective authority and individual expression. And in the necessary reduction of Wedekind's text to make room for the show's nearly 20 songs, we lose some of the play's subtle elliptical structure and its characters' intricate psychology. The central trio — the anxious misfit Moritz (John Gallagher Jr.), the good-student Melchior (Jonathan Groff) and Melchior's sweetly curious girlfriend, Wendla (Lea Michele) — do not really emerge as fully human figures. They're more like singing vessels for general adolescent anxieties, so it is possible to follow them to their individual dooms with entirely dry eyes. This is partly due to the almost insurmountable difficulty faced by the actors, adults mostly in their 20's meant to represent 14- and 15-year-olds in disturbed thrall to the transformations of impending adulthood. Mr. Gallagher, so sensitive as a troubled teenager in "Rabbit Hole," is a little mannered as the still more troubled Moritz. (Did he take a cue for his character from his hairdo, a showy tangle recalling Robert Smith of the Cure?) Mr. Groff and Ms. Michele do better in more unadorned performances that quietly illuminate the confusions and excitements of their characters' sexual adventuring and its tragic consequences, while Jonathan B. Wright, as a handsome blond seducer, and Gideon Glick, his easily persuaded prey, are standouts in their amusing homoerotic duet. Problems also arise from the challenge of making pop music function as theater music. Pop and rock are best at evoking moods and emotions or announcing attitudes, not heightening a narrative point or defining a specific character. Mr. Sheik's music, orchestrated for a small rock band supported by cello and bass, is often gorgeous in its soaring melodies and gentle rhythms, but its lushness can overwhelm Mr. Sater's moody lyrics, artful and evocative though they often are. And we often seem to be hearing the same notes — yearning, tempestuousness, anger — repeated in song after song; the show becomes saturated in a general plaintiveness that can be enervating. Still, the propulsive staging by Mr. Mayer infuses it with energy as it blends the informal atmosphere of a rock concert with ritualistic elements. (Some of the actors sit among audience members surrounding the playing space.) Unobtrusive choreography by Bill T. Jones is neatly woven into the show's texture, allowing us to see how children can develop a physical language to channel urges they do not have the words to express. The intricate lighting by Kevin Adams flashes from sober whites, for the book scenes, to urgent neons as the children enter their private musical worlds. Although it evokes, perhaps a little too broadly, the mournful comic streak in Wedekind's play, this musical version of "Spring Awakening" does not have the dramatic impact you would hope for, given its somber story of youth awakening to life's rich potential for both joy and pain. But its arching sense of adventure makes an unforgettable statement nonetheless. Imprinted on the memory is the happy sensation of having witnessed something unusual and aspiring, something vital and new.

282-> An Appeal in Lipitor Case in India
Ranbaxy Laboratories, India’s biggest drug maker, asked a United States appeals court to reconsider a ruling that would keep a generic version of Pfizer cholesterol medicine Lipitor off the market until 2010. On Aug. 2, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington upheld a patent on the drug that expires on March 24, 2010, and invalidated one that expires on June 28, 2011. Ranbaxy, which was challenging both patents, filed papers asking the appeals court to reconsider the ruling on the 2010 patent. Lipitor had sales of $12.2 billion last year, making it the world’s best-selling drug. Analysts had projected that the drug, which accounts for about 40 percent of Pfizer’s profit, would not have competition from cheaper generic versions until June 2011. Wednesday was the deadline for the companies to ask the court to reconsider any aspect of the ruling that did not go their way. A Pfizer spokesman, Bryant Haskins, said: “We have not yet filed anything with the appeals court.” He declined to comment further on Pfizer’s plans.

283-> Utah: Polygamist Is Ordered to Stand Trial
Warren S. Jeffs, the fundamentalist Mormon polygamist leader, was ordered by a Utah state judge in St. George to stand trial on two felony counts of rape as an accomplice. The judge, James L. Shumate of District Court, found probable cause to order Mr. Jeffs to stand trial on the charges, which carry a penalty of up to life in prison. Mr. Jeffs, 51, is accused of performing a “spiritual” marriage of a 14-year-old girl to her 19-year-old first cousin in 2001. The girl testified that she told Mr. Jeffs that she did not want to be married to her cousin and did not want to engage in “husband-wife” relations but that Mr. Jeffs repeatedly directed that she do so because he said it was ordered by God.

284-> Problems, but Also the Will to Overcome All of Them
Maria Castro thought that her days of raising children were coming to an end after she gave birth to twins, the last of eight brothers and sisters. She did not imagine that eight years later, she would take custody of four young granddaughters and that they would all live in an apartment so crowded that the floor is barely visible. That is exactly what happened after her oldest son was given a lengthy prison sentence on drug charges in El Salvador, their native country, during a visit there nine years ago. She managed to gain custody of his children, and after she succeeded, her three-bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, was once again filled with toddlers, in addition to the twins and her mother, who is senile. She had to give up her job as a home attendant to devote her time to taking care of her family, including her youngest son, Cesar, who needs extra care, because he is severely retarded, epileptic and schizophrenic. “Mostly my brother’s a big load, then the girls,” said Astrid Castro, 17, Cesar’s twin sister and her mother’s translator. The grandchildren range from 8 to 17. Ms. Castro struggles to provide clothes and shoes for her granddaughters, and also struggles to clothe Cesar, who often soils himself because of tantrums and accidents. She works hard to stretch assistance payments to keep everybody fed — Cesar has a healthy appetite. Nine years ago, Ms. Castro’s priest at St. Margaret Mary suggested that, faced with these problems, she contact Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, which is one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Since then, Ms. Castro has worked with three social workers and has received help in the form of canned food, clothes and dolls for Christmas. Last year, Ms. Castro also received $200 from the fund for her grandchildren’s school uniforms. Just before school began this year, however, Ms. Castro had to scramble to get enough money to buy a new uniform for one granddaughter, Estrella Chavez, 11, in the color required for her first year of junior high school. Glowing with pride, Ms. Castro showed off Estrella’s academic awards, explaining how important it was for her to get a uniform so that she could attend classes there. Ms. Castro also hauled out a large black portfolio filled with Astrid’s artwork. The first page opened to a striking self-portrait in pencil. The sketch could not be mistaken for anyone but Astrid, her eyes dark and deep. Astrid says that her love and her talent are for art, but she wants to be a pediatrician because of her exposure to her brother’s medical problems and a desire to work with children. She hopes to go to Hunter College and then to medical school at Columbia. She is taking Advanced Placement English this year and needs a computer, because her teacher requires assignments to be typed or printed. While some high school seniors might just want to go to parties and spend time with friends, Astrid’s voice conveys a sense of conviction and commitment about her future. She does not sound worn down for someone who wakes up every day before everyone else so that she can get to the one bathroom and then help dress the girls and Cesar. In the meantime, Ms. Castro makes meals consisting mostly of rice, spaghetti and soup as she tries to feed eight mouths. “It’s not enough, but it’s enough for everyone to eat,” she said with an air of making do that never seems to lift. One of her biggest wishes is to find larger quarters for her extended family. “It’s real small, but you feel like it’s a real home,” Shanae Anderson, the social work supervisor at Catholic Charities of Brooklyn and Queens, said of the family’s current apartment, in the Astoria Houses. Ms. Castro’s situation as the single head of a large family epitomizes the kinds of cases that the charity likes to take on, especially when education is emphasized in the home, she said. When asked what she wants in the future, Ms. Castro rattles off a list of things for her children. Pressed to think about what she would want for herself, she can respond only with “Salud” — health.

285-> Next Season’s Hit Shows? They’re the Talk of the Web
YEARS ago, to learn about the coming television season, “you’d have to wait for the fall preview issue of TV Guide” each September, recalls Shari Ann Brill, vice president and director for the Carat Programming division of the Carat USA media agency in New York. Now, coverage of the shows begins in May, appearing everywhere from “Access Hollywood” to Entertainment Weekly magazine to televisionwithoutpity.com. And the networks offer elaborate sneak peeks at the new series on their Web sites, as well as on DVD’s, in custom-published magazines and through other sites like itunes.com. As a result, discussions among viewers about what to watch (or avoid) begin earlier than ever. That becomes an opportunity for media agencies, which help marketers select the series on which to buy commercial time (or avoid). They can begin to gather consumer intelligence in the spring and summer, rather than waiting until fall. The Internet also makes the task easier, as the consumer chatter on Web sites, blogs and message boards can be readily monitored. •That is what the Consumer Experience Practice, part of the Interpublic Media unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has been doing for three years in what are called PropheSee reports. It plans to release today the first report that will preview the 2006-7 season, summarizing consumer sentiment online about more than two dozen new series. Of the five new shows that consumers were discussing most often online in May and June, according to the report, four will be on NBC: “Heroes,” ranked first; “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,” second; “30 Rock,” fourth; and “Friday Night Lights,” fifth. One of the five, “Vanished,” will be on Fox; it is ranked No. 3. Of the five new shows the report says were being discussed least often online in May and June, two will be on Fox — “Happy Hour,” 25th, and “Standoff,” 26th — and three will be on ABC: “Notes from the Underbelly,” No. 22; “Big Day,” No. 23; and “Help Me Help You,” No. 24. (Since the data were gathered, ABC has rescheduled “Big Day” and “Notes from the Underbelly.” They will have their premieres in midseason rather than in the fall.) The series in the top five share several characteristics, said Stacey Lynn Koerner, president at the Consumer Experience Practice. All will have serialized plots, meaning that the story lines will be threaded through each episode, requiring viewers to watch regularly to keep track of the fate of the characters. That contrasts with series like “C.S.I.,” with plots that are generally self-contained in each episode and do not continue from week to week. Several series that were identified as potential sleeper hits in past PropheSee reports, like “Lost” on ABC and “Supernatural” on WB, have serialized plots. Such shows stimulate conversations, Ms. Koerner said, as viewers speculate about the potential fates of the characters. Another trait shared by the top five series, Ms. Koerner said, is interest in the actors who will be in the casts — many of them are familiar to viewers from other programs in which they have appeared. For instance, Ms. Koerner said, 26 percent of the online discussions of “Heroes,” a drama at 9 p.m. Monday about everyday people with unusual powers, were centered on cast members like Milo Ventimiglia (“Gilmore Girls”). And 37 percent of the online discussions about “Vanished,” another drama at 9 p.m. Monday, about a senator’s missing wife, were centered on cast members like Ming-Na (“E.R.”) and Esai Morales (“N.Y.P.D. Blue”). A third commonality among many of the top five new series, Ms. Koerner said, is that they are created or produced by “TV auteurs,” that is, executives who have developed followings for their work. For example, “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” is from Aaron Sorkin, of “The West Wing” fame, and the talents behind “30 Rock” include Lorne Michaels and Tina Fey of “Saturday Night Live.” Both “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip,” a comedy-drama at 10 p.m. Monday, and “30 Rock,” a comedy at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday, are about TV shows not unlike “Saturday Night Live.” “A lot of the conversation is whether the behind-the-scenes idea is a good idea,” Ms. Koerner said, and whether viewers will be interested in two such shows in one season on one network. The Consumer Experience Practice plans to release two additional reports before the fall season starts, Ms. Koerner said. One, covering online discussions last month, is expected in two to three weeks, she added, and the other, covering August, is expected in mid-September. The PropheSee reports last year, before the 2005-6 season, identified three sleeper hits that are returning for 2006-7. They were, in addition to “Supernatural,” “Everybody Hates Chris,” on CW, and “Ghost Whisperer,” on CBS. But the reports also listed “Commander in Chief,” on ABC, and “Threshold,” on CBS, as having the potential to be hits, and neither one is returning. “It’s not an exact science,” Ms. Koerner acknowledged. Ms. Brill of Carat USA, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group, said the attention new series are getting before their premieres “is interesting, but it does not give me a sense of how a show will perform over time.” “It’s about getting viewers there a second time,” she added. Ms. Koerner, asked to identify some of the 2006-7 series that could be sleepers, said she wanted to “wait for more data” before drawing up a final list. •She offered five shows on a preliminary list: “Heroes”; “Vanished”; “Friday Night Lights,” a drama at 8 p.m. Tuesday about a football team; “Jericho,” a drama at 8 p.m. Wednesday on CBS, about a Kansas town that survives a nuclear apocalypse; and “Ugly Betty,” a comedy-drama at 8 p.m. Thursday on ABC, based on a popular Spanish-language telenovela with a Cinderella-type plot. Sometimes, Ms. Koerner said, she is surprised at the subjects that generate discussion online. For example, she said, many viewers were asking why NBC is scheduling a show titled “Friday Night Lights” on Tuesday nights. The answer is that the series is about football as played by a high school team. If the show were on Friday nights, when most high schools play their football games, it could miss out on a lot of viewers.

286-> The Overlook
When Alice Kent finally came out of the master bedroom, she had brushed her hair and washed her face but had only put on the white robe. Bosch now saw how attractive she was. Small and dark and exotic-looking in some way. He guessed that taking her husband’s name had hidden a bloodline from somewhere far away. Her black hair had a luminescent quality. It framed a face that was beautiful and sorrowful at the same time. She noticed Brenner, and he nodded and introduced himself, again using the proprietary and possessive tone when saying that Walling was his partner. Alice Kent seemed so dazed by what was happening that she showed no recognition of Brenner in the way that she had remembered Walling. Brenner directed her to the couch and told her to sit down. “Where is my husband?” she demanded, this time in a voice that was stronger and calmer than before. “I want to know what is going on.” Walling sat down next to her, ready to console if necessary. Brenner took a chair near the fireplace. Bosch remained standing. He never liked to be sitting down when he delivered this sort of news. “Mrs. Kent,” Bosch said, taking the lead in a proprietary effort to keep his hold on the case. “I am a homicide detective. I am here because earlier tonight we found the body of a man we believe to be your husband. I am very sorry to tell you this.” Her head dropped forward as she received the news, then her hands came up and covered her face. A shudder went through her body, and the sound of a helpless moan came from behind her hands. Then she started to cry, deep sobs that shook her shoulders so much that she had to lower her hands to keep the robe from coming open. Walling reached over and put a hand on the back of her neck. Brenner offered to get her a glass of water, and she nodded. While he was gone, Bosch studied the woman and saw the tears streaking her cheeks. It was dirty work, telling someone that her loved one was dead. He had done it hundreds of times, but it wasn’t something you ever got used to or good at. It had also been done to him. When his own mother was murdered more than 40 years before, he got the news from a cop just after he climbed out of a swimming pool at a youth hall. His response was to jump back in and try to never come back up. Brenner delivered the water, and the brand-new widow drank half of it down. Before anyone could ask a question, there was a knock on the door, and Bosch let in two paramedics carrying big equipment boxes. Bosch moved out of the way while they took over to assess the woman’s physical condition. He signaled Walling and Brenner into the kitchen, where they could confer in whispers. He realized that they should have talked about this before. “So how do you want to handle her?” Bosch asked. Brenner spread his hands wide again, as if he was open to suggestions. It appeared to be his signature gesture. “I think you keep the lead,” the agent said. “We’ll step in when needed. If you don’t like that we could — ” “No, that’s good. I’ll keep the lead.” He looked at Walling, waiting for an objection, but she was fine with it, too. He turned to leave the kitchen, but Brenner stopped him. “Bosch, I want to be upfront with you,” Brenner said. Bosch turned back. “Meaning?” “Meaning I had you checked out. The word is you — ” “What do you mean you checked me out? You asked questions about me?” “I need to know who we’re working with.” “If you have any questions, you can ask me.” Brenner raised his hands palms out. “Fair enough.” Bosch left the kitchen and stood in the living room waiting for the paramedics to finish with Alice Kent. He noticed that one of the paramedics was putting some sort of cream on the chafe marks on her wrists and ankles. The other was taking a blood-pressure reading. He saw that bandages had been placed on her neck and one wrist, apparently covering wounds that Bosch hadn’t noticed before. His phone buzzed, and Bosch went back into the kitchen to take the call. He noticed that Walling and Brenner were gone, apparently having slipped into another part of the house. It made Bosch anxious. He didn’t know what they were up to. The call was from his partner. Ferras had finally made it to the crime scene. Bosch updated him and directed him to start knocking on doors and looking for witnesses who may have seen or heard something relating to the killing of Stanley Kent. He knew it was a long shot because no one had called 911 after the shooting. But the canvassing of the neighborhood had to be done. When Bosch came out of the kitchen, the paramedics had packed up and were leaving. They told Bosch that Alice Kent was physically fine, with minor wounds and skin abrasions. They also said they had given her a pill to help calm her and a squeeze tube of the cream to continue applying to the chafe marks on her wrists and ankles. Walling was sitting on the couch next to her again, and Brenner was back in his seat by the fireplace. Bosch sat down on the chair directly across the glass coffee table from Alice Kent. “Mrs. Kent,” he began, “we are very sorry for your loss and the trauma you have been through. But it is very urgent that we move quickly with the investigation. In a perfect world, we would wait until you are ready to talk to us. But it’s not a perfect world. You know that better than we do now. We need to ask you questions about what happened here tonight.” She folded her arms across her chest and nodded that she understood. “Then let’s get started,” Bosch said. “Can you tell us what happened?” “Two men,” she responded tearfully. “I never saw them. I mean their faces. I never saw their faces. There was a knock at the door, and I answered. There was no one there. Then when I started to close the door, they were there. They jumped out. They had on masks and hoods — like a sweatshirt with a hood. They pushed their way in, and they grabbed me. They had a knife, and one of them held it against my throat. He told me he would cut my throat if I didn’t do exactly what he told me to do.” She lightly touched the bandage on her neck. “Do you remember what time this was?” Bosch asked. “It was almost 6 o’clock,” she said. “It had been dark for a while, and I was about to start dinner. Stanley comes home most nights at 7. Unless he’s working down in the South County or up in the desert.” The reminder of her husband’s habits brought a new rush of tears into Alice Kent’s eyes and voice. Bosch tried to keep her on point by moving to the next question. He thought he already detected a slowing down of her speech patterns. The pill the paramedics gave her was taking effect. “What did the men do, Mrs. Kent?” he asked. “They grabbed me, and they took me to the bedroom. They made me sit down on the bed and take off all my clothes. Then they — one of them — started to ask me questions. I was scared. I guess I got hysterical, and he slapped me, and he yelled at me. He told me to calm down and answer his questions.” “What did he ask you?” “I can’t remember everything. I was so scared.” “Try, Mrs. Kent. It’s important. It will help us find your husband’s killers.” “He asked me if we had a gun, and he asked me where the — ” “Wait a minute, Mrs. Kent,” Bosch said. “Let’s go one at a time. He asked you if you had a gun. What did you tell him?” “I was scared. I said, yes, we had a gun. He asked where it was, and I told him it was in the drawer by the bed on my husband’s side. It was the gun we got after you warned us about the dangers Stan faced with his job.” She said this last part while looking directly at Walling. “Weren’t you afraid that they would kill you with it?” Bosch asked. “Why did you tell them where the gun was?” Alice Kent looked down at her hands. “I was sitting there naked. I was already sure they were going to rape me and kill me. I guess I thought it didn’t matter anymore.” Bosch nodded as if he understood. “What else did they ask you, Mrs. Kent?” “They wanted to know where the keys to the car were. I told them. I told them everything they wanted to know.” “Is that your car they were talking about?” “Yes, my car. In the garage. I keep the keys on the kitchen counter.” “I checked the garage. It’s empty.” “I heard the garage door — when they were here. They must’ve taken the car.” Brenner abruptly stood up. “We need to get this out,” he interjected. “Can you tell us what kind of car it is and whether you have the license-plate number?” “It’s a Chrysler 300. I don’t know the number. I could look it up in our insurance file.” Brenner held his hands up to stop her from getting up. “Not necessary. I’ll be able to get it. I’m going to call it in right away.” He got up to go to the kitchen to make the call without disturbing the interview. Bosch went back to his questions. “What else did they ask you, Mrs. Kent?” “They wanted our camera. The camera that worked with my husband’s computer. I told them that Stanley had a camera that I think was in his desk. Whenever I answered a question, one man — the one who asked them — would then translate to the other, and that man left the room. I guess he went to get the camera.” Now Walling stood up and headed toward the hallway leading to the bedrooms. “Rachel, don’t touch anything. I have a crime scene team coming.” Walling waved as she disappeared down the hall. Brenner then came back into the room and nodded to Bosch. “The BOLO’s out,” he said. Alice Kent asked what a BOLO was. “It means be on the lookout,” Bosch explained. “They’ll be looking for your car. What happened next with the two men, Mrs. Kent?” She grew tearful as she answered. “They . . . they tied me in that awful way and gagged me with one of my husband’s neckties. Then after the one came back in with the camera, the other took a picture of me like that.” Bosch noted the look of burning humiliation on her face. “He took a photograph?” “Yes, that’s all. Then they both left the room. The one who spoke English bent down and whispered that my husband would come to rescue me. Then he left.” That brought a long space of silence before Bosch continued. “After they left the bedroom, did they leave the house right away?” he asked. The woman shook her head. “I heard them talking for a little while, then I heard the garage door. It rumbles in the house like an earthquake. I felt it twice — it opened and closed. After that I thought they were gone.” Brenner cut into the interview again. “When I was in the kitchen, I think I heard you say that one of the men translated for the other. Do you know what language they were speaking?” “I am not sure. The one who spoke in English had an accent, but I don’t know where it was from. I think Middle Eastern. I think when they spoke to each other it was Arabic or something. It was foreign, very guttural. But I don’t know the different languages.” Brenner nodded as if her answer was confirming something. “Do you remember anything else about what the men might have asked or said?” Bosch asked. “No, that’s all.” Bosch wasn’t convinced. He began to go through the story with her again, coming at the same information from new angles. It was a tried-and-true interview technique for eliciting new details, and it did not fail him. The most interesting bit of new information to emerge in the second telling was that the man who spoke English had also asked her what the password was to her e-mail account. Near the end of the retelling of her ordeal, the forensics team arrived, and Bosch called for a break in the questioning. While Alice Kent remained on the couch, he walked the tech team back to the master bedroom so they could start there. He then stepped into a corner of the room and called his partner. Ferras reported that he had found nobody so far who had seen or heard anything on the overlook. Bosch told him that when he wanted a break from knocking on doors, he should check into Stanley Kent’s ownership of a gun. They needed to find the make and model. It was looking as if his own gun was probably the weapon he was killed with. As Bosch closed the phone, Walling called to him from the home office. Harry found her and Brenner standing behind the desk and looking at a computer screen. “Look at this,” Walling said. “I told you, you shouldn’t be touching anything yet.” “We don’t have the luxury of time anymore. Look at this.” Bosch came around the desk to look at the computer. “Her e-mail account was left open,” Walling said. “I went into the sent-mail file. And this was sent to her husband’s e-mail at 6:21 p.m. last night.” She clicked a button and opened up the e-mail message that had been sent from Alice Kent’s account to her husband’s. The subject line said, “EMERGENCY: READ IMMEDIATELY!” Imbedded in the body of the message was a photograph of Alice Kent naked and hogtied on the bed. The impact of the photo would be obvious to anyone, not just a husband. Below the photograph was a message: “We have you wife. Retrieve for us all cesium sources available to you. Bring to the Mulholland overlook near to your home by eight o’clock. We will watch. If you tell anyone or make call we will know. Your wife will be rape, torture and left in many pieces to count. Use many precaution to handling sources.” Bosch read the message twice and believed he felt the same terror Stanley Kent must have felt. “So they send the message from here,” Brenner said. “The husband gets it at the office or on his P.D.A. — did he have a P.D.A.?” Brenner was venturing into an area where Bosch had no expertise. He hesitated. “A personal digital assistant,” Walling prompted. “You know, like a Palm Pilot or a phone with all the gadgets.” Bosch nodded. “I think so,” Bosch answered. “There was a BlackBerry cellphone recovered. It looks like it has a mini-keyboard.” “That works,” Brenner said. “So what that means is that no matter where he is, he gets this message and can probably view the photo too.” All three of them were quiet while the impact of the e-mail message registered. Finally, Bosch spoke, feeling guilty now about holding back earlier. “I just remembered something. There was an ID tag on the body. From St. Aggie’s up in the Valley.” Brenner registered this, and his eyes took on a sharpness. “You just remembered a key piece of information like that?” he asked angrily. “That’s right. I for — ” “It doesn’t matter now,” Walling interjected. “St. Aggie’s is a women’s cancer clinic. Cesium is used almost exclusively for treating cervical and uterine cancer.” Bosch nodded. “Then we better get going,” he said.

288-> Church Bells and Bike Bells in a Two-Wheel Town
FROM behind the upright handlebars of the hotel’s single-speed loaner bike, I had an enviable choice of vistas as I circled the Tuscan city of Lucca. On my right, the marble-rich Apuan Alps marched through northwest Tuscany, giving way to verdant hills famous for elaborate 18th-century villas and therapeutic volcanic hot springs. To the left, a picture-perfect Italian cityscape unfolded: terra-cotta rooftops zipping by at eye level and white plaster walls artfully cracked to reveal centuries-old stonework. Gravel crunched beneath my smooth tires, and a single-file grove of plane trees provided dappled morning shade on the path ahead. On an early ride around La Mura, the city’s medieval battlements, Lucca opens itself to any biker willing to push a single-speed cruiser up a gentle ramp to the city’s next level. Built as imposing ramparts nearly 500 years ago, the well-preserved walls have become the city’s elevated promenade, distinctive public park and workaday velodrome. With every easy crank of the pedals, any bare-bones rental bike can hold its steady orbit 40 feet above Lucca’s remarkable center — a medieval city built atop layers of Etruscan and Roman settlements, and often overlooked by travelers entranced by nearby Tuscan hill towns to the south. The two-and-a-half-mile ring is equal parts Hadrian’s Wall and Luxembourg Gardens and a perfect place to experience Lucca’s reputation as cyclist’s haven — even for those without form-fitting spandex or strenuous hill training. Lucca’s central location between Florence and the Ligurian beach town of Viareggio makes it a perfect base of operations for exploring the upper reaches of Tuscany while avoiding the nonstop tourist crush common to other cities. The city’s compact layout — constrained by the solid rock perimeter of La Mura — is flat and easily walkable, but all the more accessible when navigated on two wheels. Lucca’s love affair with the bike is a mix of old school practicality and urban convenience. Within the walls, automobile traffic is strictly controlled, so businesspeople commute to work with briefcases jammed into saddlebag panniers. Carpenters strap toolboxes to bike racks with stout bungee cords. Uniformed students slouch under oversize backpacks as they pedal to class. Every third doorway on the narrow street seems to have a newsboy bike standing sentinel: resting on a steel kickstand, cable lock fixing front tire to frame. During the day, charter buses discharge slow-moving package-tour crowds at the city’s various gates, then retreat outside the walls as their charges wander the cobblestone streets. Well-organized clusters of day-trippers follow their guides’ flags as they run the circuit of Lucca’s notable Romanesque churches and formal gardens. Gathering at the vaulted doors of the Cathedral of San Martino for a quick head count, the groups stream inside to see the wooden relic known as Volto Santo, a statue of the crucified Jesus reputed to have been carved by the disciple Nicodemus. Long a destination for pilgrims, the cathedral observes the statue’s annual feast on Sept. 13 with elaborate services and processions through the city streets. At lunch hour, locals and groups trickle to the Piazza San Michele, a welcoming open square surrounded by cafes, banks and the city’s second great church, San Michele in Foro. Formerly the site of the Roman settlement’s forum, the piazza throbs with activity in the early afternoon, as bicycle-bound locals wave to one another in passing or stop for a quick midday chat. Puccini themes run particularly strong in the piazza; with his birthplace a block away on Via Calderia, several cafes and shops invoke the name of Lucca’s operatic native son, hoping to hook a few tourists with the historical connection. As the piazza bustles, the church’s towering facade looms over the action like an elaborate marble wedding cake. Four rows of columns, each carved with a different decorative motif, form San Michele’s classic Romanesque frontispiece. A copper-winged statue of the patron archangel, brandishing a spear and flanked by trumpeting cherubs, caps the multilayered architectural confection. For a city with more than its share of churches, the distinctive bells of Lucca aren’t the plodding basso gongs from skyline steeples, but rather a single crisp note emanating from street level. Any Lucchese in motion knows that the artful ding of a bike bell can clear a path through even the most pedestrian-clogged alleyway. As the tourist crowds dawdle on the busy shopping street of the Via Fillungo, bike bells gently clear paths for older women trekking back from the grocery and dapper young gentlemen arranging evening plans via cellphone. As sunset approaches, it’s worth a trek up to La Mura for at least one more lap around Lucca before dusk. Morning joggers are replaced by after-work walkers and couples out for constitutionals. The golden light washes over the formal gardens of the Palazzo Pfanner, a 17th-century showpiece close to the walls as residents from outside the walls steer their bikes through La Mura’s gates, onto gently curving bike paths toward home. On clear nights, the sun sinks beyond the mountains and into the sea as windows within the city light one by one, revealing quick, almost voyeuristic flashes of Lucchese home life. After dark, the buses collect their charges, and even the most clogged streets revert to an urban biker’s paradise. With few walkers to impede wheeled progress, the single-speed bike once again becomes a human-powered flying machine, rattling a bit over scalloped cobblestones and echoing down the medieval alleyways. And within the walls, Lucca’s natives and overnight guests make for the sidewalk restaurants to the cafes for an evening out that’s never more than a quick bike ride from home.

290-> Alabama: Bus Crash Claims 4th Victim
A fourth teenage girl died and four people remained in critical condition from the crash of a school bus that plunged off an Interstate overpass in Huntsville. The driver, who was found critically injured on the overpass, was one of 15 people who remained hospitalized. Witnesses said a car struck the bus on Monday morning on the I-565 overpass, causing it to plow into and over concrete railing, crashing 30 feet into a street below. The authorities have not released the name of the car’s driver. A police spokesman, Wendell Johnson, said evidence would be presented to a grand jury to decide if criminal charges were warranted. Police Chief Rex Reynolds identified the fourth victim as Crystal R. McCrary, 17. Like the others, she was a student at Lee High School.

293-> Art in Review; Trace
Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street Through Nov. 12 Most of the pieces in "Trace" recall works from the 1970's by artists like Alice Aycock and Siah Armajani, who reacted to 60's-style formalism by creating quasi-architectural, environmental sculptures evoking historical, psychological and mythic associations. The six artists in this mostly intriguing show continue in that vein, with an emphasis on memory. The exhibition was organized by Shamim M. Momin, director of the Whitney's Altria gallery. Karyn Olivier's "Junglegym," an expansive, open, cagelike construction with multiple ladders all neatly made of slender wooden poles, was inspired by early-20th-century steel playground structures, which viewers of a certain age may remember from their own childhoods. It looks more dreamy than the real thing, though; it could be an hommage to Giacometti's great Surrealist sculpture "The Place at Four A.M." For his massive white plaster sculptures, Karlis Rekevic takes casts from parts of old bridges, traffic dividers, signposts and other functional pieces of the urban landscape. He reassembles these parts in configurations that look almost but not quite functional, and he outfits them with rows of glowing light bulbs that enhance their spectral, theatrical qualities. Iván Navarro's "Die Again (Monument for Tony Smith)" is a 12-foot black plywood cube that alludes to Tony Smith's famous cube-shape, Minimalist sculpture, "Die." Enter a doorway, move spirally, and you arrive at a dark inner chamber, where the five neon-lighted points of a white star built into the floor under glass appear to recede infinitely downward because of built-in mirrors. Meanwhile, a sweet, mournful voice sings the Beatles song "Nowhere Man." The references are nonspecific, but this movingly funereal work implicitly comments on misguided leadership, blind patriotism and endless war. Another mysterious wooden sculpture is Michael Queenland's oversize shelving unit, based on plans from a Shaker how-to manual. With its stark, clunky presence, it is vaguely menacing, like a piece of household furniture that a child might encounter in a nightmare. In the context of this show, works by Jedediah Caesar and Shannon Ebner are less persuasive. Mr. Caesar mixes studio dust and detritus with resin, which he casts into large discs whose associations remain uncertain. And Ms. Ebner's complicated and obscure project includes photographs of hands holding up signs bearing cryptic slogans in front of Washington monuments, and a mural-scale photograph of concrete blocks stacked into what is supposed to be a temporary, unofficial memorial wall. To parody official memorial art is a good idea; Ms. Ebner's work just needs sharper focus. KEN JOHNSON

The Art of Joseph Cornell Case Studies Art in a Valise Katonah Museum of Art Route 22 at Jay Street, Katonah, N.Y. Through Sept. 17 Two shows -- one of some 45 collages, chests, cabinets and other objects made by Joseph Cornell from the 1930's to the 60's, the other a group exhibition of works on the theme of suitcases -- fit together nicely in this small but lively museum. Travel is the theme of the Cornell show, which among much else contains a number of images relating to French hotels and more exotic destinations. Although Cornell never left the United States, he translated his dreams of faraway places into delicate, sometimes overly precious works that have a sense of longing. The white-painted, weathered interior of a box titled "Grand Hotel -- Hotel Taglioni" (1954) contains incongruous elements of collage, among them an old ad for a French bakery topped by a color cutout of the ballerina Marie Taglioni, an object of Cornell's adoration, whose Italian home, the Villa Taglioni, still stands on Lake Como. Even simpler, but equally dreamy, is another weathered box, "Hotel de l'Étoile" (1950), which holds only a long, vertical image of a deep blue sky rife with thousands of tiny pinpoints of light. One of the show's most striking images is a surreal photograph of Cornell by Lee Miller in which he is seen gazing upward, entranced, his shoulder adorned with a miniature sailboat (around 1935). The link between Cornell and the suitcase show is furthered by the presence in the group exhibition of Cornell's "Crystal Cage (Portrait of Berenice)" (1943), a carry-case of photographs and documents related to a fictional woman whose life he conjured up. Also here is Marcel Duchamp's "Boîte-en-Valise" ("Box in a Suitcase"), which functions as a small portable museum with miniature reproductions of 69 well-known Duchamp works, for which Cornell produced archival boxes. Other artists include Joseph Beuys, Mona Hatoum, Christian Marclay, Tony Oursler and members of the Fluxus Collective. The range is from Ms. Hatoum's grim "Traffic," whose two old suitcases joined by a flow of dark human hair conjure an image of human trafficking, to Yoan Capote's comic "Nostalgia," a suitcase full of bricks. A surprise of a sort is Mr. Oursler's eerie work, "Anvil," a talking head projected by video on a doll recumbent in a suitcase. Over and over, it repeats the words: "Breathe in, now breathe out. It will never end." GRACE GLUECK

298-> Agency Delayed Reporting Theft of Veterans' Data
WASHINGTON, May 23 — The Veterans Affairs Department learned about the theft of electronic data on 26.5 million veterans shortly after it occurred, on May 3, but waited two weeks before telling law enforcement agencies, officials said Tuesday. The officials said investigators in the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were furious with the leaders of the veterans agency for initially trying to handle the loss of the data as an internal problem through the agency's inspector general before coming forward. Officials said the investigators in the Justice Department and F.B.I. had complained that the delay might have cost them clues to the whereabouts of the data, stored on computer disks that were stolen in a burglary on May 3 at the home of an agency employee in Maryland. A spokesman for the agency, Matt Burns, declined to comment on the timing of the announcement. The disks carried names and accompanying Social Security numbers and dates of birth, practically keys to identity in the computer age. It was not clear, in the absence of an explanation from the agency, why its officials waited for days to disclose the theft to law enforcement people and still more days to announce it to the public or what internal discussions might have prompted them to change their minds. As the department sought to reassure veterans not privy to the bureaucratic machinations here and to deal with a security lapse that was becoming a public relations disaster, some veterans were uneasy and suspicious. "Why did the V.A. wait 19 days to notify veterans?" John Rowan, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America, asked. Perhaps, Mr. Rowan suggested, the department learned that the news was about to be leaked. The wife of a disabled veteran of the gulf war, Penny Larrisey of Doylestown, Pa., expressed what countless crime victims have said. "Just right about now, the only way you can feel is you've been violated," Mrs. Larrisey said in a telephone interview. The department has emphasized that there was as yet no indication that the data, taken home without authorization by the employee, had been put to ill use. But Mrs. Larrisey, whose husband, Bob, was an Air Force sergeant, was not soothed. "This puts us in a position of one paycheck away from disaster," she said, worrying that a computer-savvy thief with access to specifics about her husband's disability payments could tap into their bank account. The authorities continued to investigate the activities of the employee, who is on administrative leave. Officials familiar with the case said that while investigators had no reason to dispute the employee's account, they were nonetheless puzzled why little else of value besides the data-laden disks were stolen. In an added twist, the officials said investigators were having trouble finding the employee but did not think that he was necessarily trying to be evasive. Several aspects remained murky, including how much communication, if any, there was between the Montgomery County police in Maryland and federal investigators about the disks. Mr. Rowan of the Vietnam veterans' group said the Veterans Affairs Department should do more than just post information on its Web site advising veterans to scrutinize their financial records and telling them what to do if they find something wrong. "The V.A. has put veterans at risk for identity theft," he said. "If this were the private sector, they would be required to provide each veteran with free credit-reporting services." A spokesman for Senator Larry E. Craig, the Idaho Republican who is chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, said the panel would consider just such measures when it holds a hearing on the case on Thursday morning. The spokesman, Jeff Schrade, said government agencies should treat personal data as "top secret information." Christopher Walsh, a lawyer here who specializes in security cases, said the theft conveyed a disturbing message, that "the government has paid far less attention to the issue of data security than the people think — and far less than business." Recent federal laws entitle every consumer the right to one free credit report from each major consumer credit-reporting agency — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — every year. But for closer monitoring of credit status, the kind that some consumers turn to when they fear that their records have been compromised, the companies charge a fee. Ten dollars a month after a free 30-day trial is typical. If veterans feel threatened enough to enter such arrangements, "the government ought to pay for it, in my view," Mr. Walsh said. At least two companies offering identity-theft protection, LifeLock and MyPublicInfo, said they had discount packages for veterans affected by the theft. Senator Craig's spokesman, Mr. Schrade, declined to predict what would happen at the hearing on Thursday or how the security breach would be repaired. "But," he said, "I don't think we're going to get out of this on the cheap."

299-> World Briefing | Australia: Doctor Suspended After Boston Rape Is Revealed
A surgeon has been suspended from practicing in Queensland State, after the authorities there discovered that he had been convicted in 1981 of raping a nurse in Massachusetts. The doctor, Eugene Sherry, a New Zealander who was 27 and a resident at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston at the time of the charges, was convicted with two other doctors in a trial that riveted Boston. After six months in prison, Dr. Sherry moved to Australia in 1983, and his conviction went undetected until this week. His case brought comparisons to the case last year of Jayant Patel, an American-trained doctor charged by Queensland authorities with the deaths of several patients. Dr. Sherry's lawyer told the newspaper The Australian that his client had been wrongfully convicted in 1982. RAYMOND BONNER (NYT)

301-> Living in Disharmony
THE barometer measuring happiness inside a New York apartment tower is a tenuous thing, forever threatening to swing from content to disgruntled at the slightest provocation. Case in point: Georgetown Plaza, a generic-looking co-op that rises 34 floors above the corner of Eighth Street and Broadway in Greenwich Village. Although the building is considered by many to be the tallest and least charming structure in the neighborhood, until recently it was a very happy place. There are a laundry room on every floor and a pool on the roof. Doorman-tenant relations were convivial. The co-op board was largely free of bickering. Then, a few weeks ago, a major overhaul of the building's tan brick facade began, a project that involved repairing bricks, mortar and balconies. Basically, what it amounted to was a lot of dust and racket. "It's a smashing, then like a drilling in my head," said Susan Shapiro, a writer who has lived there for a decade. "Picture a dentist's drill that won't go away for seven hours." Everyone agrees the construction is necessary, but what has frustrated many is that it starts at 8 a.m. There has also been talk of doing construction on weekends, too, if necessary. Georgetown Plaza is home to a number of bankers and lawyers who have already left for the office by the time the drilling begins. But the tenants who are retirees and college students, and those who work from home, say their routines have been disrupted. "You have to leave your apartment by 8 o'clock every morning," said Jeremiah Palmeri, a pre-law student at St. John's University in Queens, who was smoking a cigarette outside the building last week. Far above his head, work crews were being hoisted up and down the building's facade like Spider-Man by a series of ropes and pulleys. The low-frequency moan of a drill bit could be heard. "Dude, everyone is complaining," Mr. Palmeri said. Maybe not everyone. Construction is confined to the lower part of the building so that tenants who live on, say, the 30th floor have so far been spared the experience of having a dust-covered apartment and the feeling of "living next to a jackhammer," as Dr. Peter Lowitt, who lives on the fifth floor, put it. The ill will stems from both the co-op board's approval of the early construction time and the fact that a few years ago the board approved a similar repair of the facade, which is now being fixed up. Tenants say those earlier repairs were improperly done. The result has led to a possible coup at the once tranquil building. This Wednesday, shareholders will hold their annual meeting to elect a new board. A team of tenants, led by the board's president, Pritpal Kochhar, known as Pepi, are trying to oust several current members. "I've been here 10 years and I've never seen this kind of fighting and anger," said Ms. Shapiro, who is not seeking a seat on the board but has suggested that other candidates run on a "No construction until 9 a.m." platform. Tom Furth, a board member and an intellectual property lawyer, conceded that the construction affected some tenants more than others. But, he added, "I don't know that there's an easy solution." The more hours in the day crews can work, he pointed out, the sooner construction will be finished. Moreover, he said, "we feel the facade repair will result in a long-term benefit to the building." Dr. Lowitt agreed. He said that the drilling had affected his sleep — and his sanity — but that the sole determinant for scheduling construction should be the hours required to do the work. As for the election, he was equally pragmatic. "Generally, it's a well-run building," he said. "I get someone up here within a half-hour if there's something wrong in my apartment. Most people would give an arm and a leg to live here." But even he is drawing a line in the sand. On Wednesday, he said, "I'm voting for the new guy."

The leftist candidate for president took his anti-government oratory to a new level last night, saying he and his followers were not just seeking a recount in last month's election, but also wanting to transform the country's democratic institutions. The candidate, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, 52, harangued a crowd in front of a courthouse where an electoral tribunal denied his request on Saturday for a full recount, opting instead to order another tally of ballots in about 9 percent of polling places.

307-> Lights, Music, Action: Try to Keep Up, Please
AT dusk on Nov. 25, the lights started to dance to the music at the twin row houses of Robert DeLauro and Frank Cianflone in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn. They blinked and shimmered, their colors fading in and out, as the homes — linked with a Christmas tree made of lights hovering over a common driveway — were outlined first in red lights, then green. Candy canes and a “Happy Holidays” banner of lights blinked in time to Frank Sinatra crooning “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town,” and a nativity scene on the Cianflones’ lawn glowed and then dimmed, alternating with spotlights on Santa’s sleigh and a snowman at the DeLauros’. Passersby could also hear Jiminy Cricket singing “Very Merry Christmas” from an outdoor speaker, or double-park and listen by tuning in with their car radios, drive-in-theater style, to 88.7 FM. Mr. DeLauro, who decorates both his home and that of the Cianflones, his in-laws, next door, is one of a growing number of Christmas enthusiasts who are using computerized displays of synchronized lighting and sound to produce a kind of musical extravaganza, pushing the ever-mounting stakes in the competitive sport of decking the halls. Until 1999, there were fewer than 100 such lighting animation hobbyists, according to Chuck Smith, the founder of planetchristmas.com, a Web site where Christmas display buffs have gathered for the past 10 years. But in 2000, with the advent of early-generation software and hardware that allowed people to create elaborately choreographed Christmas decorations, “the genie was let out of the bottle,” he said. (Mr. Smith, an electrical engineer from Franklin, Tenn., who calls himself a “super-nerd,” claims to have created the first computerized Christmas display, in 1984.) Computerized displays enjoyed a huge increase in visibility last year, when an Ohio man’s painstakingly choreographed light show became an Internet sensation, and was picked up for a Miller Lite commercial. In just the last year, Mr. Smith said, the Planet Christmas community has more than doubled, from 1,700 members to 4,000. Until three years ago, Mr. DeLauro’s lights merely twinkled in a static display of Christmas cheer. At the urging of his two teenage daughters, he searched the Internet for technology that would allow him to pipe in music to accompany the display. He found Light-O-Rama software and a microprocessor-based Light-O-Rama controller box with 16 programmable channels, which he wired to a computer in his basement. Then he connected his 10,000 lights to the controller using 32 extension cords. “I spend all summer planning it out on my computer,” said Mr. DeLauro, 46, a funeral supply business manager who holds a Christmas-in-August barbecue every year to test his lights. He listens to Christmas songs all year long, programming the lights to flicker to the beats. He found an empty frequency that lets him broadcast the show over the radio for about 25 feet on each side of his house using a small FM transmitter. Mr. DeLauro posted his home on Planet Christmas, where the chat boards buzz 365 days a year about the latest decorating trends, from larger-than-life inflatables to light-emitting diodes, or L.E.D.s, that don’t have filaments that burn out and that consume very little electricity. There is much discussion, too, of the fact that attention-grabbing computerized displays — usually thought of as power-hogging — actually save energy. “Your consumption goes down by 90 percent or more, mainly because the lights aren’t all on at the same time,” said Mr. Smith, who has closely monitored his holiday electricity use for 20 years. Even so, the number of lights on at any one time can be staggering. Marty Slack, 43, a firefighter and musician in Murray, Utah, near Salt Lake City, decorates his 1,800-square-foot town house and adjoining 1¼-acre property with some 100,000 lights in more than 400 separately controlled groups. “Bruno” and “Winston,” two talking heads constructed out of lights, emcee his show, telling jokes in the recorded voices of two of Mr. Slack’s friends and singing along with seven animated six-foot-tall musicians playing French horns, drums and a saxophone, all mounted on the front of the house. Mr. Slack’s 15-minute show, which won an international lights competition run by Planet Christmas last year, has been ramped up this year to include 28 wire-frame reindeer, whose lights can be manipulated to create the impression of one or more animals running across a one-acre pasture, jumping a fence and running off into the bushes. There are also more than 50 miniature trees that appear to be chasing each other, all set against a large lighted cityscape backdrop. Videos of Santa waving are screened in an upstairs window. Mr. Slack takes a two-month vacation before the holidays — nearly all his yearly vacation time — to get his light show running. Every minute of music takes more than 20 hours to synchronize, he said, and building the over-the-top display costs him about $5,000 in new equipment each year. But “people have usually been out fighting the crowds and feeling the pressure to buy gifts and attend Christmas events,” he said, and “as they approach my show they seem to forget about all the pressures. Smiles and laughter seem to take the place of worries.” They may, however, have to sit in 45-minute traffic jams that inevitably back up through the neighborhood to see the show. Dan Baldwin, a software executive who started his career as a computer programmer and electrical engineer, saw opportunity in all the attention that his own computerized light display attracted. In 1999, he designed and built the first one at his home in Garfield, N.J., with trees on the roof, candy-cane shutters and a nativity scene. Visitors raved, and what started as a hobby soon became a full-time business, when Mr. Baldwin started Light-O-Rama in 2002. Since then, he said, his business has grown 300 percent a year. “Many thousands” of residential do-it-yourselfers get started for $200, he said, and work up to systems costing $10,000 or more, often installed by professional Christmas decorators. “It used to be that if there was any animation, it would be a Santa waving or a deer’s leg moving, where it looked like he was running, but all those things were uncoordinated,” said Mr. Baldwin, 52. Even store-bought decorations have become more animated, he said, but with a computerized system, people can coordinate the animation and produce a show. Which is what the Nintendo generation, in particular, craves, said Paul Smith, president of Animated Lighting, a four-year-old Missouri company that manufactures animation software and plug-and-play starter kits, serving some 3,000 homeowners as well as commercial users and municipalities. “People want a show,” he said. “We sell ‘wow.’ ” Ken Good, 45, a lawyer in Tyler, Tex., switched from a static to a computerized display last year. He said he uses 300 extension cords to run more than 30,000 synchronized lights in his Christmas display, which includes a 12-foot inflatable snowman on the roof and a multimedia show with a voiceover. As the lights dim, a machine fills his yard with fog and a moving spotlight appears. A drum roll sounds, and red lights flash in one tree, then another, then a third, in an accelerating but seemingly random sequence, to the strains of “Reflections of Earth,” a k a the fireworks theme from Epcot. At the crescendo, white strobes shine on a different tree, creating a sparkling effect, and the original trees resume their dance in blue, green and red. Finally the entire yard is illuminated in green. “It’s dramatic,” he said. The music portion of Mr. Good’s 25- to 30-minute show, which repeats for several hours each night, can be heard on car radios in his cul-de-sac. It includes “Believe” from “The Polar Express” and “Silent Night” and ends with “Amazing Grace.” Predictably, computerized light shows are becoming part of the annual display competitions sent up in the recent movie “Deck the Halls,” but they also lend themselves to cooperation among neighbors. Year after year, Rob LaRe of Pickerington, Ohio, tried to outdo his neighbor Rick Griffith with his Christmas lights. Then, three years ago, Mr. LaRe decided that instead of adding more lights, he would make them dance. “He fired his up and I fired mine up, and he said, ‘I’ve got more,’ ” recalled Mr. LaRe, 38, whose home is triple-strung with 40,000 lights. “I said, ‘Yes, but watch this.’ ” Mr. Griffith was duly impressed. Instead of competing, the neighbors ended up synchronizing their homes to the same blinking beats using wireless technology. Soon other neighbors were hankering to get in on the act. This year, Mr. LaRe, a graphic and Web designer, connected 13 houses in the neighborhood, hardwiring connections between the houses along each side of the street and using wireless technology to link the houses facing each other. (The display includes one Jewish couple’s house with an inflatable menorah and blue-and-white lights.) An FM transmitter broadcasts “Picktown Lights,” a loop of 13 Christmas songs, on a frequency advertised by signs on the lawns, with lights on all the houses blinking and pulsing in accompaniment. As passersby cruise down the street oohing and aahing, Mr. LaRe, dressed in a Santa costume, and his neighbors, dressed as elves, hand out candy canes and collect items for a local food pantry. When people ask how the lights were synchronized, Mr. LaRe sticks to a simple explanation. “It’s Christmas magic,” he says.

312-> Eat Smaller Fish? (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Paul Greenberg’s suggestions in “Other Fish to Fry” (Op-Ed, Sept. 8) are laudable, and if indeed people were to switch to eating smaller fishes, some of the larger ones might be spared. But it would not apply to tuna, as long as the Japanese market gobbles up the large ones for expensive sashimi. The Japanese make the market for the large tuna, whether caught in the Mediterranean, South Australia or New England. In 2001, a 440-pound bluefin tuna was sold for $173,600 at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo. We can eat all the sardines and tilapia we like, but the numbers of bluefin tuna will continue to decline as long as the Japanese are willing to pay these outrageous prices for a single fish and then offer a slice of the red belly-meat for $75 in a restaurant.

316-> World Briefing | Asia: Thailand: Assets Inquiry For Deposed Leader
The military rulers appointed an anticorruption commission in what appeared to be a move toward investigating and perhaps seizing the assets of Thaksin Shinawatra, the prime minister stripped of his job by a coup on Tuesday. They also continued their search for an interim prime minister and received the official blessing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej in a ceremony broadcast on national television, where a statement was read on behalf of the king. His backing for the coup appears to be a main reason why former Thaksin supporters, even in rural areas considered the bastion of his support, now express support of the military takeover.

319-> Dead Bronx Man Had Been Cleaning Fishing Tackle
An 85-year old man who was found dead in his apartment on Sunday with severe chemical burns had been cleaning fishing tackle with a rust remover shortly before he died, his daughter said yesterday. A spokeswoman for the city medical examiner said the cause of death had not yet been determined. The man, Joseph Walker, had not gone fishing since 1994, the year his wife died, said his daughter, June Walker. "I don't know if he was reminiscing about the old days," she said. Ms. Walker said she found a household chemical used to remove rust stains in the living room of his apartment at 3080 Park Avenue in Melrose. She found her father, who she said was a former Tuskegee airman, in a hallway with a fishing rod in his hand.

320-> Sisyphus, Making It Work on the Streets of New York
Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi), the Pakistani immigrant who is the protagonist of Ramin Bahrani’s “Man Push Cart,” goes through a Sisyphean daily grind. In the wee small hours of each morning, he commutes by subway from his shabby one-room apartment in Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan, where he sells coffee, doughnuts and bagels on the street. Lugging his portable propane tank, he stocks his stainless-steel cart, then pushes it through traffic to his station on a corner of Avenue of the Americas. Much of the movie takes place before sunrise during the winter months, and images of the illuminated spire of the Chrysler Building spearing the night sky and of tree branches crusted with tiny white lights evoke the city’s crushing indifference. In the scenes filmed in daylight, it is often raining. It makes Mr. Bahrani’s small, bleak film no less gripping to know that it was, in fact, partly inspired by “The Myth of Sisyphus,” Albert Camus’s treatise on the absurdity of existence. The movie sparingly dishes out the details of Ahmad’s life, leaving many questions unanswered. We learn that his wife died a year earlier (there is a brief, awkward flashback to happier days) but not how she died. Because Ahmad can’t afford a large enough place, his 6-year-old son (Hassan Razvi) is living with his in-laws. Ahmad’s angry mother-in-law (Razia Mujahid) blames him for her daughter’s death and tries to keep his son from him. We also learn that Ahmad was a Pakistani rock star who had a hit record in 1995. Exactly when and how he came to the United States is never specified. He now sells bootleg pornographic DVD’s as a sideline, for $8 apiece or two for $15. (The movie quickly lures you into its desperate nickel-and-dime mind-set.) Ahmad’s stoic, lonely existence is brightened by three events. He forms a friendship with Noemi (Leticia Dolera), a pretty young Spanish woman from Barcelona who temporarily runs her uncle’s newsstand, and the relationship develops a romantic undertow. He is also taken up by Mohammad (Charles Daniel Sandoval), a successful Pakistani businessman who recognizes “the Bono of Lahore,” as he hyperbolically calls Ahmad, and offers to help restart his musical career. Mohammad, who can be brusquely condescending, gives Ahmad work painting and fixing up his new apartment and gets him a short-lived evening job taking tickets at a nightclub. He even lends him $500 to complete the $5,000 first installment on his cart, which will ultimately cost him $15,000. And finally, Ahmad finds a stray kitten and impulsively brings it home. But as tenderly as he feels toward his pet, which becomes a surrogate for his son, he has little idea of how to care for it. He gives it milk instead of water and doesn’t have it use a litter box. Filmed in less than three weeks, “Man Push Cart” is an exemplary work of independent filmmaking carried out on a shoestring. Mr. Razvi’s convincing performance is a muted portrait of desolation bordering on despair; only once does Ahmad lose his composure and lash out. If this bare-bones production leaves some seams showing, the sparseness mostly complements the film’s vision of a confined existence eked out in the shadows of skyscrapers. Refusing to give Ahmad’s struggle a rainbow’s end, the movie is true to the myth. It allows a single, devastating blow, reminiscent of the end of De Sica’s “Bicycle Thief,” to dash Ahmad’s expectations of salvation, leaving him no other choice but to keep rolling that rock uphill. Written, directed and edited by Ramin Bahrani; director of photography, Michael Simmonds; music by Peyman Yazdanian; art director, Charles Dafler; produced by Mr. Bahrani, Pradip Ghosh and Bedford T. Bentley III; released by Films Philos. At the Angelika Film Center, Mercer and Houston Streets, Greenwich Village. Running time: 87 minutes. This film is not rated.

322-> An Animal's Life
To the Editor: Elizabeth Marshall Thomas misses the point in her review of "Kicked, Bitten, and Scratched," by Amy Sutherland (June 4), when she states that: "Despite the beliefs of animal rights activists, many captive animals welcome their training. . . . Training gives them a life." Wild animals have a life -- it is in the wild. Keeping them in captivity, trained or otherwise, for human entertainment deprives them of that life. If species conservation is important (which it is), it should be done on huge reserves that simulate the natural environment, which means keeping animals away from people. It is hard to imagine that Thomas really believes that the trained animals she describes benefit in any way from their puppetlike existence, or that they are much better off than wild animals kept in zoos.

323-> Road Trip With Family, Latin Version
Don’t fret if you find it frustrating to unscramble the blood ties or follow the fragmented domestic dramas that jostle one another in Pablo Trapero’s big-hearted ensemble comedy, “Rolling Family.” Watching this movie, in which four generations of a clan from Buenos Aires cram into a mobile home and drive to the other side of Argentina, is like finding yourself stuck at a family reunion in the middle of nowhere. Without becoming intimate with any one person, you come to know them collectively. Fun probably isn’t the exact word to describe the journey, organized by Emilia (Graciana Chironi), an 84-year-old grandmother invited to be the matron of honor at her niece’s wedding in Misiones, her hometown near the Brazilian border. As the travelers face automotive crises, marital strife and internecine sexual rivalries, the trip is more of an endurance test than a holiday. But if your idea of fun is a just-folks realism reminiscent of the HBO series “Family Bonds,” only far more pungent, you will find much to treasure in “Rolling Family.” In surveying a large swath of the Argentine landscape, the film could be a companion piece to “The Motorcycle Diaries,” in which the young Che Guevara and his best friend, also starting out from Buenos Aires, traverse South America. “Rolling Family” paints a portrait of Argentina outside Buenos Aires as a rugged, hard-bitten rural culture — Texas without millionaires — in which men travel in packs on horseback, and the residents of scattered farming villages live hand to mouth. The film never says what the grown-ups do for a living or feel about politics, culture and religion. As the camera draws in close and studies their faces, “Rolling Family” voices an unspoken philosophy. Those things are extraneous to the meat and potatoes of life, it suggests. This is how most people live, getting along as best they can within the confines of the only institution that really matters.

324-> Twirling the Kaleidoscope of Women’s Roles in Japanese Culture
Even casual observers of Japanese culture are probably aware of its identification of femininity with cuteness, shyness and deference. These stereotypes get a somewhat unconvincing workout in “Candies: girlish hardcore,” a piece by Shirotama Hitsujiya and the performance art troupe Yubiwa Hotel, which made its first appearance in the United States on Thursday night at Japan Society. Using animal masks and an oft-changing array of girlie attire (white nightgownlike shifts, black strapless dresses, Laura Ashley-like patchwork skirts, tulle tutus over white leggings), the five performers of Yubiwa Hotel offer disconnected images and narratives of female life. A woman drops dead on the way to a wedding; her daughter argues with the bride-to-be about going on with the ceremony. Two women feed each other with increasing aggression. The group plays with a ball. Performers occasionally bark or make bird noises. At the end the women do a combination aerobic routine and Broadway shuffle while stripping to their underwear. All the while a female voice offers opaque ruminations (with English translations projected onto the backdrop): “Why don’t they come back?” “If she had died, I wish she had told me.” There’s not much dance in “Candies: girlish hardcore,” though there is a considerable amount of choreographed movement: walking, running, jumping, rolling. Much of this centers on large, bouncy spheres covered in black fabric decorated with sketches that suggest animal and insect shapes. The women sit on, roll over, throw and disassemble these spheres (pulling out wooden branches), the significance of which remains mysterious. Much remains mysterious in this piece, which feels like less than the sum of its parts. Ms. Hitsujiya might have wanted to expose the underbelly of conventional femininity in Japanese culture, but her images and text never cohere in a way that convincingly reveals her subject.

326-> DINING/SOUTH NORWALK; Newcomer Accommodates The Eye and Palate
AS a newcomer to South Norwalk's "restaurant row," Strada 18, a bistrolike cafe that bills itself "apizza e vino," has settled right in. So much so that early in September, when the residual winds and rain from Hurricane Ernesto swept through the area and knocked out the electricity, Strada 18 was one of many restaurants forced to serve by candlelight (though cooking was done on gas stoves). The waiters never missed a beat, serving with élan and good humor in cramped quarters in the dark. For diners it was a romantic adventure. My three guests and I had a great time. Not only that, we had good food as well, beginning with a medium-thick, garlicky gazpacho, a crisp-leafed, tangy Caesar salad and steamed mussels in a delicate white wine-garlic broth. A group of eight cheeses was also offered before the main course. The choices change nightly, with French, Italian and Spanish usually among them. The star, we decided, was Langa Rochetta, a creamy Italian cheese made from cow, goat and sheep's milk, with a pronounced edge. As for entrees, the most satisfying was lamb shank, simmered to extreme tenderness and served with white beans. Macaroni and cheese, high on my comfort food list, was attractively presented in a huge terra cotta bowl, but the pasta was too dry. At lunch several weeks later, two of us sat near the front of this converted storefront, and, with the power back on, I could see my surroundings. The lime green and scraped brick walls, wood floor and handsome exposed wood-beam ceiling were a pleasure to the eye. This time, though, service was slow. My friend had pizza, with a thin crust but stingy Gorgonzola-and-caramelized-onion topping. (Other toppings at a later time, like the double-smoked bacon and wild mushrooms, were more generous.) My salade Niçoise -- a lovely combination of ingredients mixed with house-cured tuna and a shallot-caper vinaigrette -- was followed by a delicious warm strawberry-rhubarb crumble, with a scoop of vanilla gelato. A recent dinner highlighted Strada 18's many strengths and a few weaknesses. Baked sea scallops, a starter, were innocuous, their garlic butter and Parmesan crumb topping too minimal. A better choice was housemade mozzarella (ambrosial) with roasted red peppers and tomatoes in pungent Italian extra-virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Baked orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage was a bowlful of well-seasoned, peppery deliciousness. Roasted chicken diavolo was a crunchy-skin breast and leg, beautifully cooked to moist tenderness, but there wasn't a semblance of diavolo treatment and hardly any flourishes. The scattering of diced raw tomatoes around the edges of the plate didn't do much; a helping of mashed potatoes would have been welcome. Desserts are generally first rate, especially the flourless chocolate cake, apple tart, strawberry-rhubarb crumble and remarkable black pepper biscotti. David Raymer, the executive chef and co-owner, who seemed to spend as much time chatting with guests as in the kitchen, also makes terrific gelatos and sorbets. The white peach sorbet is nothing short of exquisite. Even an experimental Guinness gelato was a delight. Strada 18 already seems to have a crowd of regulars, who are probably attracted to its informality and flexible menu. A diner may enjoy a three-course meal while his companion selects only a piping hot sheep's milk ricotta-Black Forest ham-stuffed calzone -- and both are satisfied. Anyone addicted to good cheeses and ice creams should visit for those two items alone. Oh yes, and the wonderful housemade biscotti. Strada 18 18 Washington Street South Norwalk (203) 853-4546 www.strada18.com GOOD THE SPACE -- Long, narrow storefront, well lighted and simply decorated, with brick pizza oven on the left. Wheelchair access possible, but tricky. THE CROWD -- Young and old, many couples and foursomes, casually dressed. Friendly, well-trained, youthful staff.

THE BAR -- Full bar, with well-chosen, medium wine list, with emphasis on French, Italian and California wines; bottles, $24 to $150, large by-the-glass selection, $8 to $15. Impressive micro-beer list, $4 to $25, with many Belgian ales. THE BILL -- Entrees, $7 to $25. WHAT WE LIKE Mussels, Caesar salad, gazpacho, housemade mozzarella, lamb shank, orecchiette with sausage, roasted chicken diavolo, calzones, most pizzas, apple tart, strawberry-rhubarb crumble, flourless chocolate cake, biscotti, gelatos, sorbets. IF YOU GO -- Noon to 9:30 p.m., weekdays and Sundays; until 11 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Limited street parking, a pay lot on the same street and a public lot a block away.

327-> Link Is Cited Between Smell and Sexuality
Lesbians react to the smell of certain bodily odors in ways similar to heterosexual men and different from heterosexual women, new research suggests. Building on their previous studies that showed significant differences in the ways heterosexual and homosexual men's brains process odors, the researchers may be narrowing the search for the elusive human pheromone. The existence of pheromones, the sex-specific chemicals that send messages by smell to other members of the species, is well known in animals, but their existence among humans is in dispute. The authors do not claim that they have discovered human pheromones or even that odors are a major factor in human sexual choices. But they have found suggestive differences in physiological responses to odor. The study appeared online on May 8 in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The substances involved are a progesterone derivative produced in male sweat and an estrogenlike steroid that has been detected in female urine. The two smells are processed in the brain differently from ordinary odors. In the experiment, 12 lesbians smelled the two substances while researchers observed blood flow in their brains with PET scans. The scents activated parts of the brain that ordinarily process odors, but the estrogenlike compound also activated a part of the hypothalamus, as it does in heterosexual men. Animal studies suggest that the hypothalamus is important in sexual behavior. So when that part of the brain lights up under the stimulus of an odor, a sexual response, rather than simply an olfactory one, is implied. In previous research, Dr. Ivanka Savic and her colleagues established that brain responses to these odors were reciprocal in heterosexual men and women. Heterosexual women responded to the male sweat odor in the hypothalamus rather than in the olfactory portions of the brain, and heterosexual men responded to female estrogen in the hypothalamus. Homosexual men processed the smells in the same way as heterosexual women. Despite the similarities, lesbians do not respond to these two odors in exactly the same way as heterosexual men, so the analogy with gay men and heterosexual women is imperfect. "This observation could favor the view that male and female homosexuality are different," said Dr. Savic, an associate professor of neurology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. The scents are not aphrodisiacs. No subjects reported sexual arousal during the experiment. The researchers also emphasize that their findings have no clinical application. "It is very important to make clear that the study has no implications for possible dynamics in sexual orientation," Dr. Savic said.

328-> ART REVIEW; Works of a Major Player In Macho Sculpture
A self-guided tour group pauses in a tram, gawking; people walk casually by, heads turned on their way to somewhere else; and a docent picks up stray pieces of rubbish that may detract from the site that seems to be stealing everyone's attention: Mark di Suvero's building-size, painted stainless-steel sculptures on the landscaped lawns and in the fields of the Storm King Art Center. Piece by piece, starting in 1976, 16 of them have been installed here to constitute a kind of partial, semipermanent retrospective of Mr. di Suvero's 40-year career. Situated in Mountainville, in New York's Hudson Valley, Storm King is a breathtaking setting for the display of outdoor sculpture. Its 500-acre property encompasses woods, a stream, several ponds, alfalfa fields, lawns and rolling hills. No outdoor sculpture park in the world that I know has such an attractive natural setting. The highlight of the center is a superb permanent collection of postwar American and European sculpture, with pieces rotating in and out of display. But at any one time you will find on view here sculptures by artists like Magdalena Abakanowicz, Alice Aycock, Nam June Paik, Ursula von Rydingsvard, Andy Goldsworthy, Chakaia Booker and Roy Lichtenstein. The core of the collection is abstract welded steel works from the 1960's to the present. Steel work by Richard Serra is here, along with pieces by Alexander Liberman, Alexander Calder, Robert Grosvenor, Richard Stankiewicz, Herbert Ferber and Louise Nevelson. There is also a group of a dozen sculptures by David Smith, who pioneered the heavy steel-driving tradition of macho sculpture and assemblage that provide an important historical context for more recent work. Storm King is a sculpture park and a museum; in the main entry building are exhibitions of smaller sculptures, prints and drawings related to the outdoor sculptures on view. This year archival photographs of Mr. di Suvero's sculptures, besides smaller indoor sculptures by him, are on display. The exhibition is an altered version of a show put on a year ago -- about half the photographs and some of the sculptures have been changed. For frequent visitors to the center, this will probably come as a disappointment. But for first-timers, the display offers a helpful, impressive introduction to Mr. di Suvero's work. Of particular interest are the photographs of Mr. di Suvero's sculptures installed in cities throughout the world, many of them taken by Richard Bellamy, his friend and longtime dealer. Paris, Nice, Stuttgart, Canberra, Venice, St. Louis, Kansas City and Chicago are just some of the locations. There is also a pleasantly distracting video of the 73-year-old artist installing his sculptures in three different places: Storm King (1985), Venice (1995) and Paris (1997). Although most of the indoor sculpture was here a year ago, Storm King's director and exhibition curator, David R. Collens, has added "Departure 2001" (1964), a small but significant early piece, and "Page 2" (1981-82), a lovely unpainted spinning steel sculpture on a wooden base that Mr. di Suvero created in France. But the real action is out in the fields, where Mr. di Suvero's sculptures can gleam in the sunlight. Large arrangements that resemble oversize origami, they are made of structural steel building elements -- mostly T-beams and I-beams -- either painted or left raw to weather. Some contain moving parts, like swings or seats. Not many contemporary artists have approached making steel sculpture as resolutely as Mr. di Suvero has. His challenges to Minimalism, the reigning movement of his era, and probably the last great modern movement, have less to do with his materials than the way he uses them. There is none of the formal fundamentalist rigor of Carl Andre, Dan Flavin or even Donald Judd, Minimalism's founding fathers. Instead, we encounter a sense of whimsy and play. On a grassy hillside against a summer sky is one of Mr. di Suvero's largest works, "Jambalaya" (2002-2006), a 60-foot-high orange sculpture on public view for the first time. Although created specifically for this exhibition, it is very different from Mr. di Suvero's other works here. A central tripod anchors several steel I-beams leaning vertically, creating the impression of a ladder to the sky. "Jambalaya" is fascinating to walk around. Its essence seems to change with every angle -- from one view, it looks like a slingshot, from another a bird. Mr. di Suvero never gives you the impression of an artist oppressed by the weight of his material. His beautiful and strong creations defy expectations of what might reasonably be done with steel. "Jambalaya" replaces "Joie de Vivre" (1997), a 70-foot-tall, flaming-orange-red sculpture that was removed from the fields at Storm King last month and installed at its new home in Zuccotti Park (formerly Liberty Park), a three-quarter-acre park that borders Liberty and Cedar Streets in Lower Manhattan, half a block from the World Trade Center site. (Across the street is Isamu Noguchi's famous red cube). "Joie de Vivre" looks terrific there, the soaring structure nicely echoing the skyscrapers around it. The other new outdoor sculpture at Storm King is "Beyond" (2004), Mr. di Suvero's dramatic 26-foot-high unpainted open steel assemblage installed among a group of six of his unpainted sculptures, including "Mozart's Birthday" (1989), which it resembles. Moving Mr. di Suvero's sculptures around is not an easy thing, requiring two cranes and flatbed trucks. "Beyond" and "Jambalaya" were installed in May, one of the wettest months in years. The cranes did some damage to the fields, which are only now beginning to show signs of recovery. But beyond this, the grounds are in magnificent shape, ready for visitors during the sunny months ahead. "Richard Bellamy and Mark di Suvero" is at the Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, through Nov. 15. Information: (845) 534-3115 or www.stormking.org.

329-> 2 Charged in Scheme Said to Defraud Internet Phone Providers
Federal authorities yesterday arrested a Miami man who they said made more than $1 million in a hacking scheme involving the resale of Internet telephone service. The suspect is accused of surreptitiously routing calls through the lines of legitimate Internet phone companies, saddling them with the expense of carrying the traffic while he pocketed the connection fees from customers. A second man was arrested in Washington State, and charged with aiding in the scheme. The case, representing an elaborate new form of Internet hacking, raises fresh questions about the security of phone traffic over largely unregulated networks. Prosecutors say that starting in November 2004, Edwin Andres Pena, 23, a Venezuelan who has permanent residency in the United States and lives in Miami, used two companies he started to offer wholesale phone connections at discounted rates. Such companies typically help connect long-distance calls by buying minutes from large carriers and reselling them for a profit to smaller phone companies. But instead of buying access to other networks to connect his clients' calls, Mr. Pena is said to have conspired with Robert Moore, a 22-year-old hacker in Spokane, Wash., to create "what amounted to 'free' routes by surreptitiously hacking into the computer networks" of unwitting Internet phone providers, and then routing his customers' calls over those providers' systems, the federal complaint says. To evade detection, Mr. Pena is said to have first funneled the calls through hacked network ports at other companies, including one run by an unsuspecting investment company in Rye Brook, N.Y., after Mr. Moore found that a network router there was unprotected. These steps made it appear as if this company were originating the calls. In a three-week period, for instance, prosecutors say one victimized Internet phone provider, based in Newark, handled about 500,000 calls made to look as if they came from the company in Rye Brook. In all, more than 15 Internet phone companies, including the one in Newark, were left having to pay as much as $300,000 each in connection fees for routing the phone traffic to other carriers without receiving any revenue for the calls, prosecutors said. "Emerging technologies and the Internet represent a sea of opportunity for business but also for sophisticated criminals," Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in New Jersey, whose office is prosecuting the case, said in a statement. "The challenge, which we and the F.B.I. continue to meet with investigations and prosecutions like this one, is to stay ahead of the cyber-criminal and protect legitimate commerce." Mr. Pena was charged with one count of wire fraud, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, and one count of computer fraud, with a maximum term of 5 years; each count could also result in a $250,000 fine. Mr. Pena appeared in court in Miami yesterday, and was jailed overnight pending a bail hearing today. Mr. Moore, who is said to have received about $20,000 from Mr. Pena for his work, was charged with conspiracy, punishable by a five-year jail term and a $250,000 fine. He appeared in court in Spokane and was released on bail. The companies in Newark and Rye Brook and others said to have been victims were identified only by their initials in the complaint, which was filed in United States District Court in Newark. One affected company in Newark was named N.T.P. in the complaint. One prominent Internet phone company in Newark is Net2Phone. That company and its parent, IDT, did not return calls for comment. The Rye Brook company, identified in the complaint as a hedge fund, was referred to by the initials O.H. To date, most of the concern about the safety of Internet-based communications has focused on the ability of criminals to eavesdrop on calls, to generate fake caller ID's and to steal long-distance phone service. In this case, however, Mr. Pena is said to have mimicked legitimate telecommunications brokers who often buy "minutes" worth of capacity on large networks at, say, half a cent a minute and resell it to smaller Internet phone providers at 1 cent a minute, keeping the difference. But instead of buying those minutes, he is accused of manipulating voice-over-Internet services that break conversations into data packets and route them over the Internet. Each packet carries a prefix that identifies the carrier handling the call, and its origin and destination. Mr. Pena is said to have appended stolen prefixes to his customers' calls, allowing them to piggyback on other phone company networks. At its core, industry experts say, such a scheme is technologically straightforward for a hacker with knowledge of how Internet phone companies work, particularly new service providers that are sprouting up and spend relatively little securing their servers and routers. "The technical side of this a 14-year-old can do," said Tom Kershaw, the vice president for voice-over-Internet-protocol services at VeriSign, an Internet security company. "There are many vulnerabilities." The scheme attributed to Mr. Pena appears to have begun not long after his arrival in the United States. A family friend, Juan Fortes, a 70-year-old Cuban-American, said Mr. Pena landed in Miami a couple of years ago and rented a room in his single-story red brick house in a quiet neighborhood in southwest Miami. "His mom contacted me some time ago, and she said he didn't have work or a place to stay, so I helped him out; he was a good young man," Mr. Fortes said. Because Mr. Pena was not a legal resident, he persuaded Mr. Fortes to start a company in September 2004 called Fortes Telecom Inc., Mr. Fortes said. Mr. Fortes, who claims to have only a passing knowledge of computers, said he and Mr. Pena bought PC's together. A few months later, Mr. Fortes said, Mr. Pena married, obtained a permanent resident's visa and moved out. Fortes Telecom was dissolved, and last September, Mr. Pena started a new company, Miami Tech and Consulting Inc., prosecutors said. Mr. Fortes said that he had not spoken to Mr. Pena in a long time, and that he had been questioned by the police, who took his computer and bank information. Federal investigators said the roots of the scheme lay in Mr. Pena's ability to obtain the prefixes used by Internet phone companies to identify their voice calls. He did so, they said, by repeatedly slamming Internet phone networks with test calls, each using a prefix variant — a method known in hacking circles as a "brute-force" attack. The attack would continue until a prefix match allowed a call to penetrate the network. According to the complaint, Mr. Pena turned to Mr. Moore, whose Web site, moorer-software.com, was still visible yesterday displaying links to various hacking sites and downloadable software like the Global Brute Forcer, to create cover for the scheme. Mr. Moore is accused of performing "an exhaustive scan of computer networks of unsuspecting companies and other entities in the United States and around the world, searching for vulnerable ports." The complaint notes that AT&T recorded some six million scans of its worldwide network attributable to Mr. Moore from June to October of last year. During that period, only two users made more scans of AT&T's network, the complaint said. Once vulnerable ports were found, prosecutors said, Mr. Moore delivered the network addresses — along with hacked administration names and passwords — to Mr. Pena, who used them to reprogram the routers to allow Internet call traffic to flow through them and obscure the real origin of the calls. In other cases, the pair would bounce traffic off Internet servers rented under false names, including the aliases "David Hauster" and "Jake Hamilton." The ease with which Mr. Pena and Mr. Moore are said to have constructed the scheme is an indication that though Internet-based communications have ushered in more flexible and far cheaper phone services, they have also made it easier for hackers to manipulate the system. "In terms of consumer Internet phone services, it's really the Wild West out there," said Andy Zmolek, a manager in the security planning and strategy group at Avaya, a telephone equipment maker. "This is just the tip of the iceberg." Prosecutors said Mr. Pena appeared to have used the more than $1 million he received from his customers to go on a spending spree, buying real estate in South Florida, a 40-foot Sea Ray Mercruiser motor boat, and luxury cars, including a Cadillac Escalade and a BMW, which authorities confiscated yesterday. He did not appear to be shy about showing off his new possessions, frequently posting pictures of his cars on Web sites devoted to car enthusiasts — including unitedbimmer.com, a BMW fan forum where Mr. Pena displayed his 2004 M3. Tommy Hoyer, a moderator at the site, said Mr. Pena was a generous contributor to the forum's upkeep and activities, including last year's Christmas toy drive, in which he was the single largest contributor. "He posted pictures and videos of his car, and obviously people were impressed," Mr. Hoyer said. "Many people kept asking, What does he do? What does he do?" Mr. Hoyer said Mr. Pena, when asked, would say only that he worked at home.

330-> TV Is Now Interactive, Minus Images, on the Web
Many "Rescue Me" viewers weren't happy, and they weren't being quiet about it. The June 20 episode of the series, on FX, concluded with a violent sex scene between the main character, played by Denis Leary, and his estranged wife. Bloggers and other online fans protested, saying that the scene depicted — and appeared to endorse — rape. So the executive producer of "Rescue Me," Peter Tolan, who had written the episode with Mr. Leary, resorted to an increasingly popular site for television writers who want to defend their editorial choices. Mr. Tolan went to the Internet. In a June 21 posting on the discussion boards of the Web site Televisionwithoutpity.com Mr. Tolan tried to appease "Rescue Me" fans. "Welcome to writing a television drama," he wrote at the end of his lengthy first message. "We're trying to do something different," he explained. "Sometimes we succeed, sometimes we don't." His readers might have retorted, "Welcome to the Internet." Mr. Tolan is not the first television writer to defend his choices online, nor even the first to communicate via Television Without Pity. But his attempt to reach out to his show's viewers reflects a growing awareness among television writers of their shows' online communities, as well as of a variety of ways to engage them. Mr. Tolan did not respond to requests for an interview. But according to John Solberg, a spokesman for FX, Mr. Tolan now regrets trying to explain himself on Television Without Pity. Rather than defusing the controversy over the episode, his response "stirred it up more," Mr. Solberg said. "If he had to do it again," Mr. Solberg continued, "he wouldn't do it." Tara Ariano, a co-founder and co-editor of Television Without Pity, said she was surprised by the amount of attention Mr. Tolan's response had received. But she also sounded bemused by writers like him who debate their online critics without apparently anticipating any negative response. "Any way that you interact with your fans online is potentially reckless," she said. "When you write a script like that, you've got to expect some controversy." That type of controversy might have been easier for writers and producers like Mr. Tolan to ignore in the past. Internet fans — and occasional writer interaction with them — have existed since the birth of the Internet, although until recently they were mostly confined to science-fiction or cult series, like "Star Trek" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." But in the age of widespread broadband access, iTunes video and video sites like Youtube.com, television viewers are migrating en masse to the Internet, looking not only to watch their favorite shows online but also for ways to discuss and engage with those shows. As a result, the blogs, communities like livejournal.com and message boards devoted to television shows are becoming more popular — and mainstream — forums for viewer discussion and feedback. And the people behind the shows have taken note. "As fractured as the media market has become, the Internet has become a great means of rising above the noise," said James Duff, the creator and executive producer of "The Closer" on TNT. "The Internet is going to turn television into the equivalent of AM radio," he predicted. "People will be talking about their shows and watching their shows in the same place." Many writers welcome the increased feedback from online viewers. "Television writers really work in isolation," said Ronald D. Moore, who, with David Eick, is the executive producer of the Peabody Award-winning Sci-Fi Channel series "Battlestar Galactica." "You have to fight this feeling that you're doing this show for yourself, your wife and your friends, who are the only people you watch it with," he said. "The Internet really changed the immediacy of the contact" between writers and viewers. Networks and producers are now cultivating that contact, often creating Internet-based content to accompany their series and attract online viewers. Mr. Moore releases a podcast to accompany almost every new episode of "Battlestar Galactica," while Mr. Eick appears in mockumentary-style behind-the-scenes "video blogs" on the Sci-Fi Channel's Web site, www.scifi.com. Even highly rated, more mainstream series like ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" and NBC's "Office" have thriving online communities devoted to viewer discussion, which have yielded attempts by series creators to engage those communities via writers' blogs or cast members' pages on myspace.com. Mr. Duff, who writes a blog about "The Closer" for TVGuide.com, said he focused primarily on the production, rather than on the specific episodes or storylines. "I'm not using my blog to supplement the program," Mr. Duff said in an interview. "If you have to explain what you said in a television program, then you've left some stuff out." According to Michael Ausiello, a senior writer for TV Guide and TVGuide.com, certain shows lend themselves more to attempts to cultivate Internet fandom than others. "Serialized shows succeed more," Mr. Ausiello said, citing ABC's "Lost" and "Veronica Mars," which is in transition from UPN to the new CW, as examples. "You're not going to see fans of the procedural shows up all night dissecting the shows," he said. As more television show creators communicate with their online fans, they often discover that their shows already have passionate, and often critical, Internet communities. Television Without Pity, a site that Ms. Ariano began with Sarah D. Bunting and David T. Cole in 1998 as Dawsonswrap.com, is one of the most prominent and established of these forums, with about one million unique visitors a month, according to Ms. Ariano and Nielsen/NetRatings. The site blends irreverent commentary on episodes of shows ranging from "The Apprentice" to "The Sopranos" with an array of discussion boards devoted to almost every show ever broadcast. Although many television writers may keep an eye on its boards, few get directly involved with the fans, Ms. Ariano said. Rob Thomas, the creator and executive producer of "Veronica Mars" and one of the few such "show runners" to post openly on the Web site's forums, said in an interview that Television Without Pity functioned "as a big focus group." "They're very intense fans," he added, "the really devoted ones." But, Mr. Thomas added ruefully, as viewer response to "Veronica Mars" became more critical in the show's second season, the experience of reading the site was "like being in a room with a thousand ex-girlfriends," he said. "The new shine wore off," he added. Mr. Thomas conceded that his awareness of the fans' reactions had occasionally influenced the way he wrote "Veronica Mars." Fans hated a second-season character played by Tessa Thompson, he said, leading him to overcompensate in an effort to make the character likable. "I feel like I sold out a little," Mr. Thomas said. "She became a little saintly by the end. If I had to do it over again, I'd leave her a little more complicated." The consequences of Mr. Thomas's communication with his fans may be relatively unusual. But other writers and producers interviewed also said they regarded their fans with a mixture of gratitude and caution. Mr. Eick of "Battlestar Galactica" said online fandom could "be a very powerful weapon to help you develop the audience of your show." "But," he continued, "you can't rely on it too heavily, or the show becomes too inside, and you end up marginalizing your larger audience." Mr. Moore, who reads fan boards and occasionally responds to viewer concerns via his scifi.com blog, said he felt obligated to acknowledge the devotion of online "Galactica" fans. "I was a fan, too," he said. "I'm always impressed; they really pay attention. It forces you to deal with the criticism. It's easy to read the good stuff."

331-> Cultural and Generational Clashes, Played Out for Laughs in the Suburbs
In “Red Doors,” the oceanic divide between generations in a Chinese-American family is epitomized by the relationship of its glum paterfamilias, Ed Wong (Tzi Ma), and Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee), the youngest of his three daughters. A 60-year-old retiree who sits around watching old home movies of his little girls, Ed has plunged into a suicidal funk. But every time he begins to act on his self-destructive urges, Katie barges in on him, barely noticing his distress. On one occasion she interrupts him as he is tightening a noose around his neck. On another she appears as he is reclining in a bathtub with razor blades at his side. Her obliviousness to his pain would be unsettling if “Red Doors” weren’t a comedy. But this agreeable, lightweight movie, written and directed by Georgia Lee, turns the malaises of a suburban family into bittersweet farce that teeters between cheeky humor and surface pathos. Ultimately “Red Doors” (the title refers to the Wongs’ red front door, whose color is supposed to bring good luck) loses its nerve and wraps up its interlocking family crises in a cozy blanket of reassurance. Katie’s personal behavior is as extreme as her father’s. A ferociously headstrong high school student who wears her hair in two jutting pigtails, she leads a hip-hop dance troupe in school and, to her parents’ annoyance, pumps rap into her ears at the dinner table. Those dinners are traditional Chinese meals passed around on a Lazy Susan. Katie is consumed by her treacherous quasiromantic pas de deux with Simon (Sebastian Stan), a fellow high school student who lives next door and with whom she has never spoken a word. Acutely aware of each other but silent by tacit agreement, these teenagers, who exchange meaningful poker-faced looks when they pass each other in the halls, are engaged in a tit-for-tat war in which they play increasingly grisly practical jokes on each other. He sends her a present of a dead rodent. She drops a burning bag of dog feces on his doorstep. After igniting a small explosion in his school locker, this teenage caricature of the Asian woman warrior with American junk culture in her blood is given a warning by school authorities. Each of the three Wong sisters exemplifies a different mode of cultural assimilation. Samantha (Jacqueline Kim), the eldest, is the dutiful high achiever. A successful businesswoman, she is engaged to be married to Mark (Jayce Bartok), an Ivy League yuppie whom the movie unabashedly despises. Samantha still carries a torch for her old boyfriend Alex (Rossif Sutherland), a drippy singer-songwriter with patches of facial hair who regards her with a moist cow-eyed longing. The shy middle sister, Julie (Elaine Kao), is a medical student who begins to emerge from her shell when Mia Scarlett (Mia Riverton), a flirtatious television starlet visiting the hospital to study for a role, puts the moves on her after Julie helps her through the trauma of seeing a chest cut open. Julie is besotted with this Angelina Jolie-manqué, until the star treats her carelessly; then Julie shows her mettle. “Red Doors” pulls together three well-worn subgenres of independent cinema. The moldiest is the suburbia-as-hell cliché that was revived by “American Beauty” and whose solemnity “Red Doors” tries to subvert with humor. The second is the drama of cultural assimilation within several generations of a family and the tension between the puritanical old ways and the freewheeling new ones. In these movies (“Red Doors” included) it often boils down to the choice of a wedding dress. Finally there is the coming-out story. If these three subgenres are folded together comfortably in “Red Doors,” which is handsomely photographed, they don’t add up to something larger than the sum of their parts.  Written and directed by Georgia Lee; director of photography, Zeus Morand; edited by Youna Kwak; music by Robert Miller; production designer, Angelique Clark; produced by Jane Chen, Ms. Lee and Mia Riverton; released by Polychrome Pictures. Running time: 90 minutes. WITH: Jacqueline Kim (Samantha Wong), Elaine Kao (Julie Wong), Tzi Ma (Ed Wong), Kathy Shao-Lin Lee (Katie Wong), Freda Foh Shen (May-Li Wong), Rossif Sutherland (Alex), Mia Riverton (Mia Scarlett), Jayce Bartok (Mark) and Sebastian Stan (Simon).

332-> Manhattan: M.T.A. Executive Director to Resign
The executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Katherine N. Lapp, left, announced yesterday that she would resign at the end of the year to make way for new leadership at the agency under Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer. A spokeswoman for Mr. Spitzer said he would announce Ms. Lapp’s successor today. Speculation has centered on Elliot G. Sander, a former city transportation commissioner.

333-> Manhattan: More Demand for Food From Charities
The number of New Yorkers relying on food from charities is rising, according to a report released yesterday by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. Nearly one in six city residents live in households that could not afford to buy enough food during a three-year period ending in 2005, the group said. The households include 15.4 percent of city residents, up from 14 percent from 2000 to 2003, the group included in a report that was based in part on figures from the federal Department of Agriculture. About 1.1 million of the city’s 8.1 million residents receive food stamps, but advocates estimate that hundreds of thousands more are eligible. Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, said the city must do more to provide healthy food to residents.

334-> Waterbury, Conn.: Schools Closed After Buses Are Vandalized
Waterbury public schools were canceled yesterday for 18,000 students in kindergarten to 12th grade after more than one-third of the school district’s buses were vandalized over the weekend. The police are still searching for the unknown culprits, who broke into about 50 buses and spray-painted graffiti, set off fire extinguishers and smashed first-aid equipment. School officials said classes would resume this morning.

335-> A Special Relationship
For the best part of three years in 1961-63, during a critical phase of the cold war, the president of the United States and the British prime minister were linked by a family connection. In Barbara Leaming's view there was still more to the story of that time when John F. Kennedy was in the White House and Harold Macmillan at Downing Street. Young Jack had visited England in the late 1930's and had been introduced by his sister Kathleen (known as Kick) to her friends there. The bonds that Kennedy forged then profoundly affected him; above all, Winston Churchill's "monumental influence" shaped Kennedy's strategy during his tragically curtailed presidency, or so Leaming contends in "Jack Kennedy: The Education of a Statesman." She has written what is in part an absorbing and enjoyable book; whether her thesis really stands up is another matter. By now the aura of Camelot and Kennedy's political repute have faded, but the story of his glittering, doomed family remains as poignant as ever. Born the son of that old brute Joseph P. Kennedy and his wife, the "rigid and physically distant" Rose, Jack grew up in the shadow of Joseph Jr., eldest of the nine siblings, on whom all old Joe's hopes were pinned. Frail as a boy, Jack envied and resented Joe Jr., and was turned by illness toward books: Leaming is delighted to find him hospitalized in Boston at the age of 15 reading Churchill's history of the Great War, "The World Crisis." From this book he learned the importance of military preparedness and firm resolution, we are assured: "Thirty years later, these and other lessons from 'The World Crisis' would prove central to the Kennedy presidency." Early in 1938 Joe Kennedy became American ambassador in London, one of the more curious appointments made by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who could be careless in these matters. Another famed Irish-American, James Michael Curley — governor of Massachusetts, four times mayor of Boston and twice jailed for corruption — wanted an ambassadorship, and Warsaw was suggested as a destination. When reminded of his unsuitability, Roosevelt replied, "What is there in Poland that Curley could steal?" But in Joe's case, theft was less the problem than his opinions: he remained the isolationist he had been in the first war, not to say an appeaser who sympathized with Hitler. In England, Kick began to make a circle of upper-class friends: David Ormsby Gore, Hugh Fraser, Debo Mitford and the sons of the Duke of Devonshire, William, Marquess of Hartington, and Lord Andrew Cavendish. Leaming has written biographies of Orson Welles and Katharine Hepburn, and in a Hollywood way can be a little gushing — "immensely rich . . . vast landholdings with castles, mansions and large numbers of tenants" — but she does have a real sense of what English life (at least in that rarefied stratum) was like. If anything, she misses a point when she talks of the "immense" class difference between Kennedys and Cavendishes. A trite received idea — America means laid-back egalitarianism and England hidebound hierarchy — is sometimes near the reverse of the case. Aristocratic England had no problem with trans-Atlantic plutocracy: the peerage had been fortifying itself with American heiresses for a couple of generations before this. But more to the point, the Kennedys had grown up near Boston, under the veritable apartheid of old Back Bay snobbery, where Irish Catholics rated not far above blacks. To us English, on the other hand, the Kennedys were just rich and attractive Yanks, and I believe that England was something of a liberating experience for Kick and Jack. In this account, high jinks among the highborn are interspersed with Churchill's warnings against German aggression. But Leaming knows that Kick's friends were not all passionate opponents of appeasement. Nor indeed was she — in the fall of 1938 she grumbled that "all you can hear or talk about at this point is the future war which is bound to come. Am so darn sick of it" — or her brother. The ambassador preached reconciliation between the democracies and dictatorships — "After all, we have to live together" — at which young Jack, back in America, congratulated his father on a speech that "while it seemed to be unpopular with the Jews etc. was considered to be very good by everyone who wasn't bitterly anti-Facist" ("[sic]," adds Leaming, as well she might). When war came, both Cavendish boys joined the Coldstream Guards ("the Coldstream" is correct, by the way, or "Coldstreamers," but never "Coldstreams," as this book has it). By now Billy Hartington and Kick had fallen in love, but there was the grave difficulty of religion, which held up marriage for several years until Kick, to the horror of her mother, agreed to bring up any children in the Church of England. Meanwhile, Jack pulled ahead of his big brother on every front: his "Why England Slept" (1940) was the book that had been expected from Joe. When the United States entered the war, both brothers were commissioned, but again it was Jack who became the great hero after the sinking of PT-109. Joe found himself "in Jack's shadow in ways he could never have imagined," and responded by sourly wondering whether the sinking of his brother's boat hadn't been due to incompetence. In the dramatic course of 1944, Billy Hartington ran for Parliament in what was regarded as a family seat, and — in an episode that is covered here at excessive length, but that was certainly of some significance — he was derided by the popular papers and then defeated, illustrating the eclipse of the traditional ruling class and adumbrating the great Labor landslide of the following year. He and Kick were married at last, and had five weeks together before he rejoined his regiment in France. Shortly afterward, Joe Jr. was flying an aircraft that was a kind of manned missile, intended to be aimed down at its target across the Channel while the crew parachuted out, when it exploded prematurely. Old Joe was devastated by his son's death: "He had never believed that the war was worth fighting, and he did not change his mind now." And in September Billy was killed in Belgium. Although grief-stricken, Kick stayed in England. Leaming says what I have been told also, that she was much loved by those who knew her. But she was born under an unlucky star. Within a few years she fell for another man, Lord Fitzwilliam, who not only was a hard-drinking philanderer but needed to divorce his wife to marry her. Rose said she would disown Kick for such literally damnable behavior, but the guilty lovers never did wed. In May 1948, their chartered plane stopped outside Paris, where the pilot said the weather was too bad to take off, but Fitzwilliam arrogantly insisted, so they flew on through a storm and into a mountainside. After Kick's death there was a lull in the relentless family tragedy, though not of course for good. As Jack goes into politics, first as a congressman and then as a senator, there is also a lull in Leaming's relentless Churchillian theme and her adulation of Kennedy. It is surely difficult to make much of a hero of him at this time: he dismayed his Democratic colleagues by abstaining from the Senate vote to condemn Joseph McCarthy, whom he "rather respected." For that matter, Leaming's hero worship is defeated by Kennedy's private life. He was an energetic Lothario before marriage, and if anything even more so after. One doesn't need to be a prude or a militant feminist to be startled: it wasn't decorous old-fashioned adultery but sexual recklessness — White House secretaries, Marilyn Monroe, call girls — on a scale that makes Bill Clinton seem a model of prudence. Was this compulsion connected with Kennedy's appalling health? His life was spent battling bravely with pain and illness, from something like leukemia in boyhood to Addison's disease later on, and the excruciating back complaint. When he was a boy, doctors gave him a slim chance of survival, and before he was 40 he had twice come close enough to death to receive the last rites. By 1959, Kennedy was running for president, and "emphatically cast himself in the mold of the 1930's Churchill." Where Churchill had charged Neville Chamberlain with "acute blindness to the menace of Nazi Germany," Kennedy accused President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, his vice president and would-be successor, of being blind to the "missile gap" with Russia. Once Kennedy becomes president, the point is hammered over and again. After describing his unsatisfactory meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in Austria, Leaming writes, "Vienna promised to be his Munich," and then again: "As Churchill had," Kennedy aimed "not to start a war, but to prevent one." It is Churchill's fate to be continually appropriated by or on behalf of occupants of the White House, among others. You can take your pick between Steven F. Hayward's book "Greatness: Reagan, Churchill, and the Making of Extraordinary Leaders" or President Bush himself saying, "We are finding and dealing with the terrorists, drawing tight what Winston Churchill called a 'closing net of doom.' " But Churchill can be cited on both sides of many arguments, often misleadingly. His warnings about German rearmament in the 1930's were in reality much exaggerated — the Luftwaffe was nowhere near the strength he claimed — but at least that was an honest mistake, whereas the "missile gap" that helped Kennedy win the 1960 election was willful demagogy. And once you start using the rhetoric of "resist the aggressor" and "no appeasement," you are on a very dangerous slope. Where does Churchill's heroic example lead in practice? The Bay of Pigs? Vietnam? Guantánamo Bay? To an English reader another theme is visible. Macmillan was married to Lady Dorothy Cavendish, Billy Hartington's aunt. With a truly Whiggish sense of family connection, Macmillan made Billy's brother, now Duke of Devonshire, a junior minister (an outrageous act of nepotism, Andrew Devonshire liked to say), and sent David Ormsby Gore, to whom Macmillan was linked by yet another marriage, as ambassador to Washington, where he saw the Kennedys more often than most American politicians did. And yet during the extraordinary events of these years, it is very difficult to find evidence that Ormsby Gore had any great influence on American policy. It seems rather one more illustration of that great British illusion, a "special relationship" that only one side knew existed (and relationships don't come more special than that). In October 1963, Macmillan abruptly resigned; five weeks later Kennedy was shot in Dallas: in personal terms, this remains a Greek tragedy. And whatever else is said of the Kennedys and their English circle, they not only aspired to the political leadership of their countries but were prepared to fight and die in battle themselves, a contrast indeed to our present rulers. All the same, Churchill deserves to be given a rest.

336-> World Briefing | Africa: South Africa: Aristide Welcome To Stay
The deposed Haitian president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, is welcome to remain in exile in South Africa for as long as he likes, but neither he nor the South African government anticipates that he will stay forever, the foreign minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, told Parliament. Mr. Aristide, left, who left Haiti in 2004, lives outside Pretoria in circumstances akin to those of a cabinet minister, she said. Critics have accused President Thabo Mbeki of according luxury accommodations to Mr. Aristide, who was widely accused of corruption and misrule. Ms. Dlamini-Zuma said, however, that Mr. Aristide's exile fit an international mandate to create peace and stability in Haiti. MICHAEL WINES (NYT)

337-> These Front-Row Seats Come With a Lot of Sweat
After negotiating nearly 23 miles of the New York City Marathon yesterday morning, Basil Ashmore, 51, and Herb Dershowitz, 61, veered left off the course, stopped and called it a day. Then they got off their bicycles. They were 2 of the 78 cyclists who volunteered to ride alongside the wheelchair and handcycle racers to prevent pedestrians and motorists from wandering onto the course and into the athletes’ way. Kurt Fearnley of Australia followed the path that Ashmore and Dershowitz cleared and finished first in a course-record 1 hours 29 minutes 23 seconds. “That guy was really moving,” Ashmore said. “It was not easy staying with him.” Pedestrians and motorists seem less aware of the wheelchair and handcycle competitions, said Bob Laufer, the coordinator of the wheelchair division of the New York City Marathon. In past races, there were near misses. “Some wheelchair racers reported afterward that they had to swerve to avoid pedestrians,” Laufer said. “We just wanted to act before anything major happened.” After the 2003 marathon, Laufer enlisted Richard Rosenthal, 67, a former president of the New York Cycle Club, to help prevent collisions on the course with a formal cycling detail. Rosenthal had volunteered in 1991 and 1992 to guide the wheelchair racers. “I recall all too well a school-bus driver backing up into the path of an oncoming wheelchair, utterly irrespective of my screaming and yelling,” Rosenthal wrote in an e-mail message he sent to the cyclists Saturday night. This year, Rosenthal and Laufer provided the wheelchair and handcycle racers with more protection than ever. The 78 cyclists who volunteered yesterday were almost quadruple the total from 2004, Rosenthal said. Rosenthal requires the volunteers he accepts to meet his criteria. He asked riders to be able to maintain a speed of 18 miles an hour, which is how fast the elite handcyclists can go. He asked the volunteers not to talk to the racers because the distraction could give some racers an unfair advantage, he said. And he did not want volunteers there for the excitement alone, he said. There were a few accidents yesterday among the wheelchair racers — including a minor wipeout by Fearnley — but none were caused by spectator interference. Rosenthal assigned a pair of cyclists to each of 38 disabled athletes. The cyclists rode on either side of the racer, always pedaling just a little ahead. Wearing fluorescent yellow vests and using whistles, the cyclists kept intruders at bay. “You just blow your whistle a lot,” said Gerry Oxford, 52, a systems analyst in Manhattan. Rosenthal’s group reflects the diversity of the city and the marathon field. There is Marten L. denBoer, 51, an associate provost at Queens College; Kurt Gustafsson, 41, a caterer; and Neal K. Fujishige, 47, a dentist. There is an orthopedic surgeon; a hedge-fund manager; the president of the municipal council in Irvington, N.J.; a chef; a conductor for New Jersey Transit; a chiropractor and five architects. Harold E. Varmus, 66, who won a Nobel Prize for medicine in 1989, was part of last year’s contingent, Rosenthal said. Rosenthal recruited from New York-area cycling clubs. He brought in members of Fast and Fab, a gay and lesbian cycling club, and the Major Taylor Iron Riders, whose membership is predominantly African-American. Rosenthal recruited members of the Kissena Cycle Club of Queens; the Staten Island Bicycling Association; the New York Cycle Club; and others. Rosenthal said his primary purpose was to provide the wheelchair and handcycle racers with a course free of obstacles, but he also hoped to “marshal a single voice for cycling considerations,” he said, by cobbling together people who could make unlikely connections. Rick Jakobson, 44, acknowledged another benefit to volunteering. “To get to ride through New York City without hitting one red light is wonderful,” he said. “I think only the president gets to do that.”

338-> Where Politics and Personal Lives Seem Not to Intersect
SYDNEY, Australia, Nov. 15 — American elections are always big news here, but the upheaval in the United States Congress — as well as concerns about rising interest rates here and a prolonged drought — were all eclipsed, at least briefly, by “values” issues. First, an Australian senator announced that he and his wife had become parents through surrogacy, firing up critics and advocates of a practice that is banned in parts of the country. Then legislators entered into an emotional and well-covered discussion of therapeutic cloning. Like Americans, Australians are deep in a nationwide debate over a number of hot issues that have been raised by advances in medical science. Another legislative fight, over the abortion pill RU-486, ended early this year with legalization of the pill. But there is a major difference. While polls show that Australians are generally quite divided on “values” issues — like abortion, which is legal, and same-sex marriage, which is not — political debates on the topics do not degenerate into personal attacks, perhaps a reflection of the country’s secular nature. For the most part, religion is a private matter here, not a political one. And while it would be glib to say that Australians worship the sun, the surf and the laid-back life, it is not wrong to note that although Australians go to church — predominately Catholic or Anglican — candidates are generally not concerned with playing to religious groups. The evangelical right, though growing, is politically insignificant. Those conditions may help explain why Australia’s politicians have had some very candid debates on very emotional subjects. Earlier this year, during the legislative struggle over RU-486, a cabinet minister who opposed legalization mentioned that a girlfriend had once had an abortion; a few days later, a senator who supported legalization said she herself had had an abortion when she was 18. Neither suffered politically. The recent debate over surrogacy started with the news in early November that a Labor Party senator, Stephen M. Conroy, 43, and his wife, Paula Benson, a 38-year-old businesswoman who could not conceive after having ovarian cancer, had become parents through an elaborate procedure. The egg was donated by one woman, fertilized in vitro by the senator, then implanted in another woman who carried the child to birth. Surrogacy is banned in the senator’s home state of Victoria, so the couple and the woman who bore the child came here, to New South Wales, for the birth. That ban in Victoria was put in place 20 years ago when the Roman Catholic Church was still powerful there, according to Dr. Peter Illingworth, medical director of IVF Australia, one of the largest fertility clinics in the country. But there is also a federal ban on “commercial” surrogacy — in which a woman is paid to carry the child — that Dr. Illingworth said was less about religious beliefs and more about what he said were basic Australian values. “This is a quite secular country, but there are certain core principles,” he said in an interview. “One of these is that for rich people to pay poor people to take health risks on their behalf is not a good thing.” In the senator’s case, both women were friends of the couple and charged nothing. One day after the Conroy-Benson story was front page news, the big story was the debate in Parliament about legislation that would allow therapeutic cloning, which some say is critical to helping scientists find potential cures for diseases. The technique involves taking the nucleus from a mature cell, like a skin cell, and transplanting it into an egg. The resulting embryo would be destroyed at an early stage to obtain stem cells. In 2002, Parliament banned all cloning but called for a review after three years. Last year a government-appointed committee recommended that the ban on therapeutic cloning be lifted. Prime Minister John Howard, leader of the center-right Liberal Party, was opposed, and might have been able to block legislative action because party discipline is considerably stronger here than in the United States. But he allowed what is called a conscience vote on the issue, which means that representatives are free to break from the party line. Taking advantage of that opening, a Liberal Party senator, Kay Patterson, a former health minister and an advocate of stem-cell research, introduced legislation that would permit therapeutic cloning. The debate was intense and emotional. Opponents warned that human embryos could be created using eggs from cadavers and that legalization could eventually lead to human cloning. “In my view, these proposals turn human dignity on its head,” said Senator Julian McGauran, of the Liberal Party. Others argued that poor women would be offered irresistible money for their eggs. “These arguments are deeply offensive to women — indeed, they should be to men, too,” Senator Jeannie Ferris, of the Liberal Party, told her colleagues during the debate. “They suggest that a woman has no control over her body, is driven by money and greed, will willingly take medication to stimulate egg production, and in return for payment, will jeopardize her health and potentially her life.” The legislation passed, but only barely, 34 to 32. Twenty of the yes votes were by women; four women voted against it. “This is the second debate in a row that has taken the liberal, secular approach,” Dr. Illingworth said about the cloning vote. In the debate in February over RU-486, support by women in Parliament was also critical. The two votes demonstrate that “women are prepared to flex their political muscle,” The Australian wrote in an editorial. The stem cell legislation is to be debated by the House next month, and is expected to pass.

339-> World Briefing | Americas: Brazil: Prison Wardens Murdered
Six prison wardens have been killed in two weeks of violence in the prisons of São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, the police said, prompting thousands of penitentiary workers to strike for safer working conditions. Police said the attacks were perpetrated by the First Capital Command crime gang, which formed within the Brazilian prison system. The gang was behind a coordinated rebellion across dozens of prisons and São Paulo street offensive in May which left some 170 people dead, including 41 police and security officers.

The United States military said it would pay $90,000 in compensation to the families of victims of an air attack in May that killed at least 16 civilians in Tulokan, in the Panjwayi district of Kandahar. But a military spokesman, Col. Tom Collins, said the compensation process -- "family assistance, reconstruction and projects in the village" -- would not start until security in Kandahar improved. The airstrike came amid intense fighting with Taliban forces. While the military and the Afghan government put the death toll from the strike at 16, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and local residents say 37 people were killed.

341-> Metro Briefing | New York: Albany: Hevesi Says Board Is Rushing Projects
A board that oversees borrowing for state construction and economic development projects is "rushing through" major decisions in the last months of Gov. George E. Pataki's administration, saddling taxpayers with billions of dollars in debt, State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said yesterday. The board, the Public Authorities Control Board, approved $4.7 billion in projects last month and is set to vote on $6.7 billion worth of projects this month. Mr. Hevesi has said Mr. Pataki should allow Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer to review the projects. A spokesman for Mr. Pataki, a Republican, blamed delays caused by Mr. Hevesi and Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, both Democrats, for the volume of projects coming up for approval. Mr. Silver's office did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.

342-> Checking a Co-op’s Finances
 “It is very important to review a co-op’s most recent financial statements, as well as the building’s offering plan and its rules and regulations before signing a contract to buy,” said Elliott Meisel, a Manhattan co-op and condominium lawyer. “Contracts usually contain a representation that the buyer has reviewed all relevant information before signing the contract so as to insulate the seller from any claims that the buyer didn’t know what he or she was getting into.” Typically, Mr. Meisel said, such a review can be conducted based upon documents that the seller should have available. If not, the prospective buyer should be able to get them from the managing agent, who may charge a fee for photocopying them. “The financials will reveal whether the building is meeting its annual expenses and will indicate whether it will have to increase its maintenance charges in the future to do so,” Mr. Meisel said. “They will also show whether the building has adequate reserves to meet anticipated or unforeseen repairs, improvements and other extraordinary expenses, or whether it will have to impose assessments or increase borrowing to meet those expenses.”  Stuart M. Saft, a Manhattan lawyer and the chairman of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said that since managing agents work for the co-op corporation, they must follow the directions of the co-op board. And though agents can place reasonable restrictions on a board member’s ability to review the records of the co-op — limiting reviews to regular business hours, for example — they generally cannot flatly deny a board member access to those records. “A board member, as a fiduciary of the co-op, has to be given access to the financial records so he or she can be assured that there are no problems,” Mr. Saft said. He added that the writer should ask her fellow board members to direct the agent to provide the records she needs. If for some reason the board declines, her only option would be to convince a court that there are compelling reasons to overturn the board’s decision.

344-> Cowboys and Indians Reconsidered: The Mythic West, Lassoed In by Reality
LOS ANGELES — Breakaway bottles used as props in fake saloon fights, posters for grade-B movies, a Hopalong Cassidy board game, Annie Oakley’s pistols, Gary Cooper’s toupee and a diorama of the O.K. Corral shootout: this is what you might expect to find in a museum founded by America’s Favorite Singing Cowboy, Gene Autry. And here, at the Museum of the American West (formerly the Autry Museum of Western Heritage) in Griffith Park, nostalgic film buffs and aficionados of cowboy culture will find it all, much of it associated with an entertainer whose reputation was made with a guitar and a saddle, but whose greatest hit was a 1949 rendition of “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer” that sold more than 30 million copies. That is why it seemed so bizarre when, in 2003, the Autry Museum, with its $100 million endowment, absorbed the Southwest Museum of the American Indian, with its neglected world-class collection of 250,000 objects associated with once-flourishing tribes. This takeover caused much consternation. It wasn’t just the old cowboy-versus-Indian battle recurring in modern commercial form. It was the triumph of the phony cinematic West over its authentic past, with Hollywood’s stage sets winning out over relics so neglected through the decades that many had been assaulted by mold, mildew and insect infestation. But something is needed other than these comfortable formulas to account for what the Museum of the American West has already become. In the next few years it has the potential to map out a new form of historical museum in the United States, one that is neither an intoxicated celebration of Western fantasy — turning itself into another stage set in a fictionalized drama — nor romanticized recompense for those who lost out in the conflict, as is now so often the case; sadly, the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington set the standard for a new indulgent, sentimental tone of Indian self-celebration. The possibility of a new kind of museum is apparent here. Mr. Autry’s original goal when the museum opened in 1988 was to “exhibit and interpret the heritage of the West and show how it has influenced America and the world.” But that heritage is complicated. Mr. Autry died in 1998, but the museum, thriving with the fortunes left it by his foundation — that singer not only succeeded in television, radio, movies, theater and recordings, but later owned a major-league baseball team, hotels, broadcasting stations, a flying school and oil wells — grew far beyond its founder’s imaginings. Mr. Autry’s collection of showbiz memorabilia was amplified with careful acquisitions and collections from the historical, not cinematic, West. Then came the 2002 absorption of the Women of the West Museum (founded in 1991 in Boulder, Colo.) and finally the acquisition of the Southwest Museum of the American Indian. An umbrella — the Autry National Center — was created for these institutions; the Autry Museum was renamed the Museum of the American West; and the Institute for the Study of the American West was established. The center has already spent $5 million to restore the Southwest Museum’s collection, with the museum’s former building in the Mount Washington section of Los Angeles now being used for restoration instead of display. Another $1.5 million is budgeted for similar work next year, and millions will be required as plans develop for expansion of the Griffith Park complex . Now the center promises visitors a new frontier, where they can “explore uncharted territory at the only history center to make the intersection of cultures its principal focus.” Portraying the intersection of cultures has its own dangers: hypersensitivity, endless qualification and overly tentative exploration. But there is something about the Museum of the American West that makes this goal eminently plausible. The museum successfully mixes realism and fantasy, skepticism and enthusiasm. Its first half is given over to fantasies of the West on stage and screen. But distortions are made clear in the midst of the celebration: the real West and the illusory West intertwine. Western figures, like Buffalo Bill, turn themselves into stage legends, while Annie Oakley, who was neither born nor reared in the West, becomes the archetypal Western woman. In a display of movie costumes, a label reads that designers and producers “create their own visions of the West and Westerners,” often providing “illusions of authenticity.” Another display points out that in the “myth of the Hollywood western,” “early Hollywood cowboys were hard-working, polite to the ladies, honest and patriotic to the core.” Their corny cinematic tales became known as “horse operas” and “oaters.” Props in B movies made their way from jungle films to westerns with minimal alteration: “Historians of the ‘real’ old West sometimes find such compromises to be maddening,” one label playfully points out, “but as the saying goes, ‘That’s Hollywood!’ ” So for all the memorabilia, there is no chance here that illusion will be left intact. But there is also great affection for the idea of the West mixed in with the criticism, and a great respect too for the passions it inspired. Those passions helped make the mythmaking possible. They also carry over into the next part of the museum, where history holds sway. The romance of the West is given its due in displays of marshal badges and Colt revolvers, in a life-size stagecoach and a mess wagon. So are its darker aspects, with a “legacy of pain and prejudice.” “Conquest and settlement of the West in the 19th century inevitably meant destruction of native peoples and their ways of life,” reads one label. “By killing off millions of bison and by confining tribes to reservations, Americans dominated the West.” Warfare, the museum notes, caused suffering “on both sides” and “the permanent alteration of the land.” You can sense throughout an attempt to look over the shoulder, to test out the formulations from differing perspectives, sometimes with too much strain, sometimes with great skill. Given its origins as well as its future, the museum has a continuing challenge: it must remain true to its enthusiasms and faithful to ever-expanding historical understanding. It must incorporate, sympathize, comprehend, mourn and celebrate. Extremes are to be avoided: mythmaking — like a stilted life-size diorama of the shootout at the O.K. Corral — is the antidote to cynicism. Skepticism — accounts of, say, the suffering of Chinese immigrants in the West — is an antidote to fantasy. And somehow the bizarre mixture of spectacle and sobriety has an impact: the portrait of the West begins to become nuanced. But nothing is relativized. The nuance doesn’t mean withholding judgment; it means exploring complication. This same spirit may also be inspiring the temporary exhibitions planned by the museum. Currently, in a special show, “Yosemite: Art of an American Icon,” paintings and photographs of that extraordinary landscape suggest the physical power and lure of the West, even if only some of the images are themselves sublime. The museum has also scheduled major exhibitions including “Home Lands: How Women Made the West” and “Encounters: The American Frontier.” The impulse toward multiple understandings at the “intersection of cultures” may become even more palpable once the Southwest collection is fully restored, perhaps even demonstrating a way for other museums to move beyond political clichés. In that age of the Autry center yet to come, Indians and cowboys will be sharing the same home; little room will be left for self-indulgence.

345-> South Korea: Knife Attack on Political Leader
Prosecutors were seeking a charge of attempted murder against a man being held in a knife attack on Park Geun Hye, the chairwoman of South Korea's main opposition party, the Grand National Party. The attack on Ms. Park took place in Seoul on Saturday as she was attending a party rally for the country's local elections this month. She suffered a four-inch cut along the face that required 60 stitches and will prevent her from talking normally for weeks, a hospital spokesman said. Ms. Park, 54, is widely expected to be a candidate for president next year. Her father, Park Chung Hee, was a president from 1961 to 1979, when he was assassinated. Her mother had been killed five years earlier by a bullet that missed her father. The police said that the suspect in Ms. Park's attack had served 14 years in prison on charges including assault and that he had told them he was "upset at a society that lacks democracy."

346-> State Department Yields on PC's From China
Long story short, an influential member of Congress played the China card, and the State Department folded. It was a drama that reached a conclusion late last week, when the State Department, responding to fears that its security might be breached by a secretly placed device or hidden software, agreed to keep personal computers made by Lenovo of China off its networks that handle classified government messages and documents. The damage to Lenovo is more to its reputation than to its pocketbook. The State Department will use the 16,000 desktop computers it purchased from Lenovo, just not on the computer networks that carry sensitive government intelligence. Yet the episode does point to how much relations between the United States and China have become a tangled web of political, trade and security issues. Mutual economic dependence and mutual distrust, it seems, go hand in hand. To the Lenovo side, the outcome was a matter of anti-China politics overriding economic logic. Last year, the Chinese company completed the purchase of the personal computer business of I.B.M., after the Bush administration concluded a national security review. Given the nod, Lenovo figured it was free to do business in America just like any other personal computer company. But the State Department decision suggests that it is not that simple. "Unfortunately, we're in a situation where certain people in Congress and elsewhere want to make a political issue of this," said Jeffrey Carlisle, vice president of government relations for Lenovo. "They are trying to create as uncomfortable an atmosphere as possible for us in doing business with the federal government." Mr. Carlisle characterizes the worry that the Chinese government might secretly slip spying hardware or software on Lenovo computers shipped to the State Department as "a fantasy." The desktop machines, he said, will be made in Monterrey, Mexico, and Raleigh, N.C., at plants purchased from I.B.M. "It's the same places, using the same processes as I.B.M. had," Mr. Carlisle said. "Nothing's changed." Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Virginia Republican, said the change of ownership changes a lot. In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice earlier this month, he wrote that because of the Chinese government's "coordinated espionage program" intended to steal American secrets, the Lenovo computers "should not be used in the classified network." Mr. Wolf is the chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees the budget appropriations for the State Department, Commerce Department and Justice Department. In an interview yesterday, Mr. Wolf said the security concerns about the State Department's use of Lenovo computers had been brought to his attention by two members of the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a bipartisan group appointed by Congress. "They deserve the credit for this," Mr. Wolf said. Larry M. Wortzel, a member of the review commission and former military attaché to the American embassy in Beijing, said he and another commission member, Michael R. Wessel, began looking into the sale in March. What most concerned them, he said, was that 900 of the Lenovo computers were intended for use on the State Department's classified networks. Lenovo is partly owned by the Chinese government, which holds 27 percent. "This is a company owned and beholden to agencies of the People's Republic of China," Mr. Wortzel said. "Our assumption is that if the Chinese intelligence agencies could take action, they would take action." After meetings with American government and securities agencies, including classified briefings, Mr. Wortzel and Mr. Wessel concluded that it would be possible for the Chinese government to put clandestine hardware or software on personal computers that might be able to tap into American intelligence. "This is not off the wall as to whether there are potential security concerns here," Mr. Wessel said. Both Mr. Wortzel and Mr. Wessel insisted that theirs is not an anti-China stance or even anti-Lenovo. "I'm sure they are good computers," Mr. Wortzel said. "I would use them in my home. But I would not use one on a classified network at the State Department." The State Department said last Thursday that it would not use the Lenovo computers on its classified networks. In a letter to Mr. Wolf, Richard J. Griffin, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, said that the department had "consulted with U.S. government security experts and is recommending that the computers purchased last fall be utilized on unclassified systems only." The letter added that the State Department was "initiating changes in its procurement processes in light of the changing ownership" of computer equipment suppliers. A spokesman said that "to allay any possible fears and any possible concerns, this is where we came out." Certainly, there are fears aplenty these days in any matter related to China. Mr. Carlisle of Lenovo insists any security fears about its computers are unfounded. The company's computers and the software loaded on it are routinely tested inside the company and, on the State Department sale, by third-party American contractors, like CDW. "If anything were detected, it would be a death warrant for the company," Mr. Carlisle said. "No one would ever buy another Lenovo PC. It would make no sense to do it." Lenovo, industry analysts say, may well have the stronger argument, but it may still suffer. "Basically, this is much ado about nothing," said Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates. "Unfortunately, perceptions count. And the damage has already been done."

347-> Hollywood Puts the Squeeze on Talent
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 6 — On a recent trip to New York City, Russell Crowe was asked by reporters why he had dropped out of negotiations to star in a new movie being directed by Baz Luhrmann and produced by 20th Century Fox. The Academy Award winner, never one to mince words, suggested it was, in part, the money. “I do charity work, but I don’t do charity work for major studios,” Mr. Crowe said. It seems the needy are not the only ones in Hollywood with their hands out. Movie and television studios, facing escalating budgets, rampant piracy and the uncertain future of new media, are demanding concessions from talent. But as actors, directors and writers feel the squeeze, many are not happy about it. Worse, the tension is not likely to ease soon. As studios are set to begin contract negotiations with talent in January, all sides are girding for battle. Hollywood is in the midst of a strategic shift. The average cost to make and market a movie has skyrocketed — to $96.2 million last year, from $54.1 million in 1995 — while lucrative DVD sales have flattened. Major film studios are fending off illegal piracy, which industry executives say accounted for $1.3 billion in lost revenue in the United States last year. The growth of new media threatens to undermine traditional businesses, while studios are flummoxed about how to take advantage of the new opportunities they represent. And movies and TV also face tough new competition from video games and online social networking sites. Even cellphones have become a favorite diversion among the young. As in so many other show business debates, money and control are at the heart of the matter. And without solutions to these problems in sight, relations between talent and the studios are more strained than ever. “No matter how successful you are, you are not invincible,” said Brett Ratner, who directed the blockbuster “X-Men: The Last Stand” and is an executive producer of the television show “Prison Break.” “The studio is writing the checks. It’s all about leverage and who has the power. The goal is to get the biggest deal you can, because you are going to have to give something back to the studios anyway.” With guild contracts set to expire within the next two years, the animosity is palpable. This summer, 12 writers for the reality show “America’s Next Top Model” went on strike, complaining that the producers would not let their work be recognized by the Writers Guild of America, which would have guaranteed the writers pension and medical benefits. And movie studios are aggressively demanding that actors and directors lower their fees or risk having their movies dropped. Two weeks ago, 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures walked away from “Halo,” a movie based on the popular video game, after the executive producer, Peter Jackson, and others refused to reduce their fees. It is one of several productions recently that have either been halted or delayed; others include the comedy “Used Guys,” an adaptation of the television show “Dallas” and “Ripley’s Believe It or Not.” But it is the growing area of new media and technology that has made the relationship between studios and talent most fragile. Mr. Ratner, who also directs music videos, said he wanted to share in the profits from music videos when they were downloaded over services like the Apple iTunes Store. And actors, writers and directors are pressing to be paid fees for shows they worked on that are streamed or sold on the Internet, as well as for new programming on cellphones. Talent and studios, of course, have clashed before. In 2001, a Hollywood shutdown was narrowly averted. In 1988 writers walked out for nearly half a year, delaying the fall television season. And in 1980, actors took to picket lines to establish fees for films made for pay television channels, like HBO. But there seems to be a greater urgency now, because there do not appear to be clear answers to the industry’s woes. And entertainment executives seem more determined this time to hold the line. Film studios got burned in the 1990s when popular film actors and directors brokered lucrative paydays for themselves while, in some cases, studios took a loss on their films. Now even bankable stars, like Tom Cruise, are being cut less slack. His 14-year producing deal with Paramount Pictures was severed this summer, although he rebounded last week to become a partner at United Artists. “It works on an artist’s psyche, ourselves included,” said Brian Grazer, an Academy Award winner who produced the blockbuster “The Da Vinci Code.” “You are faced with a new reality. Do you want to stick to your price and be forced to stand in the parking lot instead of playing on the field? That is cause for conflict between talent and studios.” Brad Grey, a former talent manager and currently chairman at Paramount, said he did not think relationships with actors were more contentious than in the past. But, he said, leverage had shifted in favor of the studios. The studios will pay top dollar for certain actors, writers or directors, but only if they need them, he said. The rest have to settle for less. “If indeed you are an actor and you believe you will guarantee box office, then you have the privilege and freedom of arrogance,” Mr. Grey said. “It’s when there is a margin for error that emotion runs high.” Even Mr. Grazer said a new discipline imposed on talent could be beneficial. But not surprisingly, the industry’s guilds — particularly the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild of America — are defiant. On Sept. 20, nearly 700 protesters gathered at Pan Pacific Park in Los Angeles at a Writers Guild unity rally. Among them was Sara Jane Sluke, one of 12 writers for “America’s Next Top Model” who went on strike in July because of a lack of union representation for writers on that show. Many jobs in reality television are not covered under union contracts; guild representation is negotiated separately for each show. “This is trying to grab a little security in an uncertain business,” said Ms. Sluke, who added that she and her colleagues wanted pension and health benefits like those negotiated by the show’s editors. A spokesman for the CW network, which broadcast the show, said neither the CW nor the producers would comment. J. Nicholas Counter, who for 25 years has been president and chief negotiator of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, said the striking writers might have been more successful if the Writers Guild had been less hostile. “If the guilds are flexible, these deals could be negotiated,” said Mr. Counter, who was not involved with “Top Model.” “There are more tensions, more pressures on both sides. This is worse than it’s ever been.” Indeed, it is not the only scuffle involving the Writers Guild. NBC Universal recently filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against the Writers Guild after writers for television shows, including “The Office,” refused to work for Web shows too. “The posture and rhetoric studios are blaming us for having is that we are being too aggressive and militant,” said Patric M. Verrone, president of the Writers Guild. “But there is a mentality out there that this is a buyer’s market, that we’ll do more for much less.” Whatever the tensions, many in the industry still prefer to avoid a strike. Said Mr. Grey of the coming negotiations: “From our perspective, tough is fine as long as you get to a reasonable place. Rhetoric is one thing; reality is another.” Last year, Alan Rosenberg, who starred in the television show “L.A. Law,” was elected president of the Screen Actors Guild, pledging that studios should pay fees for content delivered by new media. It was a particularly appealing platform because guild infighting had left many actors worried the dissension among their ranks made them vulnerable. So far Mr. Rosenberg has had some success in negotiating terms. Last year, for instance, he said, nonguild actors were being asked to perform in short programs for cellphones based on the ABC series “Lost.” The Screen Actors Guild objected. “They have to come to us first and talk about it,” said Mr. Rosenberg, referring to the show’s producers. That led to negotiations with Touchstone Television, a division of the Walt Disney Company, which produced the show. Now actors who work on the cellphone program based on “Lost” will get a minimum wage of $425 for their work, as well as other fees if a short program was streamed on the Internet or sold on DVD, according to the guild. (The writers and directors negotiated separate deals.) “It is possible to work things out and not just react to vitriolic letters,” said Mr. Rosenberg, referring to correspondence from lawyers sent in such disputes. That said, the Screen Actors Guild is clashing with Disney and other studios over how much talent will be paid for television shows offered for sale by services like iTunes. Recently studios agreed to pay actors a fee similar to those negotiated for DVD sales. The actor’s guild balked, saying it should have been consulted first about the decision to offer shows online. The dispute between the actors and the studios is in arbitration, with actors hoping for a higher fee. “We don’t consult the guilds on major business decisions,” said Anne Sweeney, co-chair of Disney Media Networks, which was first to offer shows for sale on iTunes. Either way, she added, it was more important that media companies move ahead with online offerings, even if it meant conflict. “There is a far greater risk in doing nothing, than doing this,” she said. Recently Mr. Ratner, the director, was driving down Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood when he noticed a going-out-of-business sign at Tower Records, the music retailer that once thrived on selling the music of superstars like Prince, Elton John and Madonna. Many here, like him, fear that the problems that plagued the music business are heading their way. “What happens if the film business is not ahead of the curve?” he asked. “What is going to happen to me? To all of us?” Mr. Ratner said he had been well compensated as a director. Still, he has urged the Directors Guild of America to look at several issues facing directors, including the fact that they are not paid when music videos they direct are sold on the Internet. But he is not waiting around to see what the guilds will do or studios will offer either. Mr. Ratner said he was close to announcing a deal with an Internet company to create his own “Saturday Night Live”-style program that he would own outright and distribute online. Then he can bypass studio bosses altogether. “I could make a lucrative deal for myself,” he said. “This is just the beginning.”

348-> What If It's (Sort of) a Boy and (Sort of) a Girl?
Elizabeth Weil's article (Sept 24) presented important information but did not address the issue of prevention in the most common cause of genital ambiguity, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, in which the adrenal glands overproduce androgens (malelike hormones), owing to a genetic defect. These overproduced androgens masculinize the female fetus in utero, such that she is born with ambiguous genitalia, making sex assignment in the newborn difficult. There is now ample evidence that treatment of the fetus by administering medication to the mother from early in pregnancy to term can prevent the masculinization of the genitalia in the female fetus. Prenatal diagnosis (via DNA analysis) and treatment have proven so far to be effective. Such treatment prevents genital ambiguity and causes the affected female to be born with normal female genitalia, and thus no confusion of sex assignment.

OLESEN--Claus. On August 3, 2006 New York City lost a beloved resident, Claus Olesen, 65 years old. Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he spent 40 years living as an American citizen here, a place very close to his heart. A graduate of Hunter College, Claus was an avid participant in the City's social and cultural circles as a gifted poet, painter, photographer, and was also involved in amateur theater. His greatest passion however was film, having amassed a collection of over 2,000 works from various genres complete with personalized reviews and critiques. As a testament to his character, Claus has donated his collection to a film institute where it will continue to bring joy and knowledge to others for years to come. A world traveler who brought love and spirit into the lives of all he touched, Claus will be greatly missed by his former co-workers at the Milliken Textile Company, where he would still visit even after his retirement, and by his friends and family in New York and abroad. He is survived by twin brothers Jens Olesen of Sao Paulo, Brazil and Lars Olesen of Copenhagen, Denmark. A memorial service will be held on Friday, September 8, 12 o'clock noon at St. Luke's Lutheran Church, 308 W. 46th St. NY, NY 10036

351-> Asking Simple Questions of African AIDS Victims and Getting Simple, Powerful Answers
Christiane Amanpour lends her authority and acuity to the newly energized cause of Africa tonight on her CNN special “Where Have All the Parents Gone?” Like Bono, Angelina Jolie, Bill Clinton and Bill Gates, Ms. Amanpour has seen that Africa now offers clear opportunities to do some good with reports that, against the odds, offer hope. Not long ago, Africa was the name for a problem without a solution. Hunger and war, which had seemed intractable on the continent since decolonization, had been compounded by the rapid spread of AIDS, for which there was no treatment. In those days — post-apartheid, post-Live Aid — Africa seemed to have exhausted the minds and the mercy of politicians, celebrities, relief workers, missionaries and journalists. Instead, in the 1990’s many in the grandstanding and ministering classes turned their attention to the Middle East, where peace seemed tantalizingly within reach, and where analysis — using principles of university-taught political science, and economics — seemed to pay off. For a time. But then it didn’t. And today, as the conflicts in the Middle East have come to seem increasingly opaque and unpredictable, some analysts, after many a dove-hawk-dove oscillation, have quietly thrown up their hands. It’s just too demoralizing to be wrong over and over. Africa has been an unlikely beneficiary of this demoralization. Fresh from her special “In the Footsteps of bin Laden,” in which Ms. Amanpour, like everyone else, failed to find Osama bin Laden, she now visits various regions of Africa where a measure of hope can be found. Not that it comes easy. The first half of the program lays out twinned problems: children who have lost their parents to AIDS and children who have AIDS. As Ms. Amanpour announces at the top of the hour, Africa now has 12 million orphans (“And counting!” she shouts, her indignation persuasive). She talks to many, and to the grandmothers who, in many cases, have been left to care for them. While the camera takes in the irrepressible beauty of the East African landscape, Ms. Amanpour visits a boy whose father and mother are dying of AIDS. “Muktar,” she says, “can you tell me what you’re thinking right now, what you’re feeling?” Muktar, we learn, is feeling very sad. Many of Ms. Amanpour’s interviews proceed this way. Sometimes, as when she assumes that African grandmothers of small children must be aged (they look in their 40’s to me), she seems disconnected from her surroundings. She also asks mannered questions that draw annoyed comebacks; to her credit, she leaves these exchanges in the documentary. “Do you have enough food?” she asks one woman surrounded by skeletal and stunned-looking boys and girls. “The children are dying of hunger, don’t you see?” is the woman’s incredulous response. Ms. Amanpour does see. But she also sees, after a meeting with various relief workers, that some of this misery can be curtailed. Many organizations are working to get AIDS medicine to Africans who need it, and one, the Riders for Health, even goes out to rural areas on motorcycles to be sure it gets to those most unwell. One simple thing the motorcyclists do is to treat pregnant AIDS sufferers with anti-retroviral drugs, which prevent them from passing the disease to their babies. In small regions this has worked wonders, and most believe that the program can be successfully broadened. As Ms. Amanpour talks to doctors and children, she seems exhilarated to be finding ways to improve the world, rather than just report on it. But in other scenes, especially when she’s pumping for good quotes, she seems to feign involvement in a way that may make you long for her authoritarian reports into the camera, delivered in her gloriously husky tones, which suggest that she never gets a word wrong. Here she’s much more human, and extremely idiosyncratic, as when she asks a man whose wife has worked as a prostitute: “How could you send your women out to sell their bodies?” “Your women”? “Sell their bodies”? This sounds more like a base provocation than a real concern. No matter. Fortunately, the man has no time for debates about marriage, modesty, sex work. “We are hungry!” he says, which once again closes the case.

352-> First Time Around the World: A Trip Planner for the Ultimate Journey
  Many of us will not soon have the extra cash, vacation days or nerve to circumnavigate the globe, and so must take the journey with Phileas Fogg or contestants on “The Amazing Race.” But for the swelling ranks of would-be Magellans, this encouraging guidebook can help not only to dream up an itinerary but also to push the fainthearted out the door. Doug Lansky believes that a satisfying trip (25,000 miles or more) can be completed in three months “as long as you don’t try to visit too many destinations” and for about $4,000 — “no problem” — even less if you know how to hitchhike on yachts. (The fine print — and there is lots of fine print in the sidebars here — suggests that most people should allow more time and a larger budget.) Once you’re committed, the book has plenty of savvy advice on transportation (a single round-the-world ticket versus flights booked on the go, container ships versus freighters), communicating cheaply with home (Skype, an Internet telephone service, is touted), what to look for in a travel partner and how to find a currency black market (“just walk down the street in all your Western-ness and it will find you”). Later chapters divide the world into regions, with travel costs and journey times for bus and ferry routes in Africa, various grades of Eurail passes, and visa and immunization requirements. Some tips are suspect (a list of recommended books for deciphering North American culture includes Capote’s “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”). But “First-Time Around the World” doesn’t overlook the basics. Pages are devoted to toilets, from the primitive squatter to the hi-tech Japanese (“more features than a scientific calculator and the comfort of a beanbag chair”), while a list of Web addresses at the back, for everything from online maps to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will very likely be well-thumbed before, during and after your trip. As impressive as the practical notes are the coolheaded judgments about achieving a global perspective. Mr. Lansky warns that the return home can be as shocking as anything experienced along the way. “It’s common to feel superior to those around you,” and one should resist “the continued need to ‘set them straight.’ ” The book spells out the benefits of volunteering and provides contact information for various organizations. Unless you spend weeks or months in another culture, the people you will most commonly meet — on what is supposed to be a cherished break from routine — are other travelers who have read this book.

354-> For the Midfield Maestro O'Brien, One Injury Led to Another
For most of the past four years, the muscles in John O'Brien's lower body have been as unbalanced as a checkbook. Or, more precisely, his body became a game of medical Mouse Trap, one biomechanical problem leading to another in a debilitating chain reaction. He started all five games in midfield for the United States at the 2002 World Cup, and was one of three Americans to play every minute of those matches. Then his body betrayed him, forcing one of the national team's most skillful players to relearn what once came naturally — how to run correctly, how to strike a ball properly and without pain. Lost was an international club career in the Netherlands with powerful Ajax, which O'Brien joined at age 16. Almost lost was a chance to play in the 2006 World Cup. Sore Achilles' tendons and muscular trauma in his lower back, hamstring and groin have left O'Brien able to play only intermittently. He has spent much of his time visiting doctors, fitness coaches, trainers, physical therapists and sports psychologists on a kind of scavenger hunt to relocate his health. "When you have a lot of injuries, sometimes you can get down and start fearing being injured as opposed to looking toward playing," O'Brien, 28, said last week at the United States national team's training camp in Cary, N.C. "That's something you've got to keep working at." When healthy, O'Brien possesses vital skills for creative passing, holding the ball, working out of tight spaces. So Bruce Arena, the manager of the national team, put O'Brien on his 23-man roster, hoping that he could work his way into playing shape by June 12, when the United States opens World Cup play in Germany against the Czech Republic. Three exhibitions — tonight against Morocco in Nashville; Friday against Venezuela in Cleveland; and Sunday against Latvia in Hartford — will mean nothing for the United States on the scoreboard but everything in gauging O'Brien's preparedness for the World Cup. "He's still not ready to play 90 minutes in a World Cup match," Arena said. But, with three more weeks of preparation available, Arena added that he was optimistic about O'Brien's chances. "Maybe he won't be in the same role as the last World Cup, but hopefully he's going to be able to play," Arena said. O'Brien's injuries are common in soccer, but the duration and repetitiveness of the injuries are not, trainers said. The running, cutting and kicking aspects of soccer tend to overdevelop the quadriceps muscles in the thigh that straighten the knee and provide a kicking motion, the hip flexor muscles that lift the knee and allow bending at the waist, and the gluteal muscles that form the buttocks. "The consequence of that is that muscles on the other side are getting weaker" or imbalanced, said Pierre Barrieu, the fitness coach for the national team. "If you look at soft tissue injuries in soccer, 99.5 percent of them are hamstring or groin." O'Brien's case remains a mystery. It is not known whether biomechanical problems led to his pain, or whether initial pain led to a change in biomechanics, said James Hashimoto, the trainer and physical therapist for the national team. "It's the chicken and egg," Hashimoto said. The injuries began two months after the 2002 World Cup, during which O'Brien scored a goal and collected an assist as the United States advanced to the quarterfinals. In September 2002, O'Brien injured an Achilles' tendon while playing with Ajax. He would never regain complete health. His body continued to break down, one muscle group trying to compensate for another and aching from overuse and repetitive stress. He played sparingly for Ajax and the national team in 2003 and 2004 as the hamstring problems persisted. In February 2005, O'Brien was given a free transfer to ADO Den Haag, a lesser Dutch club, but a strained groin muscle kept his career unraveling. His Dutch clubs grew impatient, and skeptical about his injuries, O'Brien said. "A lot of times, they said, 'Go train,' " he said. Sometimes, O'Brien admitted, he was in denial. At Christmas 2004, he began working in Los Angeles with trainers at Athletes' Performance, a fitness company that trains elite athletes, in part by evaluating and correcting movement patterns. O'Brien says that his attempt to compensate for Achilles' tendinitis led him to change his running style and that that overworked and stressed his hamstrings. He became too reliant on his calf muscles and hamstrings, instead of using his gluteal muscles to extend his hips when he ran, said Shad Forsythe, a trainer at Athletes' Performance. Video analysis determined that O'Brien's poor posture left him pawing or pulling at the ground instead of properly pushing off with each stride. The biomechanical flaw in his running style was corrected, O'Brien said, by getting his weight over the middle of his feet "as opposed to kind of sitting on my heels." But just after his hamstrings healed, O'Brien sustained a groin muscle injury last fall that led to his exit from ADO Den Haag and his signing this spring with Chivas USA of Major League Soccer. "It's been times where it's been discouraging," O'Brien said. "I had to have patience. I still believe I can play consistently." Last January, he began to work again with Athletes' Performance, trying to determine why striking a ball caused pain in his adductor, or groin muscle. His mechanics were sounder when O'Brien, a left-hander, kicked with his left leg, said Omi Iwasaki, a trainer with the fitness company. But when kicking with his right leg, O'Brien tended to slump and tilt his pelvis backward, leaving him too reliant on his kicking leg for power instead of generating a coordinated force through his trunk and hips, Iwasaki said. This placed excessive stress on O'Brien's groin, and like a golfer with an improper stroke, he began to scoop the ball instead of driving through it, Iwasaki said. The solution was to attach a bungee cord to O'Brien's waist and to tug at him when he kicked the ball. This exaggerated the backward tilt of his pelvis and forced him to rotate his pelvis forward or topple to the ground, Iwasaki said. "He would go the other way so he wouldn't fall over," Iwasaki said. Each morning, O'Brien spends a half hour in therapy with Hashimoto, the national team trainer, loosening his feet and ankles before he can practice. Each night, O'Brien has about another hour of deep-muscle therapy as Hashimoto kneads his body like dough, trying to alleviate the troublesome kinks in his legs, groin muscles and hips. Weight training and balance exercises are also incorporated into the therapy. No one expects O'Brien to be pain free at the World Cup. But just getting him on the field will be considered a victory. "I'll be proud of him because of his perseverance and patience," Hashimoto said. "When you go through something like this, you can say, 'This is too much, I'm done.' Other people will push through that."

359-> Knicks and Brown Resolve Contract Issue
The Knicks and their former coach Larry Brown have settled their contract dispute, the National Basketball Association announced last night. Under the settlement, none of the parties are allowed to provide the details of it or to comment on it. Commissioner David Stern, who served as the arbitrator in the dispute, announced the resolution. “Neither the club nor Larry have any future obligation to each other and have assured me, in response to my direction and request, that there will be no further public discussion of the matter,” Stern said in a statement released just after 11 p.m. A Knicks spokesman said the team would not comment. Brown was fired in June after leading the Knicks to a 23-59 record in his lone season with the team. The Knicks withheld the $41 million remaining on Brown’s contract, saying he had violated terms of the deal. The contract provided that Stern would arbitrate any dispute.

360-> A Rural Primer: First Fix Up the House, Then the Nearby Town
WHEN Mark Veeder, an events planner, bought a tumbledown 19th-century house in Sullivan County, N.Y., he wasn’t thinking of giving it the wow factor that he promises his clients. But he did just that, reviving not only a house marked for the wrecking ball but also a once-moribund town on the Delaware River. As a result of Mr. Veeder’s involvement, the town, Barryville, now has a chamber of commerce, an upscale grocery store, a farmers’ market, a young blacksmith and a future seemingly as rosy as the new planter boxes along the road through town. Mr. Veeder’s Manhattan company, EventQuest, arranges multimillion-dollar functions for clients like Mercedes-Benz and GQ. That work draws on the same talents he used in his upstate community. “I knew how to train people, although doing it in a store was something new to me,” he said. “And I knew how to do things like write a good proposal, which helped get a financial grant for the town.” How Mr. Veeder, 43, got involved in the revival of Barryville has as much to do with his background in event planning and his hyperkinetic drive — he rises at 6 every morning and always juggles numerous projects — as with meeting his partner, Michael Schroeder, also 43. In 2001, Mr. Veeder was coming out of a nine-year relationship and was quite happy spending his time renovating his house, which is near the town of Forestburgh, about 20 miles northeast of Barryville. Mr. Schroeder, a clinical psychologist from Manhattan who had a second home in Shohola, Pa., just across the river from Barryville, liked being single. But three months after the two met upstate, they were living together in Mr. Veeder’s SoHo loft. They kept both their country houses, however, and now spend the warmer months in Forestburgh, the cooler ones in Shohola. Driving from one house to the other, they saw a “For Sale” sign on a worn-out boardinghouse in Barryville, a town of about 1,000 on the Delaware River. The boardinghouse had seen better days. Both men had the same thought: Why not buy the eyesore and put something back into the community? “We wanted to create a throwback to the 50’s,” Mr. Veeder said, “when community in towns like this was important.” Soon after they bought the boardinghouse for $180,000 and began an 18-month renovation, Mr. Veeder was wearing other hats in Barryville, too. He began a local chamber of commerce, of which he is president, and with whose members he got various grants, including one for $30,000 from the Alan Gehry Foundation, to beautify the town. Along with banners and planter boxes came an information kiosk and tourist maps, and that was only in the first year. Mr. Veeder is loath to take credit for all the achievements and says it was a group effort. Once the boardinghouse, called the Spring House, was finished, they put in an antiques store, a bed-and-breakfast and several rental apartments. Situated at one end of town, it became a kind of beacon of change. “More people started buying up here after 9/11,” Mr. Veeder said, “so there was new life coming to the area. But after the Spring House opened, you could see things changing a lot and people getting more pride in the place.” Several weeks ago, an acquaintance of Mr. Veeder’s bought the Spring House, saying that he wanted to keep the same vision for the gracious building. In 2004, Mr. Veeder and Mr. Schroeder joined with a local couple, Scott and Jennifer VanTuyl, to buy the old general store, which was going out of business. They modeled its replacement, the River Market, after shops they had seen in Napa and Vermont. “It’s a bit of Dean & Deluca,” Mr. Veeder said, although the River Market stocks everything from basic groceries to fine items. The two New Yorkers are there most weekends, chatting with customers and staff and keeping an eye on things. They have also started stocking the shelves with their own brand of jams, rubs, scented candles and River Mud coffee beans. “It’s the anticonvenience store where everyone says hello,” said Mr. Veeder, almost forgetting how chaotic it was to start up. The four partners renovated and opened their doors only three weeks after completing the purchase. No one got any sleep for several days. “It was harder than any multimillion-dollar event I’ve done,” Mr. Veeder said, although in creating a place where people hang out, he has achieved his aim. “Now people come up to us and say, ‘Thank you for doing this.’ ” The River Market has become a kind of town hall and gathering place. To announce a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony last year, notices were tagged to shopping bags. More than a hundred people turned up for carol singing, cookies and hot chocolate. Mr. Veeder has given space downstairs to a young blacksmith, whose wares he will market and sell. This summer, a farmers market was added in front of the store, after Mr. Veeder arranged for the greenhouse at a nearby prison to provide seedlings to local farmers that they could grow to sell at the market. The revitalization of Barryville came close on the heels of Mr. Veeder’s renovation of his Forestburgh house, a gorgeous old two-story that was about to be torn down when he first saw it by accident in 1992. The three-bedroom house and seven acres of forest had stood unsold for five years, but it was everything Mr. Veeder wanted: a stone house, a pond, a barn, lots of garden and no neighbors. Unable to afford the $180,000 to buy the house he had his eye on because he had just started EventQuest with his business partner, John Schwartz, Mr. Veeder wrote the owner a detailed financial proposal on how he would pay for it, which the owner accepted. Mr. Veeder and his father did most of the extensive renovations, and he took hardly any time off to explore the countryside. Later, Mr. Schroeder not only got Mr. Veeder out exploring, but he also added his touches to the house, opening the interiors and painting the rooms in brighter colors. “I’m the master of the interior,” Mr. Schroeder said. “Mark is the master of the exterior.” MR. Veeder’s weekend metamorphosis into his country self — whether he’s working on Barryville or his house — shocks his friends. Locals upstate can’t picture him in Armani, and city colleagues can’t imagine him wielding a chainsaw or baking a pie. Mr. Veeder ascribes his ease with noncity pursuits to a childhood in the 4-H Club and growing up on a farm outside the Hudson Valley town of Athens, where he had to help with everything. “As a kid, I used to think, why do I have to go out and cut wood and milk the cows and fix lights when everyone else my age is having fun?” he said. “Little did I realize that it would give me all these abilities I’m using now.” If he is partial to any of these activities, it’s landscaping and gardening. He has help with lawn and garden maintenance, but he designs and plants all the gardens himself. When he walks around the property today, he points not to the large sections he has landscaped but to specific plants that he loves: a Chinese may apple, a variegated aralia, a golden metasequoia. Mr. Veeder makes them seem like little surprises in the greater landscape — a bit like Barryville. “People look at the overall,” he said, “but for me what’s special is the detail.”

361-> Critics Question the Effectiveness of New Jersey’s High School Drug Tests
New Jersey’s groundbreaking program to randomly test high school athletes for performance-enhancing drugs, implemented earlier this month, is already drawing criticism as being inefficient and ineffective in preventing steroid use. The program, adopted in June by the state’s Interscholastic Athletic Association, made New Jersey the first state to require such tests. Only public and private school athletes competing in state playoffs, including players in this fall’s football playoffs, are subject to the tests. During this school year, about 500, or .002 percent, of the state’s 240,000 high school athletes are expected to be tested. Critics say that is too small a number to create a deterrent, and some suggest that the money spent on the program could be better used to educate more students about drugs and their risks. The American Academy of Pediatrics has said that such programs are impractical at the high school level because the high cost of testing limits the number of students who can be tested. Dr. Jorge Gomez, the author of the academy’s position paper on the use of performance-enhancing drugs, said, “By testing a small number of athletes they have the lottery mentality and students think: ‘It is likely I am not going to be tested.’ ” Eric Small, the chairman of the academy’s Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness, said that there was little evidence that testing prevents teenage athletes from taking drugs. “It is a Band-Aid approach,” Small said. “It is a secondary approach. Educational programming starting in fifth or sixth grade, teaching about steroids at a younger age, would be much more cost-effective.” The New Jersey program is modeled on the one used by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which tests for steroids but also things like high levels of caffeine. The state’s program  like programs used by the National Football League and Major League Baseball  does not test for human growth hormone because there is no reliable test for it. In New Jersey, 60 percent of the tests are targeting athletes participating in football, wrestling, track and field, swimming, lacrosse and baseball, said Bob Baly, the assistant director of the state athletic association, who is overseeing the program. Baly said that, so far, about 150 tests have been conducted on athletes playing football, field hockey and soccer. No test results will be made public, but at the end of the school year, the testing statistics will be released, Baly said. A student who fails a test would be suspended from competition for a year and would undergo counseling before returning to a team. The Interscholastic Athletic Association received $50,000 from the state for testing, but no money for education about drugs. The testing program is expected to cost $100,000 this year, with the athletic association making up the shortfall, Baly said. Each test costs $175. Baly defended the test’s usefulness. “I don’t think anybody believes testing alone is going to stop youngsters from taking steroids,” he said. “But if it stops 2 to 3 percent from taking steroids, then it has been effective.” Baly estimated that about 12,000 high school athletes in New Jersey were using drugs. He served on a task force established in 2005 by Richard Codey, the acting governor at the time, that examined the use of performance-enhancing drugs by high school students. Baly said the task force found overwhelming anecdotal evidence that students knew how to acquire such drugs on the Internet and at local gyms. Baly said that while educational programs were being implemented in middle schools and for coaches and parents, no additional money had been set aside to pay for them. “We are hoping that this will get people to pay attention and that the testing will act as a deterrent,” Baly said. At Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, N.J., a school that regularly makes the state’s football playoffs, the school’s athletic director, Frank Rezzonico, said that he had not heard of students at his school or any other taking performance-enhancing drugs. Regardless, Rezzonico said that testing is a good idea. He acknowledged it would take several years to develop a comprehensive program. “I am sure there will be some bumps in the road,” Rezzonico said. “It is a start, but they had to start somewhere. It is a step in the right direction, and I think other states will follow.”

362-> Going Down Under to Save a Sacred Baby Elephant
“The Protector” concerns a transsexual dragon lady (Jin Xing) who absconds to Australia with a sacred baby elephant from Thailand, and the efforts of Kham (Tony Jaa), a provincial guardian, to bust skulls and get it back. This is achieved through flabbergasting deployments of Muay Thai, a martial arts discipline in which force is concentrated in the torso and released through the knees, elbows and shoulders. The effect is scrappier than the traditional kung-fu movie moves, with their balletic flurry of the extremities, but the proletarian righteousness is pure classicism. Ditto the “whu-pssht!” thwack for each body blow. Directed by Prachya Pinkaew from a screenplay reducible to a single exclamation (“You stole my elephant!”), “The Protector” supersizes the formula of “Ong Bak,” his previous film starring Mr. Jaa’s muscles. The grimy street vibe of that picture, in which our hero went muy Muay Thai on the folks who desecrated his village temple, has been cleaned up by the producers, who have budgeted for elephants, explosions, speedboats, helicopters, high-end Jacuzzis, C.G.I. interludes and extreme sports montages. The American distributor has added its own polish by partially dubbing the dialogue into English and slapping one of the most meaningless phrases in the language — “Presented by Quentin Tarantino” — above the credits. This tinkering inadvertently fortifies the theme of third-world exploitation but does little to distract from the pleasure of watching Mr. Jaa hurl himself willy nilly at an onslaught of randomly generated foes (the swordsman, the Capoeira dude, the bodybuilder, the in-line skater wielding a fluorescent light bulb). Directed by Prachya Pinkaew; written (in Thai, with English subtitles) by Napalee, Piyaros Thongdee, Joe Wannapin and Kongdej Jaturanrasmee, based on a story by Mr. Pinkaew; director of photography, Nuttawut Kittikun; music by the RZA; production designer, Akadech Kaewkot; martial arts choreographers, Tony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai; produced by Mr. Pinkaew and Sukanya Vongsthapat; released by the Weinstein Company. Running time: 84 minutes. WITH: Tony Jaa (Kham), Phetthai Wongkhamlao (Mark), Bongkod Kongmalai (Pla), Jin Xing (Madame Rose), Nathan B. Jones (T K) and JohnnyTri Nguyen (Johnny).

364-> Can It Happen Here?
In November 2005, Fritz Stern received an award for his life’s work on Germans, Jews and the roots of National Socialism, presented to him by Joschka Fischer, then the German foreign minister. With a frankness that startled some in the audience, Stern, an emeritus professor of European history at Columbia University, peppered his acceptance speech with the similarities he saw between the path taken by Germany in the years leading up to Hitler and the path being taken by the United States today. He talked about a group of 1920’s intellectuals known as the “conservative revolutionaries,” who “denounced liberalism as the greatest, most invidious threat, and attacked it for its tolerance, rationality and cosmopolitan culture,” and about how Hitler had used religion to appeal to the German public. In Hitler’s first radio address after becoming chancellor, Stern noted, he declared that the Nazis regarded “Christianity as the foundation of our national morality and the family as the basis of national life.” Stern was of course not suggesting an equivalence between President Bush and Hitler but rather making a more subtle critique, extending his idea that contemporary American politics exhibited “something like the strident militancy and political ineptitude of the Kaiser’s pre-1914 imperial Germany.” At 80, Stern has just published a sprawling memoir, “Five Germanys I Have Known,” and as with that speech, he does not file away his experiences of Nazism in a geographical or temporal box. The opening chapter, set in an “ancestral Germany” — before Stern was born, in 1926 — is the book’s greatest pleasure, offering a glimpse into an educated Jewish milieu of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is so richly detailed that it reminds one of the early works of Thomas Mann, or of Stefan Zweig’s portrait of the same period in Austria, “The World of Yesterday.” Stern was from Breslau, a Prussian industrial city, and was raised in a medical family; his four great-grandfathers, two grandfathers and father were all physicians. His paternal grandparents had converted to Christianity in the 1890’s, and his mother’s Jewish parents had her baptized — though this would mean nothing to the Nazis. Paragons of a society that worshiped achievement and knowledge, the family happily understood their lives to follow what Tolstoy called “the work cure.” Yet they read widely in all other fields and insisted that art, poetry and the classics be a daily part of life. (In the hours before he died, years later, Stern’s father would quote lines of Homer to him in Greek.) The full nightmare of the Third Reich still lay around a historical corner, and much of what distinguishes the Nazi chapters of Stern’s memoir is the way the horror arrives slowly, strangely, in jarring images appearing along the edges of a civilized upper-middle-class life. After 1933, Stern’s math teacher gives the class word problems like: “If three Jews robbed a bank, and each got a part of the loot proportionate to their ages ... how much would each get?” Stern learns about his own Jewish background only when he uses an anti-Semitic epithet against his sister and is set straight. In the mid-1930’s, the Sterns take one of their regular drives to the mountains, now punctuated by anti-Semitic slogans on signs by the side of the road. (“Trust not the fox on the green heath, and not the Jew when he gives his oath,” Stern recalls, marveling that this catchy bit of cultural poison sticks in his mind 70 years later.) On the way home that night, they get into a fender bender and end up in a ditch. The driver of the car they hit happens to be an SS officer, out of uniform, but everything turns out all right: Stern’s father and the officer exchange insurance papers and the incident is settled by lawyers. (Stern points out that his father was in fact at fault, having driven on the wrong side of the road.) After various trips abroad to test the waters of emigration, the Sterns finally decide to escape the country in 1938. When Stern’s father goes to the local Gestapo office to get his traveling papers in order, a nail-biting afternoon passes without incident — much like the collision with the SS officer’s car. Safely in America, young Fritz savors the simple joy of asking a policeman directions: “Only weeks before, a man in uniform had been a figure of dread to me, but this New York cop, grasping my linguistic disability, answered me helpfully in fragments of Yiddish and German.” The Stern family is lucky. Even when their cousin Otto is arrested during the Kristallnacht pogrom, which occurs just a month after Fritz and his parents get out, and Otto’s “Aryan” wife leaves him, he manages to emigrate to the United States ... where he invents the plant fertilizer Miracle-Gro and becomes a millionaire. From here on the memoir shifts into the more familiar landscape of postwar American academic life. Stern’s career, however, will always be filled with noteworthy encounters. On his first day at Columbia, waiting in the registration line, he befriends the boy standing in front of him, Allen Ginsberg; in 1944 the future scholar and the future beat poet become the co-chairmen of a “Roosevelt for President” club. When Stern needs to pick a college major, he tags along with his mother, who is interviewing Albert Einstein at Princeton, and he asks Einstein whether he should pursue medicine or history. The discoverer of relativity does not hesitate: become a doctor. Ignoring Einstein’s advice, Stern studies European history and literature under Jacques Barzun and Lionel Trilling, and he begins to sense his mission as a historian. Outraged by the facile interpretations of Nazism floating around in the 1950’s — “all the tomes and slogans about Germany’s inevitable path ‘from Luther to Hitler’ ” — he charts his own, more subtle interpretation of what caused the Third Reich. Over the years Stern protests the ways radicals abuse the memory of Nazism to support their present-day political agendas, whether the 1960’s students who called authority figures fascists and Nazis, or those today who compare foreign leaders they dislike to Hitler and cry “Munich” at every diplomatic gesture. Yet the value of Stern’s work is precisely that it has refused to keep Nazism safely on the other side of a historical and geographic chasm. His first book, “The Politics of Cultural Despair” (1961), is one of the durable masterpieces of 20th-century history because it seems to locate the roots of a peculiarly modern malaise. As he explained in a later edition of the work, “I attempted to show the importance of this new type of cultural malcontent, and to show how he facilitated the intrusion into politics of essentially unpolitical grievances.” Rather than looking for obvious parallels among contemporary dictators who ape the style of the Nazis, Stern looks for the nihilistic undercurrents in our own educated, commercial societies. Hunger and poverty have little to do with the politics of cultural despair. It thrives especially well at moments of plenty and prosperity, when people have enough social advantages to dwell on their inner alienations and resentments. By probing history for answers to how Germany progressed from radical illiberalism to Nazism, Stern has created a cumulative canon of warning signs for the degeneration of any great nation’s politics. The more personal history in this book adds power to an argument that has been a lifetime in the making.

366-> Arrest of Second Major Online Gambling Figure Is a First for State Officials
In a broadening of the American attack on Internet gambling, law enforcement agents in New York late Wednesday night arrested the chairman of Sportingbet, which offers online sports betting and is traded on the London Stock Exchange. Agents of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey arrested Peter Dicks upon his arrival at Kennedy Airport, acting on a warrant issued by the state police in Louisiana. The arrest comes seven weeks after federal law enforcement officials arrested the chief executive of a competing Internet sports book, BetOnSports, while he was on layover at an airport in Dallas. That executive, David Carruthers, and his company, which also trades in London, were charged with taking bets illegally over the Internet. The latest arrest was the first time that officials at the state level had adopted similar tactics and pursued charges against a director of a publicly held Internet gambling company. According to the Louisiana State Police, Mr. Dicks, 64, was arrested in connection with an investigation that began in January into the activities of online casinos. The police said other warrants were outstanding but declined to elaborate. George Hudson, a spokesman for Sportingbet, declined to comment about the arrest, saying the company was awaiting further information. Sportingbet halted trading in its stock soon after learning of the arrest. After the arrest of Mr. Carruthers, legal experts and industry analysts and executives said they presumed that the American law enforcement effort was aimed at one company, BetOnSports. “We thought this was company-specific; now we know it’s broader than that,” said Sue Schneider, the publisher of Interactive Gaming News, an online magazine focusing on the Internet casino industry. Ms. Schneider, echoing the sentiments of other industry analysts, had said the one obvious lesson after the arrest of Mr. Carruthers was that executives of online casinos should not visit the United States and risk arrest. She and other analysts and legal experts said it was puzzling that Mr. Dicks had visited anyway. “It’s absolutely amazing,” said I. Nelson Rose, a professor and Internet gambling law expert at Whittier Law School in Costa Mesa, Calif. “Apparently he convinced himself this all involved Carruthers and BetOnSports.” News of the arrest sent shares of other Internet casinos tumbling in London, with shares in one major company, PartyGaming, falling 9.8 percent. Lawrence Walters, a Florida lawyer who focuses on gambling law, said there was good reason for investor concern, given that the arrest of Mr. Dicks indicates online casinos now need to be concerned about problems at the state level. Gambling law experts say federal law makes it fairly clear that operating Internet sports books is a crime. But they say the law is much less clear on the issue of other Internet games, like poker and blackjack. By contrast, Mr. Walters said, at least a handful of states explicitly criminalize poker and table games offered over the Internet. Offshore Internet casinos that had believed they could avoid scrutiny from the states might now have to rethink their positions. “There’s been a widespread assumption that the sites only needed to worry about federal law,” said Mr. Walters, who has represented some of the offshore casinos. “Now there’s a new level of concern that the previous comfort zone may be breached.” At the same time, Mr. Walters said he did not believe that states had the jurisdiction to regulate Internet gambling, which involves transactions that cross state and national borders. The policies of the federal government and some states are, broadly speaking, at odds with the rules governing online betting parlors in many countries, like Costa Rica and Antigua, where casinos have their operations. They also put law enforcement in conflict with millions of Americans who place bets online, using their home computers to wager on sporting events and games like blackjack and poker. Sportingbet, one of the largest online gambling operators in the world, had revenue of £103 million, or $193 million, for the year ended in July, with two-thirds of that coming from the United States, said Mr. Hudson, the company spokesman. Mr. Hudson said Mr. Dicks was a father of four who built a career investing in technology companies in the United States and Britain. Mr. Dicks joined Sportingbet as nonexecutive chairman in January 2000. “He’s not a swashbuckler like some of those other online betting types,” Mr. Hudson said. Law enforcement officials in New York said they expected Mr. Dicks to be extradited to Louisiana. Mr. Carruthers, who was dismissed as chief executive of BetOnSports, is under indictment by the attorney general for the Eastern District of Missouri. Some industry analysts said they believed Internet casinos would weather the latest attacks. “Online gaming will not end unless they prosecute every one of the 50 million Americans who bet online every year,” said Andrew P. Lee, a London-based online gaming analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort. “But from an investor’s perspective, this becomes a very difficult sector to invest in.”

367-> Mexico: Shooting Shakes Presidential Race
An armored car carrying a woman who had threatened to release videotapes said to show aides of the former Mexico City mayor and presidential candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador taking bribes was fired on by gunmen, the authorities said. Three of her children were also in the car, but no one was injured. Coming on the day of the last presidential debate, the attack set off a storm of speculation about who was behind it and how it might influence the race. The woman, Celia Gurza, is the wife of Carlos Ahumada, who is in prison on charges that he paid bribes to Mexico City officials. In 2004, he released a videotape that appeared to show a close ally of Mr. López Obrador accepting a bribe. From prison this week, he said his wife would release tapes to reporters showing other bribe-taking, but after yesterday's gun attack, she canceled her news conference.

368-> World Business Briefing | Australia: Economic Growth Slowed in Quarter
Australia's economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the second quarter as higher interest rates and record fuel prices curbed consumer spending. The gross domestic product rose 0.3 percent from the first quarter, the Bureau of Statistics said. Consumer spending slowed, rising 0.6 percent in the second quarter after increasing 0.9 percent in the first quarter, the report showed. A drop in inventories subtracted 0.7 percentage point from growth in the quarter, and net exports subtracted 0.2 percentage point from growth. First-quarter growth was revised lower to 0.7 percent from 0.9 percent. Also, the Reserve Bank of Australia left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 6 percent.

373-> Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri
SLAMMED doors and passionate reunions were part of the daily existence of Shana Goldberg-Meehan and Scott Silveri — but only at work. The couple, both writers and executive producers of “Friends,” the former NBC comedy, have had a stable, exclusive relationship since their first college date, 13 years ago. But in all that time they had not gotten around to marrying, or even moving in together, owing in part to the “70- to 80-hour weeks” they were putting in, Mr. Silveri, 34, explained. “It’s nice to sometimes have separate homes to return to.” Ms. Goldberg-Meehan, now 33, was also content with the status quo. “I come from an unconventional family,” she said, explaining that her parents, Diana Meehan and Gary David Goldberg, eschewed marriage for many years. “They’re former hippies. They eloped when I was 17 and told me after the fact.” Her father eventually became the creator and executive producer of television comedies like “Spin City,” “Brooklyn Bridge” and “Family Ties,” the latter being a semi-autobiographical series about aging flower children raising a family. His daughter’s living arrangement and marital status were not important to him, Mr. Goldberg said. “I was just so happy that they were in a committed, loving relationship.” Her mother, a founder of the Archer School for Girls in Los Angeles, was equally supportive. “The only thing I don’t understand is why they didn’t have kids yet,” she said with a laugh. “But Shana’s more old-fashioned than I am.” Ms. Goldberg-Meehan and Mr. Silveri met in 1992 while writing for the Harvard Lampoon. Like the fictional Monica and Chandler, “We were friends first,” Mr. Silveri said. While they play down comparisons with the characters on “Friends,” he conceded that “there are similarities — a guy who tells too many jokes with an improbably pretty girl.” After graduating, they found themselves in Arlington, Vt., at the vacation home of Ms. Goldberg-Meehan’s parents. “I was thinking of going into publishing,” Ms. Goldberg-Meehan remembered, “and Scott was waiting to hear about a job from ‘Saturday Night Live.’ He’s still waiting.” In Vermont they decided to test their collaborative writing skills, devoting a week to developing a television comedy script together. Laughter became a bond that drew them closer and propelled them forward. They ended up staying for six months and left with two sample scripts that they used to land jobs in 1995 as staff writers on “Mad About You.” They moved on to “Friends” the next year, but their own lack of dating experience proved to be a handicap when pitching ideas in the writers’ room. “There were two dating stories a week on that show,” Mr. Silveri said, so they would often have to borrow from friends. “I would never steal a joke, but I’d steal a story in a heartbeat.” Focused on their careers, neither wanted to tinker with a relationship that worked on many levels. “Part of you doesn’t want to jinx it,” Mr. Silveri said. Ms. Goldberg-Meehan admitted to a deeper conflict: “It was hard for both of us to believe we found the person we were meant to be with at 19.” By the time “Friends” ended in 2004, they had been hired as the creators and executive producers of “Joey,” a spinoff. But when Ms. Goldberg-Sheehan left the show after the first season and Mr. Silveri stayed on, working 12- to 18-hour days, their relationship shifted to unfamiliar territory. “It was the first year since college we were just boyfriend and girlfriend again,” Mr. Silveri said. “I got to miss her for the first time, and I think she missed me, too.” On bad days she would make a drink for him and sometimes have his slippers out. “It was very Dick Van Dyke,” Mr. Silveri said. Suddenly marriage seemed like a very natural idea. He picked out a ring, aided by his father, Greg Silveri, a jewelry executive in Queens, and presented it last December in a surprise proposal in Napa, Calif. They decided on marrying at the Vermont farmhouse, where their collaboration began. While discussing seating arrangements for the reception, Mr. Silveri recalled asking his fiancée: “ ‘Why don’t we do one table for each year we’ve been together?’ And she got so emotional and said: ‘That’s the sweetest idea. I can’t believe no one’s ever done that before.’ ” He shot back: “ ‘That’s because no one’s waited 13 years.’ ” The couple’s Oct. 7 ceremony took place beneath a birch wedding canopy on a rolling lawn. As their 165 guests looked out onto the orange freckled foothills, the Rev. John J. Tuite, a pastor of Rose Ministries praised the clear-blue autumn day and performed a ceremony that included Jewish and Catholic traditions. After exchanging vows, the couple shared a glass of 1972 Château Lafite-Rothschild from a bottle that had been set aside at Mr. Silveri’s birth by his maternal grandfather to be opened on the day of his grandson’s wedding. Taking a sip, Ms. Goldberg-Meehan blurted “Pfew!” as she nearly spit out what was now more vinegar than wine. Mr. Silveri, who never misses a setup for a punch line, asked his bride, “Did we wait too long to get married?”

375-> Racial Component Is Found in Lethal Breast Cancer
Young black women with breast cancer are more prone than whites or older blacks to develop a type of tumor with genetic traits that make it especially deadly and hard to treat, a study has found. Among premenopausal black women with breast cancer, 39 percent had the more dangerous kind, called a "basal like" subtype, compared with only 14 percent of older black women and 16 percent of nonblack women of any age. Researchers are not sure why. The study, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to measure how common the different genetic subtypes of breast tumors are in American women, and to sort the subtypes by race. The authors said more research was needed to test their conclusions. The finding has no immediate effect on treatment, because there is no treatment that specifically concentrates on basal-like cancer. But scientists are trying to create drugs that will zero in on it. The study helps explain something that was already known: although breast cancer is less common in blacks than whites, when black women do develop the disease, they are more likely to die from it, especially if they are under 50. Among those younger women, the breast cancer death rate in blacks is 11 per 100,000, compared with only 6.3 in whites. The new data about tumor types is not the whole story, researchers say, because some of the disparity may also result from a lack of access to health care among blacks or differences in nutrition, personal habits or environmental exposures. The genetic discovery is "somewhat alarming," but also a "good thing," because it exposes details about the cancer that should help doctors identify specific drugs to fight it, said the study's main author, Dr. Lisa A. Carey, the medical director of the University of North Carolina-Lineberger breast center. Several research groups including her own have already begun testing new drugs against this type of breast cancer, Dr. Carey said. The work involves finding drugs to block specific molecules that these tumors need to grow. If the trials succeed, new treatments could be available within a few years, perhaps even as soon as a year from now, she predicted. These tumors are identified not by looking through a microscope, but by special tests that measure patterns of genetic activity. "Things that to my eye and a pathologist's eye look similar turn out to be biologically very different," Dr. Carey said, adding that the tests were now strictly a research tool and were not done routinely in women with breast cancer. Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York who was not part of the study, said the research was extremely well done and important. He said there was preliminary evidence from other studies that basal-like tumors were the most common kind found in Africa, and that understanding what caused them could help point the way toward better treatments and methods of prevention. Dr. Olufunmilayo Olopade, director of the center for clinical cancer genetics at the University of Chicago, said she had found high rates of basal-like tumors in young women in Nigeria and Senegal, most of whom died. In many, the disease ran in their families. The work has not yet been published, but Dr. Olopade said the message to black women, and to women of all races, was that if their mothers, sisters or daughters developed breast cancer at an early age, they needed to start screening for it well before age 40, to seek genetic counseling and to consider preventive drugs and perhaps preventive surgery if they proved to be at high risk. Basal-like tumors tend to grow fast and spread quickly, and they are more likely than other types to be fatal. They are not fed by the hormone estrogen, and so cannot be treated or prevented with estrogen-blocking drugs like tamoxifen or raloxifene. Herceptin, another breast cancer drug, is also useless against these tumors. The tumors are not stimulated by the hormone progesterone, either. For that reason, cancer specialists call them "triple negative." Standard chemotherapy does help, and women with basal-like tumors benefit more from it than women with other breast cancers. But even with treatment, those with basal-like tumors are less likely to survive. Women with mutations in a gene called Brca1 tend to develop this kind of aggressive breast tumor. In the past, researchers thought Brca1 mutations did not occur in black women, but Dr. Olopade dismissed that notion as a myth, saying the mutations were found just as often in black women as in other populations. She and Dr. Carey said other mutations, not yet discovered, might also predispose black women to the basal-like tumors. Dr. Carey's research was based on stored tissue samples from 496 women who had breast cancer diagnoses from 1993 to 1996 and who were included in a project called the Carolina Breast Cancer Study. Their average age was 50, and 40 percent identified their race as African-American. The researchers used new techniques of molecular biology to find patterns of gene activity in the cancer cells, to classify the tumors accordingly and then to sort the genetic subtypes by race, menopausal status, other tumor traits and survival. "The same technology that identified the subtypes also tells us about the biology of the subtypes," Dr. Carey said. "Once you know what makes it tick, you can figure out how to stop the ticking. It's opened up a window on it." The goal is to find particular molecules in a cell that drive proliferation or tumor survival, and to block them. "If it looks like a particular cancer cell is dependent on a certain pathway to live or grow, and if you can shut it down preferentially in that cancer cell, you can stop it," Dr. Carey said. Newer cancer drugs like herceptin and Gleevec, which is used for certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors, work in this so-called targeted fashion, and so does Tykerb, a new breast cancer drug described last weekend at a meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology. For certain cancers, targeted treatments are far more effective than standard chemotherapy, more of a buckshot approach. Breast cancer experts hope to find better treatments than chemotherapy for many types of the cancer, and Dr. Carey said, "That's the challenge, getting away from chemo for this subtype." The next step in the research is to look for risk factors for the basal-like subtype, in hopes of finding ways to prevent it, she said. "There's a lot of smart people working very hard on this," Dr. Carey said. "I'm very optimistic."

377-> Newspaper Circulation Falls Sharply
The circulation of the nation's daily newspapers plunged during the latest reporting period in one of the sharpest declines in recent history, according to data released yesterday. The slide continues a decades-long trend and adds to the woes of a mature industry already struggling with layoffs and facing the potential sale of some of its flagships. Over all, average daily circulation dropped by 2.8 percent during the six-month period ended Sept. 30, compared with the period last year, according to an industry analysis of data released by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Circulation for Sunday papers fell by 3.4 percent. The figures appear to be the steepest in any comparable six-month period in at least 15 years. They come after the sale of the Knight Ridder newspapers this year and in the midst of a possible sale of the Tribune Company, whose assets include 11 newspapers. The circulation losses also follow recent sour earnings reports, raising questions about why anyone would want to buy a newspaper now. The losses have accelerated as the industry tries to adjust to the steady migration of readers and advertisers to the Internet. Papers in major metropolitan areas, where more homes are wired for broadband, fared worse than those in smaller markets. Newspaper executives also attribute some of the decline to deliberate strategies to eliminate so-called bulk sales to third-party sponsors that offer papers free in places like hotels. Advertisers view them as having little value because the readers getting them did not pay for them. The Los Angeles Times lost 8 percent of its daily circulation and 6 percent on Sunday. The Boston Globe, owned by The New York Times Company, lost 6.7 percent of its daily circulation and almost 10 percent on Sunday. The New York Times, one of the few big papers where circulation had held steady over the last few reporting periods, lost about 3.5 percent of its circulation both daily and Sunday. The Washington Post's declines were nearly the same. The Wall Street Journal's daily paper fell by less than 2 percent but its Weekend Edition, which comes out on Saturday, reported a 6.7 percent drop. As of Sept. 30, total circulation for the nation's dailies had dropped to 43.7 million. Daily circulation peaked in 1984, at 63.3 million. Nonetheless, three billionaires in Los Angeles have said they are interested in buying The Los Angeles Times, which is owned by Tribune. John F. Welch Jr., the former chief executive of General Electric, has mused about buying The Globe, although The New York Times Company has said it is not for sale. And others have expressed interest in papers elsewhere. Prospective buyers are interested, in part, because despite their problems, newspapers generally still turn a profit and remain attractive to advertisers who want to reach a mass audience. Many papers have higher profit margins than the average Fortune 500 company. Moreover, many companies see promise in their online publications, which are drawing an increasing number of readers each year. At The New York Times, for example, the number of people who read the paper online now surpasses the number who buy the print edition. The newspaper association said that for the third quarter of this year, 57 million people visited a newspaper Web site, an increase of 24 percent over the period a year ago. And revenues from online advertisers are growing. "The fundamentals say to me that there is a future for a well-run newspaper," said Conrad C. Fink, who teaches newspaper management at the University of Georgia. "But short range, it looks dismal and nobody knows exactly what to do about it." One immediate problem is that although online revenues are growing, they still make up only a small portion of the overall newspaper revenues. And it could take at least two decades for online revenues to equal half of current revenues, Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, wrote last week. Still, there is the vanity aspect of owning a newspaper. "If you're Jack Welch, you've already made a ton of dough," Mr. Fink said. "You want to buy The Boston Globe because you want a voice at the top." He also said there was an "element of altruism" by some people, "who believe they can buy these papers and return them to their local roots." But he pointed to the recent acquisition of The Inquirer and The Daily News in Philadelphia by Brian P. Tierney, a local advertising executive, as an example that was "not all that impressive." The Inquirer lost 7.6 percent of its daily circulation and 4.5 percent on Sunday, according to the new data. Some of the papers owned by McClatchy, which acquired Knight Ridder, also lost circulation in this period: The Star-Tribune in Minneapolis was down more than 4 percent daily and The Sacramento Bee was down more than 5 percent daily. Nonetheless, Elaine Lintecum, treasurer of McClatchy, said the company was optimistic. McClatchy's online sites now account for 8 percent of the company's revenue, Ms. Lintecum said. "It's a small portion, but it's growing more in importance each year," she said. "As that transition is taking place, we have to look at our total audience" online and in print. She also said that like many other publishers, McClatchy was in the process of cutting back on third-party sales, "and until that's weaned out, the circulation numbers won't look so good." One of the few increases in circulation was scored by The New York Post, which eked past its main rival, The Daily News, by about 10,000 copies and trumpeted the news on a giant billboard in Times Square.

BETHELL--Sr. Annunciata, O.S.U., 90. The President and Board of Trustees of Montefiore Medical Center and the entire Montefiore community are deeply saddened by the death of longtime Board member, Montefiore volunteer and community spirit and activist for the young and the elderly, Sr. Annunciata Bethell, O.S.U. A lifelong resident of the Bronx, Sr. Annunciata spent decades teaching the borough's young, and then, spent over forty years as a tireless advocate for the senior citizens of the Bronx. Clergywoman and social worker, Sr. Annunciata began her association with Montefiore as a member of the Moses Division Community Advisory Board, becoming a constant presence in the Emergency Department and on the inpatient units, always checking on the care being given to "her" seniors, becoming a confidante and close friend to many. In 1980, she was asked to join the Board of Trustees where she remained until her passing this weekend. Sr. Annunciata never wavered in her devotion to her community, and her seniors.

387-> Paterno Has Broken Bone; Wants to Coach
Penn State Coach Joe Paterno is expected to coach this Saturday’s home game against Temple, but will decide in the next few days whether he will have surgery on the top left shin bone that he fractured during Saturday’s 13-3 loss at Wisconsin, the assistant athletic director Jeff Nelson said yesterday. Paterno, who will turn 80 next month, also sustained ligament damage in his left knee when the Nittany Lions freshman tight end Andrew Quarless crashed into him on the sideline in the third quarter. He later left the game and the defensive coordinator Tom Bradley filled in. A statue of Paterno outside Beaver Stadium had a bandage wrapped around its left leg yesterday and bore a yellow handwritten sign, “Get well soon!!” Nelson said it had not been determined if Paterno would coach from the sideline or the press box. Wayne Sebastianelli, Penn State’s director of athletic medicine, who examined the injuries, declined additional comment on his condition last night. After the game Saturday, Bradley was upbeat about Paterno. “He’s a wiry old rascal,” he told reporters. “He’s not going anywhere; he’s pretty tough.”

389-> The San Fernando Valley? Hip? Like, Totally!
THE San Fernando Valley has always gotten a bad rap. For years, it has been associated with two dubious cultural phenomena: Valley Girls and pornography. But just as the city of Los Angeles has undergone a process of rediscovery in long-neglected regions like the downtown area, so this suburban outpost across the Santa Monica mountains has also experienced an image makeover. “A lot of people move from West Hollywood to the Valley when they have kids,” said Mark Frauenfelder, a Valley resident who co-founded the Web site www.boingboing.net. “They still want to go out at night, but they want to stay closer to home, instead of driving over the hill and wasting a half hour of precious babysitter time.” The velvet rope has come to the Valley in a big way, especially on Ventura Boulevard, around the Studio City-Sherman Oaks corridor, where bar-hopping on foot is possible. With its Plexiglas barstools and padded white leather walls, Clear (11916 Ventura Boulevard, 818-980-4811) is the Valley’s take on sleek Euro-chic. A rotating cast of D.J.’s spin dance music Tuesday through Sunday, but Saturday is when you might see some single men ogling micro-skirted passers-by, their sunglasses hiding their furtive glances. A few feet away from Clear is Sapphire (11938 Ventura Boulevard, 818-506-0777), a bar with a clubby, English drawing-room atmosphere — brown leather banquettes, tan wood paneling, low light from table lamps. Sapphire, whose owners also run Daddy’s, an equally dim establishment in Hollywood, was once a well-kept secret. But it’s now a wildly popular after-dinner destination, with the line snaking down Ventura Boulevard on Saturday nights. Best to get there when the bar opens at 7 every night and stake your claim to a seat early. A short walk east on Ventura Boulevard from Sapphire on a weekend night will land you at an unmarked building with a bouncer in front. This would be Firefly (11720 Ventura Boulevard, 818-762-1833), a restaurant that shares Sapphire’s fusty Anglo décor but also serves entrees like foil-wrapped monkfish ($24) and roasted Muscovy duck breast ($26) in an airy outdoor seating area. The objective for many here is to hang out at the bar first and then pick someone up before dessert arrives. Several other fine restaurants have opened in recent years. La Loggia, the Studio City Italian restaurant, has opened Next Door Tapas Bar (11814 Ventura Boulevard, 818-985-9222), an intimate space with an extensive Spanish wine list and tantalizing items like lamb stew with couscous ($8) and steak fries with aioli dipping sauce ($4). For heartier fare, there’s the Boneyard Bistro (13539 Ventura Boulevard, 818-906-7427), a barbecue joint that doesn’t scrimp on big slabs of red meat, but also throws in a few curve balls, such as deep-fried macaroni and cheese ($6 for a large portion) and smoked-duck spring rolls ($11). The Valley is getting downright cosmopolitan, but it’s unlikely the region will ever completely morph into a hip haven. You can still hit the great Dupars coffee shop (12036 Ventura Boulevard, 818-766-4437) for the best pancakes in town, while old-school waitresses feed your caffeine fix and call you “darlin” as they slip you the check. It seems as if urbanity will always rub up against the quaint here.

398-> Green Onions Identified as Source of E. Coli Cases
After Taco Bell traced a growing E. coli outbreak to green onions at its restaurants yesterday morning, government investigators began an intensive search to identify the source of the contamination. The total number of cases in three Northeastern states swelled to 99, implicating several additional restaurants and a second food distributor, who said the onions came from a California farm. Taco Bell officials said early yesterday that their preliminary tests had traced the E. coli to three samples of green onions, which the restaurant chain sprinkles on many of its menu items. In what the company president, Greg Creed, called “an abundance of caution,” Taco Bell removed green onions from its 5,800 outlets across the United States. A Suffolk County laboratory later confirmed E. coli in three of four green onions taken from a previously unopened package at one of the restaurants, “suggesting that it was already contaminated before it arrived,” said Suffolk’s acting health commissioner, Dr. David G. Graham. County officials retrieved the green onions from a Taco Bell in Deer Park after the franchise identified them as the probable cause of the outbreak. New cases were reported yesterday in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. In New York, the number of sick people on Long Island nearly doubled to 41, while the outbreak spread to far-flung counties upstate, where several new cases were reported. The Taco Bell franchises in upstate New York get their food from a distribution center in Albany, not the huge warehouse in Burlington, N.J., that serves the Taco Bell outlets first tied to the outbreak. Three new cases were reported in New Jersey, for a total of 43 under investigation. The new cases included that of a 43-year-old North Plainfield man who ate at a Taco Bell on Dec. 2, far later than most of the other victims, who reported getting sick after eating at the restaurants about the third week of November. In Pennsylvania, officials reported three new cases for a total of seven. While some of the victims told investigators that they had not eaten green onions, “with green vegetables there is a possibility of cross-contamination from onions to other food substances in the production line,” said Harry Duran, public health epidemiologist for Camden County, N.J. As the inquiry widened, federal and state officials were investigating two New Jersey suppliers to Taco Bell: McLane Foodservice, of Burlington, and Ready Pac Produce in Florence. McLane is the sole distributor of ingredients including cheese, meat and produce for Taco Bell stores in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware and on Long Island. Ready Pac, which is based in California, processes produce like lettuce, tomato and onions. Bart McKay, associate general counsel for McLane, a Texas-based company, said inspectors from the New Jersey Department of Health and the federal Food and Drug Administration looked at shipping dates and other documents at the 192,000-square-foot Burlington facility, but did not inspect any of the food areas. Shane Falls, general manager of the warehouse, which provides food for 1,100 restaurants, including KFC, Pizza Hut and Long John Silver’s as well as Taco Bell, said, “We’re cooperating in any way we can.” Ready Pac, which Taco Bell praised with an award in 2001 for “outstanding performance” in food safety, was one of dozens of companies that recalled prepackaged spinach during an E. coli outbreak in September that killed 3 people and sickened more than 200 in 26 states. “We have taken every prudent precaution and immediately stopped production and shipments of all green onions,” said Steve Dickstein, the vice president for marketing at Ready Pac. He said the onions were produced in only one section of the plant, and only for Taco Bell. Mr. Dickstein said Ready Pac bought the onions from a California producer, Boskovich Farms. At the Florence plant, green onions are cut, washed and sanitized three times, he said, then bagged, boxed and sent to McLane for distribution. A spokeswoman for Boskovich said it was working closely with Taco Bell in the investigation. The spreading crisis at Taco Bell is at least the third episode of illness linked to produce in the last three months. In addition to the September outbreak tied to California spinach, there was a rash of salmonella linked to tomatoes that made dozens of people ill in 21 states. And green onions were the culprit in a 2003 outbreak of hepatitis that began at a Chi-Chi’s restaurant in Pennsylvania. In recent years, the number of outbreaks from contaminated produce has far surpassed those from beef and poultry and has drawn nearly even with those linked to seafood, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group. While there are more food-borne outbreaks related to seafood, far more people get sick from produce outbreaks, the group found. “I think we are really at a tipping point for consumer confidence with fresh fruits and vegetables,” said Caroline Smith DeWaal, the group’s director of food safety. She noted that the F.D.A.’s guidelines for safe farming practices were voluntary and that the number of inspectors had been pared by budget cuts. The F.D.A. regulates the produce and seafood industries, while the Department of Agriculture oversees poultry and meat production. “We are doing a number of things to address food-borne outbreaks and recognize that the system is not perfect,” said an F.D.A. spokeswoman, Julie Zawisza. “But fresh produce does carry risks, and we are committed to finding effective ways to prevent and reduce incidents and have made good progress using available resources in a more targeted and strategic way.” The current outbreak is not the first time that people have gotten sick from eating green onions, also called scallions, at Taco Bell. In 2000, 23 people in Florida contracted hepatitis A after eating green onions at a Taco Bell, and similar outbreaks in Nevada and Kentucky were tied to green onions from Taco Bell, said Andrew Weisbecker, a Seattle lawyer who represented people who sued in the Florida case. Taco Bell declined to comment on that case. The number of people who have fallen ill in recent weeks is minuscule given the number of people who eat at Taco Bell, which the company estimates at 5,000 to 7,000 a week at a given store. Doctors said possible explanations were that the bacteria were limited to a small quantity of produce or that resistance to E. coli varied among customers. E. coli, a common bacterium that lives in the intestines of humans and animals, is normally harmless. Toxic strains can cause diarrhea and abdominal cramps. A small percentage of patients suffer severe or even fatal consequences, involving kidney failure, anemia and bleeding. Such complications sometimes occur after the patient gets well enough to leave the hospital, then relapses, as happened with a 12-year-old boy in Nassau County last week. While state authorities have identified 99 probable cases, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited 43 confirmed cases. Besides on Long Island, the new cases reported in New York were in the Middletown area of Orange County, the Cooperstown area of Otsego County, the Utica-Rome region in Oneida County, and Clinton County near the Canadian border.

403-> Trial Is Scheduled in Enron Case
HOUSTON, Sept. 6 (Reuters)  The judge in the case of the former British bankers who fought extradition to face Enron-related fraud charges set the trial for next year and rejected a defense motion that he quit the case because of possible bias. The three bankers  David Bermingham, 43; Giles Darby, 44; and Gary Mulgrew, 43  have been accused of conspiring with Enron executives in 2000 to defraud National Westminster Bank of $19 million. Federal District Judge Ewing Werlein set possible trial dates for Feb. 5 and Sept. 4, 2007, in the hope that defense lawyers can get ready earlier than they now expect. In rejecting the defense motion that he remove himself from the case, the judge said that the implication of his former law firm, Vinson & Elkins, in the case would not prejudice him. He severed his ties to the firm 14 years ago, he said. The law firm helped Enron create the special-purpose financial entities that led to the former bankers’ indictment. In asking the judge to set a late trial date, defense lawyers argued that preparation could take a year because they need to investigate the case in Britain as well as in the United States.

405-> Escape From Japan
AT the Terminal 8 food court of Kennedy International Airport, over a breakfast of Coca-Cola and greasy Chinese noodles, Miho Mimura slipped her hand into her new American boyfriend’s and the tears started to flow. “I’m sad, I don’t want to go back to Japan,” she said. She looked tired, her complexion worsened by the fierce fluorescent lights. It was the morning after her 23rd birthday, and she and her boyfriend had stayed out celebrating until the wee hours. “Today I expect cry, so no makeup,” Ms. Mimura said in her imperfect English, rubbing her eyes. The emotion was understandable. Her three months in New York had changed her forever. Ms. Mimura had come with a broken heart, after splitting with a Japanese boyfriend. To pay for her plane ticket, she took a second job in a bar in Tokyo, supplementing her $10-an-hour wage as a clerk in a clothing shop. She came to New York to heal. She came to dance, particularly the hip-hop moves she had practiced in Japan. And she came to New York, like thousands of other young Japanese, to find herself. In the East Village on any given weekend night, throngs of such Japanese crowd the restaurants known as izakaya that have sprung up on and around St. Marks Place, in an enclave sometimes called Little Tokyo. With red paper lanterns and cacophonous dins, the restaurants serve delectables like raw liver sashimi and grilled rice balls, to tables of expatriates known in Japan as “freeters” (a combination of free and the German word for worker, arbeiter), or “NEETs” (Not in Education, Employment or Training). As a Japanese version of slackers, such young people are often derided at home as selfish for drifting through part-time jobs or trying to develop talents in the arts — photography, music, painting, dance — rather than contributing to society by joining a corporation or marrying and having babies. The pressure can be intense. Many escape to New York, staying from three months to three years. “In New York they feel they don’t get any pressure, that New York gives them freedom,” said the Japanese-born owner of the Sunrise Mart, a Japanese market in Little Tokyo. The influx is at least a decade old, but unlike in the mid-1990’s when men and women freeters came in equal numbers, now it is largely a female wave — a result of the recovering economy in Japan that has made it slightly easier for young men to find corporate jobs upon graduation. Some of the youths are financed by their parents. Others say they wait tables, even when lacking work permits, in Japanese restaurants in New York where little English is required, or take cash jobs like posing nude for drawing classes in Chelsea art studios. “Three months ago, I asked my parents to send me money, and they said, ‘This is the last money!’ ” said Misaki Ishihara, 23, an aspiring makeup artist from central Japan, near Kobe, who has been in New York for two years. “My parents are so conservative, they can’t believe I’m here alone. They want me to be married to a Japanese man, an established man, make some kids and live in the same house with them. I can’t even believe I am from that family. I am so different!” Ms. Ishihara’s New York sojourn has included learning to surf on the Jersey Shore, studying English and establishing credentials for her career. “I want to go back to Japan eventually, but now is not the time,” she said. Her dwindling cash supply notwithstanding, her favorite pastimes are, she said, shopping, clubbing with hipsters on the Lower East Side and partying. Peter Pachter, who runs the American Language Communication Center in the Hotel Pennsylvania on Seventh Avenue near Penn Station, has watched the ranks of his Japanese students increase 14 percent, to about 500 in the last two years. “There’s a feeling that they kind of blossom here; they finally get a chance to express themselves,” he said. A number of Japanese freeters have become role models in Tokyo by finding success in New York; their stories make their way home via the weekly radio show “Good Day New York,” which broadcasts “live from the Big Apple” to 12 million Japanese from a studio on Fifth Avenue, and the “D.J. Kaori Show,” which reaches listeners all over Japan. D.J. Kaori, the host, began spinning records at the restaurant Match in SoHo in the mid-90’s. After being discovered by Funkmaster Flex of Hot 97, she graduated to D.J. jobs for celebrity parties. That translated into a recording contract for one — and now eight — CD mixes in Japan. “It was so hard in Japan to have the confidence to say, ‘I can be what I want to be, I can do what I want to do,’ ” Kaori, now in her 30’s, said in a mellifluous voice. “New York is very free. I thought, ‘If I want to do this, I can do it. In Japan you have to follow the rails.” In Tokyo bookstores, guides like “Finding Yourself in New York,” and “The ‘I Love New York’ Book of Dreams” fuel the fantasies of those would follow in Kaori’s footsteps. In an indication that a phenomenon has truly taken off, there’s a contrarian title, “Even If You Live in New York, You Won’t Be Happy.” New York now has the largest number of Japanese living in any city outside Japan: 59,295, according to last year’s Japanese Foreign Ministry data. But the Miho Mimuras don’t register in those statistics. Like the majority of the nearly 475,000 Japanese who landed at Kennedy and Newark airports last year, she was officially a tourist. In her allotted 90 days in the United States, she took more than 850 photos — “my memory souvenir!” — of the Statue of Liberty, of Picassos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art when the guards weren’t looking, and of Harlem, Radio City Music Hall and all the other places on a Japanese girl’s must-see list. She had a favorite East Village restaurant. She marveled over $5 T-shirts at H & M. “Very cheap!” she exclaimed. She stood in front of store windows imitating the mannequins. She took classes almost every night, mostly at Broadway Dance Center on West 57th Street, a studio heavily populated with young Japanese women. She saw “Stomp” because the 13-member cast includes a Japanese woman who, like Ms. Mimura, came to New York to pursue a dream of being a dancer. On her very first Saturday night in the city last March, at a clandestine Japanese lounge operating without a liquor license in Midtown, Ms. Mimura ordered a drink more appropriate to the girl she still was than the woman she aspired to be: milk and Malibu rum. She had arranged to meet a fellow student from her first hip-hop class who went by the nickname Smiles, and a friend of his. Before their arrival, Ms. Mimura confided, “I want American boyfriend.” She spent those first weeks struggling to learn her way around the city. She found it difficult to navigate the subway or to find Internet access. For a month, she slept on the couch in the Brooklyn apartment of her best friend from childhood, a design student at LaGuardia Community College. The two women spent hours in deep conversation. Ms. Mimura wrote in her diary about her ex-boyfriend and why he had abandoned her. In one entry, which she allowed a reporter to read with the help of a translator, she confided that she had been needy and insecure around the boyfriend. Six months after the breakup, it was still hard to let go. She phoned him from New York and they talked about why their romance had ended. “I still need him,” Ms. Mimura said. One night, Ms. Mimura went to the East Village club Sin Sin, at a monthly party called “Soulgasm,” where a well-known dancer, Henry Link of Elite Force Crew (who has danced for Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey), often shows up. The party is popular with young Japanese women interested in hip-hop culture. About 1 a.m. Mr. Link appeared, dressed in a T-shirt and track pants, and soon a circle formed around him as he danced. From time to time challengers stepped into the circle to battle, using their own dance moves, with crowd reaction measuring their success. Ms. Mimura bounced with anticipation. In Japan, she never would have tried such a thing, but when an opening came she handed her beer to a bystander and plunged into the circle. Mr. Link stood back in admiration, and spectators nodded and clapped. “At Sin Sin I wasn’t nervous, just not thinking about it,” she said later. “I felt really happy — everybody cheering. I felt so good!” A dancer from the Bronx named Mark stood on the edge of the circle watching Ms. Mimura’s impressive moves. He walked her to the subway after the club closed at 4 a.m. She thought he was “very kindness,” she said later, and agreed to dinner and a movie the next Saturday night. But Mark showed up two hours late, and when Ms. Mimura sought an explanation he babbled at her so quickly that she didn’t understand. It was a stilted evening, hampered by language difficulties and hurt feelings. But still Ms. Mimura was eager to see him the next week at the House Dance Conference, another monthly event at a club. When she did, however, the initial spark was gone. Smiles, her first American friend, was also there. A 22-year-old student of graphic design at New Jersey City University, he is partial to tank tops that show off his biceps. At the club, he took a proprietary interest in Ms. Mimura’s welfare, making sure she got a prime spot on the edge of the challenge floor to watch the action. Slowly, Ms. Mimura was gaining confidence about living in New York, discovering an inner strength. She signed up to go to a national dance contest in Boston, where she made it to the semifinals. Her new friend, Smiles, wished her “Ganbatte!” a combination of “Good luck” and “Knock ’em dead” in Japanese. But she didn’t win. She blamed too much technique and not enough feeling for her loss. She needed to let the freedom of New York and the let-it-all-hang-out attitude of Americans into her heart while dancing, she said. “Japanese dancers copy, not create,” she said, “and I’m more like typical Japanese dancer.” She resolved to be more American. Shortly before she was scheduled to return home, over dinner on St. Marks Place, Ms. Mimura declared that New York had changed her. “I wasn’t strong at all when I came here,” she said. “In Japan, I had people to rely on, but in New York I didn’t have any people. I have to rely myself, so I became stronger. In Japan, I am a little bit shy. But in New York, people have freedom, and that freedom is very good for me.” She said that when she returned home she would pursue her dream of becoming a dancer. She had been promised a promotion if she returned to her job at the clothing store in Tokyo, but Ms. Mimura resolved to take a less demanding job to leave time for dance. Indeed, since returning to Japan in June, she has kept that promise to herself and is working in a mobile-phone shop, while entering dance contests — three so far. It was a mild summer morning when she arrived at Kennedy for her flight home. She had bought a second suitcase for all her purchases — 30 pairs of Tommy Hilfiger socks for friends back home; a crystal statue for her ex-boyfriend’s mother; a stuffed bear for a grandmother; jewelry for her mother and sister; and for herself, dancing shoes and piles of new clothes. Smiles was with her. At some point in the previous days, it seemed clear, he had become her boyfriend. He helped load her suitcases onto the baggage scale. They headed to the food court. Alternately crying, then finding something to laugh about, then crying again, Ms. Mimura took out her camera. She wanted to remember the moment.

409-> ART REVIEW; Sampling the Diverse Output of Artists From China
BEFORE the late 1990's, exhibitions by Chinese artists were a rare sight in United States museums. With economic change and the gradual opening of Chinese society, a few more began to appear, but they still tended to be by those who had emigrated from China in search of professional opportunities -- that is, artists who now lived here and who clustered mostly in and around New York. In recent years, the contingent of Chinese artists showing in museums here has grown much larger and more varied. China-based artists now regularly exhibit in New York commercial galleries and in museums nationally, and many Chinese artists based in the United States have begun to reconnect with their homeland, exhibiting work in China after decades of absence. Right now, an exhibition at the Visual Arts Center of New Jersey tracks the changing status and migratory patterns of Chinese artists, touching on issues of identity and culture shock. The center completed a $6.5 million renovation last year; this is the sixth exhibition in its impressive new galleries. The show opens with a video by Lin Yilin, an artist from southern China whom I met in the early 1990's at his home in Guangzhou. Back then he was part of Big Tail Elephant Group, a funky collective of Chinese experimental artists working in performance, video and installation -- art forms banned in China at the time. (They are now accepted and even taught in Chinese art schools.) Those were scary times for contemporary artists in China. Mr. Lin has a talent for nutty theatrical performances, which he captures in grainy videos. Here he is seen standing on a traffic island in the middle of a busy intersection somewhere in China giving mock directions in the manner of a traffic officer. Such officers used to be ubiquitous in China, where until recently there were no traffic lights because so few people owned cars. From here the exhibition broadens to include the work of some of the better-known Chinese artists based in the United States, people like Xu Bing, Lin Yan and Wenda Gu, all of whom emigrated to the United States in the late 1980's and early 1990's. These days they are busy, sought-after artists, and the exhibition's curator, Zhijian Qian, has done well to wrest important works from each for the present show. It is a quiet coup. Mr. Xu presents a major continuing installation titled "New English Calligraphy" (1995-2006), in which audience members are invited into a kind of classroom with tables, chairs and paper and encouraged via an instructional video to try their hand at New English Calligraphy. This hybrid language invented by the artist renders English words as Chinese calligraphic characters. It is brilliant. Mr. Gu has long worked with human hair, braiding and weaving it into reels out of which he makes hanging sculptures and wall paintings that resemble scrolls. Here he has a pair of installations, the most impressive of which is a suspended tent structure made from a single continuous braid of human hair several miles long. Restrictions imposed by the building have prevented a proper installation of the work from the ceiling, but it has been arranged in such a way that it offers a good sense of the artist's intention. Mr. Xu and Mr. Gu were not the first Chinese artists to come to the United States. Others arrived in the early 1980's, including Zhang Hongtu, who moved to New York in 1982 and lived for a time in New Jersey. He makes humorous paintings and sculptures that fuse and combine historical references to Eastern and Western art. His works have a distinctive Chinese voice, but are about living elsewhere. The exhibition includes several of Mr. Zhang's vast oil paintings, which fuse traditional Chinese scroll painting imagery with visual elements of famous Western modernist masterpieces. In one piece here Mr. Zhang repaints a famous work by the traditional 10th-century Chinese painter-scholar Jing Hao in the garishly-colored, somewhat turbulent style of Vincent van Gogh. It is a very unusual fusion. Mr. Zhang's best-known works are disposable fast-food containers cast in bronze to resemble ancient and valuable Shang dynasty (circa 1766-1050 B.C.) archeological artifacts -- a bronze McDonald's Big Mac box, for instance. They are provocative, pleasurable and fun, fusing Eastern and Western cultural traditions to create hybrid objects you could never have imagined. You can only hoot and admire.

410-> California: Ban on Same-Sex Marriage Appealed
The lawyers for 11 gay and lesbian couples filed an appeal with the State Supreme Court in San Francisco, seeking to overturn a lower court decision in October that upheld a state ban against same-sex marriage. State law requires that marriage be between a man and a woman, although gay and lesbian couples have some rights under the state’s domestic partners law. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argue that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. In April 2005, a Superior Court judge agreed, ruling that the ban violates the California Constitution. An appeals court last month overturned the ruling, in a 2-to-1 decision. A companion lawsuit filed by the City of San Francisco supporting same-sex marriage is also headed for a State Supreme Court appeal, the city attorney’s office said.

411-> Help for Chronic Insomnia Isn't Always Found in a Pill
Recent reports of bizarre sleepwalking behaviors, including middle-of-the-night binge eating and even driving a car, among patients taking the popular sleeping pill Ambien have led some health professionals to focus on drug-free methods of treating chronic insomnia. Sleep therapists have demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief form of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy. Through it, patients learn to restructure their thinking about sleep, which is often erroneous, and to change counterproductive bedtime habits. Should insomnia recur after formal therapy ends, patients have the tools to make corrections on their own. Or, if self-help fails, they see the therapist for a refresher session. Jack D. Edinger and his psychology colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham, N.C., reported five years ago that, among 75 patients with chronic primary insomnia, cognitive behavioral therapy — known as C.B.T. — produced "clinically significant sleep improvements within six weeks," and these improvements persisted for at least six months, the length of follow-up in the study. It found the therapy to be significantly better than readjusting sleep habits or teaching patients progressive muscle relaxation to help them fall asleep and stay asleep. Patients treated with cognitive behavioral therapy reduced by an average of 54 percent the time they spent awake in the night. Those undergoing relaxation therapy reduced awake time by only 16 percent. Those receiving the behavioral placebo therapy achieved a 12 percent reduction. The patients were randomly assigned to groups and were unaware of the therapy they were receiving. Plagued with chronic insomnia that for years had left her lying awake for hours, Dr. Rachel Norwood, a psychiatrist at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, visited Dr. Edinger to learn his techniques. After successfully applying them to her own problem, Dr. Norwood adapted the method to help her patients. She has found that not only does cognitive behavioral therapy produce startling results in people whose insomnia has no underlying cause (so-called primary insomnia), it can also help those whose insomnia is more complicated than simply being unable to fall asleep and stay asleep. One of Dr. Norwood's patients, Karen Hagler, has suffered for three decades with restless leg syndrome that, she said, turned her bed into a battleground, left her tired and crabby all day, and hurt her marriage. "I'm now able to have quality sleep for about six hours a night, and I'm no longer tired during the day," Ms. Hagler said. "C.B.T. has given me quality of life. I don't even have to think about it anymore." Dr. Norwood explained that the therapy retrains the part of the brain that controls a person's sleep-wake cycle and helps patients become experts on their own sleep. Patients learn that they cannot talk themselves into sleep. They figure out how much sleep they really need and how to budget it. Important to reprogramming an errant brain is establishing a regular bedtime and, even more important, setting a specific time to get up each morning. Taking naps to make up for lost sleep at night can make insomnia worse, Dr. Norwood said. With the therapist's help, patients explore what seems to help and what hurts their ability to fall asleep and stay asleep. Some patients need a dark, quiet, cool room; others may need a constant sound to help them sleep. If it takes more than 20 minutes to fall asleep, patients are told to get out of bed and do something distracting until they feel sleepy again. Dr. Norwood said that most patients with insomnia harbor erroneous beliefs that impair rather than aid their ability to sleep soundly. For example, one patient thought that if she didn't sleep for seven hours, her next day would be ruined. Another believed that she could not sleep unless the bedroom temperature was exactly 65 degrees. And while many insomniacs think they need a drink to help them fall asleep, alcohol is a common cause of middle-of-the-night insomnia, the experts say.

412-> Filling Pantries Without a Middleman
A few years back, the online grocery business was just about the perfect symbol of the dot-com bust. A company called Webvan had gone public in 1999, promising to reinvent the $500 billion supermarket industry — retail’s largest sector — by quickly opening high-tech warehouses across the country. With Louis Borders, the bookstore mogul, as its founder and George Shaheen, the former chief executive of Andersen Consulting, as its day-to-day boss, Webvan looked like the real thing. But it didn’t do a very good job of attracting real customers and after blowing through $1.2 billion in only two years, it was forced to close its doors. Five years later, though, the idea behind Webvan is finally starting to look good. Since its demise, smaller players have been slowly and quietly building online groceries into a legitimate business. The most intriguing of the group is a little New York company called FreshDirect that may well be offering us a glimpse of the next wave of Internet commerce. It has already become something of a cult in New York, thanks to produce, fish and meats that put most supermarkets to shame, usually at lower prices. A handful of new apartment buildings have installed refrigerators in their lobbies, built to FreshDirect specifications, to lure residents who want their groceries delivered during the day. Real estate agents selling home buyers on up-and-coming neighborhoods like Inwood have taken to emphasizing that FreshDirect delivers there. When a friend of mine saw a delivery man walking on her Brooklyn street, she chased him down to confirm that, indeed, the company had begun delivering to her part of Park Slope. Today, which is FreshDirect’s busiest day of the year, it will deliver many of the 2,000 fully cooked Thanksgiving dinners and 6,000 uncooked turkeys that it has sold in recent weeks. Operating out of a single warehouse in Queens, the company brings in about $240 million a year, up from nothing in 2001. Its executives talk as if they’re planning someday to expand to other cities, where they would compete with services like Peapod run by existing supermarkets. In all, online groceries are still only a $2 billion business, but they are growing quickly. FreshDirect got its start seven years ago, during the same Internet mania that created Webvan. Jason Ackerman, then 32, was working at a food-focused investment fund that managed some of the money that his uncle, Peter Ackerman, had made as Michael R. Milken’s right-hand man in the 1980s. Looking for new business ideas, the younger Mr. Ackerman traveled up to Harlem to talk to Joe Fedele, who ran a store called Fairway, which was then — and is now — the best supermarket in New York. “This was 1999,” Mr. Ackerman recalled, “and everybody was asking, ‘What can the Internet do for me?’ ” For them, the Internet offered a chance to avoid one of the thorniest problems in the food business: the stores themselves. In a store, vegetables, cheese, meat and seafood have to be cut into portions, dropped into a crowded case and displayed under bright lights long before they will be eaten. None of that makes them taste better. So Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Fedele, who had left Fairway, cut out the store. They spent $80 million, much of it Peter Ackerman’s, and on July 11, 2002 — 7/11 for good luck — FreshDirect made its first delivery. (Mr. Ackerman and Mr. Fedele had a falling-out in 2004, and only the one whose uncle owns a big chunk of the company is still there.) FreshDirect has taken an approach that is nearly the opposite of Webvan’s. It is trying to get one market right before entering any others. Over the last four years, it has been figuring out what New Yorkers want, where delivery vans get caught in traffic and how to put together a shrimp cocktail platter that can survive being dropped. “If we get to Chicago in 3 years or 10 years,” Mr. Ackerman says, “we want to be the best when we get there.” Still, groceries are a tough business. Even without the frustrations of delivery, supermarkets have notoriously thin profit margins. And even though New York, with its affluent, overworked population, may be the country’s best market for online groceries, FreshDirect isn’t yet turning a profit. Its executives insist that it will once the warehouse is operating at closer to full capacity. (I know. We’ve heard that one before.) To get there, the company is doing two main things. First, and in many ways less interestingly, it is nudging its customers toward food that is at least partly prepared and thus brings higher margins. Its sells a really nice Cajun fish rub, for instance, that costs only 50 cents but is largely profit. It also sells microwavable dinners, which aren’t great but are a lot better than most frozen meals. Richard Braddock, the former Citicorp and Priceline executive who is now FreshDirect’s chairman, said he thought the company could eventually have operating margins of about 10 percent, compared with 3 or 4 percent at a typical supermarket chain. Along these lines, FreshDirect stocks less than a complete selection of certain staples, like cereal, giving customers a reason to shop elsewhere for them. When the tennis partner of the company’s chief executive, Dean Furbush, sheepishly confided that he shopped at both FreshDirect and Costco, Mr. Furbush replied that he loved hearing that. The company’s second big strategy is the one that could be a window onto the Internet’s future. FreshDirect’s executives will try hard to convince you that their business isn’t really about convenience. Besides selling good food, the business is about helping people shop in ways they never could in an actual store. It’s about the Web as an information sorter. When you’re looking at, say, crackers, you can sort them by price, by the amount of saturated fat per serving or by any number of other things. In recent months, the company has also loaded hundreds of recipes from some wonderful cookbooks onto its site. You can now click on one of the recipes and quickly order all the ingredients. In the future, FreshDirect executives talk about going further. If your daughter were allergic to nuts, you would be able to tell the Web site not to sell you anything that contains nuts. For anyone with diabetes or heart disease, who keeps kosher or vegetarian, the advantages would be huge. All that time spent reading labels could be reclaimed. Mr. Braddock puts it this way: Phase 1 of the Internet revolved around providing information. Phase 2 revolved around basic transactions. In Phase 3, what Mr. Braddock calls “the golden age of marketing,” smart companies are starting to use the information about customers to sell products in fundamentally new ways. And who’s got more information about your shopping habits than your grocer? So the guys at Webvan were really onto something. They just didn’t run the company well enough to make it to the golden age.

414-> Washington: Decked-Out Capital (Without Crowds)
IT'S a beautiful thing — Washington without the tour buses. Like most Washingtonians, I only begrudgingly accept that I must share the city with a cavalcade of charter buses dispensing tourists most of the year. Visiting taxpayers have as much right to the nation's capital as do its half-million residents, I frequently remind myself. And visit they do, roughly seven million to nine million fanny-packers a year. The hordes start arriving in March for spring break and pick up the pace for the Cherry Blossom Festival; stay thick in the hot summer months, when families wait in line for tickets at 8 a.m. just so they can wait in line again to get into the Capitol Building; and are still thick in the fall, when conventiongoers seem to storm the city, leading with their name tags. What few tourists learn is that Washington is far more pleasant in winter, when everything is open as usual, yet the city is blissfully empty of crowds. And best of all is December, when evergreen garlands festoon the White House, the luxury hotels offer deep discounts and even the hottest restaurants have tables available. This is when the locals come out to play. Like the holiday season in New York, Washington's December is an urban experience, one with candlelight tours of historic homes, late-night jazz in seasonally decorated clubs around Duke Ellington's U Street neighborhood, hot toddies by a cozy fireplace in Georgetown and dance troupes performing in the open air. But although the urban holiday in New York comes with impenetrable crowds in Times Square, claustrophobic throngs at Rockefeller Center and long lines waiting to shuffle past the Saks Fifth Avenue window display, Washington is quiet and relaxed. Yet it's still Washington, with all of its resplendent monuments, world-class museums and manicured parks. Not to mention the National Christmas Tree. One night early this season, the night air was cold and crisp, and Bing Crosby softly crooned from the loud speakers on the Ellipse behind the White House, serenading the polite crowd at the National Christmas Tree. At 5 p.m., when the big tree's 75,000 lights suddenly went on, the throng oohed, then applauded. It was a Norman Rockwell tableau — excited children atop dads' shoulders, swaddled babies in strollers, grandparents taking pictures — except that Spanish, Vietnamese and Hindi could be heard almost as often as English. Nearby, 56 smaller trees represent every state and territory. Over by one of the model trains encircling the 40-foot blue spruce, 10 members of the Butler and Spears families, ages 2 to 42, sang “The Twelve Days of Christmas” a cappella. Living in Washington, said Marshay Spears, 15, means they can visit the tree every year. Annual pilgrimages, it seems, are common. Adelaide Morrissey, 64, and her husband, William, 82, who were also at the tree, dig out their hats, gloves and wool coats every year for a holiday-season trip from Arizona to Washington. They have faithfully done so for at least 10 years, possibly longer, Mrs. Morrissey said. Jeray Simms, 41, and her son Jeremy, 12, also come every year to see the big tree — and the one honoring Ohio, which has Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inspired ornaments. They live in the Virginia suburbs, but Ms. Simms was from Cleveland, she explained. She had climbed a fence and posed for a photo beside the Ohio tree. Just down Constitution Avenue, at the Victorian-looking rink next to the National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden, the Zamboni machine finished smoothing the surface. The skaters were ready to storm the ice, to strains of Elvis Presley. Several days earlier, at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the most somber and elegant of Washington's many war memorials, Jean Ann Brinlee and her husband, Chris, were making tracks. They had only three days to see everything the nation's capital had to offer, and since flying in from Tulsa, Okla., the day before they “just kinda ran amok,” said Ms. Brinlee, going from the National Museum of the American Indian to the Holocaust Museum to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. The Brinlees, a middle-aged couple with two grown daughters, were disappointed to learn that the National Museum of American History was closed for restoration until mid-2008, but delighted to find that Andrew Jackson's coat, Edison's light bulb, Dorothy's ruby slippers and more than 150 other objects from its collection were on temporary display at the Air and Space Museum. They had gone to the trouble to preorder tickets for the Bureau of Printing and Engraving, but they didn't need them. “The lines have been zero,” Ms. Brinlee said. “We didn't have to wait once.” Washington's unique urban experience may also include something that's rarer elsewhere — politician sightings. Marnie Russell, who lives in Brooklyn, was wearing a light jacket and toting a camera, about to make her way to the just-renovated National Portrait Gallery in the Penn Quarter, about halfway between the Capitol and the White House. This was her first trip to Washington, she said, and the portrayal of the city on television “doesn't seem real to me, so I wanted to check it out for myself.” She was in luck: Congress was in town for a postelection session. I told her the best place to spot a politician or two was at the Charlie Palmer steakhouse or the Sonoma wine bar, both near Capitol Hill, but only for a few more days. As Christmas closes in, lawmakers adjourn for the year and quickly board their flights home. The pace slows down; the traffic thins. Washington, suddenly and rarely languorous and easygoing, feels again — as it does for a brief winter respite each year — like the Southern city it is. From December to February, the iconic sites of Washington are easygoing places, mostly free of clamorous crowds. The and the are free as always. The Smithsonian museums are open every day except Christmas, and the National Gallery is open every day except Dec. 25 and Jan. 1. At the , tour groups snake around the public rooms without long waits in line. Tours of the have the bonus of Christmas decorations in December, though reservations must be made through members of Congress and visitors must go in groups of 10. Washington may not have Broadway shows, but it offers classic theater and music, including the holiday standards in December. There are the Washington Ballet's “Nutcracker” at the (13th and E Streets NW, 202-783-4000; www.warnertheatre.com), “A Christmas Carol” at (511 10th Street NW, 202-347-4833; www.fordstheatre.org) and concerts at the (202-467-4600, www.kennedy-center.org). In the vibrant Penn Quarter, north of Pennsylvania Avenue about halfway between the White House and the Capitol, new ethnic restaurants are (781 Seventh Street NW, 202-393-2929; www.modernmexican.com/zengodc), which fuses Mexican and Asian flavors; (901 New York Avenue NW, 202-408-8848; www.acadianarestaurant.com), with contemporary Louisiana comfort food; and (633 D Street NW, 202-637-1222; www.rasikarestaurant.com), serving up modern Indian fare. Georgetown, always the best place for boutique shopping, has had a face-lift, with repaved streets and renovated lamp poles that make M Street more inviting than it has been in decades. Stop in (3318 M Street NW, 202-965-6005; www.kafeleopolds.com) for a Viennese coffee and pastry. The at Eighth and F Streets reopened in July after a six-year renovation, with redesigned space for its collection of presidential portraits, including Gilbert Stuart's famous Lansdowne portrait of George Washington. The shares half the space. Both are open from 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily except on Dec. 25. The 16-month-old giant panda cub, Tai Shan, now 80 pounds, can at last be viewed without a special ticket. The zoo, near the Woodley Park Metro stop on Connecticut Avenue, is open with free admission daily except on Dec. 25. The , adjacent to the National Gallery of Art, features ice skating daily from mid-November through mid-March, weather permitting. But for a less crowded spin, try , across from the Willard Hotel at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Both rinks rent skates and stay open to 11 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

415-> World Business Briefing | Asia: Third Round of Trade Talks
The United States and South Korea began a third round of free trade talks in Seattle, hoping to make progress toward an accord that could be the biggest of its kind for the United States since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in 1994. Critics from both countries planned demonstrations throughout the week, protesting what they characterize as an unfair bias in favor of multinational corporations with only token attention to issues like workers' rights and environmental protections. Wendy Cutler, the chief United States negotiator, is leading a team of more than 100 representatives from about 20 government agencies. South Korea sent 200 representatives.

416-> In Breast Cancer, There Is a Single Agenda: Stay Alive
It is the middle of April 2006, and I am seated on an examining table on the third floor of the New York University Clinical Cancer Center, waiting to hear about my future. My presence here was requested in the strongest possible terms because ethnically speaking, I am half Ashkenazic, or Eastern European Jewish, and because nine months earlier, my life had imploded: on a Friday evening in July 2005, as I was making fruit salad for my daughter’s birthday party, my doctor called to tell me that the lump I’d found in my left breast was, in fact, cancer. I was 43, and I listened, stunned, as she apologized for having ruined my weekend. Three surgeries, four months of chemo, one head of hair and a universe of experience later, here I am. Compliant but antsy. Wanting someone to tell me something good. Actually, I was extraordinarily lucky, relatively speaking, and since July, my doctors had each told me something good: that I had found the cancer early, the first key to survival; that my tumors were hormone-sensitive, making me a candidate for medications like Tamoxifen to help prevent a recurrence; and that the disease hadn’t spread to my lymph nodes. In addition, I had virtually no family history. Nonetheless, I had had a multifocal Stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma — and I was half Ashkenazic — so I had first come to this office in February to be tested for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, which can cause breast cancer and which occur disproportionately in Ashkenazic women. Now I am back, looking for answers, and my only certainty so far is that I have a leg up by dint of my mixed heritage. The half of me that isn’t Ashkenazic comes from a big, boisterous, hyper-musical Greek Orthodox family. The Greek side gives me my hedonism, my penchant for the ocean, my love of food and overly strenuous circle dancing. It is 50 percent of my brain and heart and blood and bones, and in this situation, I realize, it could be my salvation. This, it occurs to me, is one of the great virtues of intermarriage: call it hybrid vigor. I sit, banging my heels softly against the base of the examining table, willing my Greek side to kick in. I was petulant about BRCA testing from the moment it was first mentioned to me. This, after all, was never supposed to have happened to me in the first place. There are plenty of perfectly ghastly inherited diseases in my extended family. But cancer? I had enough to deal with. Cancer was somebody else’s business. Yet there was more to it than that. Once cancer had ceased to be somebody else’s business and had temporarily wiped everything else off my schedule, BRCA testing came to mean the possibility of more devastating news: an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer for me and for my daughter, the question of my sister’s risk and the possibility of having to consider a second mastectomy and removal of my ovaries to decrease risks for myself. After I had a mastectomy, though, the idea of more surgery became unmanageable. Losing a breast was extraordinarily difficult. The body wants its own coherence; it objects, in the most strenuous terms possible, to any structural loss. No more parts for sale to the lowest bidder, was all I could think afterward. Everything else I have, I want to keep. But here’s the important thing, the thing I learned that changed me for good: in practical terms it was all bluster. I was 43, a working journalist, with a 3-year-old daughter and a remarkable husband. Of course I was going to be tested. I was boundlessly grateful that I lived at a time when such a test was available. I was grateful that my outstanding oncologist had recommended the equally outstanding risk-assessment specialist at the hospital where I was already being treated. I was grateful that my insurance would pay for everything. Besides, I’m a practical person and friendly with Western medicine even on good days; so from the moment my cancer was diagnosed, that practicality and my most fundamental interests fused into a single agenda: staying alive. Living out my marriage. Being able to raise my child. Making a contribution with my work. At the end of the day, there is nothing else. You tell yourself that you’d never make it through this or that treatment, couldn’t survive a recurrence, couldn’t bear to lose another breast, and literally as you are uttering the words, you know with certainty that if you had to bear any of those things, you would. Breast cancer kills 40,000 American women a year. It is the end of the line. You look at your husband, and you look at your daughter, and you do whatever you have to do. And so I am sitting upright on the examining table when Dr. Julia A. Smith, the head of the N.Y.U. Breast Cancer Screening and Prevention Program, comes in. Dr. Smith is so busy, so intense and so passionate about her subject that she tends to enter rooms in midsentence. “It’s your cousin I’m curious about,” she says, right off the bat; then, seeing the confusion in my eyes, she doubles back to report, “ results are negative.” My body collapses backward onto the table. The sense of relief is astonishing. Dr. Smith mulls over my chart and asks me to come back in a year. I will always have to be watched for signs of recurrence, but this moment begins a long period of adjustment to the fact that I may well be out of the woods. And what if the news had been different? My gravest worry, I know, would have been for our daughter. Though her risk was low because I, too, am intermarried — Hannah is half Sierra Leonean — discovering that I had BRCA mutations could still have put her in danger. I hope that I would have been governed by the same ethic that guided our family through this entire experience: learn as much as possible, then take advantage of everything that science has to offer. This is a disease for which there are options. In that situation, information becomes the only game in town.

417-> A Core of Despair, a Shadow of Nemesis
I don't think I will ever eat Greek pastry again without thinking of Mr. Z., or of his wife's expression as the nurse and I left Mr. Z.'s house for the last time. He was not a complainer, and even during his final days, Mr. Z. seemed grateful to the nurse and to me, his psychiatrist. Plainly, he was astonished that we would travel the few miles from the mental health clinic to his house, simply to look in on him. He had come to this country from Greece 30 years before and had run a successful business for two decades. Then, the Furies descended upon him, seemingly out of the blue, though Mr. Z. always felt that he was atoning for some evil deed. I took this as part of his depression: guilt, self-loathing — these were part of the picture I had seen in a thousand such cases. It was not until a few weeks before his death that I learned the truth about Mr. Z., or at least, one family member's version of the truth. In my field, there's major depression, and then there's Major Depression. With proper treatment, some depressive bouts seem to blow away like dead leaves in a spring breeze. Other cases, like Mr. Z.'s, sit before your best remedies like a fierce, scowling stone idol, mocking all hope. We had tried nearly everything in the pharmacopeia with Mr. Z. Nothing seemed to budge his depression, or to pry the man himself from his rock-hard hopelessness and despair. He maintained a kind of shrugging, patronizing stoicism that seemed to say, "Oh, come now, Doctor, you didn't really think that would work, did you?" At times, I wished Mr. Z. had yelled at me a little; it would have made my sense of impotence easier to bear. He adamantly refused electroconvulsive therapy, which was probably his last, best hope. And yet, Mr. Z. did not become suicidal. Week after week, he and his stony, sulking misery would dutifully present themselves. This standoff went on for several years. Mr. Z. had received the usual yearly physical and routine lab studies, but I did not follow his medical issues very closely. For the most part, he had always been in good health. His internist sent me letters occasionally, documenting the usual innocuous findings. But one day I received quite a different communication: Mr. Z. had been feeling tired and weak, and he had been admitted to the medical unit for some tests. The results were catastrophic: he had metastatic cancer, with involvement of his lungs and heart. My own heart sank at this news, but not with pity or compassion. My first thought was that I had missed it. How much of the depression could have been due to the undetected cancer? After all, severe depression can be among the first signs of cancer of the pancreas. Had there been clues along the way that I had missed? Mr. Z. had been depressed for at least 10 years; surely, this malignancy was not the inciting factor. And, I consoled myself, his family doctor had been no more successful than I was in catching the thing in its earliest stages. My father died of cancer, and I knew that Mr. Z.'s sickness was stirring up some old and painful feelings. My father's doctor had missed the diagnosis entirely. Mr. Z.'s decline was swift, despite the most advanced treatment available. When the nurse and I made that last home visit, Mr. Z. was confused, disoriented and very anxious, though he recognized us. I was able to calm him some with a small amount of a sedative, worrying all the while that I would worsen his confusion. Mr. Z. seemed grateful, and shook my hand. His expression told me that he knew this would be our last meeting. His wife stopped the nurse and me just as we were about to leave. "Wait!" she said, hurrying from the kitchen. "I want to thank you!" She handed us two big bags of Greek pastry. I wanted to say, "Thank me for what?" Instead, I smiled, shook Mrs. Z.'s frail hand, and said, "Thank you." About two weeks before Mr. Z. died, I learned that a sister had come forward and revealed to a family member that Mr. Z. had physically abused her as a child. This seemed so unfaithful to my own internal portrait of Mr. Z. that I scarcely gave it credence. Yet it would have explained the man's corrosive sense of guilt and his self-flagellating need for atonement. I wondered if, for Mr. Z., his dark history had demonstrated what the ancient Greeks knew as Nemesis — originally the goddess who allotted us our share of happiness and woe, but later the goddess of retribution.

418-> Weehawken: Charges in Teenager's Death
Prosecutors have charged a 20-year-old woman with the murder of a Bergen County teenager, Jennifer Moore, whose body was found in a garbage bin in West New York last month. The woman, Krystal Riordan, left, of Orange, Conn., who had been arrested in July and charged with evidence tampering, was charged on Friday with one count of felony murder. A man who lived with her, Draymond Coleman, 34, was arrested in Manhattan on July 27 and is also charged with murder in the case, said Edward J. De Fazio, the Hudson County prosecutor. Mr. Coleman is accused of picking up Ms. Moore, 18, of Harrington Park, as she walked along the West Side Highway after she left a night club in Chelsea on July 25 and killing her in a motel room in Weehawken, Mr. De Fazio said. Ms. Riordan was in the room when the murder took place, the prosecutor said. Before dumping Ms. Moore’s body in a trash bin, Mr. Coleman and Ms. Riordan clipped her fingernails and rubbed her body in bleach “in a misguided attempt to thwart crime scene investigators,” Mr. De Fazio said.

420-> Mother of Boy Found Dead Leaps to Tracks
A woman jumped in front of a subway train in Brooklyn yesterday, just before her son was found dead in their Crown Heights apartment on his birthday, the police said. The boy was 9 years old. The woman, who jumped onto the tracks at Surf Avenue and West Eighth Street, in Coney Island, was taken to Lutheran Medical Center. She lost two fingers, the police said, but was not severely injured. The police said the boy, Knil Jean Noel, was found face-down in his bed by his father shortly before 5 p.m. in the family’s third-floor apartment on Brooklyn Avenue. There were no signs of trauma on his body, the police said. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. Neighbors said Knil’s father returned home and came wailing down the stairs, repeating that his son was dead. The boy’s mother was not at home at the time. The boy was an only child. He enjoyed soccer, cricket and martial arts, neighbors said. The family had moved into the apartment three years ago. The mother was often seen taking the boy to and from school. A woman who runs an after-school program, Anansi’s Playground, on the ground floor of the apartment building said there were never any signs of trouble. The woman, who would only give her first name, Sharon, said that just last week, the boy made oatmeal cookies with a friend. “He was leaving for school and asked if I wanted some cookies, so he shared them with me. They were very tasty.” She added, “He was a very sweet little boy.”

421-> New Treatments Offer Hope in the Fight Against a Cruel Skin-Hardening Ailment
Before Steve Nickerson, a photographer at The Rocky Mountain News in Denver, began his treatments for systemic scleroderma, the illness had already sabotaged his body on multiple fronts. His skin and fingers were so severely stiffened  “tough as rhino hide,” he recalled one doctor saying  that he could not tie his shoes and could barely hold his Nikon. His lungs became scarred. He became so weak that he could not climb a single step without gasping for breath. Even eating became arduous: his mouth would not open sufficiently for a normal bite. “I can tear an apple apart, sort of animal-like,” said Mr. Nickerson, who measures the progress of his treatments according to increased jaw opening. “I have gone from 23 millimeters to 27,” he said. Scleroderma means “hard skin,” a hallmark of the illness that can turn hands purple as if from frostbite and can curl fingers into woodlike nonfunctioning. Rare and enigmatic, it is a chronic, often progressive rheumatic disease in which the immune system overproduces collagen, which can stiffen and thicken the skin, typically on the hands, arms, legs and face. The symptoms and their severity can vary greatly among patients, and the illness takes two main forms. Systemic scleroderma  which can ravage not only the skin but internal organs like the heart, lungs and kidneys  can be life-threatening. Localized scleroderma can be limited to patches of thickened or discolored skin, while internal organs are spared. This form does not lead to systemic scleroderma and is not fatal. There is no cure for scleroderma. But doctors are using a growing number of treatments for people like Mr. Nickerson, who have the more serious systemic form, also called systemic sclerosis. As recently as June, The reported on a new study in which a drug called cyclophosphamide, or Cytoxan, modestly helped slow thickening of the skin and deterioration of lung function. “For people with scleroderma, it really is the best and worst of times,” said Chris Underation of the Scleroderma Foundation in Danvers, Mass. “The best part is that there are now more treatment options than ever, and more are coming. But the worst part is that many of these treatments are beyond the financial reach of most people if their insurance will not cover them.” Some newer treatments like stem cell transplants have shown great promise over the last few years, said Mr. Underation, the group’s communications manager. “But these new treatments,” he added, “are considered experimental and can easily run into five figures each time a patient receives one. Costs quickly rise, and patients quickly become financially desperate.” At the Rocky Mountain Cancer Center in Aurora, Colo., on roughly two consecutive eight-hour days every month, Mr. Nickerson, 49, is hooked up to an intravenous drip that is “exhausting, boring and time-consuming,” he said. His friends and colleagues raised $83,500 for his intravenous immune globulin treatments, which infuse blood and give him new antibodies. Mr. Nickerson’s insurer considered the treatments experimental and denied coverage. They cost around $37,000 each; 13 were ordered. “The treatments are saving my life,” said Mr. Nickerson, who felt strong enough last month to increase his work schedule from three days a week to four. “I was a wreck last year at this time.” By studying scleroderma, researchers are learning more about autoimmune diseases and the process that underlies them, the odd phenomenon of a body attacking itself. “While scleroderma is a rare disease, the lessons we learn from it will help us in the treatment of many common and uncommon diseases,” said Dr. Fredrick M. Wigley, director of the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center in Baltimore. He is also Mr. Nickerson’s doctor. About 300,000 Americans have scleroderma, including 100,000 with the more serious form, said Dr. Daniel E. Furst, professor of rheumatology at the University of California, Los Angeles. About 20 percent of those with systemic sclerosis have a severe manifestation of the disease, Dr. Furst said, with 50 percent mortality over five years. Scleroderma occurs most frequently among women in their childbearing years, Dr. Furst said. Emily Woods, 35, of Plano, Tex., is one of them. She was so sick at one point that she dropped to 87 pounds. “She was close to death until a stem cell transplant saved her life,” said Mr. Underation of the Scleroderma Foundation. “She was unable to clothe and feed herself. Now she drives and is quite active and enjoying her young daughter.” With more research, the face of the disease is changing, Dr. Furst said. “Until around 1995, many patients with the worst kind of scleroderma, particularly those with pulmonary hypertension, died very quickly,” he added. “In this last year, a lot of new and hopeful things have happened in scleroderma research.” “We understand the genetic background of this disease better,” Dr. Furst continued. “And new drugs to treat pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma  increased blood pressure in the lungs, which formerly caused 50 percent mortality in two years from diagnosis  are coming out in a steady stream. Within a year, we hope there will be five drugs to treat pulmonary hypertension in scleroderma.” There is other encouraging news. Besides controlling symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension and heart failure, Dr. Wigley at Johns Hopkins said, new drugs are being used to treat the gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease, stop the progression of lung disease and reverse the rapid renal failure that can occur. New medicines can also control arthritis associated with the illness and help people cope, for example, by easing depression, he said. Dr. Keith M. Sullivan, a professor of medicine who specializes in stem cell transplantation at the Duke University Medical Center, sees other developments on the horizon. The research suggests that a regimen of intensive chemotherapy or total body irradiation, followed by a treatment in which stem cells are removed from a patient’s blood and then given back, “may actually reset the immune system,” Dr. Sullivan said, “leading to long-term control of autoimmune disease.” “The patient receives back the purified stem cells, which regenerate the marrow and immune systems,” he said. Beyond that, large clinical trials of new treatments for scleroderma also offer hope. Dr. Sullivan is the principal investigator for a trial called Scleroderma: Cyclophosphamide or Transplantation, or SCOT, and Dr. Furst is principal rheumatologist. The trial compares the potential benefits of a stem cell transplant with high-dose monthly treatment with cyclophosphamide, a chemotherapy drug given for chronic immunosuppression. A Web site, sclerodermatrial.org, provides patient information and the locations of centers across the United States that are enrolling patients with severe forms of systemic sclerosis. “The proof of this hope lies not only in our scientific publications and data, but also in the patients’ own voice,” Dr. Sullivan said. He described how, at a recent meeting to discuss the clinical trial, a patient who had been treated for scleroderma addressed the assembled doctors. “She was several years after transplant and described the new normalcy of her life,” Dr. Sullivan said. “Rarely have I seen a group of 80 doctors close their laptops, sheath their BlackBerrys and give undivided attention to such a compelling story. That is the hope and the message.”

423-> Ian McEwan's Stories Reach the Stage in 'In Between the Sheets'
The subtitle of "In Between the Sheets," which opened this past weekend for a brief run at Theater 54, could be "Staging Mr. McEwan." Seth Duerr, an ambitious actor and director, decided he wanted to adapt one of the British novelist Ian McEwan's books. Having been turned down for "The Comfort of Strangers," Mr. Duerr turned to the above-named collection of short stories. The hook is that the resulting set of three short pieces (which does not, incidentally, include the book's title story) is "the first-ever author-approved stage adaptation" of Mr. McEwan's work. "Pleasing Mr. McEwan" could be another epithet. Mr. Duerr's slavish faithfulness to the original texts could not help gratifying any author's heart. Indeed, the centerpiece, "Dead as They Come," is presented exactly as it was written, a monologue. The piece is intended as a tour de force for Timothy Smallwood, who plays the role of a wealthy yuppie who falls in love with a mannequin in a shop window and projects onto it the full range of emotions, from ecstasy to silent resentment, of a more usual two-person love affair. (Mr. Smallwood gives a credible outline of the character, but tends to rush and garble his words; if you're going to do it, you might as well savor it.) The pacing of short stories, however, is different from that of theater. Mr. McEwan's tales, about twisted sexuality, are slightly creepy but told in a wry, laconic tone with a kind of elegance; onstage, they become simply elliptical and unsettling. Each segment is also extended a few measures beyond its natural theatrical conclusion. At the end of "Pornography," two women exact drastic retribution on their (shared) ex-lover, but the moment is so drawn out that it becomes anticlimactic. And "Psychopolis," a British parody of Los Angeles, ends with a sendup of American violence that seems more theatrical on the page than on the stage. "Pleasing Mr. McEwan" might express the show's purpose more than any other title, since the director's hand is not firm enough to stand in for the authorial voice that holds the original material together.

425-> Diva Meets Fan From Hell? Better Fasten Your Seatbelt
Although American pop has no obvious equivalent of Lauren Waks, the French rock goddess who struts and sulks through Emmanuelle Bercot’s film “Backstage,” the toxic relationship Lauren cultivates with a besotted teenage fan is still uncomfortably believable. Many stars have been known to “adopt” their fans by making them their assistants; it goes with the narcissism of pop stardom. And when Lauren (Emmanuelle Seigner) unwisely allows her biggest fan, Lucie (Isild Le Besco ), into her life, we know that little good can come of it. Spoiled and haughty, Lauren, who is pushing 40, suggests a physical hybrid of Deborah Harry and Madonna; she has cheekbones for days. But her music is something else. Behind the metallic trimmings, her songs, composed by Laurent Marimbert, with words by Marine Bercot (the director’s sister), are flowery and girlish. The disparity between a star who flaunts an attitude of icy indifference and songs that teem with frilly, poetic phrases like “indigo happiness” (whatever that is) is never satisfactorily resolved. “Backstage,” above all, is a showcase for Ms. Seigner, who is quite a good singer, and Ms. Le Besco, the fearless young French actress who specializes in playing naïve, headstrong girls derailed by passion. Depending on the role, Ms. Le Besco, who has sensual features that dissolve into one another like a child’s, can look 13 or 30. As Lucie, she gyrates between a desperate, puppyish longing and shrieking hysteria, with interludes of glassy-eyed, infantile opacity. One of the movie’s creepiest moments comes shortly after she has insinuated herself into her idol’s hotel suite and conducts an oral pas de deux with the star’s toothbrush. Star and fan first make contact when a reality show TV crew descends on Lucie’s suburban home to ambush Lucie with a happy surprise. As the cameras roll, Lauren strolls into Lucie’s life like a deity summoned straight from Olympus. The girl is so overcome that she falls to pieces, and the episode has to be scrapped. The very next day Lucie runs away to Paris in pursuit of Lauren. After camping out with other fans in front of Lauren’s hotel, she worms her way to the inner sanctum by throwing a fit outside the star’s suite and is finally granted five minutes of face time. Lauren inexplicably keeps her around as a gofer. As it seals you under the electric blanket of its characters’ obsessions, “Backstage” produces a feeling of emotional claustrophobia. The star, recently dumped by her boyfriend, Daniel (Samuel Benchetrit), is left so unstrung that she has been unable to complete a record and refuses to sing unless Daniel is facing her in the studio. Lucie, unbidden, slyly insinuates herself into the relationship as a go-between and seduces Daniel, who is clueless about her motives. “Backstage,” which opens today at Film Forum in New York, is fraught with narrative glitches. Especially when its attention wanders to Lucie’s and Lauren’s family histories, it stumbles into confusion. As long as it focuses on its feverishly needy central characters, neither of whom you would ever want to have as a friend, it remains true to itself. Directed by Emmanuelle Bercot; written (in French, with English subtitles) by Ms. Bercot and Jérôme Tonnerre; director of photography, Agnès Godard; edited by Julien Leloup; music by Laurent Marimbert, with lyrics by Marine Bercot, sung by Emmanuelle Seigner; produced by Caroline Benjo and Carole Scotta; released by Strand Releasing. At the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village. Running time: 112 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Emmanuelle Seigner (Lauren), Isild Le Besco (Lucie), Noémie Lvovsky (Juliette), Valéry Zeitoun (Seymour), Samuel Benchetrit (Daniel), Edith Le Merdy (Marie Line), Jean-Paul Walle Wa Wana (Jean-Claude) and Mar Sodupe (Nanou).

427-> Does My Illness Have to Be Your Business? (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Your Medical History, to Go’’ (Op-Ed, Sept. 19): Dr. David J. Brailer raises a number of important issues about the digitization of patient health care records. There is much to be gained from making such records portable, as Dr. Brailer emphasizes, as well as possibly improving the effectiveness of health care delivery. But unless Congress explicitly deals with the important issue of access to such records  who has access and how access is managed and controlled  individual rights can be swept away under the banner of efficiency. How would you feel if your employer, let alone some random, nefarious hacker, could gain access to your individual medical records? It almost makes ID theft a tempest in a teacup. B. A.

428-> Music in Review
John the Revelator Winter Garden It might not have been the sort of Hollywood red-carpet coterie that the Metropolitan Opera mustered for its opening-night extravaganza, but the crowd that assembled on Friday night for a concert at the Winter Garden of the World Financial Center was liberally sprinkled with noteworthy figures: composers, artists, even the independent film director Jim Jarmusch. The free concert also drew a sizable number of curious onlookers and giddily distracted toddlers. The occasion was the premiere of "John the Revelator," a new work by the composer Phil Kline. Mr. Jarmusch's presence made sense: he and Mr. Kline played together in a rock band, the Del-Byzanteens, during the rough-and-tumble early years of New York's downtown scene, when borders between artistic disciplines were particularly porous. A healthy disregard for traditional boundaries continues to inform Mr. Kline's work. He remains best known for "Unsilent Night," a holiday caroling procession of portable tape players that is perhaps less a composition than a piece of musical performance art. More recently Mr. Kline has created quirky, rock-influenced song cycles based on sayings of Donald H. Rumsfeld and inscriptions that American G.I.'s carved into cigarette lighters during the Vietnam War. "John the Revelator" was more conventional than those works in tone and comportment, yet it ultimately proved just as audacious in its stylistic juxtapositions and thematic concerns. WNYC radio commissioned the piece specifically for performance in the Winter Garden, which the radio host John Schaefer called a postmodern cathedral in his introductory comments: an impression based not only on the space's architectural grandeur but also on the way sounds are sustained, echoed and blurred by its vast expanse. Mr. Kline responded with what amounted to a postmodern Mass. He set the traditional Latin Ordinary for the male vocal sextet Lionheart, a group renowned in both early-music and contemporary circles. Demonstrating an estimable knack for vocal ensemble writing, Mr. Kline provided plaintive, searching melodies and playful counterpoint in movements that suggested by turns the tonal richness of Barber, the austerity of Stravinsky and the harmonic piquancy of Ligeti. Interspersed among them was a set of Propers drawing on Early-American hymnody, the Book of Jeremiah, poetry by David Shapiro, a passage from Beckett and the gospel blues of Blind Willie Johnson, who wrote the namesake song, "John the Revelator." Here Lionheart was joined by the eclectic string quartet Ethel, which alternated between the grainy burr of a viol consort and the mechanistic chug of Minimalism. Conjoined, the two ensembles provided an ideal vehicle for Mr. Kline's offbeat but ultimately moving ceremony. STEVE SMITH WNYC-FM will broadcast a recording of the performance on Dec. 5 at 11 p.m.

430-> Kitchen Appliance Chain to Be Acquired
A unit of Nacco Industries said yesterday that it had agreed to buy Le Gourmet Chef, a kitchen appliance chain that sought bankruptcy protection this month. Terms were not disclosed. Kitchen Collection, Nacco’s housewares unit, will add Le Gourmet Chef’s 77 mall stores to its chain of 200 kitchen-gadget outlets. The purchase will help Kitchen Collection “develop a new, more upscale store format” that complements its existing stores, Nacco said. The acquisition comes as Nacco, which also makes forklifts and mines coal, prepares to form the biggest supplier of countertop kitchen appliances by combining its Hamilton Beach/Proctor Silex unit with Applica, the maker of Black & Decker toasters and coffee machines. Le Gourmet Chef, based in Paramus, N.J., filed for bankruptcy protection Aug. 8, saying slumping sales left it unable to pay suppliers and cover debt payments. The closely held company listed assets of about $33 million and debts of $32 million in its filing in United States Bankruptcy Court in Newark. Nacco is based in Cleveland.

432-> Peaches at Irving Plaza: Unabashedly Raunchy, a Feminist Praises Sex
Peaches has a one-track mind. Every one of her songs is about sex: straight, gay, bi, all-purpose. At Irving Plaza on Saturday night, she started her set in a gold lamé leotard and headdress — vaguely Cleopatra-ish — and ended up in a black bikini, collar and wrist cuffs. She did a little bump-and-grind and a lot of strutting. Most of her lyrics can’t be quoted in this family newspaper. But her act isn’t exactly about enticement or desire. It’s about bravado and the spectacle of a woman who’s willing to be as raunchy as a man. For her debut album in 2000, “The Teaches of Peaches,” and through years of touring, Peaches backed herself up with rudimentary drum machines and samples. The stark, mechanized sound harked back to early-1980’s electro and old-school hip-hop, and Peaches’s savvy breakthrough song, which posited sex as a painkiller, gave club disc jockeys something to toy with. Concept aside, on sheer musical terms Peaches was no competition for equally explicit, far more articulate and rhythmically savvy rappers like Lil’ Kim, or dancehall toasters like Lady Saw. (Peaches, however, appreciates homosexuality, while hip-hop and reggae rhymers often revile it.) Wisely, Peaches picked up another 1980’s idea: adding power chords to the drum-machine beat, à la Run-D.M.C. Lately she has been shifting from raps, which take a lot of writing and rhyming, to hard-rock songs that allow for far more repetition; luckily, Peaches can sing, wailing like Joan Jett, and now she occasionally plays guitar. (Peaches, a Canadian whose real name is Merrill Nisker, used to be a music teacher.) On her new album Peaches is backed by additional musicians (including Ms. Jett), and onstage she now leads a four-woman band. At the end of the set, they wore matching jackets that announced them as “Peaches and the Herms.” The musical upgrade, as Peaches called it, puts more punch and variety in her music and frees her for more showmanship. At Irving Plaza she performed onstage, on a speaker cabinet, in the balcony and on the dance floor. The band alternated guitar-charged rockers and electro songs with deep, throbbing bass lines; an inflatable phallus loomed behind them. Singing and rapping, Peaches delivered demands, exhortations, taunts and step-by-step instructions on what to shake or stroke. Compared with Ms. Jett, Madonna or Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Peaches is less an object of desire than a pep-rally yell leader; her raps often have the rhythms of football cheers. Her material is closer to a checklist than to a fantasy, and her audience finds it amusing, not shocking. It’s one big, happy conceptual in-joke, and it’s more than entertaining enough for a one-night stand. With Peaches to represent female sexuality unleashed, the Eagles of Death Metal, sharing the bill, were the counterbalance: the return of guitar-wielding rock machismo. Their riffs echoed the Rolling Stones and AC/DC, with Josh Homme (who leads Queens of the Stone Age) pounding the drums behind Jesse Hughes, the mustachioed lead singer, who ostentatiously combed back his hair and readjusted his sunglasses between songs. The band has zero subtext and all the swagger it needs.

433-> Arrest in Bronx Death
A 21-year-old woman was arrested yesterday in the strangling of a man found in his sport utility vehicle this month on a Bronx street, the police said. The woman, Eboni Smith of the Bronx, was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of Maurice Wall, 31, also of the Bronx. Mr. Wall was found in his Ford Explorer about 11:30 p.m. on Dec. 14 near East 165th Street and Trinity Avenue. He was taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center and pronounced dead. A police official said he had been strangled.

434-> New Charges Against Gotti
A federal grand jury indicted John A. Gotti, left, on new charges yesterday as the government positions itself for the July 5 start of Mr. Gotti's third trial on racketeering charges. Juries deadlocked in two previous trials in the last year. Yesterday's indictment, in Federal District Court in Manhattan, accused Mr. Gotti of tampering with a witness last summer and of using money earned illegally to operate holding companies used to buy real estate and collect rents. Charles Carnesi, Mr. Gotti's lawyer, did not immediately return telephone messages for comment.

435-> Chess to Unify Championship, in Elista. Where? In Elista.
A schism in the chess world that opened in 1993 in London will be healed by next month in a poor and barren Russian republic on the Caspian Sea. Thirteen years ago, Garry Kasparov, the undisputed world chess champion, broke with the World Chess Federation, the governing body of the game, over how the federation was organizing a match for the title. Mr. Kasparov and his challenger, Nigel Short, an English grandmaster, staged their own match in London, which Mr. Kasparov won. In retaliation, the federation declared that Mr. Kasparov was no longer champion and organized a match between Anatoly Karpov, Mr. Kasparov’s predecessor, and Jan Timman, a Dutch grandmaster. Mr. Karpov won and the federation proclaimed him champion. Since then, there have been rival claims to the title of world champion. But now, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of the World Chess Federation — who is also president of Kalmykia, a region in southern Russia next to Kazakhstan — has brokered a deal and arranged a match to settle the issue. It will be in Elista, the republic’s capital, beginning today and will continue into October. Veselin Topalov, 31, a Bulgarian grandmaster who is the top-ranked player in the world, will play a 12-game match against Vladimir Kramnik, a Russian grandmaster who is also 31 and is ranked No. 4. The players will divide $1 million, but the winner will go away with something arguably as valuable: He will be the true world champion. Mr. Topalov is the federation’s champion by virtue of having won a world championship tournament in Argentina last year. He plays aggressively and uncompromisingly, much like Mr. Kasparov did before he retired last year. Mr. Kramnik bases his claim to the title on having beaten Mr. Kasparov in a match in 2000. His style of play has been described as minimalist, much like Mr. Karpov in his prime. Mr. Kramnik’s play had deteriorated since 2003, and he had slipped to No. 9 in the world rankings. But earlier this year, he revealed that he had a rare form of arthritis. Since seeking treatment, he has seemed to be approaching his peak form. Veteran insiders in the chess world say they believe that the split has hurt the prestige of the game. “The title has been cheapened,” said Yasser Seirawan, an American grandmaster who lives in the Netherlands. “It really affected sponsors, much to the detriment of the game. If Mercedes Benz or G.M. wanted to sponsor the world chess championship and there is another one going on down the street, then they end up asking, ‘What am I sponsoring?’ ” Mr. Ilyumzhinov, 44, who has been president of the republic since 1993 and president of the federation since 1995, has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to turn Elista into a modern city. Among the signature elements of his master plan is the Buddhist temple whose roof rises 200 feet above the parched steppe and a four-story, glass dome called Chess City that has been the site of a number of federation-sponsored tournaments. Last year, there was an offer from a German organization to stage the match in Germany with a prize fund of 1.3 million euros, or about $1.7 million. Mr. Topalov, at the federation’s urging, rejected it. That the match will now be played in Elista, for less money, is a failure of the leaders of the federation and emblematic of the decline of chess since the split, Mr. Seirawan said. “It is an embarrassment,” he said. “Arguably you have the most important event in chess today or for that matter for the last few years, and nobody, and the millions and millions of chess fans in the world, are not going to Elista.” Mr. Short, the English grandmaster who won the European Union championship last week, put it more succinctly. “Elista is a nice place. They are nice people. But, Elista is not Paris.” Still, he said, at least there is going to be a match. That is, he said, preferable to other formats that the chess federation has tried. He mentioned the 2004 championship in Tripoli, Libya, which used a knockout system like that at the Wimbledon tennis championships. Partly because of the location and partly because of the format, only 5 of the world’s top 20 players participated. It was won by Rustam Kasimdzhanov of Uzbekistan, who was ranked No. 47 at the time. Mr. Short said, “In Libya, the world championship final was watched by two men and a dog.” This time the whole chess world will be watching, even if only online.

436-> National Briefing | Washington: Computer With Data On 38,000 Veterans Is Missing
As many as 38,000 veterans may be at risk of identity theft after a subcontractor at the Veterans Affairs Department lost a desktop computer containing personal data. Veterans Affairs Secretary Jim Nicholson said that the subcontractor, the Unisys Corporation, reported the missing computer on Thursday. Local and federal authorities are investigating, Mr. Nicholson said. The disclosure comes after a string of data breaches at the department, including the May 3 theft of a laptop containing data on 26.5 million veterans.

437-> Clash Over Protesters at Military Funerals
Five people face criminal charges after a weekend confrontation with members of a Kansas group that pickets military funerals and believes that American casualties in Iraq are God's retribution for America's embrace of homosexuality, the authorities said. Members of Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan., were met at Seaford by about 1,000 angry counterdemonstrators. The authorities said David Jones, 29, of Bridgeville broke through a police line and began assaulting two of the Westboro protesters. He was charged with two counts of third-degree assault and one count of disorderly conduct. A 16-year-old Seaford youth was charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct after a tire on the Westboro group's van was slashed. Christopher Daudt, 19, Stephen Carson, 19, and Allen Dunn, 56, all of Seaford, were also charged with criminal mischief and disorderly conduct. Church members plan to return to Seaford on Wednesday to picket another funeral.

438-> A Battle Over ‘Juice of Youth’
IT’S almost impossible to turn on the television and not glimpse Suzanne Somers smiling back at you. In the last week, she has appeared on the “Today” show, “The View” and “Entertainment Tonight.” She has chatted with Martha Stewart and bonded with Bill O’Reilly. She is not discussing the war in Iraq, nor offering opinions on the Mark Foley scandal. Her latest book, “Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones,” hit stores on Oct. 10, and Ms. Somers is simply doing what celebrities do these days: selling. She happens to be good at it. The actress made the ThighMaster a household product and, of the 13 books she has written, 7 have been best sellers. If history — and a good marketing plan — has anything to do with it, “Ageless” may just be her eighth. It is a paean to bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, a controversial treatment for menopausal women that she dubs “the juice of youth.” “I had bone loss 10 years ago — I restored it with bioidenticals,” Ms. Somers, who turns 60 on Monday, said in a telephone interview from Houston, where she was speaking before a group of 1,100 pharmacists. They also recharged her libido, she said, reduced her depression, and rejuvenated her hair, skin and body. (In February 2001, National Enquirer photographed her leaving a plastic surgery clinic, and she subsequently admitted to having had liposuction on her upper back and hips.) The book, though, has raised the hormone levels of at least seven medical doctors. The doctors — three of whom are quoted in the book — generally support the concept of bioidentical hormone therapies but say that too little research has been done to assure that they are safe. Further, they said, they are outraged that Ms. Somers endorses a treatment plan created by T. S. Wiley, a former actress with no formal medical training. Although Ms. Wiley described herself in an interview as “a molecular biologist” and has published two books on women’s health, Ms. Wiley only holds a bachelor’s degree in anthropology from Webster University, in St. Louis. In a letter to Crown, Ms. Somers’s publisher, the doctors wrote, “Wiley dispenses gratuitous advice on significant medical issues including the use of bioidentical hormone therapies, areas that are legally and ethically the domain of licensed medical practitioners.” They continued, “The so-called ‘protocols’ endorsed and promulgated throughout the book may expose women to serious health dangers.” “This is not a territorial fight,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a Manhattan internist and the author of “The Hormone Solution,” who led the letter-writing campaign and is quoted in the book. “It’s about safety for women. Suzanne Somers endorses this non-physician, non-medical person who has created this whole protocol. With this book, she has gone too far.” Most women who receive hormone replacement therapy are prescribed drugs like Premarin or Prempro, which come from the urine of pregnant mares. Bioidenticals, which are also prescribed, are derived from soy, wild yam and other plant extracts. Advocates say their molecular structure is similar to that of the hormones they are replacing and can serve the same purpose. But hormone replacement therapy, in general, is controversial. The National Institutes of Health reported in 2002 that it posed more health risks than benefits for women in a clinical trial, yet that conclusion hardly appears to be the last word. Little research has been done on the bioidentical alternatives, and it is not even known how or if they work, nor whether they carry the same risks as the drugs, like for breast cancer. “We just don’t have the information, and I think it would be irresponsible to promise that for women without the information,” said Dr. Isaac Schiff, the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. “No one has proven that the bioidentical is any safer or any more harmful than Premarin.” Ms. Somers insists she merely empowers women to ask about the bioidenticals as an alternative to traditional therapies, but the doctors who have written to Crown said she crossed the line by advocating Ms. Wiley’s protocol, which repudiates a single hormonal dose through a monthly cycle and instead recommends raising it “based upon ancient cycles of nature.” Dr. Diana Schwarzbein, an endocrinologist in Southern California who has been treating women with bioidenticals for 15 years, said, “I applaud Suzanne Somers and her efforts to raise awareness of bioidentical H.R.T. to the general public.” But she signed the letter to Crown. “I do believe that they are less harmful than drugs, but the public needs to be given correct information so that they can decide for themselves if they are willing to take the risk,” Dr. Schwarzbein continued. She said she most objects to Ms. Somers’s description of Ms. Wiley as an expert researcher, rather than as the lay person she is who has made a business out of promoting bioidenticals. The criticism seems to roll right off Ms. Wiley, a mother of five who lives in Santa Barbara. “Schwarzbein is smarting because I replaced her as Suzanne’s guru,” she said. Ms. Wiley, 54, said she came upon bioidenticals about a decade ago after suffering from an ovarian cyst, fibroid tumor and lump on her chest. “I got tired of being scared,” she said, and started to work with a molecular biologist to refine what has since become the Wiley Protocol, which consists of a bioidentical estradiol and progesterone preparation in a topical cream (she holds the patent) that is “dosed to mimic the natural hormones produced by your body when you were 20 years old,” she said. Dr. Schiff said that that concept does not resemble any science he knows of. “To take a 50- or 60-year-old woman and give her the same hormonal levels as a 20-year-old who’s having regular periods on her own is all wrong,” he said. According to her Web site, Ms. Wiley charges doctors $1,500 to become certified in her methodology; pharmacies are charged $500 for the right to dispense the product. She said 60 doctors have been trained in the protocol and 12 pharmacies have signed on, though none have paid. On her site, thewileyprotocol.com, she promises that in exchange for the right to use the Wiley Protocol name, she will “drive a revenue stream of customers to you by listing your pharmacy on this Web site” and in a coming book. Members of the medical profession said they were surprised by her boldness. “I truly don’t understand how she can certify anyone to do anything,” said Dr. C. W. Randolph Jr., a gynecologist in Jacksonville Beach, Fla., who was quoted in “Ageless” and also signed the letter to Crown. “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but for a non-physician lay person to have her own hormone protocol for prescription medication is a bit of a question.” Ms. Wiley shrugged this off. “Does it have to come from a pedigreed source?” Instead, she maintains that the debate is really a “fight over women’s bodies and how much money those women are worth to doctors, who gets to prescribe and sell hormones to these women,” she said. “Suzanne is giving women enough ammunition and information to ask the right questions when they go to the doctors. They’re not happy she’s thinking on their own and they don’t want women to do that, either.” Ms. Somers said the Wiley Protocol is just one of many options she advocates. She also takes vitamins, does yoga and has sworn off sugar. “I’m not selling anything,” she said. “I don’t have an agenda. I give every doctor equal time. I spent two years interviewing 16 doctors. It was like getting a Ph.D.”

439-> Works in Which Words Wrestle With Movement
Words played a crucial role in Erica Rebollar and Kim Whittam’s shared evening of works at Danspace Project on Thursday night. Milan Kundera’s cynical, humorous writing inspired Ms. Whittam to create “Laughter and Forgetting,” but the dance itself was largely forgettable, both in movement and in its theme of time passing. Ms. Rebollar’s “Wooden Mary,” a series of vignettes based on iconic female figures, held more shape — at least until the talking started. In “Laughter and Forgetting” four dancers engaged in a highly physical, exhaustive movement vocabulary. Using the momentum of arms raised and held at rigid angles, they whipped their bodies into back turns and sideways tilts or jumped onto one another like children in a playground. But for all the visible effort, the result was colorless. Greig Sargeant, an actor, tried to lighten the mood by offering his ruminations on daylight saving time, though his cliché-riddled speeches were ultimately trying. The setting of Ms. Rebollar’s “Wooden Mary” was spare, except for two red squares on the floor. The work began as Haruka Fujita swayed slightly, eventually facing the audience as her arms rippled from her sides like an ethereal swan. With slinky control, she distorted her body — stretching her arms behind her back like broken wings — and infused the dance with the aura of a Japanese thriller. She inched off the stage, toe to heel. The toe-to-heel motif ran through other sections of the work, which featured six women and one man. Another dancer, Eriko Jimbo, poised on a red square, spun her body into a fury of turns. Dan Kwong, holding a sword, sliced off the heads of long-stemmed white blossoms held by Ms. Fujita. But melodramatic text weighed down the dance. One phrase in particular, “Casting pearls, I am torn between the beauty of the act and the futility of its impact,” transformed Ms. Rebollar’s eerie world into one of unintentional humor, where bodies, even Ms. Fujita’s, didn’t have a fighting chance.

441-> Frightfully Thin Models (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Your disturbing article “When Is Thin Too Thin?” (Thursday Styles, Sept. 21) left me with the question: What do designers (and the linked model agencies) think they are doing? You quoted a beauty editor noting the audible gasps in the audience as these emaciated young women came out  gasps not, as one would think, designers wanted, for the stunning outfits, but shock at the spectral figures walking down the runway. Do designers want to turn people off their clothes, as they seem to be doing by demanding extreme thinness? Are these models, said to be from broken homes, poor nations and barely speaking English, being abused by the agencies and designers? Does no one care about the impact on young girls already overanxious about weight? London and Madrid are taking notice: Shouldn’t the United States? E. Ann Kaplan Stony Brook, N.Y., Sept. 21, 2006

443-> Final Rush to Make Deadline for Drug Coverage
WASHINGTON, May 15 — After procrastinating for weeks, Medicare beneficiaries flocked to centers for the elderly around the country and made frantic telephone calls to insurers on Monday to beat the deadline for getting prescription drug coverage as the initial enrollment period ended. "There seems to be a panic out there right now," said Brian D. Caswell, who runs a pharmacy in Baxter Springs, Kan. "Many of the people who waited this long spend only $30 a month on drugs, and they're being asked to spend about $30 a month on premiums for a prescription drug plan." Carol H. Carter, an insurance counselor at LIFE Senior Services in Tulsa, Okla., said on Monday: "It's pretty crazy around here. We are overwhelmed. We can't help everyone who has called. At the end of the day, there will be some people who do not receive individual help because they waited to the last minute." The first lady, Laura Bush, and Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, went to a church here to broadcast a final message. "Even if you are not taking any medications, it's really important to go ahead and sign up now," Mrs. Bush said. "As you age, it's likely that you will add medications to your health care." Mr. Leavitt said the administration opposed an extension of the deadline, and he defended the financial penalty that would be imposed on most people who were eligible now but deferred enrollment to 2007 or later. Others in the administration and members of Congress from both parties said they supported the idea of waiving the late-enrollment penalty for 2006. The penalty will increase future premiums by 7 percent or more, for an expected surcharge of $2.50 a month next year. For months, the Bush administration has been urging insurers to hire additional telephone operators to handle the expected last-minute surge in enrollment. But stark differences were evident at the two biggest Medicare insurers, the UnitedHealth Group and Humana, which together have 45 percent of the market. Calls to UnitedHealth's toll-free number on Monday were generally answered within two minutes. People calling Humana's line often had to wait more than 30 minutes. (The wait on Medicare's toll-free line often exceeded 15 minutes.) Medicare officials had told insurers they could accept incomplete applications on Monday, provided they followed up immediately to get the missing information from beneficiaries. Humana went a step further, telling callers they could "meet enrollment deadline requirements" simply by leaving their names and phone numbers on an answering machine. "A Humana representative will call you back in the next few days to help you choose your 2006 Medicare prescription drug plan," many callers were told. At a Medicare forum in Cleveland, Marie L. Grant, 66, said she decided to sign up on Monday in the hope that the new program would save her money. She said she had been spending $140 a month in co-payments for drugs to treat diabetes, high blood pressure and other ailments. Why did she wait to the last day? "I never understood the whole mess," said Ms. Grant, a retired nurse. "I got so much mail about this. I just threw it all in the trash. So many stamps they wasted. I didn't understand any of it. I'm so mad. All these different plans." The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who attended the forum, said he checked with his mother on Monday and found that she had not signed up because the new program was "too confusing." He said he made sure his mother enrolled. But he said the deadline was "cruel and unnecessary." Carlos Dupont, 69, was checking his blood pressure on Monday at a pharmacy in North Miami Beach, Fla., when he was asked about the drug benefit. "I have been putting it off because I wanted to get information," Mr. Dupont said. "I am really angry that I have to register for something that should be automatic, and I think there shouldn't be a deadline, and I think the penalty is outrageous." Sherry Whitman, an insurance counselor who serves the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, said people had three basic reasons for not enrolling. Some have health insurance from a former employer and do not need Medicare drug benefits, Ms. Whitman said. "Some have no health problems, don't take any prescriptions and want to take their chances," she said. "Others don't want to be bothered. The new program is too complicated for them." Joanne Addison, an insurance counselor who has advised scores of Medicare beneficiaries in San Francisco, said: "They procrastinated only because they were confused and frightened. They simply did not know or understand what was required of them." Mrs. Bush pointed out that poor people could sign up for drug coverage after the Monday deadline if they qualified for low-income subsidies.

To the Editor: Re “Air Travel: The New Facts of Life” (letters, Aug. 15): I had to laugh at a letter writer’s comment that the simplest way to remove bomb threats on airplanes is to eliminate carry-on luggage except for medicine and books. We’re obviously at different stages in life. His indispensables might be books and medicines; I could never think of boarding a plane without a bare minimum of these items: several diapers, at least one change of outfit per child, assorted baggies of grapes, raisins and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, boxes of long-life milk, sippy cups, one infant aspirator, pads of paper, crayons, stickers, my middle child’s special blanket, my youngest child’s toy lamb, half a dozen books and at least one doll. If anyone still thinks I could do without all the above, I invite him or her to sit next to us on our next flight! Yvette Alt Miller Northbrook, Ill., Aug. 15, 2006

445-> Metro Briefing | New York: Reduction For Thruway Tolls
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a sharp cut in tolls paid by the more than 100,000 commuters who use the New York Thruway as part of a reorganization of the Thruway Authority. Under the plan, which requires the Legislature's approval, the Canal Corporation would become an independent public benefit corporation, and its money would come directly from the state's general fund. The plan would save the Thruway Authority $305 million over six years, with $110 million used to reduce tolls paid by people who buy monthly commuter passes. The rest would go to capital investments, customer service improvements and debt reduction. DANNY HAKIM (NYT)

446-> Liberal, and Proud of It (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Fathers Defeated, Democratic Sons Strike Back” (front page, Aug. 14): In dodging the label “liberal,” the Democratic politicians’ sons are miscalculating. All they have to do is list issues like Social Security, unemployment insurance, Medicare, civil rights, voting rights, child labor laws and the G.I. Bill, and ask their conservative opponents which one of these they would like to revoke. If they did that, “liberal” would be a badge of honor and a vote-getter, rather than a foul epithet.

449-> OPENERS: SUITS; BASIC EXIT
Public relations departments often use corporate code words like "moving on" or "early retirement" to make an unpleasant exit seem as much of a nonevent as possible. Not Gap Inc. The struggling retailer said last week that Jenny Ming, president of its Old Navy division, was leaving after 19 years. A company spokesman gave this explanation to Reuters: "We're in a turnaround," he said. "Today is the right time for us to begin the Old Navy leadership transition." Gap, which also owns Banana Republic, is trying to regain its momentum in the midst of a dismal sales slump. So far this year, the Old Navy division has led the company's decline. Ms. Ming herself was ready to leave, said a person who spoke with her about it, which perhaps explains the somewhat chilly adieu. Gap's chief executive, Paul S. Pressler, praised and thanked Ms. Ming for her service, but added, "I remain confident in the changes we're making in all of our brands, including Old Navy." JEREMY W. PETERS

451-> Seven Stories in Seven Seconds
AFTER Kent M. Swig and his partners paid $418 million for the Sheffield — an occupied 50-story apartment building on West 57th Street in Manhattan — at the height of a soaring real estate market last year, he knew he had to do something special to add some fizz to the marketing campaign. So, faster than you can say “condo plan amendment,” he has added seven stories to the building. A condominium conversion is now under way, and the sales office is open. Still, the 80 remaining tenants in the Sheffield, a brick postwar tower that was once home to 852 renters, were chagrined to discover a note posted near the elevators 10 days ago: henceforth, the floors would be renumbered, and the building would top out at the 57th floor, simply by skipping seven floor numbers. “In accordance with the first amendment to the offering plan, please be advised that the building’s floor numbers will be redesignated,” the note read. The building has also been renamed, to the Sheffield57, both because of its address, on 57th Street near Eighth Avenue, and because of its new 57-story status, according to Ramona Mahtani, director of sales at the building. Nancy Rovelli, an insurance broker who has been fighting efforts to evict her from her market-rate apartment in the building, said her 42nd-floor unit would now be on the 49th floor, and she worries that buyers will be deceived by the change, even though it was disclosed in the amendment filed with the attorney general’s office. She said two tenants had filed a complaint with the attorney general about the change, saying it was deceptive and a form of tenant harassment. “People who are looking to buy will think they are going to be on the 49th floor when it is really the 42nd,” she said. Mr. Swig said that the renumbering was part of a broader transformation of the Sheffield into an essentially new, more luxurious building. Mr. Swig’s partners are Yair Levy of YL Real Estate Developers and Serge Hoyda of S & H Equities. Because many new buildings skip floor numbers to make their buildings seem taller than they are, Mr. Swig said, it is only reasonable for the Sheffield57 to do the same. Besides, he said, the five commercial floors at the base of the building have unusually high ceiling heights, although he declined to provide any figures. “It is a complete re-envisioning,” he said. “The project is brand new.” The project, one of the largest condo conversions ever, was valued by Mr. Swig at more than $848 million in filings with the attorney general’s office. Prices will range from $660,000 for a studio to $1.7 million for a two-bedroom. Under the new plan, the floor numbers skip from 5 to 15, and the large swimming pool, which will have retractable glass walls, will remain on the top floor, now the 57th. But exaggerating building heights isn’t really new. The existing Sheffield already skips both the 6th and 13th floors. The original plans for the Sheffield show the building topping out at only 48 floors. JOBS may now move around the world at the speed of the Internet, but for some outsourcing moguls, location still matters, at least when it comes to real estate. Ramesh Vangal, an Indian entrepreneur who introduced Pepsi to India and went on to start a large information technology company, has bought a sprawling apartment, not in Bangalore, India, but high above Central Park. The apartment occupies most of the 18th floor of the newly restored 110 Central Park South, near Seventh Avenue. The price was nearly $7 million. Mr. Vangal was an independent director of Infosys Technologies, a Bangalore company at the heart of the outsourcing movement. He went on to found the Scandent Group, an information technology company based in Singapore, which proclaims “the world is shrinking.” Mr. Vangal said he and his wife, Katharin Zimpel Vangal, who studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology, “have always had a fascination with New York.” “It is electric; it is a unique experience,” he said. “The energy is something you can connect with, even though I come from someplace far away.” The Vangals’ new home actually combined two apartments, including a 29-foot living room facing Central Park. The 3,010-square-foot space has an oversized master bedroom carved out of several smaller rooms. Mr. Vangal led PepsiCo’s lengthy efforts to get permission to do business in India in the 1980’s. He left to head Seagram’s operations in Asia and the Pacific. He now manages the Katra Group, which has investments in technology, health care and liquor, and, Mr. Vangal said, is looking to “be a bridge” for American investments in India. The Vangals also have homes in Bangalore and Singapore, and are still trying to figure out which one to call their main home, since “life has been quite nomadic,” he said. SINCE colonial times, the government has dutifully delivered the mail. Now the United States Postal Service has added another line of work: selling air rights to help Manhattan high-rises rise even higher. Preservationists recently learned of an air rights sale by the post office — the fourth in the last few years — to the developer Sam Chang, who is planning to put up a 20-story building next to the large, ornate Canal Street Station post office in TriBeCa. The sales have given the Postal Service a chance to participate, indirectly, in the soaring real estate market of the last decade. On West 42nd Street, for example, postal air rights were used to build the 60-story Orion condominium. But preservationists contend that the air rights transfers are not valid and violate federal law. The Canal Street transaction is unusual because the privately owned parcels are so small and the post office site is so large that it appears that more than half of the size, and thus the height, of the building comes from air rights and a parking lot sold by the post office. The transfer was disclosed in a financial filing late last month by a mortgage lender in connection with the new development. Robert A. Anderson, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said the post office received $6.2 million for air rights and the purchase of a post-office-owned parking lot. “I am not aware of any other air rights issues outside these four sites in New York,” Mr. Anderson said. The other two involve post offices in Greenwich Village and Gramercy Park. Community groups have filed suit to try to stop the construction of a 26-story building next to the Cooper Station in the Village. They argued that the air rights transfer was meaningless because the federal government is not bound to follow the zoning code, but their case was rejected by a state judge and they are considering an appeal. Preservationists say the post office has an obligation to do more than sell air rights to the highest bidder. Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, said federal law requires that each sale be reviewed for its impact on historic sites. He said the new Canal Street building would abut the Depression-era post office and also block much of the view of the AT&T Building, a 28-story tower built in 1930 and declared a landmark. Mr. Anderson said the Postal Service was now developing plans to comply with the federal review requirements in the future. But he said the Canal Street sale, negotiated long ago, would not be reviewed. Mr. Chang said he had bought the assembled site from another developer and planned to put up a 20-story Sheraton hotel.

453-> Request to See Son Play Denied
The request of Nelson Peterson, the father of the Oklahoma junior tailback Adrian Peterson, to attend the Sooners’ game against Texas in Dallas on Oct. 7 has been denied by federal probation officials. The elder Peterson, 43, pleaded guilty to laundering money obtained from the distribution of crack cocaine in 1999 and is scheduled to be released from an Oklahoma City halfway house Oct. 5. Under the terms of his parole, he cannot leave the district his halfway house is in for 30 days after he is released, but he had sought permission to attend the game. On Tuesday, Nelson received a letter from a senior probation officer denying his written request. Nelson’s requests to attend Oklahoma’s home games last week against Alabama-Birmingham and Washington this Saturday have also been rejected. He hopes to attend Oklahoma’s home game against Iowa State on Oct. 14 in Norman, Okla., which is in his district.

454-> AFTER THE PENGUINS; Meerkat Love
To the Editor: Re "After a Run of Penguin Chic, It's the Year of the Meerkat" by Charles Lyons [Dec. 17]: Of the spate of new movies about meerkats, Mark Gill, the former president of Warner Independent, observes: "There's a fairly narrow band of audience interest in these animals, meaning there's room for one film but not two." I don't think so. I taped my first meerkat show from television in 1988 and have loved them ever since. A National Geographic poster adorns a wall in my computer room, and there have been meerkat cams in Britain. Another case of the audience ahead of the industry? Amalia Jacobucci Centerville, Mass.

455-> To a Castle, by River and Rail
FROM the terrace of Gillette Castle, on the tallest hill in a row of hills called the Seven Sisters, Long Island Sound shimmers in the distance where the sun-dappled Connecticut River pours into it. All that can be heard is the wind in the trees. It's a million-dollar setting, literally — that's the astronomical price, in World War I-era dollars, the castle cost to build — paid by a wildly successful actor named William Gillette, who created the familiar stage persona of Sherlock Holmes. From 1914 to 1919, in the midst of his international renown as Holmes, Gillette had teams of masons construct his castle from tens of thousands of fieldstones, many bought from local farmers at $1 a wagonload. The result is one of the most unusual houses, overlooking one of the most spectacular vistas, in Connecticut. And because Gillette directed the executors of his estate to keep it from falling into the hands of "some blithering saphead who has no conception of where he is or with what surrounded," it was sold to the state and has been a park for more than 60 years. The view that cost Gillette a fortune to enjoy — and that he showed off to Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein and many other guests — can now be enjoyed free. Gillette Castle attracts about 300,000 visitors a year who tour the house, according to Tom Morrissey, the chief of the outdoor recreation bureau of the State Department of Environmental Protection, which runs the state's parks. An offbeat option for getting there is a restored railroad car pulled by a steam locomotive run by Essex Steam Train and Riverboat. The scene that so captivated Gillette was the lush and beautiful Connecticut River Valley, 200 feet below his castle. Running along it for nine and a half miles, the Essex train roughly follows the west bank of the river. Even with no castle at the end, it's a beautiful ride, though a slow one, requiring the modern passenger to adjust to moving at a top speed of 20 miles per hour. The river, once heavily polluted, now teems with shad and Atlantic salmon. Herons and egrets stand placidly in the shallow salt marshes or show their impressive wingspans in flight. In warmer months, the train also connects some riders to steamboats, and between the train, boats and the castle, visitors can design a variety of day trips. For the bare-bones train-and-castle alternative, drive to the train station in Essex and sign up for Essex Steam Train's castle trip: a 20-minute ride upriver in a restored plain-vanilla train car, a brief crossing on an unglamorous motorized ferry, and a hike of about three-eighths of a mile up to the castle. You'll get at least a taste of travel by steam as you're pulled along by one of the old steam locomotives, whose hissing, rhythmic chugging and haunting whistle epitomized human progress for 150 years. MY 11-year-old son, Tim, and I decided to go for the longer train and riverboat experience, about two and a half hours. Riders who choose the open car can feel the breeze as the train chugs through the forest, meadows and salt marshes. If you ride in the Victorian comfort of the carpeted parlor car, with gleaming brass window sashes and walnut paneling, you can order sodas from swiveling green wing chairs by the windows. The only drawback is that you must choose your car when you purchase round-trip tickets, because the open and parlor cars cost a few dollars more than the plain one. Having ridden in both in the past, Tim and I preferred the parlor car experience for its elegance and plush seating. After 35 minutes, we left the train at the Deep River landing and switched to the Becky Thatcher, a 200-passenger Mississippi-style paddleboat, which took us to East Haddam and back to Deep River, where we reboarded the train. Along the way, on both train and boat, a narrator gave the history of the valley. The trip is popular with families. A conductor, Bob LeBlanc, 80, a former chemical engineer, told me that he emerged from retirement to work on the train for two reasons: "I love trains and I love kids." After returning to Essex, we drove 15 minutes to Gillette Castle State Park. The drive involves a river crossing, and we took the opportunity to make it on the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry, which is run by the state and can carry nine cars. Gillette Castle, impressive no matter how you get there, looms above the river 15 miles upstream from Essex. An eccentric take on the traditional European fortress, it was made with stones of many shapes and sizes pieced together. Gillette prided himself on his design of the castle. "But he was no engineer," said Mr. Morrissey. The roof was so plagued with leaks that by the late 1990's, a passing rainstorm would require workers to set out dozens of pails. The state closed the castle in 1998 for an extensive, $10 million renovation that included shoring up the structure and building a new visitors' center. For all of that, the walls still leak. Gillette was a collaborator of sorts with Arthur Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes's creator, successfully adapting Doyle's work for the stage. In the late 1890's, Gillette rewrote a five-act play that Doyle had written, casting himself as Holmes. It became a hit, and for three decades, Gillette and Holmes were virtually synonymous to theater audiences. It was Gillette who created the lasting image of Holmes, playing him in a deerstalker cap and with a curved calabash pipe. There's surprisingly little of Sherlock Holmes in the castle and surroundings, but a lot of Gillette. The castle has 47 carved wooden doors, no two of which are alike. Some couches are built-ins. Tiffany lamps bedeck the ceilings, and the extensive woodwork is made of southern white oak. Gillette was married for six years but had no children, and his nieces were not interested in living in the castle after his death in 1937, at age 84. In 1943, the state paid just $30,000 for the property, including 184 acres of grounds that are now crisscrossed with hiking paths and picnic spots. In his later years, Gillette lived part time in Tryon, N.C., which also claims him as a favorite son and this year will sponsor its fifth Sherlock Holmes festival on Nov. 10 and 11. But he took special pride in his castle. To take his guests around the property, he had his own train with an engine, two luxurious cars and three miles of track. It's no longer there. (67 River Road, East Haddam, Conn.; 860-526-2336; online at dep.state.ct.us/stateparks/parks/gillettecastle.htm) is open all year free. Tours of the castle are given from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from Memorial Day to Columbus Day and cost $5, and $3 for ages 6 to 17. To get there from Interstate 91, take Exit 22 and Routes 9S and 82E; from Interstate 95, take Exit 69, Routes 9N and 148, and the Chester-Hadlyme Ferry ($3 a car), which operates in spring, summer and fall. (1 Railroad Avenue, Essex; 800-377-3987; www.essexstreamtrain.com) runs on weekends in the spring, daily during the summer and five days a week during foliage season. Several excursions are possible, including a dinner trip on weekends with a four-course meal and two Christmas-themed trips in late November and December. To drive to the steam train, take Exit 69 off I-95 and drive north on Route 9. Take Exit 3, turn left onto Route 154, and drive about a third of a mile to the train. The train and riverboat excursion is $26, and $13 for ages 2 to 11; the train ride alone is $17 and $9; it costs $3 to $5 more for the open and parlor cars. (800-440-7848, www.sherlockholmesfestival.com) takes place in Tryon, N.C., on Nov. 10 and 11 this year.

456-> McDonald’s Shares Sold
The hedge fund run by William A. Ackman, Pershing Square Capital Management, said yesterday that it had sold its shares in the McDonald’s Corporation, after pressuring the company to repurchase stock and borrow against its real estate holdings. Pershing Square still holds a stake of more than 49 million shares in stock options and swaps, Mr. Ackman said yesterday. Pershing Square said in a regulatory filing that it sold 105,125 shares in the second quarter. The swaps and options, which are equivalent to about 4 percent of McDonald’s outstanding shares, are not required to be reported to regulators. Last year, Mr. Ackman urged McDonald’s to buy back stock and demanded an initial public offering of 20 percent of 8,000 company-owned McDonald’s stores. He dropped those requests after the company said it would repurchase $1 billion in stock and license 1,500 restaurants.

457-> In 'It Isn't the Moon...' a Therapist and Her Patient, Both With a Little Mania
"Over the past seven years, Christina wrote 'It Isn't the Moon ...' in her spare time," says this show's program biography for the playwright Christina Fragola. Perhaps that is its problem. Regrettably, this Red Wall Productions presentation at Manhattan Theater Source bears the marks of that long, spare-time composition. Fragmented and ill constructed, this self-congratulatory valentine to therapists (Ms. Fragola is a professional mental health worker) suffers from a lack of focus and poorly drawn characterizations. Perhaps seven years was too much. Or too little. In the play a confident New York therapist, Dr. Clark, accepts a new patient, Cassie, who wackily sashays into her office and begins to natter on about ice cube trays and fantasies of her own funeral. There's more to this woman than meets the eye, muses Dr. Clark, who over the course of the 85-minute show uncovers a few unsurprising neuroses and dissipates Cassie's guilt over the suicide of her brother. Interpolated into this therapy are some unorthodox techniques, including a tendency toward very bad improvised rap and a game of tug of war with a rope that, later in the play, is integrated into the story of the brother's suicide in a manner that verges on bad taste. You can't fault the actors. Yvette Ganier, a veteran of several August Wilson premieres, struggles valiantly with the character of Dr. Clark, but to no avail. Often her confidence and enthusiasm give her patient's mania a run for its money. (Note to the director, Rosalyn Coleman Williams: it's bad form to allow one of your leads to clutch the script, unconvincingly posing as a notebook, so clearly to her chest midway into a three-week run.) Pennie Diamond Quintana as Cassie starts the play promisingly, with a distracted energy and curious humor that draw the attention, but it doesn't go far from there. Sad to report, "It Isn't the Moon" isn't a lot of other things either, a finished play being one.

458-> Flipping Their Lids
NEITHER Esphyr Slobodkina nor Dr. Seuss, children’s authors who made imaginative use of chapeaus, could have made sense of all these hats. Some were steeped with more historic and geographic references than Epcot; others, like the clever caps at Bottega Veneta, were devoid of comparison to anything that preceded them. Marc Jacobs’s oversize toboggans, berets and bucket hats; Balenciaga’s mod riding hats; a hunting cap named after Elmer Fudd — all had a cutesy animated feel, which requires some explication. These are not simple looks to pull off without looking infantile. Some of the more whimsical styles, turbans with sleeves dangling to the shoulders (Louis Vuitton) or the berets stretched out like pizza dough (Giles Deacon), may be the designer equivalent of those felt jester hats worn by teenagers on the slopes — all flash. But within the many variations of berets, knit newsboy caps and more, there are wearable styles you can, well, take your hat off to.

Pope Benedict XVI waded into Italian politics, saying he "cannot remain silent" over the government's pledge to legally recognize unmarried couples. In a long year-end speech to the Vatican bureaucracy, the pope said that such legal recognition not only diminished the institution of marriage, but also put relations between men and women on the same level as homosexual couples. He also dismissed recent criticism from some politicians that the church should not speak out on the issue, insisting, "If one says the church should not interfere in these matters, then we can only respond: should mankind not interest us?"

The chart below is an attempt, admittedly selective and incomplete, to survey the first five years of our post-9/11 world — a world that is certainly new, though not always brave. (pdf)

462-> Art in Review; Allan McCollum
The Shapes Project Stephen Prina The Second Sentence of Everything I Read Is You Friedrich Petzel 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea Through Dec. 23 The means of distribution -- also known as the market -- is a looming subject in the art world these days, and Allan McCollum and Stephen Prina have clearly been giving it some thought. So perhaps has Friedrich Petzel, who scheduled their side-by-side solo shows in his gallery and its generous project space next door. Mr. McCollum has long questioned notions of originality and uniqueness with found motifs (in both two and three dimensions) and intimations of mass production, all the while sticking largely to abstraction. For "The Shapes Project," he devised a computer program that can, in theory, eventually generate enough unique motifs that everyone in the world can have one. Eventually is the key word here. In the meantime, Mr. McCollum has produced 7,056 examples of the shapes, small and framed, in black on white. They resemble emblems, irregular hand grenades or exotic knife blades and are displayed wall-to-wall on a ramp with 98 1 1/4-inch shelves that fills most of the gallery. The effect, of a stadium full of art looking at you, the viewer, is quite amazing. Next door, Mr. Prina's "Second Sentence of Everything I Read Is You" orchestrates his interests in painting, music and appropriation into a quietly delirious multimedia experience. The work is a pink-carpeted listening lounge with four big plywood ottomans whose pink cushions qualify as paintings. But -- as a spotlighted speaker hints -- the main event is a choral piece written and recorded by Mr. Prina. The music is hauntingly tender, despite that fact that its lyrics quote art critics and economists. This weirdly romantic environment is a world unto itself in more ways than one. It all fits into the bases of the ottomans, which double as shipping crates. Mr. Prina intends that the piece will travel to interested museums and galleries without benefit of cleaning or conservation until it literally falls apart, and is just a memory. ROBERTA SMITH

464-> Nacco Industries Announced Merger With Appliance Rival, Applica Inc.
Nacco Industries said yesterday that it would merge its Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex business with a rival, Applica Inc., in a bid to create the largest American company focused on small home appliances. Nacco, which has other operations that include forklift trucks and coal mining, and Applica estimated that the new Hamilton Beach Inc. would have annual sales of $1.1 billion. Applica sells appliances under licensed brand names like Black & Decker and its own brands, including Windmere. The combined company’s products will range from coffee makers to self-cleaning cat litter boxes. In the transaction, Nacco, based in Cleveland, will spin off Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, which is based in Richmond, Va., in a tax-free deal to its shareholder, and then take it public by merging it with Applica. The combined company would be based in Richmond. The chief executive of Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Michael J. Morecroft, will become chief of the new company. Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex will also pay Nacco a dividend of $110 million. After the spinoff, Nacco shareholders will retain ownership in Nacco.

Mr. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, was convicted in 2002 and is serving 20 years to life in prison. His lawyer had based the appeal on a claim that the deadline for prosecuting Mr. Skakel had passed long before his trial. The Connecticut Supreme Court concluded that legislators, who had removed a five-year statute of limitations on murders that did not involve the death penalty, intended to remove the deadline for all crimes for which the statute of limitations had not yet expired, which included Ms. Moxley's killing.

To the Editor: I read with great sadness, as a lifelong book-loving New Yorker, your article about the late, great bookstores in Manhattan ("Shelved," Oct. 15), but also with great irony, as I had just spent 10 hours putting books on the new shelves of an independent bookstore about to open. My 24-year-old daughter is fulfilling a long-held dream by opening a general used and new bookstore in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, where we live. The community has responded with great enthusiasm; there's simply something special about a small bookstore. Perhaps it is, as Oscar Wilde said about second marriage, the triumph of hope over experience, but the idea of the independent bookstore remains alive and strong. Louise Forsyth Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn To the Editor: Schulte's on Fourth Avenue -- that was a bookstore.

EVARTS--Katharine Avery of Kent, CT died peacefully on April 19, 2006, at the age of 107. She was born in Westbury, Long Island on October 29, 1898. As a child, Mrs. Evarts lived with her family at "Wheatly." Summers were spent in Newport, where she became an accomplished sailor, inspired by her father, Edwin D. Morgan, who had defended the America's Cup with the sloop Columbia in 1901. She lived in Windsor, Vermont, during her marriage to Jeremiah Maxwell Evarts, where she managed the Evarts family farm. She and her five children moved to New York City in 1935 where she worked at the Brearley School from which she had graduated in 1916. Mrs. Evarts moved to Kent at the suggestion of her sisterin-law, Dr. Josephine Evarts, in 1941 and bought a beautiful old farm on Cobble Lane. She continued with farming, bringing down a few cows, horses, and equipment by train and truck from the old farm in Vermont. Little by little Cobble Hill Farm developedinto a prize-winning Golden Guernsey dairy herd. She loved running it, mainly with the help of Myron Jennings, her favorite farm manager. He worked for and with her from 1946 until she entered The Kent nursing home in 1995. She was a great believer in hard work, education, citizenship, and responsibility. A very important part of her life in Kent was her work with allthe boards and committees she served on to help make the world a better place. For 40 years she worked with League of Women Voters in Kent, including serving as president. She was a charter member of FISH, served on the Board of Deacons at the Congregational Church, was a member of the Republican Town Committee, belonged to the Kent Grange and served on the Farm Bureau Board as well as the Extension Service Board, the Connecticut State Board of Planned Parenthood, theConnecticut Child Welfare Association Board, and was president of the Litchfield County Republican Women's Association. In addition, and in the tradition of her great-grandfather, Edwin D. Morgan, Civil War governor of New York, she ran for he Connecticut House of Representatives. She was elected in November 1958, to represent the Town of Kent, and served for four terms. After her retirement she became an active member of the OWLs (Organization of Women Legislators), which worked to push for state legislation on behalf of women's needs and issues. She is survived by four children: Mary Steele of Cambridge, Mass.; Katharine E. Merck of Lexington, Mass.; Elizabeth E. de Rham of Cambridge, Mass.; and Jasper M. Evarts of South Dartmouth, Mass.; 19 grandchildren, 36 great grandchildren, and 2 greatgreat grandchildren; and by Sue Howland, a devoted helper for more than 40 years. She was predeceased by her oldest son, Maxwell Evarts, of Mount Kisco, New York, who died in 1986, and by her oldest grandchild, Katharine Evarts Merck, who died in 1961. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Katharine A. Evarts Scholarship Fund at the Kent School, Kent, Conn. 06757 (only children of residents of the Town of Kent are eligible for these scholarships).

An Atlanta jury convicted a 79-year-old woman of murder in the shooting of her 85-year-old former boyfriend, rejecting her plea of insanity. The judge sentenced the woman, Lena Driskell, to life in prison plus five years for the death of her former boyfriend, Herman Winslow. In closing arguments, Ms. Driskell's lawyers said her jealous delusions about Mr. Winslow and other women became the motive for shooting him to death after Mr. Winslow ended their 14-month relationship. But prosecutors argued that Ms. Driskell could not plead insanity because she had admitted that she knew she was wrong when she shot Mr. Winslow.

472-> In a Country of Closed Doors, Newcomers Yearning to Fit In
Are you a terrorist? A prostitute? Have you ever taken part in genocide? In Federico Restrepo and Loco 7’s “Open Door,” now at La MaMa E.T.C., these are some of the questions posed to prospective immigrants to the United States. Shortly after that, a half-seen man is besieged with insistent questions about his plans to work while he is in this country. Then, when he is finally admitted, the audience sees that he is half man, half horse. Give us your tired, your poor, your centaurs. “Open Door” is billed as a “dance puppet music odyssey,” as good a description as any. It is a striking, evocative theater experience with music by Elizabeth Swados and a cast of 11 performers (the Loco 7 company), 3 musicians and countless puppets, ranging from a flock of delicate white birds to hideous, oversize human heads with malicious expressions. Segment by segment, the show may not always make its specific messages clear. I had interpreted a scene in which three female marionettes of various ethnicities expand to apartment-building size as an expression of a growing power felt by immigrants as they make homes and settle into their new country. Later I read that the marionettes were meant to represent the immigrants’ backgrounds as opposed to the immigrants themselves. In an early scene four barefoot performers in business suits circle a clear plastic globe as big as a beach ball and suck the air out of it. Because they do this by placing straws in the globe and inhaling, the image suggests drug use, which suggests in turn that these powerful corporate types enjoy their irresponsible actions to the point of intoxication. Mr. Restrepo was born in Colombia and first came to New York in the 1980s. His troupe, Loco 7, is named for his 1989 show, an exploration of the city’s subways.

Thanks for continuing the provocative discussion on the roles and (subtextually) body types of men and women. Catherine Duckett Highland Park, N.J. To the Sports Editor: The article glorifies Holley Mangold, but the facts warrant a warning, not a celebration. Because she is carrying 310 pounds on a 5-foot-9 frame, how long will it be before her knees deteriorate? What is her risk for diabetes? The athletic achievements of young women foster fitness and self-esteem. Obesity, however, is a major health issue in the United States. In addition, varsity football has negative effects on the health and education of the participants. You should consider these larger issues. Donald Shernoff White Plains

475-> Paid Notice: Deaths
SHAPIRO--Saul A. Of Westchester, NY and Scottsdale, AZ, died May 1 from cancer. A young and vigorous 80, Saul was an avid tennis player, cyclist, hiker and skier; above all, he was a dedicated private pilot. On the cusp of his 80th birthday, Saul piloted his Cessna Skymaster from Danbury, Connecticut to north of the Arctic Circle, touching down in Ft. Yukon, Alaska. He loved nothing more than tiring out younger companions on the ski slopes or tennis courts. Raised in New York City and a graduate of NYU, Saul first opted for the rugged life, working as a lumber jack in upstate New York. Later, he entered his father's business, serving as the production manager at the Tailored Junior Dress Company. Thereafter, he charted his own course, first in the sand and gravel business, then as a builder of apartments and retail centers and finally as a developer of real estate projects in the New York area and as an owner of the Buckingham Hotel. Saul, a humble person with a strong will, great moral character, deep curiosity and infinite patience, loved conversation, a sun-filled day, solving a construction challenge, pushing his physical limitations and looking down from 5,000 feet. And we, his loving wife Susan, and devoted son Stephen and daughter in-law Amy, will always turn our heads to the sky and look for "3 Whiskey Whiskey" when a white plane passes overhead. He is also survived by his sister Estelle and her family, niece Cheryl and nephew Sandy. Contributions may be made to the Joint Distribution Committee 212-687-6200; or the United Jewish Communities and Federations of North America 888-639-1919. A service will be held on May 11 at 2:30 PM at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 W. 76th St, in Manhattan.

476-> Subway Recycling (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Inquiry Says Free Papers Make Subway Floods Worse” (news article, Oct. 26): Often people do not wish to throw away a newspaper, so they leave the newspaper intending it to be helpful and not for it to be blown onto the tracks. Perhaps the problem may be alleviated by having newspaper recycling bins in the subway system, as they have in the Metro in Washington. Sylvia S. Shweder New York, Oct. 26, 2006

477-> Market Forces Pushing Doctors to Be More Available
Alice Kissell, 58, a longtime asthma patient, still gets indignant when she recalls the brusque receptionists and hours of waiting to see a doctor at her former health maintenance organization in Southern California. "You felt like a herd of cattle running through," she said. But a few years ago, she moved to Whitehouse, Tex., a small town near Tyler in the northeast part of the state. Now Ms. Kissell has a family doctor who knows her and who, despite having a thriving practice, seems never too busy to see her. "All I have to do is call up, and I'm in there and she's taking care of me," she said. It is not just a matter of moving to a small town. Ms. Kissell's doctor, Melissa Gerdes, is one of a rapidly growing number of physicians who have streamlined their schedules and added Internet services, among other steps, to better meet the needs of patients. For physicians like Dr. Gerdes, it is simply good business. Those doctors know that as walk-in medical offices and retail-store clinics pose new competition, and as shrinking insurance benefits mean patients are paying more of their own bills, family care medicine is more than ever a consumer-service business. And it pays to keep the customer satisfied. "It's about the patients — making people well and keeping them well," said Dr. Gerdes, 35, who has had her own practice for seven years. Professional societies for family doctors and internists are urging their members to break with tradition by making it easier to schedule appointments — or even making appointments unnecessary in the case of walk-in patients who need immediate attention. "It's a big trend," said Amanda Denning, a spokeswoman for the American Academy of Family Physicians, which has about 94,000 members. The academy is spending $8 million on consultants who visit doctors nationwide to suggest improvements in patient care. The advice is meant to "keep them from going to an in-store clinic," Ms. Denning said, while also benefiting doctors by making office procedures more efficient. Meanwhile, the 119,000-member American College Of Physicians is promoting "patient-centric care," which it made the focus of a policy paper this year, calling for more consumer-friendly scheduling, electronic medical records and electronic prescriptions, among other measures. In Dr. Gerdes's office, the innovations include daily clinics at lunchtime called QuickSick, in which patients who have phoned up that morning can come in for routine problems requiring immediate attention, like an upper respiratory infection, and are guaranteed they will be examined, treated and on their way within a half-hour. After a nurse checks the patient's temperature and blood pressure and types the symptoms into a computer, the doctor follows up with a brief exam. If medication is warranted, Dr. Gerdes can e-mail a prescription that will be ready when the patient arrives at the pharmacy. "I can see three patients with acute needs every 15 minutes," she said. The charge is $52 to $60, which is coverable by insurance and similar to prices at many of the new clinics springing up in places like CVS pharmacies and retail chains like Wal-Mart. According to various polls, cost is a high priority for most patients. "People will change physicians for differentials of $10 or $15 in a co-pay," said Dr. Anne B. Francis, a pediatrician in Rochester and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Pediatrics. But convenience also ranks high. That is one reason about 20,000 of the 59,000 actively practicing members of the American Academy of Family Physicians now use electronic health records. Being highly computerized can let doctors offer Web-based scheduling that enables patients to book their own appointments. Many of those doctors also offer what Dr. Larry S. Fields, the academy's president, refers to as "open scheduling" — setting aside certain hours each day for seeing previously unscheduled patients. "We try to cut down on the waiting time," Dr. Fields added. "We need to be more conscious of patients' time." He said that because patients who work may often prefer to fit in a medical appointment around their lunch hours, doctors have started taking their own meal breaks later and postponing tasks like hospital rounds so they can be available at midday. And instead of overbooking, as doctors have long done to maximize business, some physicians now are leaving up to 70 percent of their daily schedules available for patients who call before 1 p.m. for a same-day appointment, said Dr. Michael S. Barr, a vice president of the American College of Physicians, which includes 70,000 internists in active practices. Although doctors might fear losing income if valuable office time is left open for same-day appointments, surveys by some medical groups have shown the opposite result. The number of office visits declined slightly, but revenues increased as pleased patients had more time to fully discuss their problems, which doctors then treated and received compensation for. Another payoff can be a sharp drop in no-show patients, if appointments are available on short notice and patients know they will be seen promptly, said Dr. David G. Bundy, a pediatrician who has studied doctor access as a researcher at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. About half of the 200,000 physicians' offices have rudimentary forms of online scheduling, which typically require the information to be entered manually onto the office calendar by an aide who must call back to confirm or propose an alternative time. Now, though, some doctors have online scheduling software that sorts through the available time slots and confirms an appointment in real time. Dr. Ellen Blye, an internist with a busy practice on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, said about one in 10 of her patients used the online scheduling system she leased from NexSched, a start-up in Marcellus, N.Y., near Syracuse. Michael W. Davis, executive vice president of Himss Analytics, a health care technology consulting firm, said that NexSched and a handful of competitors were "just beginning to penetrate the market" and that fewer than 1 percent of physicians offices had installed the technology so far. "The patients who use it, love it," Dr. Blye said. "They can see what is available and do it any time." Although she does not offer same-day scheduling, her patients "can often come right in, if they see that someone has canceled." Dr. Blye said that electronic scheduling, together with electronic medical records — a system made by GE Healthcare — enabled her staff of two internists and two nurse practitioners to save on overhead by eliminating one clerical employee. Pediatricians have been ahead of most doctors in staying open late and on Saturday mornings. There can be drawbacks. If doctors leave large blocks of their schedules available for impromptu visits, it can become difficult for patients to book routine appointments in advance with some pediatricians, said Dr. Thomas Handler, a health care research director at the Gartner Group, a technology consulting firm. "Open access can work wonderfully for urgent care, and horribly for routine annual visits," he said. The same computerization that makes online scheduling possible can also open the door to online consultations, which usually involve questions that patients ask about routine matters like diet or possible changes in the strength of a prescription drug. The patient can go online at any convenient time, and the doctor often replies the next morning. But because health plans only rarely pay for these e-visits, such services have been slower to catch on. And for all the new openness that many doctors are adopting, some efforts seem mainly defensive moves against the retail clinics, which are typically operated by nurses. At its annual meeting this month, the American Medical Association called on the clinics to accept a list of principles that would limit their scope to simple services and ensure that a physician oversees the operations. "Patients want quick and easy access to health care services, but they shouldn't have to worry about the safety and quality of care provided in these clinics," said Dr. Rebecca J. Patchin, an A.M.A. board member. Several of the large clinic chains say they are already operating under similar guidelines issued last December by the Academy of Family Physicians. In Texas, Dr. Gerdes is the head of a planning group at the Trinity Clinic system in Tyler that is discussing "how we will respond when retail clinics come to Tyler and what we can do to improve access for the patient." Her clinic in Whitehouse is part of the Trinity Mother Francis Health System, and she is a Trinity system board member. She acknowledges that not all her fellow doctors are ready for change. "Quite a few are interested, but probably just as many are not interested," she said. "I'm just not happy with the status quo. You can always be better." So far, Dr. Gerdes has a happy patient in Alice Kissell, who says she is a big fan of the innovations. "I just wish more doctors would do what Dr. Gerdes is doing," she said.

478-> World Briefing | Asia: Pakistan: 8 Arrested In Rockets Plot
The authorities have arrested eight suspects, all Pakistanis, in connection with foiled rocket attacks in and around the capital, Islamabad, last week. Interior Minister Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao said there were indications that the suspects had links to Al Qaeda and had received training in Afghanistan. He gave no further details, including the suspects' identities, but said a large cache of weapons and explosives was recovered from the suspects. Last week, two rockets attached to cellphones and fitted with launchers were found near the Parliament building, and another two near the military intelligence headquarters. Those discoveries followed a small explosion from an improvised device in a park near President Pervez Musharraf's army residence in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad, on Oct. 4. Mr. Sherpao said the suspects did not intend to attack the president, but rather to create panic. SALMAN MASOOD (NYT)

479-> Gallaudet Students Protest New President
About 200 Gallaudet University students blocked access to a campus building to protest the selection of Provost Jane Fernandes as president. Ms. Fernandes is scheduled to take over the university, which is for the deaf, in January. Her critics say that the selection process is unfair and that she lacks the necessary leadership skills. Ms. Fernandes has said that some people do not consider her “deaf enough” to be president; she was born deaf but grew up speaking and did not learn American Sign Language until she was 23.

480-> From a Poet's Failing Sight, a Novel 'Seeing Machine' Emerges
A poet and artist has enlisted the help of scientists and engineering students to create a "seeing machine" that may eventually help people like her, with severely impaired vision, to read, look at pictures and explore landscapes and buildings. Elizabeth Goldring's eyesight has come and gone over the years. Mostly, it has gone. Now 61, she has had juvenile diabetes since college, and the disease has pecked away at her vision, causing hemorrhages in her retinas, the fragile layer of light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye. About 10 years ago, when she was nearly blind in both eyes, her doctor recommended a test to find out whether she had any healthy retina left at all. The test involved a large $100,000 machine called a scanning laser ophthalmoscope, which would let the doctor examine her retinas and project images directly onto them. If there were any live spots, the device might let her see. It worked. She saw a stick-figure turtle. Ms. Goldring, a poet who has had three books published, asked to see a word. She was able to read "sun." It was the first word she had seen in many months. "For a poet, that's an incredible feeling," she said. "I said almost immediately, 'I need to get in touch with the man who invented this machine.' " She wanted a scaled-down version to use on her own, and she thought other people with impaired vision would want one, too. About 14 million people in the United States have low vision — deficits that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses, according to the National Eye Institute. Diabetes, glaucoma and the retinal disease macular degeneration are among the most common causes. Ms. Goldring had tried just about every device made to help people with low vision, but the doctor's machine was far better than any of them. She imagined using a home or library version of it. The idea of creating a new device did not intimidate her: though she is not a scientist or engineer, she works at the Center for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "I was convinced it would work," she said, though she added, "at first people were really, really suspicious." She and a team of M.I.T. students collaborated with the machine's inventor, Robert W. Webb, a researcher at Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration paid for part of the project. The result is what Ms. Goldring calls a seeing machine, a smaller, simpler desktop device that cost less than $4,000 to build. It consists of a projector, computer, monitor, eyepiece and a joystick for zooming in and out. It uses light-emitting diodes instead of a laser. Ten people with severely impaired vision tried out the prototype as part of a pilot study, Ms. Goldring said. Most had diabetes or macular degeneration, which is becoming more common as the population ages. The patients used the seeing machine to look at words and navigate through virtual architectural models. "I can't think of a one of them that didn't respond very vividly and excitedly to the experience," Ms. Goldring said. She and her colleagues described the pilot study in a recent article in a medical journal, Optometry. But no seeing machines are available for sale yet. "Ten patients is great, but we need to do a large-scale test of the machine," Ms. Goldring said. Dr. Webb agreed that more testing was needed but said he thought that the machine would ultimately be useful to only a small minority of people with low vision. Even with the seeing machine, people with badly damaged retinas will not be able to read normally. Most can see only three or four letters at a time or tiny bits of a picture, and even that can be hard and slow. For people with vision like hers, she said, words like book and door can be almost indecipherable because the letters b or d followed by o create a weird visual effect. For that reason, Ms. Goldring created a "visual language" that combines letters and simple pictures to represent hundreds of nouns and verbs. For example, the word book is a b, the outline of an open book and then a k. Door is a d, the outline of a doorway and then an r. Patients in the study liked the visual language and it made reading easier and faster; one woman liked it so much she wished her recipes could be written in it, Ms. Goldring said. She said she thought the machine might eventually be used to help people look at material from Internet libraries for people with impaired vision, so that the images were not too complicated for them to process. The machine might allow people to study the layout of places they are about to visit, to make it easier to get around. Ms. Goldring said she tried this, asking students to videotape the interior of a building at M.I.T. that she had never entered. "It was too complicated, but I looked and looked," she said. "Then I went by myself. My sense of confidence was something entirely different." Just knowing the location of staircases or the arrangement of buttons in an elevator can be enormously helpful, she said. She has also been using the machine to help her create artwork that she calls "retina prints," impressionistic, digital portraits of the world as she sees it, superimposed on faint images of structures of the retina, her own and other people's. Ms. Goldring hopes that eventually the seeing machines will be mass produced and available for even less than $4,000. "My dream is that these seeing machines will make it out of my laboratory and into the hands of people who could use them," she said.

481-> Hewlett Profit Restated to Show an Increase
SAN JOSE, Calif., June 6 (AP)  Hewlett-Packard restated its second-quarter profit to show a $443 million increase on Tuesday and raised its income forecast for the remainder of the year to reflect a tax settlement with the federal government. The company said the settlement increased its previously reported second-quarter profit by 15 cents a share, bringing net income for the three months that ended April 30 to $1.9 billion, or 66 cents a share. Net income at Hewlett-Packard was $966, or 33 cents, in the period last year. The settlement, signed with the Internal Revenue Service on June 1, also prompted Hewlett-Packard to raise its profit forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year by 15 cents a share. The company expects profit before amortization and other costs to be $2.19 to $2.23 a share, compared with the $2.04 to $2.08 forecast in May.

482-> Singing With Gritty Praise for God
“After Sept. 11 we still trust you, God, ’cause you never make a mistake,” Tye Tribbett declared as he started his set on Tuesday night at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. “I have no other choice.” He was performing at “A Night of Healing,” the fifth annual gospel concert presented by WRKS-FM (known as Kiss-FM, 98.7) near the anniversary of 9/11. Gospel’s reaction to 9/11 — and to other sorrows and troubles, small and large — is to call for continued faith and ever more praise. The concert featured eight bands and two preachers: Bishop George C. Searight, a jovial master of ceremonies, and Bishop Noel Jones, who preached a sermon on faith as the antidote to anxiety with his voice rising and rasping in the cadences of classic gospel oratory. When he quoted Psalm 34, the crowd recited it along with him. Gospel is participatory, and a gospel concert has less to do with individual songs than with galvanizing the audience. Virtuosity and showmanship are presented as evidence of faith, though they’re also hugely entertaining. The lineup mingled longtime performers — like the Clark Sisters and Fred Hammond — with younger ones who are steeped in current R&B, like Donnie McClurkin and Kelly Price. They sang, preached, and sang some more, each set cresting with affirmations that bounced between the stage and the crowd. Mr. Tribbett, wiry and agile, had a band, a horn section and a dozen singers filling the stage, sometimes all doing dance moves in sync like a funk act. His songs used the buildups of rock power ballads, the slow strut of P-Funk and churchy, organ-driven call-and-response; his voice rose to a gritty shout as he declared, “Victory!” Mr. McClurkin has one of the strongest and most supple voices of his generation of gospel singers. He uses the velvety baritone croon of an R&B ballad singer, rising to an almost operatic falsetto; he can be tenderly imploring or commanding. At times his singing suggests Al Green and Mr. Green’s inspiration, the Rev. Claude Jeter. Mr. McClurkin can pepper a song with rhythmic syllables or sustain a long, arching phrase. His set reached back to old-fashioned gospel and up to a dance hall, and he also drew a doctrinal line, singing, “You are the only living God: not Buddha, not Krishna, not Muhammed.” The Clark Sisters, who have been singing together since the 1960’s and had a dance-music hit, “You Brought the Sunshine,” in 1981, made gospel swing. Three of them often harmonized like a big-band horn section (or the Pointer Sisters), while a fourth seized the lead. Elbernita Twinkie Clark, who also played organ, scat-sang in a bright upper register. After such extroversion Mr. Hammond made his set almost confessional, singing quietly and humbly asking God, “Do you love me?” Kelly Price, who has also made secular albums, called herself a “big church kid” and sang gospel songs close to R&B ballads, while J. Moss, best known as a songwriter, revealed a big, swooping voice to rival his clients. Richard Smallwood’s gospel songs looked toward the pomp and elaborate arrangements of classical music, though they came across as stiff alongside the other performers. The concert also included the return of Andrae Crouch, a major gospel star of the 1970’s and 1980’s, who has had four bouts of cancer. His voice was eroded, but he still professed his faith.

483-> Which Cows Do You Trust?
MONROE, Wash. — For demanding consumers, some dairy producers are demanding less milk from their cows — and charging more for it. The dairy companies are bowing to the natural-foods trend by shunning milk from cows treated with genetically engineered growth hormone. By labeling milk free of the artificial hormone, the dairy industry can ride the popularity of natural foods, without the greater expense and special feeds required to produce milk that can be fully certified as “organic.” As a result hormone-free milk can be priced higher than conventionally labeled milk, but less than organic. At a Safeway near central Seattle, for example, a half gallon of conventional Lucerne-brand whole milk was recently selling for $1.69, while the Horizon organic brand was priced at $3.69. Priced neatly in between, at $2.79, was the Darigold milk labeled as “coming from cows not treated with the growth hormone rBST*” The asterisk referred to tiny letters near the bottom of the carton indicating that the Food and Drug Administration says there is no difference between milk from treated and untreated cows. Some milk producers have long avoided the hormone rBST, which is made by Monsanto and was approved by the F.D.A. in 1993. Still, it has been in wide enough use since then, as a way to increase a cow’s milk supply by a gallon or more a day, that many of the nation’s dairy products probably contain milk from cows injected with the hormone. Many pure-food advocates oppose the hormone’s use on health grounds, saying it can require cows to be treated with extra antibiotics and can result in milk with higher amounts of a separate hormone linked to cancer in some studies. But only recently do more consumers appear to be paying heed to those concerns, as part of the growing interest in whole and natural foods. Experts say that avoiding the hormone is the main reason people buy organic milk, whose sales have been growing rapidly the last few years. But organic sales still account for only about 3 percent of the total milk market, so marketers see an opportunity to tap the demand for organic milk by simply eliminating the hormone. “It seems to be an explosion in the industry,” said Kurt Williams, general manager of Lanco-Pennland Milk Producers, a cooperative in the mid-Atlantic region, most of whose members do not use the hormone. “All of a sudden we have national processors like Dean Foods taking entire plants hormone-free.” In June, Dean Foods, the nation’s largest milk producer, stopped accepting milk from hormone-treated cows at a big bottling plant it owns in Florence, N.J., which sells milk under the Tuscan name. That means most of the Tuscan milk sold in the New York metropolitan area is now free of the artificial hormone. Dean Foods is now beginning a similar shift at its New England plants, which market the Garelick Farms brand, and is considering a similar move in Texas. Still, Dean Foods says only 10 of its 100 milk processing plants around the country offer milk from untreated cows. “Are we doing a wholesale shift? No,” said Marguerite Copel, a spokeswoman for Dean. “Are we seeing movement? Yes.” Darigold, which is owned by the Northwest Dairy Association, a large cooperative, recently began selling milk only from cows not treated with growth hormone. Several other dairy companies in the Northwest have recently done likewise. “I think it’s going to become a competitive disadvantage if you are not rBST-free,” said Randy Eronimous, the director of marketing for Darigold. He said surveys had shown that use of the hormone was beginning to affect consumer decisions on what milk to buy. But at least one of the co-op’s farmers, Jim Werkhoven, says he is not convinced that consumers are really clamoring for milk from untreated cows — or at least would not be without prodding from marketers. “It’s really about milk processors trying to position themselves on the grocery store shelf,” said Mr. Werkhoven, 47, who has been farming since 1979. “All they’re doing is selling fear, and I think that’s a miserable deal.” For about a dozen years Mr. Werkhoven, who runs a herd of 800 cows on a farm in Monroe, about 25 miles northeast of Seattle, injects his cows every two weeks with the hormone. “It’s worth 10 to 12 pounds a cow a day, a little over a gallon a day,” Mr. Werkhoven said, explaining that the hormone raised a typical cow’s daily output from over 70 pounds of milk to somewhat less than 90. He showed a visitor through his barns, where cows with yellow identification tags in their ears munched on a ration made mainly of corn plants or lolled about in sandy stalls. Mr. Werkhoven said it was difficult to estimate the effects on his profit because that depends somewhat on the price of milk. But he is convinced the hormone lowers his cost per gallon. For now, Mr. Werkhoven can continue to use the hormone, because the co-op’s ban applies only to bottled milk, which is consumed in large quantities by children, and not for other dairy products like cheese. Some milk bottlers, including Darigold, are paying small premiums to farmers who sign affidavits certifying they do not use the hormone. (Since there is no test to distinguish milk from treated and untreated cows, claims of hormone-free milk are based on the honor system). A Department of Agriculture survey in 2002 found that 22 percent of the nation’s dairy cows were being injected with the hormone. Currently, about one-third of the nation’s dairy herds are managed using the bovine growth hormone — though not every cow in each herd gets it, according to Monsanto. The substance, one of the first applications of genetic engineering to make its way into food production, is a synthetic version of a natural cow hormone called bovine somatotropin, or BST. Monsanto makes its version — recombinant BST, or rBST — by splicing the cow gene for the hormone into bacteria. Critics say that milk from treated cows contains higher levels of a different hormone — insulin-like growth factor 1 — that has been linked to an increased risk of cancer in people. They also say that inducing the cow to produce more milk increases the risk of udder inflammation, which then leads to increased antibiotic use. Canada has not approved use of the hormone because of its harmful effects on cows. But Monsanto and other proponents of the technology say the amount of extra insulin-like growth factor in the milk is insignificant compared with the amount made naturally in the human body. They also say milk is screened for antibiotics before it can be sold. Dairy companies that are now rejecting the hormone say they are doing so not because milk is unsafe but simply in response to customer demand. “People have become more educated on what they buy,” said Heidi Horn, marketing manager for Wilcox Family Farms. At the company’s milk processing plant in the bucolic countryside south of Tacoma, about 110 gallons of milk a minute are pasteurized, homogenized and squirted into cartons amid a near-deafening clatter of machinery. Since July the cartons have borne the name “Wilcox Natural” instead of just “Wilcox,” because the company eliminated milk from hormone-treated cows. Executives of the dairy said they had been getting requests for rBST-free milk from consumers as well as from school boards, hospitals and retailers, including a big customer, Costco. Judging the true level of consumer demand is difficult. Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the International Dairy Foods Association, a trade group, said that in studies her group helped sponsor, only 30 percent of consumers said they were aware of any issue regarding hormones and milk. And 70 percent of those who were aware said they did not care about it, she said. But when one dairy company makes the shift to rBST-free, it puts pressure on others. The move away from the hormone has been strongest on the West Coast and in the Northeast. But there are signs the trend is spreading. For example Shamrock Farms, a major dairy company in Arizona, recently went rBST-free for all its products. The Prairie Farms Dairy in Carlinville, Ill., has started a review of its policies, said Gary Lee, vice president for procurement. “It’s moving toward the Midwest,” he said. Monsanto is worried enough that in late August it mailed brochures to its farmer customers urging them to defend their rights to use the hormone. “Consumers have choices ... but so do you,” said the brochure. It included a sample calculation to help farmers assess how much money they would lose if they gave up the hormone and asked them to demand compensation. Monsanto does not disclose its sales of the hormone, which it calls Posilac. Kevin McCarthy, an analyst at Banc of America Securities, estimates they will be $250 million this year out of Monsanto’s total sales of $7.2 billion, which will come mainly from seeds, both genetically engineered and conventional, and herbicides. A few years ago Monsanto sued Oakhurst Dairy in Maine, saying its labeling of milk as coming from cows not treated with the hormone was misleading. The dairy added a sentence to the effect that the F.D.A. had found no significant difference between the milk from treated and untreated cows. Some farmers and dairy marketers say that advertising rBST-free milk pits one form of milk against another and could undermine consumer confidence in conventional milk. “If certain products can make these unsettling claims, what does that then say about the milk my family has been drinking for years?” Jerry Kozak, president of the National Milk Producers Federation, a trade group, said in his monthly message to members for September. To be sure, many farmers do not use the hormone, either because they are philosophically opposed to it or because its use requires more work for them and more food for the cows. “It’s like steroids for athletes,” said Stephen H. Taylor, New Hampshire’s commissioner of agriculture, markets and food and a dairy farmer himself. He said he had tried the hormone but it put stress on his cows and made them thinner. Last month, his wife signed an affidavit, requested by Agri-Mark, a big New England co-op, certifying that the couple’s 80-cow farm does not use the hormone. “A lot of people in the dairy industry say goodbye and good riddance to BST,” he said. But in Monroe, Mr. Werkhoven, who has a refrigerator full of boxes of Posilac, each containing 25 syringes, said his cows had not had any problems. The move to eliminate the hormone, he said, “puts at risk a valuable tool for agriculture and it adds cost to the customer with absolutely no benefit,” he said. “If this is a technology that’s going to go away, I’d be shocked and stunned.”

484-> Children Slip Through Cracks of AIDS Efforts
TORONTO, Aug. 16 — Efforts to greatly expand antiretroviral treatment for AIDS in poor countries are not reaching a vast majority of children who need it, a World Health Organization official said here on Wednesday. The official, Dr. Kevin M. De Cock, who directs the organization’s AIDS program, said that an estimated 2.3 million children 15 and under around the world are infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and that 800,000 of them needed antiretroviral drugs to stay alive. Of the 800,000, only 60,000 to 100,000 are receiving therapy. While the children account for 14 percent of AIDS deaths, they make up only 6 percent of recipients of antiretroviral drug therapy. Many of the children are orphans. “We must conclude that scale-up has so far left children behind,” Dr. De Cock said in a featured talk at the 16th International Conference on AIDS, which has attracted 24,000 participants. His comments drew on an extensive review of progress in efforts to step up antiretroviral treatment. At the same time, Dr. De Cock said, fewer than 10 percent of pregnant women with H.I.V. in poor and middle-income countries are receiving the simple regimen of pills that can prevent the transmission of the AIDS virus to their newborns. By contrast, rich countries have virtually eliminated pediatric AIDS. Dr. De Cock also described an inequity in antiretroviral treatment for injecting drug users, particularly in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. There, these users account for more than 70 percent of people infected with H.I.V. but about a quarter of those receiving treatment. “An urgent priority is improving access to antiretroviral therapy for children, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and for injecting drug users everywhere,” Dr. De Cock said. He also said that women in developing countries were receiving therapy in proportion to the female infection rate. But in an interview, he added that women’s access to follow-up care could still be inhibited. Of the 38.6 million people with H.I.V., about 6.8 million in low- and middle-income countries would be expected to die within two years without antiretroviral therapy. Of these, about 1.7 million are now receiving it, Dr. De Cock said, but for many it is coming too late to get the full benefit of the drugs. The one million now receiving therapy in Africa is 10 times the number who were being treated in December 2003. Still, that figure is two million fewer than the number Dr. Lee Jong-wook had set as a goal when he became director general of the health organization in 2003. The aim was to treat three million by the end of 2005, in a program nicknamed “three by five.” Since Dr. Lee’s unexpected death in May, his supporters have said that he deserved credit for forcing the world to bring antiretroviral therapy to the world’s poor people. “Three by five was not a failure,” Prof. Ruth Nduati, an epidemiologist at the University of Nairobi in Kenya, said at a news conference. She added that the current efforts would not have been possible without “the clarion call of three by five.” Asked when the goal of treating three million people might be reached, Dr. De Cock said he did not want to link a date and number. The first million patients are the easiest to reach, he said, because rapid scale-up programs tend to start in cities, where there are relatively large numbers of patients. Reaching people in rural areas in poor countries “is a more difficult task and may take longer,” Dr. De Cock said. Moreover, delivering antiretrovirals requires a cadre of trained health workers, and they are in short supply in many poor countries. Still, the limited success so far is a concrete rebuttal to the pessimism expressed by many officials in recent years. In 2001, for example, Andrew S. Natsios, then administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, stirred worldwide criticism when he declared that treatment in Africa would not work because the drugs had to be taken every few hours, and that Africans “don’t know what Western time is. Many people have never seen a clock or a watch their entire lives.” Many critics also said H.I.V. would develop a resistance to the drugs if people in poor countries did not take them as prescribed. Dr. De Cock said that the World Health Organization was watching for resistance among patients taking the medicines and that the information would start to become available later this year. In an interview here on Wednesday, Dr. Mark R. Dybul, the United States’ global AIDS coordinator, said, “Three years ago, people were talking about how antiretroviral therapy was not cost-effective, and now the talk is about how can we do more.” Proponents for wider availability of antiretroviral therapy say that AIDS drugs have saved more than three million years of life in the United States alone. But, Dr. Dybul cautioned, “We’re not guaranteed billions of dollars more, and we need to work” for any additional funds. “There are a lot of important priorities in the world.”

485-> Saxophonic Celebration, With Much Symbiosis
The saxophonist David Liebman has all the credentials of a major eminence in modern jazz. In the 1960’s he worshiped at the altar of John Coltrane; in the 1970s he toured with Miles Davis. He has led a handful of fine ensembles through the years, and toiled as a sideman in many others. Among fellow saxophonists and fellow educators, his reputation is ironclad. But perhaps because of the mainstream jazz world’s lingering ambivalence about free jazz and fusion, Mr. Liebman remains something other than a household name. To his credit he has reveled in the freedom of this position: last year he released no fewer than four albums on independent labels. One of them, “Different but the Same” (Hat Hut), provided a compelling starting point for Mr. Liebman’s belated 60th birthday celebration at Birdland this week. (He will perform tonight with a big band, and tomorrow with a sextet billed as “Music of Miles and Coltrane.”) “Different but the Same” documents a quartet inspired by Mr. Liebman’s rapport with a former student, the tenor saxophonist Ellery Eskelin. Each has a close compatriot in the band: the bassist Tony Marino, who has worked with Mr. Liebman for the past 15 years, and the drummer Jim Black, whose history with Mr. Eskelin stretches back nearly as far. In its first set on Wednesday night, the group covered a broad swath of post-bop territory. “Tie Those Laces,” by Mr. Liebman, began with a halting theme that suited its composer, then plunged into section of swing in 11/4 meter for a solo by Mr. Eskelin. The two tenors — Mr. Liebman left his soprano at home — presented a subtle kind of contrast. Mr. Liebman was the more fluid technician and the more harmonically adept soloist, but Mr. Eskelin’s playing was appealingly forceful, and his tone had an effective bite. On a clever exercise that overlaid Cole Porter’s “What Is This Thing Called Love?” with two songs built on its chord structure, Tadd Dameron’s “Hot House” and Lee Konitz’s “Subconscious-Lee,” the saxophonists engaged in a dual improvisation, reaching a state of deep symbiosis. But it was when Mr. Liebman soloed that the performance peaked; he summoned the locomotion of Coltrane without losing his own steam. Mr. Eskelin had a comparable showcase on one of his own compositions, “It’s a Samba.” While it wasn’t much of a samba, it did clear a path for Mr. Eskelin’s energetic bluster, and for a virtuoso turn by Mr. Black. He started quietly — coaxing overtones from his cymbals with a violin bow, thrumming his fingers on a high tom like a tabla player — and worked his way up to a fury. “Ghosts,” the Albert Ayler song that closed the set, sustained a similar intensity. Mr. Black and Mr. Marino threw themselves into a loose-tempo turmoil, as Mr. Liebman ranted and Mr. Eskelin raged. Both tenors attacked the theme with a sense of rigor; each seemed inspired by the other.

487-> Heckling McCain At the New School
To the Editor: Re "In the Garden, Graduates Boo McCain. Kerrey, Too" (news article, May 20): As one who holds a degree from the New School (Ph.D. in political science, 1975), I am embarrassed by the reception given the graduation speaker, Senator John McCain, and Bob Kerrey, the university's president. I have been an opponent of President Bush's invasion of Iraq, but I have no tolerance for people on either side who try to disrupt the expression of views they don't like. It does the New School's long-held reputation for open-mindedness and receptivity to dialogue no good. I also fear that it could reflect negatively on employment opportunities for the school's graduates. I am sure that the founders of the New School, themselves the victims of intolerance, would strongly disapprove of these tactics. James Shelland Bellmore, N.Y., May 21, 2006

490-> Raising Income for Homeowners’ Group
 Kenneth R. Jacobs, a co-op and condo lawyer with offices in Yonkers and Manhattan, said that under the state’s Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, a homeowners’ association may be given the power under its certificate of incorporation or bylaws to charge dues and assessments, to impose fines and reasonable penalties and to charge initiation fees. “An initiation fee is like a flip tax but payable by the incoming member,” Mr. Jacobs said. “So the letter writer should examine the association’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws to see what authority the board has been granted.” If those documents do not give the board the authority to impose such a fee, it may be able to amend the bylaws to provide the necessary authority. Mr. Jacobs added that a homeowners’ association also has the authority to charge fees for services — coordinating move-ins and move-outs, for example, or issuing new membership certificates, but the fees should be reasonable for the service provided.

492-> Company Asks U.S. to Provide Radio Space for Free Internet
In an ambitious proposal, a Silicon Valley company has asked the government to give it a band of radio spectrum for a free high-speed wireless Internet network that would cover most of the country and be supported by advertising. The idea is to create something like an Internet version of broadcast television, using local and national sponsors to pay for what its promoters say would be near-ubiquitous high-speed access. The company, M2Z Networks, is backed by several prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists. It is making a case that its plan could hasten the spread of broadband Internet use and lead to lower prices by spurring competition with the cable and telephone giants that dominate the Internet market. But the idea's success depends entirely on something that its backers cannot control and that some telecommunications analysts say they are unlikely to get: cooperation from the Federal Communications Commission. Under a proposal submitted this month to the F.C.C. and made public recently, M2Z said it would need 20 megahertz of radio spectrum to send and receive wireless signals. Ordinarily, but not always, the government auctions off sections of the radio spectrum, a finite and increasingly valuable asset in the digital era because it is used to carry wireless Internet signals, cellphone calls, broadcast television and many other transmissions. The price of spectrum can vary widely, depending on how effective a particular band is at transmitting information and how many bidders there are, but it can rise into the billions. Blair Levin, an expert in telecommunications policy at Stifel Nicolaus, a financial services company, and a former chief of staff at the F.C.C., said it seemed unlikely that the government would simply give the spectrum away. "The odds are against it," Mr. Levin said. But he said the proposal was interesting because it put a fine point on increasingly pressing policy questions, like whether consumers are adopting broadband access quickly enough, whether it is cheap enough and whether the government should help accelerate the process. The proposal "starts a very interesting dialogue about a number of telecommunications issues in a very concrete manner," he said. The proposal comes as several towns and cities, including San Francisco and Philadelphia, are working with companies to build local Wi-Fi networks to provide free or subsidized Internet access. Chelsea Fallon, a spokeswoman for the F.C.C., declined to comment on the proposal and said the agency did not have a time frame for when it might address the issue. Milo Medin, chairman and chief technology officer of M2Z, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., declined to discuss the company's plans. Mr. Medin, a founder of the @Home Network, a high-speed Internet company that became Excite@Home and went bankrupt in 2001, started the company with John Muleta, a former head of the wireless division at the F.C.C. In its 127-page filing with the agency, M2Z said that the spectrum it sought was not scheduled for auction and could wind up going to waste because it might not be easily used for other functions, like transmitting mobile phone calls. But the spectrum would be enough to deliver the company's proposed free Internet access at 384 kilobits a second, about six times the speed of dial-up, said Bruce Sachs, a partner with the venture capital firm Charles River Ventures. Mr. Sachs said his firm was one of three that backed M2Z in January with a round of financing. He did not disclose the amount raised. "We have the opportunity to provide more competition to the broadband marketplace and to push broadband to the masses," he said. Mr. Sachs said the company expected to spend $1 billion over about 10 years on infrastructure that would cover 95 percent of the country. Investors have already committed $400 million for the construction, money that would come due only if the F.C.C. agreed to give away the spectrum, the proposal says. The company proposes to offer a premium service, at speeds of around 3 megabits a second — comparable to faster services offered by telephone and cable companies — for $30 a month or less. M2Z has offered to give the government 5 percent of the revenue from this service. M2Z plans to include a filter with the free service that would block access to "indecent" material, a definition Mr. Sachs said could be made by the government, just as it controls standards for broadcast television. "Give us the spectrum and we'll provide free service and we'll live with the decency guidelines," Mr. Sachs said. The concept of advertising-supported Internet access is just beginning to emerge, with promoters of the idea, including companies like Google, arguing that it would allow new kinds of marketing, like messages that would reach only those Web surfers within a few blocks of the advertiser.

497-> On the Borderline
Americans do not read many living British poets, nor — except for international standouts like Seamus Heaney — do we see much current Irish verse. Poets who take their bearings from London or Edinburgh, Belfast or Dublin tend to depict realistic characters or places, in poems that grow from a sliver of plot or a stub of event. If these poets seem limited, that may be because we don't read enough of them. Their requirements — brevity, clarity, story — permit approaches as different as Robin Robertson's and Nick Laird's: the first stoic, generalizing and compellingly terse; the second loquacious, voluble, able to revel in details. Scottish by birth (now a publishing executive in London), Robertson portrays dramatic, threatening landscapes and seascapes from Scotland, Ireland and the north of England, in gritty, tactile verse a bit like the young Heaney's: "What the Horses See at Night" follows "a play of herring, a shoal / silvering open / the sheeted black skin of the sea." Though Robertson's title, "Swithering," means "indecision" in Scots, much of the time — as in his two previous books — he sounds grimly certain about his totems and archetypes, his wild animals and wilder weather. Finding discomfiting perils even in Paris, he seems more at home among his rough hills and tides, and a nature deep red in tooth and claw. At an abandoned naval outpost, "Rust, the penetrant/ turns iron maculate" while "The edging wind eats everything." When Robertson appears to address his own life directly, the poems can collapse into self-pity or worse: "In the corner of the shed my father is weeping / and I cannot help him because he is dead." He does better with alter egos like the legendary hunter Actaeon, in Greek myth transformed into a stag, then mauled by his own hounds. One poem makes a soldier returning from war sound like Actaeon incarnate: "what remains of my uniform / tattered and tailed / as velvet from antlers, as moss / flayed from this stretching rack of rock." In "At Dawn," the poet goes for a hike and discovers ill portents: "a mackerel / wrapped in today's paper, one eye / looking up at me," "the lopped head of a roe deer, / its throat full of wire" and — most ominous of all — "a photograph of me." Wringing grave warnings from confident descriptions, Robertson's poems aim more to astonish than to delight. Their world offers little variety, but they do not need it: all they need do is render that world with force enough to make it ours. If Robertson seeks the mythic and the universal, Laird (an Ulster-born lawyer now living in London) dwells on the particulars that distinguish one citizen, or one family, from the rest. His debut also strives for variety: he sets compact songs alongside rural idylls and urbane chatter, scenes from the life of his father near lyrics of romantic dejection, and musings on war (in Iraq and in Northern Ireland) beside tongue-in-cheek odes to socks and to a photocopier. Laird is also a novelist ("Utterly Monkey"), and his feel for contemporary minutiae extends to the language spoken where he lives. In one poem "the punters outside are half-cut and shirty" (i.e., the bar patrons are drunk and irritable). Another poem offers "grape pips" and "a grass-tinselled verge." Laird's ear for "smallish lexical mercies" yields superb lines no American could write: on the Atlantic Ocean, "a blizzard of homogenous decisions breathes above / the folding and unfolding pane and counterpane of waves." (A counterpane is not a window but a bedspread: Laird means that the waves appear, now soft, now hard, now glassy, and now opaque.) Like Paul Muldoon, whose syntax he can emulate, Laird dramatizes problems for which his poems discover no origins and propose no solutions. In the poem alluded to by the title, a sudden crack in linoleum suggests all the flaws in a marriage, or all the flaws in the world: the spreading "fault," its cause never determined, "saves us / from sweeping the kitchen, / and stops us from sleeping." He compares his poems to jokes, to obsolete words, to "twenty-five riddles in a rustic Latin" in the margins of a medieval book. "Like myth," he writes, "the riddle springs from the need to vest life / in the garb of the coldly fabulous." Unlike myth, though, riddles (and their authors) do not set out to justify the workings of nature, society, body or mind. Nor does Laird. He may even enjoy (as Muldoon does) telling us that he offers no great truths: a poem in the voice of an emigrant (perhaps one fleeing the Irish potato famine) begins, "I am sitting down to write to you from habit. / I have nothing important to communicate." Laird's book has attracted unusual publicity in Britain (it doesn't hurt that his wife is the novelist Zadie Smith): its broad span of forms and topics makes it hard to know what sort of poet he wants to become. Whatever the answer, his verbal nuances, and his slippery temperament, already make him worth Americans' time.

498-> Jeans Now Need Their Own Specialist Scholars: Call It Jeanitics
In “The Greening of America,” a much-debated 1970 paean to the dawning of a utopian new age, Charles A. Reich hailed bluejeans as a symbol of the liberating spirit of Consciousness III, the new generation that was going to lead America into an anti-materialist, community-minded, freedom-loving era of love, peace and hope. He wrote that the clothes worn by certified members of Consciousness III were “inexpensive to buy, inexpensive to maintain,” that they suggested “that neither individuality nor distinction can be bought in a clothing store.” “The new clothes demonstrate a significant new relationship between man and technology,” he wrote. “Basically they are machine-made, and there is no attempt to hide that fact, no shame attached to mass-produced goods, no social points lost for wearing something that sells at $4.99 from coast to coast and has its measurements printed on the outside for all to read.” Needless to say, Mr. Reich’s predictions — about bluejeans and just about everything else — have failed to come true. As James Sullivan notes in his pedestrian new cultural history, blue jeans have become a designer staple that routinely fetch $100 to $200 at places like Barneys and Fred Segal, and rare vintage ones can go for tens of thousands of dollars. In 2001, Mr. Sullivan reports in his book “Jeans: A Cultural History of an American Icon,” the oldest known pair of Levi’s in existence, a miner’s pair of buckle-back waist overalls from the 1880’s, went for $46,532 on eBay. Far from being utilitarian garments signifying egalitarianism and the common man, jeans have become status symbols, relentlessly updated, redesigned and embellished, and even more aggressively marketed. They are cropped and embroidered, adorned with rivets and jewels and sequins, injected with Lycra and spandex and polyester, meticulously ripped and shredded and frayed. They aren’t just bleached or prewashed anymore. They’re stone-washed and sandblasted, baked, overdyed, washed in ozonated water , treated with special enzymes, aged in redwood barrels, sandpapered by hand and stained with fake mud, oil and grease — all in an effort to make them look old and worn and to answer what Mr. Sullivan calls consumers’ “demand for imperfection.” The story of what’s happened to jeans post-1960’s is a perfect metaphor for the commodification of the counterculture that has occurred in the last four decades, and Mr. Sullivan, who was a pop culture critic at The San Francisco Chronicle for seven years, dutifully chronicles how this came about, just as he dutifully chronicles the early history of jeans as working men’s garments worn by miners, manual laborers and cowboys. He has interviewed various denim people (manufacturers as well as fashionistas), read a lot of newspaper articles and social and cultural histories, and spun it all into a narrative full of both extremely familiar and obscure facts. The problem is that he does so in a plodding, laborious fashion, without much wit or humor, and without providing any new insights into his subject. To make matters worse, the book’s illustrations feel both paltry and random; indeed, many of the images that Mr. Sullivan discusses — like the Norman Rockwell depiction of Rosie the Riveter that helped popularize work clothes for women during World War II and the racy 1978 Calvin Klein billboard in Times Square that helped hype his jeans line — do not appear in the volume. Mr. Sullivan reminds us that celebrities like Elvis (in “Jailhouse Rock”), Marlon Brando (in “The Wild One”), James Dean (in “Rebel Without a Cause”) and Marilyn Monroe (in “Clash by Night”) helped make jeans seem cool in the 1950’s. He discusses album covers that have prominently featured blue jeans, from the Rolling Stones’ iconic “Sticky Fingers” (featuring that famous zipper) to Bruce Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A.” to the back of Neil Young’s “After the Gold Rush.” He rattles off song titles like “Venus in Blue Jeans,” “Black Denim Trousers and Motorcycle Boots” and “Blue Jean Bop.” And he runs through a litany of brands, both past and present, including Levi’s, Lee, Wrangler, Landlubber, Jordache, Fiorucci, Sergio Valente, Guess, Diesel, Seven for All Mankind, Citizens of Humanity, True Religion, Earnest Sewn, Sacred Blue and Paper Denim & Cloth: labels whose very names conjure different eras and mindsets. In addition, Mr. Sullivan talks to denim consultants who are concerned about pressing matters like “the five-year domination of low rise” and limited-edition “super-collectible” jeans that cost as much as $2,000. Somehow, it’s not what Régis Debray, the French philosopher and onetime comrade of Che Guevara, had in mind when he declared that there was “more power in blue jeans and rock and roll than the entire Red Army.”

499-> The Nitpicking Nation
THEY are single, gay, straight, biracial, conservative, liberal and tattooed  and they have as many preferences for a potential roommate as an online dater has for a potential lover. They are bankers, fetishists, self-declared nerds and drug users. They have old wounds and new hopes, and are willing to barter their cooking and sexual expertise for free or discounted rent. They are all seeking and selling housing on Craigslist.org, the electronic listing service with sites in all 50 states and more than 200 worldwide. And because users pay nothing (for now) and are able to go on at length about who they are and what they want, their postings provide a sociological window into housing trends and desires across the country, from the neon cityscape of the Las Vegas Strip to the wheat fields of Wichita, Kan. Myriad other sites provide roommate-matching services, but in the last decade Craigslist has emerged as the gold standard. It is easy to navigate, has an extensive number of listings and does not require people to complete an online sign-up sheet to view postings in their entirety. And the intimate and sometimes politically incorrect nature of Craigslist postings can make them fun to read  amusing, frank and even kinky. Perhaps the most eyebrow-raising thing about the housing listings is the abundance of users  even young, savvy residents of anything-goes metropolises like Los Angeles and Miami  who want mellow, nonpartying roommates. Las Vegas sounds more like Snore City if you judge it by its housing listings. And New Yorkers can come off sounding square. "No parties" and "no drama" are common refrains. There are exceptions, but even club-hopping Paris Hilton hopefuls seem to have their limits. As four women (ages 19 to 22) seeking a fifth roommate in Boston wrote, "We want a partier, not a puker." People in their 20's often list their alma maters and request a roommate in their own age group. Cleanliness is a must, or at least "clean-ish," "decently clean" or "clean in public spaces." And spending life with a "professional" appears to be just as important to users of Craigslist's housing listings as it is to users of Match.com. Some listings have stirred up trouble, however, and the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonprofit group, has filed a lawsuit in federal court against Craigslist for "publishing housing advertisements which exclude prospective tenants on the basis of race, gender, family status, marital status, national origin and religion." A news release issued by the organization said that the Craigslist postings contained such language as "no minorities," "African-Americans and Arabians tend to clash with me so that won't work out," "ladies, please rent from me," "requirements: clean godly Christian male," "will allow only single occupancy," and "no children." The suit is addressed on Craigslist: "Although in all likelihood this suit will be dismissed on the grounds that Internet sites cannot legally be held liable for content posted by users, Craigslist has no need to hide behind this well-established immunity." The statement also says that Craigslist respects constitutionally protected free speech rights and that "discriminatory postings are exceedingly uncommon, and those few that do reach the site are typically removed quickly by our users through the flagging system that accompanies each ad." Craig Newmark, the founder of Craigslist, said that its "culture of trust" inspires users to be straightforward. In fact, some users do not even feel compelled to embellish the descriptions of their spaces, as housing advertisements commonly do. Rather, they take a certain pride in the gritty crudeness of their offerings. A small room for rent in the East Village is described as "definitely a young person's apartment" with "two small junky TV's that we have cheap antennas on, but we get the normal channels, and that is enough for us." "There is no window," the listing says, "but you have a full-sized door." And where else do you find housing listings that include candid photographs of the owner or leaseholder instead of the property they are advertising? (A man in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., compromised and included images of his bare room and his bare chest.) Indeed, Craigslist is where sex and real estate can truly merge. Near Dallas, a married couple are looking for a female roommate "with benefits." A listing for Astoria, Queens, reads: "I am offering a free room for up to three months for any females who are ticklish." A single man in Los Angeles is offering foot massages and free rent to women with comely feet. Those are some of the tamer overtures, though the majority of roommate listings are not suggestive. But just who are the most desirable roommates? Many people prefer women to men. There are women who feel more comfortable sharing a home with someone of the same sex, men who say they get along better with female housemates, and a few cyberspace Casanovas who want to take a shot at turning a roommate into a bedmate. Interns are also desirable, apparently because they are thought to be hard-working, responsible and willing to pay good money for cramped rooms. But couples are sometimes lumped into a list of the unacceptable, like cigarette smoking. Over all, Democrats are more vocal than Republicans in expressing a desire not to live with the opposing party, though two "hip professional guys" found elusive harmony on Capitol Hill: "One guy is straight, and one is gay. One is a Republican, and the other is a Democrat," they wrote in a listing for a third roommate. "We appreciate and welcome diversity." Users in the San Francisco Bay Area appear to be among the least interested in rooming with a pet. This area had the highest percentage of "no pets" listings during a key-word search last Thursday (slightly more than 16 percent of 32,295 housing listings). In Boston, about 14 percent of 45,880 listings said "no pets." Dallas, Wyoming and Birmingham, Ala., seemed quite pet-friendly by comparison: only about 1 percent of the housing listings in each location said "no pets." But Wichita, Kan., emerged as one of the most accepting places, with less than 1 percent of the listings snubbing pets. In some parts of the country Craigslist housing postings are an essential part of the real estate biosphere. New York is by far the leader in this regard (it had some 180,245 housing listings last Thursday). Mr. Newmark said there were two reasons for that. "New York real estate is kind of a blood sport," he said, "and also, because our site is free, brokers tend to post a lot of redundant ads." He said he hoped to address that problem in a matter of weeks by beginning to charge a fee. Although Mr. Newmark has not studied how the number of housing listings fluctuates day to day, he believes they remain fairly steady on weekdays and drop off on weekends. Boston had 45,880 housing listings last Thursday, and the San Francisco Bay Area had 32,295. In other places like Montana and Louisville, Ky., there were just a few hundred postings, and North Dakota had fewer than 100. The New York listings include some of the most expensive, precarious sleeping arrangements in the country. A sofa bed in the living room/kitchen of a one-bedroom apartment on 55th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues is $683 a month. You could get a 780-square-foot one-bedroom cottage in Savannah, Ga., for $665 a month. A couch on the West Coast, in a Los Angeles apartment belonging to three actors, is merely $400 a month and includes utilities, cable, Netflix membership, Starbucks wireless membership and wireless Internet, as well as household staples like toothpaste and shampoo. New Yorkers are also adept at constructing what the military calls a zone of separation. A woman with an apartment at Union Square posted a photograph, not of the bedroom she wanted to rent out for $1,150 a month, but of a large divider she planned to use to create the bedroom from part of her living room. Near Columbus Circle, a "very small, but cozy space enclosed by tall bookshelves and bamboo screens" is listed for $1,700 a month. Potential occupants are advised that they must be older than 30 and cannot wear shoes inside the apartment, smoke, consume alcohol, invite guests over or have "sleepovers." A plethora of "no smokers" statements in the New York housing listings make it appear that the public smoking ban has infiltrated private spaces, too. But while cigarettes are a deal breaker for some, a number of Craigslist users across the country (Denver and Boulder, Colo.; San Francisco; Boston; and Portland, Ore., to name but a few) say that they are "420 friendly," slang for marijuana use. References to 420 were nonexistent in other cities, including Little Rock, Ark.; Santa Fe, N.M.; and Boise, Idaho. There are also myriad references to amenities, everything from the use of old record collections and video games to a trapeze suspended in a Brooklyn loft. A posting for a room for rent in Detroit lacks images of the property, though there is a photograph of the L.C.D. television. And if nothing else, Craigslist housing postings in the United States confirm the zaniness of the hunt and provide a taste of the free-spirited, random connections that have always been part of the experience. A posting in Asheville, N.C., says that two 21-year-old women are planning to drive almost 20 hours to Austin, Tex., this summer, where they will rent a two-bedroom apartment for $550 a month. "We are looking for one or two (yeah, you can bring a buddy) cool people to ride out there and split an apartment with us," the listing reads. "Are you up for being spontaneous?" Would-be Jack Kerouacs, take note: they hit the road at the end of the month.

500-> Blight, Like Beauty, Can Be in the Eye of the Beholder
Of all the real estate jargon, bureaucratic buzzwords and plain old insults exchanged over the proposed Atlantic Yards project in Brooklyn, no term has evoked quite such unruly passion as “blighted.” During the last two years, the word has hung like a scythe over the 22-acre site, most of it on the northern edge of the Prospect Heights neighborhood, where the developer, Forest City Ratner Companies, hopes to build its $4.2 billion project. For the developer, it is a fitting description of the abandoned auto-repair shops, collapsing brownstones and gloomy vacant lots that blemish the area, and of the eight-acre railyards that slice through the neighborhood just south of Atlantic Avenue. For many of the several hundred people who still live there, “blighted” is a term of abuse, one that ignores the sleek, recently renovated buildings on Pacific and Dean Streets, the bustling neighborhood bar, and other signs of revival. Even some supporters of the project, like Assemblyman Roger L. Green, disagree with the description. “That neighborhood is not blighted,” Mr. Green, whose district includes the Atlantic Yards site, said at a hearing last year. “I repeat, for the record, that neighborhood is not blighted.” The long-running blight debate took a major turn in favor of Forest City Ratner last week, when the Empire State Development Corporation, the state’s lead economic agency, formally declared the project site blighted. It was the first step in a process that could eventually allow Forest City to acquire, through eminent domain, the few remaining parcels that the company has not been able to acquire privately over the last few years. But for all the freight the word carries around Prospect Heights these days, “blighted” is a word with no fixed definition, legal or colloquial. It is not unlike Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark about pornography — “I know it when I see it” — said Joseph M. Ryan, a land-use lawyer who has consulted for the development corporation before but has no involvement with the Atlantic Yards project. “Usually it’s a high crime rate, debilitated buildings. Often you’ll have pollution, or inadequate usage of land.” Under past court rulings, for example, an area can be declared blighted even if particular parcels within it are not. Similarly, a given plot of land can be declared “underutilized” if what is built there is smaller or shorter than zoning laws would otherwise allow, even if the building in question is not dilapidated. Moreover, it is largely up to government officials to decide how prevalent a condition must be — how much crime, for instance — in order to label an area as blighted. “There are no hard and fast rules regarding blight,” said Jessica Copen, a spokeswoman for the development corporation. “There’s a large area of subjectivity in evaluating the indicia of blight.” Such rules as there are have been carved out by state and federal courts over the years. But because condemnation itself is essentially a legislative power rather than a judicial one, courts have tended to grant government officials wide latitude to make findings of blight. “Reasonable people could differ as to whether something is overcrowded or has too much crime or too many sanitary problems or is losing jobs,” Mr. Ryan said. “But the courts will defer to the agency if they have a reasonable and rational basis for condemnation.” Hence the 381-page blight study issued by the development corporation last week. Conducted by AKRF Inc., a consulting firm with long experience in land use and environmental engineering, the study amounts to a painstakingly detailed walking tour of the Atlantic Yards’ potential home. Hardly a crack in the sidewalk escapes notice in the study, which declared the project site replete with “structurally unsound buildings, debris-filled vacant lots, environmental concerns, high crime rates and underutilization.” Fifty-one out of 73 parcels on the 22-acre site “exhibit one or more blight characteristics,” the study found, including buildings that are at least 50 percent vacant or are built to 60 percent or less of their allowable density. The study also noted that, before Forest City came along, 76 parties controlled the land making up the site. Such fragmented ownership, real estate developers say, is what makes large-scale private urban development difficult without government intervention. The study also dwells in some detail on the eight-acre railyards that make up about one-third of the site, and which also fall within an urban renewal zone the city established along Atlantic Avenue in the late 1960’s. The railyards hindered hoped-for development in the renewal zone for decades, the study notes, and continue to do so on those blocks to the south and west of the yards where the project would be. Critics have long accused the development corporation of favoring developers. Opponents of Atlantic Yards, say that in that project, the corporation is essentially using the railyards, which constitute blight almost by definition, as a cudgel to obtain additional land through eminent domain or the threat of it. “No one is arguing that the railyards should not be developed. That’s a pretty commonly agreed-upon point,” said Marshall Brown, an architect who helped draft the beginnings of an alternative plan for the railyards that would not have required eminent domain. “It just doesn’t make sense that the railyards themselves cannot be developed alone.” The study also included a look at crime in the area. Because the Police Department does not collect crime statistics block by block, the study could measure only indirectly whether the site has more crime than the area surrounding it. AKRF examined three police “sectors” in Brooklyn, each of which overlaps parts of the site but extend well beyond it. The study compared the combined crime rates in those three sectors with the combined crime rates for their respective police precincts. Finding the precinct numbers lower, the study declares that “residents and businesses on the project site are more susceptible to crime” than those in surrounding neighborhoods. Overall crime in the three precincts, however, decreased slightly between 2004 and 2005. “They make the footprint sound like it’s a Lower East Side slum,” said Daniel Goldstein, the spokesman for Develop Don’t Destroy Brooklyn, an umbrella organization for groups opposed to the project. The building that Mr. Goldstein lives in on Pacific Street is now owned by Forest City and is one of two within the footprint of the project that were redeveloped into luxury condos during the past several years. (Mr. Goldstein moved into his apartment shortly before the project was announced in 2003.) Another building within the project footprint, an old bakery, was widely considered ripe for conversion by its owner, the real estate developer Shaya Boymelgreen. He has since sold it to Forest City, which now owns almost all the property it needs for the project. Company officials say they have paid high premiums on that land to minimize the need for eminent domain. The blight study began last summer, after Forest City, the development partner of The New York Times Company in building its new headquarters on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, had already bought up large parcels of land for the project. Some critics have questioned whether Forest City’s acquisitions — and the implicit threat of eminent domain since the project was announced in late 2003 — deterred development. “How much of the blighted conditions were the result of the cloud of eminent domain hanging over that property, and of Ratner’s successful efforts to purchase property there?” asked Tom Angotti, a professor of urban affairs and planning at Hunter College, who studied the site with his graduate students this year. “We call it ‘planner’s blight.’ You create the cloud of eminent domain, you force people to sell, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.” Residents also point to several Dean Street buildings just outside the project site, and Prospect Heights’ generally strong residential real estate market, to argue that much of the site might have developed on its own. Deborah Wetzel, a spokeswoman for the state development corporation, stood by the study’s findings. “Irrespective of the recent property acquisitions by Forest City,” Ms. Wetzel said, “we believe it highly unlikely that the blighted conditions currently present will be removed without action by the public sector.”

501-> Purpose-Driven Candidate?
Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, has a date next month with Rick Warren, the megachurch pastor and best-selling author of “The Purpose Driven Life,” a move that could give Mr. Obama, who is black, exposure to millions of white churchgoers as he decides whether to run for president in 2008. Mr. Obama will appear, alongside Bono and Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, at World AIDS Day at Mr. Warren’s huge Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif., on Dec. 1. Is it a step toward active support for Mr. Obama? Although Mr. Warren is a theological conservative whose politics would seem closer to those of Mr. Brownback, he has championed causes like the environment and fighting the genocide in Darfur. David Axelrod, an adviser to Mr. Obama, would say only that the senator and Mr. Warren have a continuing “dialogue.” ANNE E. KORNBLUT

502-> It's All Academic
WITH his first novel, Lawrence Douglas takes to heart the adage that you should write what you know. Douglas, chairman of the department of law, jurisprudence and social thought at Amherst College and a Holocaust expert, makes his hero a Holocaust expert at a leafy New England college. There the similarities between Douglas and his neurotic protagonist, Daniel Ben Wellington, presumably end. "It's not about them. Really," Douglas says in his acknowledgments, about his real-life wife and kids. Still, the roman à clef angle is tantalizing. What is a professor to do once he chooses a wife and sees tenure on the horizon? Why, have a baby, of course, and get cracking on the serial adultery. When he learns that his wife is pregnant, Daniel, an art historian specializing in war memorials, goes into a full-throttle meltdown. He flirts with colleagues and students, then embarks on a consuming e-mail romance with a single mother he meets on a business trip. "I had entered a zone," he declares, "ungoverned by conventional rules" — except, perhaps, the rules of the academic novel, which demand a period of unadulterated bad-boyism, followed by hang-dog repentance. When Daniel finds himself almost ensnared in a harassment lawsuit for e-mailing a former student suggesting a sex act involving a salami sandwich, the dean observes, "you're not the first person to have a midlife crisis, though you are on the young side." But while Daniel has his moments of likable dry wit (he suggests Abemilech as a good "biblical" baby name and contemplates checking into a fancy mental institution: "Maybe some facilities offered special summer rates, August discounts for when the shrinks were on the Vineyard"), all the female characters, including the one whose native language is German, sound pretty much alike, and it's hard to imagine what they see in this nail-biting narcissist. For an academic novel to work — as Richard Russo's "Straight Man" does, or Francine Prose's "Blue Angel" — the characters need to be more fully developed. Daniel's most intriguing issues concern his Holocaust research, not his love life. As the author of a respected book, "Art and Atrocity," about the philosophy of war monuments, he finds himself invited to Berlin to address a forum on Holocaust memorials. He lies to reporters, claiming to be the child of death-camp survivors, and as his international reputation grows his lie threatens to topple him. Douglas, himself the author of an academic book called "The Memory of Judgment: Making Law and History in the Trials of the Holocaust," knows this terrain well and can be refreshingly unsanctimonious about the politics of war memorials. He's equally savage about scholarship itself, which is like "tossing rose petals into the Grand Canyon." But this material is never really integrated with the more predictable domestic story. Instead, it generally appears as anecdote, like this tidbit from the Holocaust Memorial director in Berlin: "Did you know that in Germany today there is a broad sociological pathology of persons who falsely claim to be Jewish? These people are called möchtegern Juden, maybe you know the term. Yet in my view, more interesting are the Germans who falsely claim to be the children of perpetrators." With material that fresh, why saddle yourself with a mopey protagonist in his underwear in a seedy apartment, eating Fruit Loops all alone?

504-> Brooklyn: Man Sentenced in iPod Killing
A man was sentenced to seven years in prison yesterday in State Supreme Court for his role in robbing and killing a teenager for an iPod. The man, Aaron Farrell, 20, described by prosecutors as a member of the Crips gang, was acquitted of murder but convicted of robbery on Aug. 1. Prosecutors said Mr. Farrell and a cousin, Darran Samuel, led a group of teenagers who robbed and killed Christopher Rose, 15, in July 2005. Mr. Samuel, who was convicted of murder and sentenced to 22 years to life in prison, testified that Mr. Farrell had stabbed Mr. Rose. The judge, Alan D. Marrus, sentenced Mr. Farrell to the maximum penalty for second-degree robbery.

507-> The Science of Zzzzz’s
With the global economy now taking more executives to far-flung places like Beijing and Mumbai, jet lag is becoming a bigger aggravation, leading sleep researchers to work harder than ever to find suitable remedies. Trips to the other side of the globe make adjusting a traveler’s body clock  or circadian system  an even more drawn-out process. Jet-lag experts say they believe it takes one day for each time zone away from home, up to a maximum of six or seven days, to get fully in sync with local time. On brief visits to China, as Dr. Abinash Virk of the Mayo Clinic pointed out, business travelers often have no recourse except to plunge into meetings without time to recuperate. About eight million corporate travelers made overseas trips last year, according to the United States Office of Travel and Tourism Industries. Most were flying to Europe or the Pacific Rim, throwing their body clocks off kilter  and the effects are considered greater going East than West. There is no easy remedy. One problem in developing solutions is all the variation in travelers’ ability to handle jet lag. Sleep researchers have found that people who have dealt with sleep deprivation over long periods  on night shifts, for example  can tolerate jet lag better than most. Older travelers also tend to get harder hit than the young by jet lag, as President Bush might attest. When asked how he felt after his quick visit to Baghdad just before his 60th birthday, Mr. Bush said, “A little jet-lagged.” Dr. Charmane I. Eastman, director of the Biological Rhythms Research Lab at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, said she had found one way to virtually eliminate jet lag from, say, a New York-Milan flight. It involves resetting your body clock with small doses of the hormone melatonin for three days before flight time  combined with going to bed an hour earlier each day  and then taking in bright light, natural or artificial, after arriving in Italy about six hours later. She recommends using a light box, widely used to treat the “winter blues.” But most international travelers manage their jet-lag problem by improvising, often with advice from their physician or a medical travel clinic. “I used melatonin for a while, but it made me feel buzzy the next day,” said Leigh Allen, chief executive of Global Consumer Finance Advisory, a consulting firm, who makes frequent trips between New York and London. “Now I have dinner on the ground since British Airways made that an option at JFK, then board and go to bed after a drink or two, and sleep for most of the seven-hour flight.” Melatonin has been widely considered helpful for reducing the effects of jet lag, and for inducing sleep. Now, however, the latest consensus among medical researchers is that melatonin isn’t considered reliable in inducing sleep, but is useful for adjusting your body clock. Left to their own devices, most travelers settle for a sedative to get to sleep on the plane  Ambien, Lunesta or Sonata are among the most popular  and a caffeine pill to wake up. But people who use these sedatives also may fail to get up and exercise in flight to reduce the risk of blood-clotting from tight seating, and may experience side effects after they land. Some businesses are seeking advice on jet lag for their employees. Alertness Solutions, a Silicon Valley consultancy, has worked with JetBlue, Qantas and Singapore Airlines, among others “Airline captains are the master jet-laggers,” said Dr. Mark R. Rosekind, president and chief scientist at the consulting firm. “We’ve done surveys of pilots to see how they manage alertness. They’re not doing the stuff that works.” What does work? “Napping and caffeine, among various solutions,” said Dr. Rosekind. “When I was at NASA, we did a study involving 26-minute naps and we found they boosted performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent. Naps of less than a half-hour work. “Using a combination of nap and caffeine is better than using them separately, if you can believe it. It takes 15 to 30 minutes for caffeine to kick in. So you do the two together. All it takes is a cup of coffee  not even a pill. By the time the caffeine is working, your nap is over.” JetBlue has a program to promote wakefulness in its pilots, created jointly with Alertness Solutions, that diagnoses their sleeping styles and helps them make adjustments. For instance, sleep patterns may show that a captain gets only five solid hours of sleep over a nine-hour period. After diagnosing the pattern, JetBlue would help modify that sleep pattern, through diet or exercise, to provide more restful sleep during a shorter period. A spokeswoman, Jenny Dervin, said the airline would open the program to flight attendants this fall. Sleep researchers are also working with professional and amateur athletes who, of course, change time zones to play “away” games or perform at international meets. “A proper amount of sleep can boost an athlete’s performance as much as 30 percent,” said Dr. Rosekind. Last fall his company worked with Hilton Hotels to improve sleeping quarters for American athletes at the Olympic Winter Games in Italy. The enhancements included new lighting, mattresses, temperature controls and easy-to-set alarm clocks to relieve athletes’ chronic anxieties about waking up on time. Sleep experts are broadening their research to include the disconnect between flying fatigue and work patterns. “The problem is how you manage people with a global 24/7 lifestyle,” said Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, chief executive of Circadian Technologies, and a former Harvard Medical School professor. “The big new trend is what our clients call ‘journey management,’ ’’ he added. For example, when companies bring together staff from all over the world for a project, his firm will help coordinate the trips to help make sure everyone is productive when they arrive. Dr. Moore-Ede added, “Jet lag may be largely sleep disruption, but it’s really a complex mixture of being out of sync with your normal behavioral pattern, plus other factors, even including airline food. If you’re going to be abroad for only a few days, why fool around with bright-light solutions? If you keep resetting your body clock, you end up scrambling your orientation.” Mr. Allen of Global Consumer Finance Advisory, a veteran traveler, said with an air of cheerful resignation: “In a sleep-deprived world, I just run around perpetually tired. I don’t call it jet lag.”

508-> Studying Autism Isn’t Enough
Bethesda, Md. WITH the recent Senate passage of the Combating Autism Act, the House is now poised to approve landmark legislation to help scientists understand the causes and characteristics of autism — a spectrum of neurological disorders affecting more than 1 in 200 children in the United States. If the House does as we hope and passes the act, the National Institutes of Health and related health research agencies will finally begin to devote the magnitude of resources — nearly $200 million a year — commensurate with the severity and prevalence of this terribly devastating set of conditions. The research emphasis of the act is appropriate, given how little is still known about the causes and the physiology of autism spectrum disorders, as well as the means by which medical treatments can reduce autism’s severity if applied early enough. Basic questions like whether the frequency of childhood vaccines today contributes to autism are still unresolved. As parents of a child facing these challenges, we applaud those lawmakers and fellow parents who have done so much to promote this and other initiatives. But research is not enough. We as a nation must also begin to focus seriously on treating those children who are already afflicted. At present, we are failing miserably to do so. In America, you have to be lucky or rich to get proper care for your young autistic child. Treatment regimens typically cost more than $50,000 annually for preschool children — one reason proven methods are available to perhaps only 10 percent of afflicted children during those crucial years. In a few states, like New Jersey, educational systems provide therapy to preschool kids, but resources vary from county to county. Here in Maryland, our 4-year-old daughter has received an hour or two of publicly provided help a week; studies show that ideally up to 40 hours of intensive intervention are required. A handful of states, including Maryland, have established a Medicaid autism waiver to allow parents of severely afflicted children to obtain relevant services independent of income. But limited funds constrain those services even where they exist. Earlier this year, we put our daughter on Maryland’s autism waiver waiting list — and were told that she was No. 1,519, corresponding to an expected delay of several years before services would be available. We are still lucky. Thanks to the farsightedness and generosity of one of our employers, most of the money needed for our daughter is provided via insurance. But among major American corporations, only Microsoft, Home Depot and two or three others offer comparable benefits. Virtually no private health plans do. The Department of Defense has some, though it has been introducing bureaucratic obstacles to obtaining coverage that could make it inaccessible for most as a practical matter. If we do not help these children, we are essentially condemning them to a lifetime of disability, unemployment and, for many, institutionalization. On human grounds, this is tragic. But it’s also bad economics. The few hundred thousand dollars needed to do intensive early intervention for four or five years — while a lot — is only one-tenth the expected cost of supporting someone for a lifetime on the dole. Intervention is costly because it is essentially one-on-one. Youngsters with autism spectrum disorders are hard to engage. They do not closely observe their environment or naturally imitate the actions of others. Nor do they tend to seek out human interaction and communication. Overcoming these barriers requires a highly individualized and intensive program. There is broad consensus, as reflected in previous studies by the National Academy of Sciences and American Academy of Pediatrics, that early and intensive intervention is critical. The core of most intervention plans, it is generally agreed, should be a cognitive method engaging the child’s intellect and emotions and sociability. Insurance companies and others often deny coverage by arguing that treatment methods are experimental, but that assertion no longer holds water. Studies now show that 40 percent to 50 percent of toddlers undergoing intensive Applied Behavior Analysis, one of the best-known methods, can be mainstreamed in regular classrooms without personal aides by the time they reach school age. (The figure is close to zero for children not given special care.) Most of the other 50 percent to 60 percent make notable progress too. The applied behavior method breaks down learning into simple steps with one-on-one tutoring, in a manner somewhat akin to the way Helen Keller was taught. Other applied behavior approaches involve reinforcing appropriate behaviors in daily life and creating opportunities for social interaction. In the early 1990s, Dr. Stanley Greenspan developed a competing method. Commonly known as Floortime, it focuses on core autism deficits — emotional, social and imaginative abilities — by harnessing a child’s natural interests and tailoring interactions to specific skills and challenges. It involves interactive play, as well as activities that vary a child’s environment to teach language concepts in a realistic way. At a conference last December at the Brookings Institution, Dr. Greenspan, while making a strong case for Floortime, also recognized applied behavior’s potential for children on the autism spectrum. As parents using a blend of approaches with our child, we have been encouraged to see that they increasingly draw on one another’s insights and activities. (A third cognitive method, called relationship development intervention, also focuses on core autism deficits.) So while vigorous debate continues over optimal therapy, there is no longer any doubt that the main methods work. Once the Combating Autism Act is passed, and we hold out hope for the next generation, it is time to rescue the children who already are afflicted. Our options range from mandating that insurance companies cover therapies documented to work, to trumpeting the example of places that do provide coverage in the hope others will follow, to expanding autism Medicaid waivers. The autism community is encouraged by the recent attention to this profound set of disabilities. But as a nation, we have been letting down 25,000 more children every year. Good will is not enough.

509-> Trenton: Horses With Mosquito-Borne Illnesses Are Destroyed
Two New Jersey horses were euthanized last week after contracting mosquito-borne illnesses, state agricultural officials said. One horse, a 14-year-old mare in Middlesex County, became ill with West Nile virus on Sept. 6 and was euthanized the next day. A 6-year-old mare in Burlington County was destroyed on Saturday after Eastern encephalitis was diagnosed the day before. Both diseases affect the brain tissue; neither can be transmitted to humans from horses.

513-> QUICK BITE/Armonk; Falling for Doughnuts
With autumn's first frost, my thoughts turn to doughnuts. And judging from the rate at which doughnuts were disappearing on a recent Sunday morning at Beascakes, in Armonk, I am not alone. Bea Ebinger makes a particularly fine old-fashioned cake doughnut, with a crackly crust and a delicate interior. If you get there early, you can watch the doughnut machine at work. Rings of dough drop from a funnel into a canal of hot fat; drifting along like boats in a lock, the doughnuts are flipped by a mechanical arm, then glide up a conveyor and tumble onto a fluted carousel to cool. Varieties include cinnamon sugar, powdered sugar, glazed, chocolate, Granny Smith apple and plain. Doughnuts are available starting at 7 a.m. every day but Monday; they are 85 cents each, $5 for a half-dozen and $9 for a dozen. For fall, Beascakes has sugar cookies in the shape of bats, pumpkins and maple leaves ($15 a pound) and irresistible cupcakes topped with colorful chrysanthemums made of frosting ($3.95 each or three for $10). Down the road in Harrison, at the Acorn Farm and Garden Center, Pat Acocella Jr. operates the Donut Robot on Sundays, alternately dusting doughnuts with powdered sugar and greeting customers. His young niece was on hand to stack and bag the fried confections. Doughnuts are sold on Saturdays and Sundays only, starting at 8:30 a.m. "Right before Halloween," Mr. Acocella said, "the machine will probably run all day." The family-run business was started in 1963 by Pat Acocella Sr., who still presides over the sale of garden sheds and gazebos, locally grown produce and fresh baked pies. Right now, Acorn features sweet cider and local apples, as well as an arsenal of pumpkins, corn stalks, hay bales, Indian corn and gourds. "Doughnuts aren't a moneymaker for us, but they put a smile on everyone's face," the younger Mr. Acocella said. Beascakes, 29 Maple Avenue, Armonk, (914) 273-3612. Closed Mondays.

514-> World Briefing | Europe: The Netherlands: 2 Ministers Resign Over Jail Fire
Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner and Housing Minister Sybilla Dekker accepted responsibility for a catalog of safety failings cited in a long-awaited report into a deadly fire at a jail complex at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam last October, and they promptly resigned. The fire killed 11 illegal immigrants, but the report by the Dutch Safety Board said "there would have been few or no victims to mourn if fire safety had received attention." The fire, which investigators said could have been caused by a discarded cigarette or arson, brought wide criticism of the government's treatment of illegal immigrants. Last month, it decided that 39 survivors of the fire would be allowed to remain in the Netherlands.

515-> A Law That Says Man Can Have Only One ‘Best Friend’
BEIJING, Nov. 13 — Wu Tianyu gave fair warning about the odor and then pushed open the heavy metal door to the ground-floor apartment. The smell rushed out, and so did the tiny dogs, tongues wagging, yipping, unaware of their central role in an issue gripping China’s capital city. The small apartment was the equivalent of a safe house: Ms. Wu, head of a local animal rescue association, had stashed about 10 strays and handicapped mutts. She said the dogs, one paralyzed, another recovering from a broken spine, should be exempt from a new “strike hard” campaign against dogs in Beijing. But she was not certain. “They cannot move out these dogs!” she declared. But then she hesitated slightly, “How could they do it?” Beijing is a city of at least 12 million people and at least a million dogs, about half of which are unregistered and deemed fugitives in the eyes of the local police. The complication, of course, is that many of these fugitives are also beloved pets, so confrontation is almost inevitable and has been rising in recent weeks as the police have begun a swift and harsh crackdown against illegal dogs. The police have already rejected applications by different pet advocacy groups to stage demonstrations. On Saturday, at least 100 police officers blocked roads as a large crowd congregated outside the city zoo. One participant said officers manhandled and detained more than 20 people who tried to hand out leaflets promoting animal protection. The people were released later the same day. The conflict is over city regulations that limit households in eight designated districts to a single dog and also forbid people from owning large dogs like golden retrievers and huskies. The regulations, considered misguided by many dog owners, were introduced in 2003 but have been only loosely enforced as the city’s pet industry has boomed. Dogs in Beijing can now eat at a dog restaurant, be groomed at a dog boutique and swim in an outdoor dog lap pool. Last Tuesday, though, Beijing newspapers carried a notice about the new campaign, under way since October, concerning “pet dog management work.” It said households with too many dogs, or with big dogs, would have 10 days to relocate them. In essence, owners had 10 days to get rid of the dogs or the police would do it for them. The note also promised to pay rewards to people who helped the police catch neighbors violating the dog rules. Anxiety and outrage have quickly spread among dog owners. Several reported that the police were already apprehending large dogs in apartment compounds and had even entered individual apartments to seize some dogs. Web sites posted photographs of dogs crammed into holding pens at dingy city pounds. Another Internet posting warned that a slaughter of stray dogs and cats would begin next week. “We are all worried,” said a woman who owns several dogs and asked not to be identified for fear the police would try to seize her pets. She is building a kennel in her uncle’s village in nearby Hebei Province to ensure that her dogs and others are not seized. Rabies is the primary reason offered for the new crackdown. Nationally, China reported that 1,735 people died from the disease between January and August, a 29 percent increase from the period a year earlier. The Ministry of Health said growing numbers of people were taking dogs as pets without properly vaccinating them. But what has horrified pet advocates worldwide is the brutal solution that some places in China have adopted to solve the rabies problem. This summer, officials in one section of Yunnan Province ordered an extermination campaign that led to the slaughter of more than 54,000 dogs. Another smaller extermination drive was held in Shandong Province. Grace Ge Gabriel, the Asia director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said her group agreed that dog owners should vaccinate their pets and register them. But she said Beijing’s current ban against big dogs was wrongheaded because it was based on the premise that they are more vicious. She also said that using rabies to justify the crackdown was misleading because Beijing did not have a rabies problem, a point confirmed by a state media report. Last Friday, at the Huayuan Street police precinct in the northeastern quadrant of the city, a red-and-white banner stated: “If You Have a Dog, You Need a License.” Inside, at the Dog Management Office, Shi Chenhe said he had registered 10 new dogs in recent days and argued that rabies and dog bites were serious problems in Beijing. He said officials wanted to ensure that no one was bitten and injured during the 2008 Olympics. “Of course, it is related to the Games,” Mr. Shi said. “Everything needs to be cleaned up before the Olympics.” Mr. Shi said that officers in his precinct had not begun cracking down on illegal dogs but that each police district was handling the issue differently. “We’re waiting to be notified,” he said. Ms. Wu, the head of the association for stray dogs, has been racing to different meetings with dog advocates, trying to find a solution, and some dog owners have told her they will defend their dogs at any cost. “People are saying that if they have to, they will fight back,” Ms. Wu said. “I told the young people that they shouldn’t fight back. It is the order of the government. If you fight back, it will hurt the dogs in the long run.” Across town at a trendy pet store, Man Qingwei, 32, helped hold down his two border collies on Friday afternoon as an attendant cleaned the dogs’ ears with a cotton swab. Mr. Man bought the dogs recently even though he knew their size violated city regulations. “Of course, we hide them,” Mr. Man said as his girlfriend patted the collies. “I have to sneak them out quickly into my car.” Mr. Man said he wanted dog owners to organize to force the city to change the rules. “I think the one-dog rule is ridiculous,” he said. “It’s a matter of one’s personal life and tastes. You should be able to have as many dogs as you like.” Mr. Man said that he and his girlfriend owned several dogs but that the new regulations were making ordinary tasks difficult. “We can no longer walk them,” he said. “I’m thinking about buying them a treadmill.”

516-> Breaking a Travel Stereotype
The travel industry has long viewed frequent fliers as fitting a certain stereotype: hard-charging men who touch down in a city, stay only as long as necessary to get their job done and leave quickly with few, if any, traces. But as the ranks of frequent fliers grow more diverse, travel companies are catering more to the needs and wants of women, as well as minorities and the more narrow niche of gay travelers. In general, many companies say, these travelers want a little more comfort, and they tend to stay longer and spend more money in the cities they visit. "Men have a 'fix it and leave' attitude," says Marybeth Bond, a consultant who has advised hotels on marketing to women. "Women will take more time for themselves than men if they are traveling for business. Men will rush home, but women will stay an extra day." When she travels, Ms. Bond said, she wants to "feel I have taken a little bit of time for myself and incorporate a thing for pleasure," such as visiting art galleries after her work is done. Longer stays, of course, can make travelers more valuable customers. Pete Garcia, vice president for Latin America at Continental Airlines, said changing demographics were reflected in travel patterns. As more Latinos move to the United States, he said, they often mix business with pleasure when visiting their home countries. Continental's efforts to market more to the Latino community include sponsoring events like Cinco de Mayo festivals and the Edward James Olmos Latino Book and Family Festival. The airline has also worked with the United States-Brazil Business Council and the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce. Community Marketing, a San Francisco firm that advises companies about gay travel marketing, said it surveyed 3,439 travelers in the United States last year and 28 percent said they had extended a business trip a day or two for leisure. "That has something to do with the dual-income, no-kids," said Jerry McHugh, the firm's head of research and development. The Kimpton Hotel chain is marketing more to gay and women travelers with its In Touch loyalty program, started in 2004. Through a newsletter it sends to about 5,000 gay clients, it highlights sponsorships of organizations like the Red Ribbon Campaign, which holds fund-raisers for H.I.V. and AIDS charities. It also mentions Gay Pride events in cities where it has hotels. Kimpton, part of the Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group, also sends a general newsletter to 190,000 men and women who are members of its loyalty program. The chain's executives say male travelers generally give greater weight to miles and points programs when deciding where to stay, while many women travelers are equally interested in safety precautions and the organizations the hotel chain supports. In the newsletter, the chain has highlighted, for example, its support of Women's History Month in March, when Kimpton raised money for Dress for Success, a charity that helps underprivileged women find jobs and prepare for interviews. The W Hotels chain started selling "Wonder Woman" hotel packages in October, which include emergency makeup kits and dresses designed by Diane von Furstenberg for businesswomen who might have to attend unexpected client dinners on their trips. Jane Lehman, director of public relations for W Hotels, which is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, said the company had sold 618 such packages to date, generating more than $550,000 in revenue. To attract more women, Wyndham Hotels has upgraded many of its amenities. Wyndham, a unit of Cendant, improved lighting and security, installed better beds and added magnifying mirrors in the bathroom. The trick to catering to niche markets, said Cary J. Broussard, a consultant for Wyndham, is to make sure no group is alienated while "taking great ideas and implementing them for everybody." As a sign of its intent to cater more to women travelers, American Airlines named Nora Linville director of women's sales and marketing in March. Ms. Linville said women were responsible for 70 percent of travel decisions. "One of my key objectives is to integrate women's preferences and priorities into our marketing efforts," she said. American, which is owned by AMR, started a marketing program aimed at gay business travelers in 2005. Its efforts include establishing sponsorship deals with Gay and Lesbian Chambers of Commerce; American has been the official airline sponsor of various chamber conventions. Nearly 24,000 American companies belong to gay chambers, says Justin G. Nelson, president of the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce, based in Washington. American Airlines has also increased its marketing to other minority groups. For example, it has sponsored organizations like the United Negro College Fund and the Asian-American Chamber of Commerce. The travel media have also picked up on the growing clout of women. On the cover of the May issue of Business Traveler magazine, a giant briefcase-toting woman towers over a cityscape with a cover line of "What Women Want." The magazine's editor in chief, Eva Leonard, said that when the publication asked women if hotels met their travel needs, 65 percent of the respondents said no. Many said they wanted more personalized service and a less condescending attitude, better security and hallway lighting, more comfortable beds and healthier food choices. She said bigger hotel chains were missing an opportunity, as women now seem more drawn to smaller boutique hotels known for their style and service. But this will change, Ms. Leonard said. "As the number of female business travelers is growing and they're being vocal about their needs, I think it's just better for everybody," she said. "I think it's to everyone's benefit because, for the most part, they are changes that men appreciate, too."

519-> Summer of Shakespeare:
FROM June through August, Elizabethan English trips off tongues all over the country as audiences assemble on grass, in folding chairs or in theaters to watch Shakespeare. There's Shakespeare at the Ruins (Virginia), on the Sound (Connecticut), by the Sea (California), Under the Stars (Texas) and in various other familiar and unfamiliar settings. Staging ranges from traditional to eccentric. Shakespearean scripts are easily adapted to move Romeo, Hamlet, Othello, Lear and friends to centuries and cultures the playwright never knew. "His stories are so seminal to the human experience," said Hamilton Clancy, a theatrical artistic director in New York. "They lend themselves well to different generations and interpretations." Mr. Clancy should know. His troupe, the Drilling Company, transports Shakespeare to a parking lot on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. This year, in its 14th season, Shakespeare in the Parking Lot will perform "The Tempest" from July 6 to 22 and "As You Like It" from July 27 to Aug. 12. It's free to anyone who walks — or drives — up. Shakespeare loved to play with gender, a proclivity that works nicely for the San Francisco Bay Area-based all-female company Woman's Will. This summer the troupe will perform "Twelfth Night" — set in the Caribbean of the 1860's — in parks all over the Bay Area. The company was the brainchild of Erin Merritt, who in 1998 realized women had a tough time breaking into Shakespearean performances because of the smaller number of female characters. "Shakespeare was writing for men," she said. "So when his plays are performed by women, his comments on gender really pop." Then there are adaptations — sometimes extensive adaptations. "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)," first performed in 1987, crams all 37 Shakespearean plays into just a bit over an hour and a half, complete with rap, Freudian psychology and a cooking show. A cast of three performs this cult hit, with plenty of wigs and costume changes, through June 24 in Seattle. Taking Shakespeare even more off the map is the Improvised Shakespeare Company in Chicago, which performs every Friday night at the iO Theater. The actors don't do Shakespeare directly, but improvise a play in Elizabethan style, with plenty of thee's, thou's and rhyming couplets, along with Shakespearean character motivations like ambition, greed, and love (star-crossed, of course). The performance starts with an audience member calling out a title — usually one never heard before — and what follows is an impromptu 90-minute, two-act play. Going in the opposite direction is Shakespeare in the Valley, set outdoors in Waterville Valley, N.H. In its inaugural year, the company is producing "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and "Much Ado About Nothing" in revolving performances from July 13 to Aug. 19. It promises a faithful rendering of both shows but has the slogan, "This ain't your Momma's Shakespeare." "There's a weird disconnect with Shakespeare today" said the artistic director, Donna Devlin. "People think he's highbrow, but he attracted the same demographic of people who today watch 'Desperate Housewives.' " This company aims to bring Shakespeare's appeal back to the masses by not only encouraging audience interaction, but provoking it, too. "It'll be like the Bard's original performances," Ms. Devlin said, "as long as no one's cellphone goes off." Ludlow and Broome Streets; Lower East Side. Shakespeare in the Parking Lot, 212-414-7717; www.drillingcompany.org. 8 p.m. Thursday to Saturday, "The Tempest" July 6 to 23; "As You Like It" July 27 to Aug. 12.  Various locations.

520-> A DNA Chip Maker Acquires Gene-Sequencing Company
A small San Diego company called Illumina has been making significant gains in market share over the last year at the expense of Affymetrix, the company that pioneered and has long ruled the market for so-called DNA chips used in genetic studies. Yesterday, Illumina announced another move in its effort to leap ahead. The company said it would acquire Solexa, a developer of DNA sequencing machines, for $600 million in stock. The acquisition will put under one roof most of the main tools now used for genetic studies. “We believe the combination of Illumina and Solexa will create a powerful life sciences franchise,” the chief executive of Illumina, Jay Flatley, told analysts in a conference call yesterday. Solexa, based in Hayward, Calif., is one of several companies trying to develop methods to determine the sequence of DNA in an organism at less cost and far more quickly than the technology used only a few years ago in the Human Genome Project. Eventually DNA sequencing might be so cheap that every person would be able to carry around his or her complete genetic blueprint on a DVD or computer chip. That day is still far in the future. But Solexa is expected to soon begin shipping a DNA sequencing machine that it claims will be able to determine the three billion DNA units in a person’s genome for about $100,000, about one-hundredth the cost of using older sequencers. Illumina hopes that having the gene-sequencing technology will complement its gene chips, which are used to measure particular genetic variations, not the complete sequence of DNA units. The chips are slivers of glass or other material containing bits of DNA of genes of interest. Illumina’s products are mainly used in studies trying to find genes that cause or raise the risk of a disease. Scientists might take the DNA from 1,000 people with a disease and another 1,000 without the disease and compare their genomes at 500,000 specific spots. The aim is to find genetic variations that correlate with the disease. Such studies have become more feasible in the last year as the cost of testing such variations has dropped. And Illumina has won a number of contracts for those studies from pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions at the expense of Affymetrix, which has had manufacturing and technical difficulties. Illumina’s revenues jumped to $53.5 million in the third quarter of this year from $19.5 million in the third quarter of 2005. Profit has also soared as has its stock price, which enabled Illumina to buy Solexa for stock. Solexa shareholders will receive Illumina stock worth $14 a share at the time the deal closes, though the price would be lower if Illumina’s stock is below $40.70 at that time, as it is now. At $14 a share, the deal would be at a 44 percent premium to Solexa’s closing price of $9.70 on Friday. Yesterday, Solexa shares soared $2.86, or 29 percent, to $12.56. Illumina’s shares plummeted $5.14, or 12 percent, to $38.91, but the price is still about 140 percent higher than it was a year ago. An analyst at Pacific Growth Equities, Un K. Kwon, said the drop reflected the 20 to 35 percent dilution in Illumina’s earnings expected next year from the deal. “Illumina was starting to get to a point as a company where they were more mature and had significant earnings,” she said. The Solexa acquisition “puts that up in the air.” Ms. Kwon said that strategically, however, the deal made sense for Illumina. As Illumina has gained, Affymetrix has suffered. Its share price is down nearly by half from a year ago. The company cut the price of its chip used in such disease-gene studies in half. A spokesman for Affymetrix, Andrew Noble, said the manufacturing problems had been fixed and the company was “back on track.” Affymetrix also still leads in the market for chips used to study which genes are active in a cell at any given time. Ms. Kwon, the analyst, said Illumina’s move could prompt Affymetrix to buy its own sequencing company. Affymetrix shares fell 61 cents, or 2 percent, yesterday, to $25.70.

521-> National Briefing | Washington: Documents To Be Made Public Again
The head of the National Archives said that most of the thousands of historical documents withdrawn by government agencies because of secrecy claims since 1999 would be made publicly available again. In an update to a group of researchers, Allen Weinstein, archivist of the United States, said the secret removal of documents had been virtually "stopped in its tracks." The Air Force and the Central Intelligence Agency, which had withdrawn the largest number of documents, will declassify 95 percent of what they withdrew, though some will still have deletions, Mr. Weinstein said. Archives officials are devising an initiative to streamline the release of records and prevent individual agencies from withholding those that are no longer sensitive. SCOTT SHANE (NYT)

522-> Trust Me, Baby, the Joint Is Jumping and Singing
The joint doesn’t jump in the musical “Idlewild”; it just twitches and stumbles. As much a missed opportunity as a terrible tease, the film stars André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, better known as André 3000 and Big Boi of the hip-hop group OutKast, playing lifelong friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia. Their characters, Percival (Mr. Benjamin) and Rooster (Mr. Patton), have reached adulthood by going down radically different roads, an approach that will be familiar to fans of OutKast, well accustomed to its creative dissonance. A great or even good version of “Idlewild” sounds heavenly. The shy and retiring and very single Percival works for his father, a gruff, unsmiling mortician played by a persuasively vinegary Ben Vereen. Rooster, meanwhile, married with a half-dozen children, earns his comfortable keep as a singer down at the local juke joint, called Church. Rooster is all crow and plenty of show, and the first time he takes the stage in “Idlewild,” he enters wearing a fur coat that looks like a skinned yeti and surrounded by a chorus of beauties in bubble-gum pink ostrich feathers. Like most of the songs in the film, what he sings isn’t especially memorable, but he delivers this disappointing news with style. The rest of the news is equally bad, alas. The writer and director, Bryan Barber, a music-video auteur with loads of credits, seems to have riffled through the Warner Brothers film catalog to compile enough chestnuts to take him and his crew through several Christmases. Without any ironic inflection, he recycles ideas and tropes that were stale when Edward G. Robinson was chewing cigars and scenery in the 1931 film “Little Caesar.” When a wife in “Idlewild” pleads with her wayward husband by imploring him to remember the way it “used to be,” his only response is to call her baby and ask for her trust. And when someone gives the same man a Bible, you know that good book will save him, body and soul. There are more clichés, including a beautiful singer, Angel (Paula Patton), who strolls into Church one day and tries to steal the show. Ms. Patton is a lovely woman with a serviceable voice, but when the fabulous Macy Gray is in the house, as a loud canary named Taffy, Angel can’t help but seem beside the point. (It’s disconcerting that Ms. Patton, by far the most glamorized female lead, also has the palest skin.) Like clockwork, Angel hooks up with Percival, who tends to otherwise mope about idly tickling piano keys. A Jelly Roll Hamlet in search of a reason for being or maybe just for leaving the small town of Idlewild, Percival has talent and apparent depth, which Mr. Benjamin conveys principally by looking downcast. Neither star is well served by his director, but Mr. Benjamin is particularly let down because he has, in the past, dazzled whenever a camera has been pointed at him. Given both his interest in film acting and the limited role historically assigned to black entertainers, you can understand why he doesn’t want to smile for his first big film role. But there’s a difference between being a serious actor and being a wet blanket, and Mr. Benjamin and his director have neither the experience nor the instincts to make sure that Percival has sufficient emotional shading. If Mr. Patton fares better it’s largely because Rooster, with his lust for life and outsize personality, has been drawn with broad strokes that make sense for the real-life singer and his fictional self. In an interview this summer, Mr. Barber expressed a long-held desire to direct what he called a “1930’s musical”; he might have done well to actually watch a couple before he started shooting. Busby Berkeley, the brilliant choreographer of 30’s musicals like “42nd Street,” could have taught Mr. Barber something about moving bodies and cameras through space. A close study of one of Mr. Barber’s professed touchstones, Vincente Minnelli’s 1943 all-black musical “Cabin in the Sky,” would have been similarly instructive. Mr. Barber loads his visually incoherent film with poor camera choices that make it difficult to ground yourself in a scene and that, with the grievous overediting, make it hard to appreciate the actual talent on screen. On the rare occasions when the camera sits still long enough for you to get a sense of space and place, the editing invariably reduces the image to confetti-size bits. That’s a shame because the choreographer, production designer and costume designer have done nice work, even if the women’s nails tend to look more Beverly Hills contemporary than Southern period. Still, the real trouble isn’t the rapidity of the edits; it’s that the editing choices generally lack rhyme and narrative reason. This kind of overediting can murder a mood and undercut a performance, turning what should have been an intimate love scene with Percival and Angel, for instance, into a jumble of shots, some only as long as one or two seconds. The narrative compression that works so well for Mr. Barber in his music videos for OutKast, particularly in pastiches like “Hey Ya!” and “Roses,” damages “Idlewild” beyond repair. Instead of letting a scene play out to the natural ebb and flow of conversation, Mr. Barber rushes in, moving the camera here and there, and seemingly running from a fine cast that also includes Terrence Howard, Cicely Tyson and Ving Rhames. Like too many young directors, Mr. Barber seems in the grip of a kind of creative attention-deficit disorder, caused less by the digital tools at his disposal than the lack of good guidance. Too bad Arthur Freed, who produced a number of musical masterpieces for MGM, wasn’t around to show him how it’s done and say, “Once more, from the top....” Written and directed by Bryan Barber; director of photography, Pascal Rabaud; edited by Anne Goursaud; music by John Debney; choreography by Hinton Battle; production designer, Charles Breen; produced by Charles Roven and Robert Guralnick; released by Universal Pictures and HBO Films.

POLITI -- Achilio Francesco "Francis," 95, of Roxbury, VT, died Monday, May 8, 2006, at the Mayo Healthcare in Northfield, VT. He was born in Northfield on March 17, 1911, the son of Emilio and Maria (Ambrosini) Politi. He attended Northfield schools, as well as Eastman College in Poughkeepsie, NY, and Columbia. Mr. Politi had started a monument business in Poughkeepsie. At the outbreak of WWII, he set aside his business to support the war effort and traveled to Washington, DC, where he accepted a position in the New Deal Office of Price Stabilization, becoming one of the first government employees to work on the War Productions Board. He later worked in the State Department where he served on the Board of Economic Warfare. He traveled to neutral countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, where he bought up vast stores of commodities like leather, sugar and beef, and sent them to Russia, effectively channeling them away from the Axis powers. Later, when the United States was desperate for elemental silver for the manufacture of electronics, he traveled to Mexico, bought up pesos, and sent railraod cars full of silver coins back across the border, which nearly caused the Mexican economy to collapse for lack of hard currency. After the war Mr. Politi was a top executive at Carborundum International, where he personally established manufacturing operations in more than a dozen cities worldwide. He was able to conduct business in English, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and French. His industrial negotiations took him to Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Operating from Geneva, he entertained many of the world's richest leaders, closing enormous financial deals with a handshake. His resume later included CEO positions at three international corporations. Before retiring to Roxbury, VT, he maintained residences in Switzerland, Peekskill, NYC, Ft. Lauderdale, as well as Roxbury. In the mid 1980's Mr. Politi's longtime informal association with Norwich University became formalized when he helped establish the Brigadier General Elizabeth P. Hoisington Award, presented annually to the top senior female cadet. Elected to the Norwich University Board of Fellows in 1987, he served on the Peace Corps committee, and in 1996 the University awarded him an honorary Doctorate of Business Administration Degree. In 2004 Mr. Politi established the Politi International Fund, a resource aimed at offering Norwich students an international educational experience. Mr. Politi was also a significant supporter of the Edmundite Fathers and St. Michael's College in Colchester, VT. He enjoyed hosting the annual bocce ball tournament and barbeque for his community friends, Peekskill friends, as well as his friends from St. Michael's and Norwich. Despite his global business experience and entrepreneurial success, he always considered his true "home" to be Vermont. Mr. Politi is survived by a nephew, Domenic R. Politi of Stowe, VT, and a cousin, Elvira Lockwood of Peekskill. He was predeceased by his brothers, Domenic and Ugo Politi. A Memorial Mass will be celebrated at St. John the Evangelist Church in Northfield, VT, at a later date. Donations may be made in his memory to the Norwich University General Fund, 1 Winooski Park, Colchester, VT 05439. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Wednesday, May 17, at 10 AM, at the Church of the Assumption, Peekskill, NY. Interment to follow at Hillside Cemetery, Cortlandt Manor, NY. Visiting at the DorseyCarlone Funeral Home, Peekskill, on Tuesday, 4-8 pm

China is considering a law that would stop teachers from hitting or insulting their pupils, the official New China News Agency reported. The measure would require teachers "to respect minors" and would prohibit corporal punishment, the agency said, and violators could be fired. A survey last year by an official youth committee found that more than 80 percent of elementary school pupils said that insults from teachers was their most serious problem. Two years ago, a 17-year-old student killed herself after a teacher humiliated her in front of the class, the agency said.

Pernod Ricard, the liquor maker, said its annual profit rose less than forecast as a result of higher spending on advertising. Profit for the year ended June 30, excluding interest, taxes and amortization, was 1.26 billion euros ($1.6 billion), missing some analysts' estimates. Net income rose 32 percent, to 639 million euros. The results are the first full-year numbers since Pernod bought Allied Domecq for $13 billion last year. Pernod, which is based in Paris, said it increased its marketing spending during the year to 1.04 billion euros from 593 million a year earlier.

533-> U.S. Moves to Prevent Strike at Northwest
MINNEAPOLIS, Aug. 23 (AP)  The United States attorney’s office in New York filed papers on Wednesday urging a judge to bar flight attendants at Northwest Airlines from striking. Flight attendants have said they may stage sporadic, unannounced strikes after 9:01 p.m. Central Daylight Time on Friday unless Northwest negotiates a better contract with them. Judge Allan L. Gropper of Federal Bankruptcy Court ruled last week that he had no jurisdiction to block a strike. A federal judge in Manhattan is to hear the airline’s appeal Friday. Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., filed for bankruptcy protection last September in the Southern District of New York, and the appeal must be heard in the same district. The brief from the United States attorney’s office says that Northwest and the flight attendants are obligated to bargain as required by a law that generally bars strikes unless a mediator has released both sides from talks, which has not happened. The flight attendants say they have the right to strike because Northwest, with Judge Gropper’s permission, imposed a new contract on them on July 31.

534-> Pay for Good Behavior?
James Traub (Oct. 8) cites conservative theorists who claim that the greatest determinant as to whether someone will become poor is if he acts responsibly or not. If that were true, people who work two or three jobs scrubbing bathrooms would generally be millionaires, and many members of Congress would be impoverished. Given that the reverse is usually true, perhaps connections, family and luck have as much -- if not more -- to do with relative wealth than behavior does.

536-> A Majestic Imperial Chinese Saga Has Its Premiere at the Met
The relative rarity of world premieres at the Metropolitan Opera does not alone explain the buildup of good will, genuine excitement and high expectation over “The First Emperor,” the opera by the Chinese-American composer Tan Dun, which had its premiere on Thursday night, conducted by the composer. Over the years Mr. Tan has drawn new audiences to classical music with eclectic works that find common ground between Asian traditions and the avant-garde. His ferociously propulsive film score for “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” won him both an Oscar and a pop-culture following. Zhang Yimou, the Chinese director of this production, best known for his popular film “House of Flying Daggers,” also adds luster to the project. And Plácido Domingo, by taking on the title role, the first role he has created in his 38 years at the Met, contributes his formidable star power. The story of the opera, based on incidents from the life of Qin Shi Huang, the prince and warlord who unified China through the brutal conquest of other states and became the country’s first emperor, is timely and psychologically complex. That all nine performances are essentially sold out is good news for the Met, for contemporary music and for opera over all. My guess is that a large number of the ticket-holders are opera neophytes attracted by the novelty of this project and hoping for a grand theatrical experience. Still, music drives the theatrical experience of opera, and Mr. Tan’s score is an enormous disappointment, all the more so because whole stretches of it, and many arresting musical strokes, confirm his gifts. The opera, with a libretto in English by Mr. Tan and Ha Jin, begins hauntingly with sounds of the East. Muffled drums and the humming drone of the waterphone (a bowed instrument with a bowl full of water) seem to come from the beyond, as low tremolos and a slinky melody emerge from the strings. The Yin-Yang Master (Wu Hsing-Kuo), singing in the style of Beijing opera, with nasal tone and vocal slides, takes us back 2,000 years to introduce the story of the emperor, who has roused his army and the people of Qin (pronounced chin) to conquer their neighbors and ward off barbarians. A row of 12 costumed palace musicians playing enormous Chinese drums thwack out pummeling rhythms as the riled-up choristers, the people of Qin, ask in chilling outbursts who their next victims will be. The musical problems start shortly after Mr. Domingo appears, in the regalia of the emperor, and calls for the people to desist in their savage cries. He now controls the most feared army in the land and is bent on wiping out cultural differences in the conquered regions of China. What his nation needs is a stirring musical anthem to foster unity, he explains, in the opera’s first flight into lyricism. But Mr. Tan’s approach to operatic lyricism and vocal writing seems ill-conceived. In preparing this work, he drew on his studies of ancient Chinese folk music, filtering those styles through techniques learned by attending almost every opera the Met produced during his years in New York, starting with his days as a graduate student and a fledgling professional musician. He wanted “The First Emperor” to sing, like the Italian operas he and countless other buffs adore. His music does sing. And sing. And sing. On and on. Whatever the mood of the moment, whether dreamy, defiant, sensual or tragic, as soon as the characters break into song, the melodic lines are inevitably long, arching and slow. Even when the orchestra bustles with intensity, the often cloying vocal lines hovering above still move with almost unvarying deliberateness. In the Italian operas Mr. Tan has in mind — say, Puccini’s “Turandot” — the pacing of vocal lines accords with the impetuosity of the moment and the flow of the words. Mr. Tan’s goal in this work, it would seem, was to create a ritualistic and hypnotic lyricism. But “The First Emperor” gives soaring melody a bad name. Also, because Mr. Tan integrates Chinese melodic elements into the music, the vocal lines continually move by wide and sometimes awkward leaps to unusual notes, making the phrases tiring for the singers. There is undeniable artistry at work in all this. Playing through these passages on the piano (from the piano-vocal score), I found some of Mr. Tan’s exotic harmonies and elusive vocal lines enticing. But a little of this goes a long way. Between the scenes of ruminative lyricism come orchestral passages that are much more inventive and effective. Take, for example, the crucial third scene of Act I. Emperor Qin has implored Gao Jianli, his estranged childhood friend and a gifted musician, to compose the unifying anthem. But Gao Jianli, whose mother was killed when his homeland was conquered by the emperor, is full of bitterness and resists. Princess Yueyang, the emperor’s willful and alluring daughter, has fallen for Gao Jianli, even though she is pledged to the emperor’s right arm, General Wang. In this scene, the princess slowly seduces Gao Jianli, who cannot resist her. And slowly is the operative word. The expansive lyricism begins enticingly but soon turns saccharine and, worse, inert. Yet when the singers depart, the orchestra, vividly enriched with Chinese instruments, takes up their themes and processes them through thick, spiky, grippingly astringent harmonies. Would that there were more such moments in the opera. The choral ensembles are also powerful and harmonically bracing, including the crucial final anthem, in which Gao Jianli, defying the emperor, recycles a mournful slave song. The more “The First Emperor” sounds like “Crouching Tiger” the better; the more it sounds like updated “Turandot,” the more tedious it becomes. The Met has spared no expense in mounting this $2 million co-production with the Los Angeles Opera. The set by Fan Yue is dominated by stairs through which you can sometimes glimpse colored banners and assembled masses. Descending from ropes above the stage is an intricate network of stones, representing both the writing tablets on which the emperor codified the Chinese language and the blocks of the Great Wall, with which his name is associated. Emi Wada has created 400 wildly colored costumes. You have to admire the cast members for their willingness to grapple with this unconventional new work, though the demands of the wide-ranging vocal lines were evident in some tired-sounding singing. As Gao Jianli, the tenor Paul Groves summoned ardor and energy. The agile coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral made a kittenish and sensual Princess Yueyang. The charismatic mezzo-soprano Michelle DeYoung was mostly wasted as the long-fingered, ominous Shaman, a rather campy role. The mezzo-soprano Susanne Mentzer brought dignity to the smaller role of the princess’s mother, and the sturdy bass Hao Jiang Tian was a stern General Wang. And give credit to Mr. Domingo, who at nearly 66 is still ambitious, still taking chances and challenging himself. He mostly sang with stamina and burnished power. True, his best friend onstage often seemed to be the experienced prompter, Donna Racik, invisible to the audience but quite often the focus of Mr. Domingo’s attention. And though the role was written for him, he could not disguise the effort involved in singing it. Despite his trouble with top notes in recent years, Mr. Domingo’s voice sounded freshest when the lines took him into his still clarion upper range. The man takes on too much. But what a major artist! With one intermission, the opera lasted just 3 hours 20 minutes yet seemed much longer. In the final scene, the emperor’s inauguration — after his daughter has taken her own life (in what may be the longest farewell aria in opera, which is saying something), and after his general has been poisoned by Gao Jianli, who then mutilates himself by biting off his own tongue to spite the emperor — Mr. Domingo breaks one final time into lofty flights of ponderously arching lyricism.

540-> Google Is Said to Set Sights on YouTube
YouTube, the popular video-sharing Web site that has yet to celebrate its first anniversary or its first profit, is quickly becoming the must-have prize for media and technology giants. Google is in discussions to acquire YouTube for $1.6 billion, people involved in the talks said yesterday. While the talks are in the early stages, and may fall apart, the size of Google’s offer may push YouTube closer to a deal. Other companies have also expressed interest and could swoop in with a higher offer. Microsoft, Yahoo, Viacom and the News Corporation, among others, have all visited YouTube’s headquarters in San Mateo, Calif., in recent months to inquire about buying the company. The frenzied hunt to acquire the next hot Internet property — MySpace last year and now YouTube — has become reminiscent of the first Internet boom, as companies bid up prices of sites whose ability to generate profits is the subject of much debate. A deal for YouTube would be the crowning moment for a property that emerged as a cultural phenomenon almost immediately after it officially began last December. Its site, which delivers more than 100 million video clips a day, allows users to share a broad array of offerings from news clips to home movies to spoofs — sometimes funny but often simply crude — created by ordinary users. Almost single-handedly, YouTube has both popularized the sharing of videos and empowered would-be movie makers around the world. The site is also facing possible legal challenges over the unauthorized posting and sharing of videos. Yet a number of media companies would prefer to embrace YouTube as a partner, rather than treat it as a pariah, as was the case with Napster. If YouTube agrees to a deal, it would be a sudden change of heart. Chad Hurley, a founder of the company, has said that he prefers to stay independent. “We’re not even thinking about being acquired or going public,” he said in a meeting with New York Times editors and reporters last month. A spokesman for Google declined to comment. A spokeswoman for YouTube did not return calls for comment. YouTube’s meteoric rise has made it one of the most closely watched of the new generation of Internet companies created since the technology bust of 2000 and the fallow period that followed. The millions of people that visit YouTube each day make it a valuable property, though it has yet to turn a profit. Rumors of YouTube’s talks with Google first appeared yesterday on TechCrunch, a Web site about Internet start-ups. The $1.6 billion price tag, while seemingly rich for so young a company, makes sense, research analysts said. “That’s expensive but not unreasonable,” said Charlene Li, an analyst with Forrester Research. Ms. Li estimated that the company has about 50 million users worldwide, which works out to a purchase price of about $32 a user. The deal would make sense from the perspective of both companies, Ms. Li and others said. “Google Video has not gotten any traction,” Ms. Li said. Despite Google’s broad reach as an Internet search service and its well-known brand name, Google Video has only a 10 percent market share, according to Hitwise, which monitors Web traffic. YouTube has a 46 percent share, and MySpace has 23 percent. “YouTube figured out what Google and Yahoo and Microsoft and all the others in the marketplace didn’t,” she said. “It’s not about the video. It’s about creating a community around the video.” A link-up with Google might also carry benefits for YouTube as it tries to clear up its legal picture. Google and its lawyers are already addressing similar questions involving copyrighted works on the Internet and working on technology to deal with them. “Who is in a better position to develop that technology,” Ms. Li wrote in a blog entry posted yesterday. “Sixty burnt-out people at YouTube or the legendary technical minds at Google?” Mr. Hurley and Steve Chen started YouTube after the two struggled to share videos of a dinner party in January 2005. In a sense, YouTube is the classic Silicon Valley start-up. The pair, working out of a garage and still in their 20’s, went on to secure $3.5 million in venture capital from Sequoia Capital, one of the two venture firms that invested in Google when it was a small, relatively anonymous company. The recent takeover frenzy is being fueled in part by the News Corporation’s acquisition of MySpace, a social networking site immensely popular among teenagers. The company, controlled by Rupert Murdoch, bought MySpace last year for $580 million in cash, and it is now worth as much as $2 billion by some analysts’ estimates. Sumner M. Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, recently called losing MySpace to Mr. Murdoch “humiliating.” He also said that one reason he fired Tom Freston as Viacom’s chief executive last month was because he failed to secure that deal and did not move fast enough to push Viacom’s Internet activities. Yahoo, meanwhile, is in negotiations to buy Facebook, a social networking site originally aimed at college students, for more than $1 billion, according to people involved in those talks. But while media moguls are fascinated by YouTube, they also harbor deep concerns. The site’s mix of videos includes many clips from television shows and movies, often posted without a thought to who might own the copyright. As a result, there are widespread concerns that YouTube may eventually draw a hailstorm of lawsuits — especially if the company becomes part of a deep-pocketed acquirer. Doug Morris, the chief executive of the Universal Music Group, recently called YouTube and MySpace “copyright infringers” and said that the sites “owe us tens of millions of dollars.” Mark Cuban, who founded Broadcast.com, an early Internet video site that was bought by Yahoo, has suggested that YouTube is essentially a business based on piracy. Some in the industry have even compared YouTube to Napster, which, before it adopted its current subscription-based model, was a hugely popular free music-swapping service. Lawsuits from the recording industry forced the original Napster to shut down, and it eventually filed for bankruptcy protection. YouTube says it is different from Napster because it removes content when a copyright holder informs the company of a violation. It points to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which in general does not require Internet companies to screen material in advance. Despite these legal uncertainties, YouTube holds obvious appeal for any potential acquirer. Buying YouTube would instantly vault Google to the lead in the business of online video, which is drawing increased interest from advertisers. Its own fledgling offering, Google Video, remains a relatively small player. At $1.6 billion, YouTube would be Google’s most expensive acquisition. In fact, it would cost nearly as much as Google’s total acquisitions budget since 2001, according to a recent estimate from Citigroup. Google’s largest investment to date was its $1 billion equity investment in Time Warner’s AOL subsidiary, which was part of a multiyear advertising deal. Google had cash and marketable securities of about $9.8 billion as of June 30, and its market capitalization stands at about $129 billion.

543-> Moving Quietly, as if Sculptured by Rodin
For all the subtle beauty of the dance presented by Odile Duboc and her company, Contre Jour, on Wednesday night at the French Institute Alliance Française, it was tempting to laugh or at least to smile at the contrariness of the program’s three pieces. In a time when the fashion is big, fast-traveling, technically demanding dance crammed with high-energy movement, Ms. Duboc is creating choreographic miniatures in which dancers huddle like rugby scrummers, scarcely moving or even all that visible in Françoise Michel’s dim but vital lighting. This was the first full program in the United States for Ms. Duboc, who came of artistic age in the 1970’s, just as American modern dance was beginning to be exported to France. Ballet-trained, she taught dance and later directed a state dance center in the French city of Belfort. But since 1980, she has focused primarily on choreography and the theatrical directing of work by playwrights including Peter Handke and Edward Bond. A quiet, innate theatricality was evident from the first moments of “trio 03,” the opening dance, which was inspired by Natalia Goncharova’s painting “The Wrestlers.” Three wrestlers (Bruno Danjoux, David Drouard and David Wampach) move, very slightly, as a huddling clump of bodies in an atmosphere made eerier by Pascal Contet’s subdued score. Small, buried events like minute pullings-away or the extension of a flattened arm are as eye-catching and absorbing as the biggest leap. Ms. Duboc’s improvised solo, “ODIL,” cost her a few audience members in the pause that followed the piece. But this was a stunning tour de force, if so crude a term can be used for delicately modulated shifts in movement quality and tone, performed by a woman (Ms. Duboc) dressed in black pants and shirt, her bowed head and mop of graying hair adding to the fleeting, recurrent sensation of watching something as fragile as dandelion fuzz holding its own in buoyant air. “Boléro, two,” an excerpt from Ms. Duboc’s 1996 “trois boléros,” was inspired by the sculptures of Camille Claudel. But Rodin also came to mind, though Rodin in an offhand mood, as two lovers (Stéfany Ganachaud and Mr. Danjoux) cantilevered and wrapped around each other and formed a bridge of their bodies to muted Ravel. The duet builds with the score, in choreography that puts an imaginative if understated new spin on the art of partnering.

544-> Cheney Assails Press on Report on Bank Data
WASHINGTON, June 23 — Vice President Dick Cheney on Friday vigorously defended a secret program that examines banking records of Americans and others in a vast international database, and harshly criticized the news media for disclosing an operation he said was legal and "absolutely essential" to fighting terrorism. "What I find most disturbing about these stories is the fact that some of the news media take it upon themselves to disclose vital national security programs, thereby making it more difficult for us to prevent future attacks against the American people," Mr. Cheney said, in impromptu remarks at a fund-raising luncheon for a Republican Congressional candidate in Chicago. "That offends me." The financial tracking program was disclosed Thursday by The New York Times and other news organizations. American officials had expressed concerns that the Brussels banking consortium that provides access to the database might withdraw from the program if its role were disclosed, particularly in light of anti-American sentiment in some parts of Europe. But the consortium, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, published a statement on its Web site on Friday, saying its executives "have done their utmost to get the right balance in fulfilling their obligations to the authorities in a manner protective of the interests of the company and its members." A representative for the cooperative, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk about its internal discussions, said that he knew of no discussions about withdrawing, adding that the group was "very resolute" in its commitment to the financial tracking operation. The program, run out of the Central Intelligence Agency and overseen by the Treasury Department, has allowed counterterrorism authorities to gain access to millions of records of transactions routed through Swift from individual banks and financial institutions around the world. The data is obtained using broad administrative subpoenas, not court warrants. Investigators have used the data to do "at least tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of searches" of people and institutions suspected of having ties to terrorists, Stuart Levey, an under secretary at the Treasury Department, told reporters at a briefing on Friday. Officials say the program has proven valuable in a number of foreign and domestic terrorism investigations, and led to the 2003 capture of the most wanted Qaeda fugitive in Southeast Asia, known as Hambali. News accounts of the program appeared just as President Bush returned from a two-day trip to Europe, where he met in Vienna with leaders of the European Union. Neither that organization nor any of its member states commented Friday, but one advocate for civil liberties in London said the program could create new tensions in Europe just as Mr. Bush was trying to smooth trans-Atlantic relations. "Our data has been effectively hijacked by the U.S. under cover of secret agreements and entirely undisclosed terms," said the civil liberties advocate, Simon Davies, the director of Privacy International, a London-based organization focused on the intrusion on privacy by governments and businesses. "There will be a snapping point, and this may be it." Initial reaction from global banks was muted, with one executive saying that while the privacy of information was a contentious issue within the industry, the Swift operation had so far generated few complaints. In Washington on Friday, privacy groups and civil liberties advocates were critical of the program, as were some Democrats and one prominent Republican on Capitol Hill. The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, Anthony D. Romero, condemned the program, calling it "another example of the Bush administration's abuse of power." Lauren Weinstein, the head of the California-based Privacy Forum, an online discussion group, raised concerns about lack of independent review of the operation. "Oversight is the difference between something being reasonable and something being abuse," he said. Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had sent letters on Friday to both Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales on the issue. While he declined to release the letters, he said he was concerned about the legal authority for the operation. Mr. Specter has been at odds with the administration over another previously secret counterterrorism operation, the National Security Agency's domestic eavesdropping program. The senator said he was particularly troubled that the administration had expanded its Congressional briefings on the financial tracking program in recent weeks after having learned that The New York Times was making inquiries. "Why does it take a newspaper investigation to get them to comply with the law?" the senator asked. "That's a big, important point." In explaining the program, Mr. Levey, the Treasury under secretary who oversees the program, said in an interview earlier in the week that "people do not have a privacy interest in their international wire transactions." But Mr. Specter was skeptical. "I'm not surprised that a Treasury official would take that position, but I'm not so sure he's right," the senator said. "I don't think it's an open-and-shut question." Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who has made privacy a signature issue, said, "I am very concerned that the Bush administration may be once again violating the constitutional rights of innocent Americans as part of another secret program created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks." But Mr. Cheney was emphatic on Friday in arguing the program is necessary, and predicted that the Bush administration might be criticized over it in much the same way that critics have assailed the National Security Agency eavesdropping, which has been done without warrants. "The fact of the matter is that these are good, solid, sound programs," the vice president said at the fund-raiser in Chicago for David McSweeney, a Republican who is running against Representative Melissa Bean, a freshman Democrat. "They are conducted in accordance with the laws of the land," Mr. Cheney continued, adding, "They're carried out in a manner that is fully consistent with the constitutional authority of the president of the United States. They are absolutely essential in terms of protecting us against attacks." Mr. Cheney's sentiments were echoed Friday by two other top administration officials, Treasury Secretary Snow and the White House press secretary, Tony Snow. The two men, who are not related, defended the program in separate news conferences on Friday. The Treasury secretary called the operation "government at its best," and the press secretary derided criticism of it as "entirely abstract in nature." The Treasury secretary called the program "an effective weapon, an effective weapon in the larger war on terror." Administration officials spoke to various reporters about the financial tracking program Thursday night after The New York Times published an article about the program on its Web site. Bill Keller, executive editor of The Times, has said the newspaper decided to publish the story because "we remain convinced that the administration's extraordinary access to this vast repository of international financial data, however carefully targeted use of it may be, is a matter of public interest." Swift has said that its role in the program was never voluntary, but that it was obligated to comply with a valid subpoena, and had worked to narrow the range of data it provided to American officials. But the Treasury secretary, Mr. Snow, said Friday that after the Sept. 11 attacks, Treasury Department officials initially presented the cooperative with what he described as "really narrowly crafted subpoenas all tied to terrorism." Officials at Swift responded that that they did not have the ability to "extract the particular information from their broad database." "So they said, 'We'll give you all the data,' " Secretary Snow said.

545-> Security for Monuments (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “City Takes On U.S. in the Battle of Independence Square” (Philadelphia Journal, Aug. 9): I work three blocks from Independence Hall, and I walk by it on my daily commute.

Traffic, including large trucks, is allowed unimpeded passage along Chestnut, Fifth and Sixth Streets, coming within 30 feet of Independence Hall. Perhaps a fence is needed to secure Independence Square, but much greater security issues need to be addressed first. Security for our national monuments needs to be more than just window dressing.

546-> Consumer Borrowing Slowed in August
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (AP)  Consumer borrowing rose in August at the slowest pace in five months, reflecting weaker demand for auto loans, the Federal Reserve reported Friday. Consumer borrowing rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in August, compared with a 4.3 percent rate of increase in July. It was the slowest performance since March, when borrowing declined. The overall economy slowed in the spring as consumers were battered by soaring energy costs, rising interest rates and a cooling housing market. Borrowing in the category that includes credit cards rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in August, after a gain of 4.7 percent in July. Both of those gains were below the double-digit increases in May and June, months when economists say consumers were using their credit cards as a way to cope with soaring energy prices. For August, borrowing for auto loans rose at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, far below the 4.1 percent gain in auto and other nonrevolving loans in July. Total consumer debt rose by $4.99 billion at an annual rate, to a record of $2.35 trillion in August. The August increase was in line with economists’ expectations.

547-> Whales Up Close, in High-Def
CONSIDERING that most humpback whales are the size of a city bus and weigh about 40 tons, you would think that it would be easy for researchers to record them on video underwater. Except for material that was shot for a couple of Imax films, however, whales have eluded underwater cinematographers for years. Whales typically spend more than 90 percent of their time underwater, making it difficult for humans to spend extended time with them. Another challenge is technological; researchers, who can usually afford only basic equipment, have produced grainy shots taken with standard-definition video camcorders. This winter, one researcher, Jason Sturgis, 31, changed everything, becoming the first to capture underwater scenes of humpbacks frolicking in the waters of Hawaii with a Sony HVR-Z1U high-definition video camcorder. Mr. Sturgis compiled three months of videotape -- detailed images that researchers said have revolutionized how they study whales. "Jason's images might well serve whale research in the manner that Carl Sagan's eloquence made physics and astronomy meaningful to a lay audience," said Dan R. Salden, founder of the Hawaii Whale Research Foundation, a nonprofit group in Maui. For Mr. Sturgis, the move to high-definition video had been brewing for a while. In 2003, working under the guidance of the National Geographic photographer Flip Nicklin, Mr. Sturgis began recording the behavior of singing whales for the Whale Trust, a nonprofit research group in Hawaii. Mr. Sturgis learned underwater cinematography with small standard-definition cameras. During the 2005 research season in Hawaii, when the whales migrate to the Auau Channel between the islands of Maui and Lanai, he used a Sony DSR-PD150, a hand-held camcorder favored by independent filmmakers. This camera, which writes to mini DV tapes at 30 frames a second, was not designed to record compressed high-definition video. Underwater images were muddled, and Mr. Sturgis had to dive deeper to get closer to the whales. "By swimming down to get decent footage, I worried that my presence was impacting the very behaviors I was trying to study," he said. After months of frustration, Mr. Sturgis was ready to upgrade his gear. The Sony HVR-Z1U appealed to him because it was sophisticated yet small; at 26 pounds, it was light enough to be taken underwater without too much effort. The device also records MPEG-2 video at 29.97 frames per second onto digital tape, which Mr. Sturgis can digitize and edit with Final Cut Pro software on his Apple G4 laptop. At the start of the whale season in February 2005, the Whale Trust bought an HVR-Z1U for $4,700. In November 2005, the group spent an additional $5,000 on custom underwater housing for the device. The setup got its first test this February. Floating alongside the Whale Trust research vessel, Mr. Sturgis filmed a group of humpback whales 40 to 50 feet below. As the camera rolled, the haunting whale songs were so intense that they reverberated throughout his body. Later, in the lab, the benefits of the new technology were obvious. While standard-definition video cameras recorded underwater images at 480 lines of vertical resolution, the HVR-Z1U captured them at 1,080 lines, more than twice as sharp. The contrast between the whales and the water was so crisp that the Whale Trust researchers could see more whales per clip, as well as more of the whales' surface area. This information has helped scientists broaden what they know about the whales that return to the Auau Channel every year. Meagan Jones, executive director of the Whale Trust, said that by studying the underwater images, she and fellow researchers could supplement what they have learned over the years from still photographs. No whale researcher, as far as it is known, has witnessed humpback whales mating or giving birth, and Mr. Sturgis said that capturing such an act on high-definition video would be the thrill of a lifetime. "We've got the technology to do it," he said. "Now we just need to get it on video." INNOVATIONS

550-> Inmates Report Mental Illness at High Levels
More than half the inmates in the country’s prisons and jails reported mental health problems within the last year, according to a Justice Department survey released yesterday. The findings, based on a sample of about 25,000 inmates, were drawn from personal interviews and prisoners’ own reports of symptoms, psychiatric treatments or medications. The figures are higher than reported in past studies because inmates describing any symptoms of problems like major depression or mania were counted along with those with diagnosed psychiatric disorders, said Fred Osher, director of health systems at the Council on State Governments. Further evaluations would be required to make an official diagnosis of a mental illness. Still, Dr. Osher said, the findings “underscore what every prison administrator knows  that large numbers of individuals with mental health problems are cycling through their facilities.” Correctional institutions have given increased attention to mental health treatment in recent years, he said, but the new findings highlight the need for intensive screening. The findings also suggest the need to connect released prisoners with mental health treatment in the community, a goal of the emerging “re-entry” movement that tries to prevent ex-convicts from returning to prison. Prisoners with mental health problems were more likely to have had repeated incarcerations and substance abuse problems and to have been homeless, the study found. Separate findings were reported for state prisons, where 56 percent of inmates were found to have mental health problems; federal prisons, where the figure was 45 percent; and jails, where it was 64 percent. The figure may be higher for jails, the report said, because they often hold mentally ill prisoners temporarily before they are moved to psychiatric facilities. Women reported higher rates of mental health problems than men, and whites had higher rates than black and Hispanic inmates. One in three state prisoners, one in four federal prisoners and one in six jail prisoners had received some form of mental health treatment, often medication, during their current incarceration, the study said.

552-> Bicyclist Hurt in Collision With Tow Truck
A Manhattan doctor who was bike riding with his wife on a path beside the Hudson River Thursday night was seriously injured when he collided with a Police Department tow truck, the police said yesterday. The doctor, Carl H. Nacht, who practices at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, was in critical condition at the hospital yesterday, a spokesman said. The driver of the tow truck, a civilian member of the Police Department, was not injured. The police did not say who was at fault. No charges were brought against the tow truck driver.. Dr. Nacht was riding north on the bicycle path that parallels the Hudson River with his wife, Mary Beth Kelly, about 11:30 p.m. when he hit the front of the tow truck, which was turning off 12th Avenue into an impound station at 38th Street, the police said. Dr. Nacht, who the police said was not wearing a helmet, was thrown from his bike and hit his head on a parked tow truck, the police said. A stoplight regulates traffic for the bicyclists and others using the pathway, while another sign warns drivers to yield to pedestrians.

553-> Cheating Accusations in Mental Sports, Too
Accusations of cheating at the largest tournament of the year have the chess world buzzing -- and have tournament directors worried about what they may have to do to stop players from trying to cheat in the future. The cheating is alleged to have occurred at the World Open in Philadelphia over the July 4 weekend and to have involved two players in two sections of the tournament. In each case, the player was suspected of receiving help from computers or from accomplices using computers. Neither player was caught cheating, but one player, Steve Rosenberg, was expelled. The other, Eugene Varshavsky, was allowed to finish the tournament but was searched before each round, then watched closely during games. Chess has always been considered a gentleman's game, with an unwritten honor code. But the advent of powerful and inexpensive chess-playing computers and improved wireless technology has made it easier to cheat. Although rare, cheating at chess is not new. For years, players who wanted to cheat would leave the board and ask other players for advice, or consult chess books or magazines for suggested moves. Cheating at chess may seem like a twisted exercise in ego gratification, but growing prize money has made the rewards more meaningful. At the World Open, the total prizes were $358,000, with first place in the top section worth as much as $28,000. Bill Goichberg, the director of the World Open and the Continental Chess Association, an organization that sponsors many big tournaments, said that, if true, the incidents at this year's tournament were troubling because of the players' stealth and effectiveness. "Before, a player might have discussed the position with someone who is a grandmaster," Goichberg said. "That sounds terrible, but if the grandmaster hasn't seen your position, I don't know if that is going to be much help. What is happening now is that the cheaters are concealing the fact that the moves are being transmitted to a computer." Goichberg said the older methods of cheating were easier to spot, but there are signs to indicate when someone may be using a computer program. Programs often play sequences of moves that are different from what a player would do, and they rarely make mistakes. Another signal is if a player shows a significant improvement over a short period of time, something that is rare among adult players. Goichberg said that he became suspicious of Varshavsky at the Open because he displayed those tendencies. Varshavsky was among the lowest-ranked players in the top section of the tournament. In his first four games, he beat three high-ranked masters and played another to a draw. Then after losing to a grandmaster, he played almost flawlessly to beat another grandmaster in his next game. Larry M. Christiansen, a grandmaster who did not play at the Open, ran the moves of the game through a commercially available chess-playing program called Shredder. He found that the last 25 moves of Varshavsky's win against the grandmaster matched those played by the program. Goichberg said that he asked to see Varshavsky before the next round but that Varshavsky hurried off to the bathroom. Goichberg waited 10 minutes outside a stall until Varshavsky came out. Varshavsky consented to be searched, and Goichberg said that no device or transmitter was found. Varshavsky was allowed to proceed in the tournament. Directors then went to search the bathroom stall and found it occupied. Goichberg said they waited 45 minutes before a director peeked under the door and saw Varshavsky's shoes. After Varshavsky left the stall, nothing was found in it. In the last two rounds, Varshavsky played against two grandmasters and lost each game quickly. Attempts to reach Varshavsky by telephone were unsuccessful. Goichberg expelled the other player under suspicion, Rosenberg, because he was found with a wireless earpiece. Rosenberg, who played in a lower section than Varshavsky, was leading going into the last round. A victory would have been worth about $18,000. Before the round began, Goichberg said, a tournament director noticed that Rosenberg was wearing something in his ear and asked to see it. Goichberg said that Rosenberg told the director it was a hearing aid. The director wrote down the name and the serial number and looked it up on the Internet. Goichberg said the device was called Phonito and it was described on a Web site as a wireless receiver that was ideal for undetected communication between two people. Part of the paraphernalia of the device, Goichberg said, was additional equipment that had to be worn elsewhere on the body to boost and receive signals. Goichberg said Rosenberg was wearing a heavy sweater and declined to be searched. Goichberg said the information did not prove that Rosenberg had cheated, but he felt he had no choice but to remove him from the tournament. "He had things on him that could be used for cheating," Goichberg said. Before the World Open, Rosenberg had been the No. 2 official at ChessLive, an online chess-playing site, according to Chris Fitzgerald, the site's chief administrator. "I know Steve personally, from online use, and he's basically a nice guy," Fitzgerald said. After the World Open, Fitzgerald said, Rosenberg called him to tell him that he had been accused of cheating and to resign his position. Fitzgerald said that he spoke to Rosenberg and that he was not willing to talk to a reporter. Other efforts to contact Rosenberg were unsuccessful. Goichberg said he planned to take countermeasures to try to catch people who might be using hidden electronic devices but he would not be specific for fear of tipping his hand. Steve Immitt, another tournament director working at the Open, said that the latest incidents made him concerned about directing tournaments, particularly ones with bigger prizes. He said he expected he would hear more accusations of cheating and "it is going to be harder to dismiss those complaints." In the end, he said, "It is going to be more and more unpleasant to direct tournaments." CHESS Correction: August 21, 2006, Monday A sports article on Aug. 8 about accusations of cheating at the World Open chess tournament in Philadelphia misstated when a tournament director noticed that one player, Steve Rosenberg, had a device in his ear. It was during a round, not before. The article also referred incorrectly to some of the identifying information that the director found written on the device, a wireless receiver. It was a Web address, not a serial number.

555-> What’s Your Mood: Chaotic Epic or Childlike Journey?
I’VE been completely bewildered since first playing Monolith Software’s role-playing game Xenosaga Episode I: Der Wille zur Macht in 2003. The first of six planned episodes, the game had a story that was mysterious, convoluted, engaging and confusing, offering endless questions and no answers. While the series developed a devoted following, it never sold as well as hoped, and Monolith was told by its publisher to wrap things up in the third installment. So in Xenosaga Episode III: Also Sprach Zarathustra, questions are answered, mysteries are solved and explanations are given. So why am I still so confused? The series follows a scientist named Shion and her creation KOS-MOS, an android superweapon that looks like a supermodel, as they and an assortment of humans and biologically engineered soldiers battle the Gnosis, monsters from another dimension, and search for the Zohar, a mysterious monolith also coveted by a religious cult and an all-powerful corporation. The Gnosis take a back seat in Episode III, which focuses more on the Zohar and the oft-hinted-at ultimate purpose of KOS-MOS. I’m talking a lot about the story before getting to the gameplay, because that’s the Xenosaga way. Episode III contains so little gameplay in the first two hours that it barely feels like a game. Eventually, the story-to-gameplay ratio evens out as Shion and her friends fight their way through a series of locales in search of answers. Combat is fairly typical of Japanese turn-based role playing games, with each combatant taking a turn to hurl a basic attack or a more elaborate one that depletes a power source. This is more conventional than the previous games, which had a way to store up energy on one turn so as to unleash a more powerful attack on the next. Outside of the Boost ability that allows combatants at certain points to jump ahead in the battle lineup, Episode III plays like dozens of other games. There are also somewhat more interesting battles involving giant robots where you can choose several attacks for each turn, but these are relatively infrequent. Episode III’s character-development system, in which you strengthen characters and teach them new skills, is also simple and conventional. This is not bad, just typical. The other notable change in the game is in the storytelling. The Xenosaga series is noted for its long cut scenes, which are noninteractive animated scenes that tell the game’s story. In the Xenosaga series, cut scenes would sometimes run for more than half an hour while the game controller sat untouched. Critics argued that such long inactivity lessened the player’s immersion. Monolith’s solution in Episode III was not to shorten the cut scenes but to make the player hold onto the controller. Now, cut scenes of four or five minutes are interspersed with long bouts of dialogue printed on screen. Even though all the dialogue is voiced, the player still has to push a button at the end of each sentence. This is an annoying feature found in many Japanese games, but it is so much more annoying in a game with seemingly thousands of lines of dialogue. It makes the conversations more wearying, something that could have been avoided by offering the option of automatically advancing the game to the next sentence. Episode III does have its good points. You can sneak past some enemies when you don’t feel like fighting and, in comparison with Episode I, it’s generally pretty easy to find your way around. There are some interesting puzzles and an entertaining mini-game in which you must lead characters through a series of elaborate obstacle courses. In the end, it is the story and characters that have set the series apart, and after juggling dozens of narrative balls for two games, Monolith manages to catch most of them. I’ve always had trouble keeping track of the game’s intricate story and dozens of characters, so I’m not sure how many loose threads remain, or whether what seem like plot holes are simply places where I missed a vital piece of information, but it’s nice to understand at least the basic framework of the story. The last scenes are quite interesting, sometimes very moving and reasonably informative, but they also highlight problems inherent in Xenosaga’s narrative approach. With a cult seeking the planet of Lost Jerusalem, characters named Canaan and Abel and references to 666, the biblical “number of the beast,” Xenosaga has always steeped itself in Christian mythology. I always thought this was allegorical, but in Episode III it becomes clear that the game is literally talking about God and Jesus and all that, although it’s unclear whether God is a supreme being, a powerful, unknowable force or a scientist who created an entire universe. With one foot in science fiction and the other in religion, Xenosaga stands on uneven ground, creating a host of questions that probably can never be answered satisfactorily. God doesn’t really work well as a character in a science fiction story, and the religious angle tends to feel like an interesting idea that doesn’t quite come off. Episode III is clearly not meant to end the series; most things are resolved, but a whole new chapter is opened up at the end in case good sales allow Monolith to continue the saga. I hope they get that chance; for all my complaints, I find the games as fascinating and engaging as I find them bewildering. If Xenosaga is all about complexity, LocoRoco from Sony is a model of simplicity. LocoRoco centers on LocoRocos, which are like happy-face balloons filled with Jell-O. The player controls the landscape, and can tilt it left or right to make the LocoRoco roll that direction. Using both buttons together makes the creature jump. LocoRocos collect flowers that turn them into bigger LocoRocos, and the goal is to find every last flower, some of which are cleverly hidden. The gameplay is like a slow-motion version of Sonic the Hedgehog, as the LocoRoco rolls up and down hills, bounces on trampolines and gets caught in strong winds that whirl it through the sky. But it’s the game’s adorableness that really makes it stand out. The game is reminiscent of Katamari Damacy, with simple, pretty graphics and quirky, charming songs. To get through small passages, LocoRocos can split themselves into mini-LocoRocos, and when they re-form they make the sounds of children playing. It’s darn cute. With imaginative levels on snowy landscapes or inside whales, LocoRoco uses charm and simplicity of design to create something near perfection. But it’s a small perfection, charming in its childlike whimsy but as insubstantial as a summer breeze. Xenosaga is big and wildly imperfect, but the bewilderment it creates can last a lifetime.

559-> All the Choreographers Are Male at a Dance New Amsterdam Program
"In the Company of Men," presented by Dance New Amsterdam at its TriBeCa theater Saturday afternoon, began with a bang as a man leapt out from the darkness into a spotlight, to a burst of music, and began to tap dance, very loudly. He was joined by two other men in an excitingly staged series of trios, duets and solos performed by Marshall L. Davis Jr., Ted Levy and Maurice Chestnut. The tapping was fine and individually styled, but the taped Broadway standards were so loud, it was hard to hear the footwork. Gus Solomons Jr. and Patrick Ferreri performed with the cellist Chris Lancaster onstage in a work in progress that juxtaposed Mr. Solomons's long, expressive arms with the younger Mr. Ferreri's lithe torso to suggest a playfully, subtly competitive dance conversation on age. "Switch (Grass Growing)," created and performed by Michael Whaites and Jon Kinzel, offered the chance to watch dancers with different personas and body types occupy the stage enjoyably. Julian Barnett conjured urban and personal angst in his "origin," a solo with video featuring Fiona Marcotti as a slightly worn-looking street psychic advising Mr. Barnett, a slight, intense performer with too circumscribed a dance vocabulary for this ambitious piece. Richard Rivera's "212° F," performed by his Physual company (Mr. Rivera, Aaron Haskell and Delano Jean-Pierre), started as an intriguing exploration of "threeness," or the conundrum of three bodies joined close. But it dissipated into a dance that also suffered from a restricted vocabulary, eventually sprawling into tedium despite strong performances. Finally, Ron De Jesus simply let it all rip in "one side of something many-sided ...," another sprawling trio (Ben Hartley, Dante Adela and Tiger Martina), but one that more simply luxuriated in the pleasures of male energy and bodies.

561-> Form Follows Function. Now Go Out and Cut the Grass.
Failure 101. That is the nickname of an engineering course Henry Petroski describes in his new book, "Success Through Failure: The Paradox of Design" (Princeton University Press). And if it sounds as if the course (like the book) must be full of self-help advice for engineers, that is partly true. Failure, Mr. Petroski shows, works. Or rather, engineers only learn from things that fail: bridges that collapse, software that crashes, spacecraft that explode. Everything that is designed fails, and everything that fails leads to better design. Next time at least that mistake won't be made: Aleve won't be packed in child-proof bottles so difficult to open that they stymie the arthritic patients seeking the pills inside; narrow suspension bridges won't be built without "stay cables" like the ill-fated Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which was twisted to its destruction by strong winds in 1940. Successes have fewer lessons to teach. This is one reason, Mr. Petroski points out, that there has been a major bridge disaster every 30 years. Gradually the techniques and knowledge of one generation become taken for granted; premises are no longer scrutinized. So they are re-applied in ambitious projects by creators who no longer recognize these hidden flaws and assumptions. Mr. Petroski suggests that 30 years — an implicit marker of generational time — is the period between disasters in many specialized human enterprises, the period between, say, the beginning of manned space travel and the Challenger disaster, or the beginnings of nuclear energy and the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island. His ideas also lead in other directions. He quotes Ralph Baer, one of the pioneers in the development of video games, who said that engineers are in the habit of "looking at the world as if everything in it needs fixing." The engineer strives to eliminate failure. But the unprecedented success of technology in the last 50 years may have also created an expectation that failure should be anticipated and eliminated in all aspects of life. This leaves less and less tolerance for its inevitable persistence; very little margin is left for error. That is understandable in deciding whether bolts or welds should be used in a skyscraper (as became an issue in the Citigroup Tower in New York); large forces hinge on such small decisions. But that absolutist approach also entails unexpected sacrifices in other aspects of life, particularly when avoidance of failure and accident becomes the guiding principle for future design and behavior. Because of safety and liability fears, for example, new children's playgrounds never seem to have see-saws or "monkey bars," sacrificing some of the daring enterprise that once accompanied play's inherent risk. Or a shoe-bomber is found on an airline, and to avoid any possibility of something similar, all air passengers must remove their shoes to be X-rayed. It is not only generals who fight the last battle; it sometimes seems as if the last war — the last failure — maps out how we assess contemporary success and determine future actions. So something other than failure must also be a guide. Consider, as counterpoint to Mr. Petroski, two simple engineering triumphs from widely contrasting eras, each of which has enjoyed considerable popularity. They are not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical; they are flawed but powerful. And it is their successes, rather than their failures, that have been crucial. Their failings have even been accepted as an aspect of their function. I am thinking of the manual lawn mower and the iPod. Look at an old lawn mover, with its center of curved rotary blades, turned by pushing on a wooden handle; nothing seems hidden from view. There is something elegant about this machine. The mower's turning rubber wheels spin the curved, angled blades. The length of the grass is determined by adjusting the rotor's height. The mower is a transformation of the scythe and a miniaturization of horse-pulled threshers. But it had a very specific purpose. It was not a tool for the farm; it was a tool for the small landowner, the city-dweller with a lawn or the country dweller with a yard. The mower's flaws are evident: the effort it takes to push it, particularly in wet grass, or the way it tosses the cut leaves of grass back onto the ground. Those flaws were addressed by electric and gas mowers, but those inventions added other problems: the motor, the noise, the worry over fuel and power cords. The basic principle was affirmed, not replaced. And it turns out that the manual mower's flaws were also part of the quiet pleasure it provided (when used in small areas): a direct connection is felt between the physical act of pushing and the physical result of cutting. The iPod, of course, comes from a drastically different engineering universe, but it too inspires through its successes not its failures. Unlike the mower, nothing can be seen of its workings. All physical effort dissolves into the magic of minimal gestures. A finger slides along its surface summoning several centuries of music. The iPod applies the best concepts in electronic design. Very few controls are required to perform any function. But you are never lost and can glide forward or backward through a catalog of possibilities. The iPod also has flaws that are constantly being ameliorated, with increased storage, decreased size and dedicated volume controls. But one reason for this evolution is not its flaws, but that advancing technology makes more things possible. And its limitations are also its strengths: the iPod requires a computer and cannot play music for multiple listeners, so it draws other pieces of equipment into its orbit, turning the sound system and the computer into extensions of its power. No doubt, far less than 30 years hence, the iPod will seem as limited and clunky as the manual mower, and perhaps as superfluous. And no doubt, engineers will be attending to its limitations as each new generation is constructed. But what accounts for its power and beauty is that, like the lawn mower, it may require some labor to set up and maintain, but it fulfills its function with simplicity and clarity, offering hints of sensual pleasure. Its flaws mark the necessary limits of every humanly manufactured object or human activity; failure and limitations are ineradicable, even essential. Mr. Petroski cites an epigram of Epictetus: "Everything has two handles — by one of which it ought to be carried and by the other not."

565-> Wireless Technology to Bind an African Village
NEAR Fort Portal, Uganda, where modern resources are scarce and power outages occur daily, four remote villages are harnessing solar-powered computers, wireless networks and telephones to help farmers compete in the regional economy. The computer-and-telephone system, designed by the San Francisco nonprofit group Inveneo, also enables villagers to surf the Web, build databases, use e-mail and make phone calls over the Internet — a big assist considering that the nearest land-line phone is two miles away. The impact has been immediate. Computer literacy among the 3,200 residents of the region is on the rise. The municipal governments have used the technology to organize records and cut back on paper files. The local economy is benefiting as well, said Jane Nabwire, information technology officer of the project. In an e-mail message from Fort Portal, Ms. Nabwire said that farmers used the technology to call friends in larger cities and obtain market prices for produce before deciding whether the trek to town is worth it. “The technology has brought services to people where they can access developmental information at any time,” she wrote. “In every possible way, it has made life for us easier.” To users in the United States who can pay bills online and answer e-mail on their cellphones, these technologies may not seem so vital. But in countries like Uganda, the gift of information and communications technology can change an entire area’s perspective on the world. Many call this practice technophilanthropy, though the equipment involved is not always donated. Inveneo, although a nonprofit group, sells its technology to nongovernmental organizations, which supply it to areas in need. Another nonprofit, the AED-Satellife Center for Health Information and Technology in Watertown, Mass., gets financing through grants and gives the technology away. Jody Mahoney, senior director of international development at TechSoup, a nonprofit technology assistance agency in San Francisco, said that however the two groups arranged for payment for these projects, they shared a belief that technology can help developing nations help themselves. “No one solution is going to work,” she said. “The best way to get technology into these nations is to create an ecosystem of partners that give people the tools they need to get things done.” Inveneo’s efforts revolve around these partners. In 2003, two of its co-founders, Mark Summer and Robert Marsh, developed a wireless communications system for villagers in Laos while volunteering for a nongovernmental organization there. Last year, they took the technology to Uganda, teaming with ActionAid. Together, the two groups chose a town called Bukuuku for an economic development pilot program because the villagers were farmers who earned less than a dollar a day. Since then, the effort has expanded greatly, including the setup in the Fort Portal area. Mr. Summer, who now serves as Inveneo’s chief executive, said that by the end of the year it would be supporting 18 projects in Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Mali and Guinea-Bissau. At the AED-Satellife Center, the focus is on medicine with two goals: to disseminate information to health workers all over the world and to give nations like Rwanda and Uganda the ability to use technology to revolutionize the way they keep medical records. Crucial to this effort is a network of hand-held computers. With the help of a special wireless access point, the hand-held devices transmit information about patients from field offices to regional ministries of health. The network, much like computers from Inveneo, runs on solar and battery power, and is meant to replace the paper-based record-keeping that characterized so many of these countries for years. Andrew Sideman, AED-Satellife’s director of development, said this information was important because it helped doctors decide how resources were allocated. “The gathering of health information doesn’t sound very exciting, but it’s the basis for how decisions are made,” he said, adding that the Satellife network also enables Web surfing and e-mail communication for villagers and doctors alike. “In meeting this need, we hope to improve the overall health of this part of the world.” So far in Uganda, Satellife has accomplished that goal. For years, when pregnant women gave birth, doctors had 72 hours afterward to dispatch a messenger to pick up a refrigerated dose of Nevirapine, a drug that kills H.I.V. in newborns and is routinely administered. Today, under the new system, the doctors send out e-mail queries as the mother is about to give birth, so the drug is there when the baby is born. Somebody has to pay for this kind of project, and in Satellife’s case, the network is underwritten by grants, including $1 million from the International Development Aid Research Center, the Canadian government organization akin to the United States Agency for International Development. Inveneo, on the other hand, finances its projects by selling the technology to nongovernmental organizations and other parties for $2,000 each. Inveneo then reinvests these funds into the company by buying new technology and making more computers to distribute in other developing nations. Skeptics question how important these efforts are to nations where people are dying of starvation. But Ms. Mahoney, the director of TechSoup, disagrees. “Technology can be a tool to save people’s lives,” she said. “Anything that enables these people to share information is a step in the right direction.”

566-> The Walk Is Fun, Raising the Money Isn’t
WALKING was something I knew I could do. I run four to five miles a day, so why not put those muscles to further use in a fund-raising walk? But what cause should it be? The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s Light the Night (two miles), in honor of a friend’s daughter who survived leukemia last year? Or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s Walk to Cure Diabetes (7.5 miles) because another friend works there? The decision was made for me when I received a diagnosis of Stage 2 breast cancer last spring, and my sister suggested that we do the Avon Walk for Breast Cancer (39 miles over two days). That is how most people choose among the fund-raising walks, runs, marathons, relays and triathlons. “Almost everybody at a relay or a walk is there for a personal reason,” said Reuel E. Johnson, a vice president at the American Cancer Society, which sponsors Relay for Life in 4,500 places and 120 Making Strides Against Breast Cancer walks. In these, he said, “There’s almost 100 percent odds you know someone close who’s experienced cancer.” If the decision is that straightforward for the walkers, it is less obvious for the event organizers. Should the walk be three miles or 39? Should participants raise $100 or $1,000, or nothing at all? People have been moving their feet for health causes at least since the March of Dimes inaugurated its Walk America to fight birth defects in the early 1970s. The concept really got going in the mid-1980s, with the first AIDS walks, the Cancer Society’s relay and the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation’s Race for the Cure. While no one compiles comprehensive data, USA Track and Field, the governing body for track competitions, sanctions 5,000 events each year to raise funds to combat diseases. Moreover, a single “walk” can be in hundreds of locations at different times. The most popular distance seems to be three miles (five kilometers) because, sponsors say, that is long enough to show commitment without scaring couch potatoes. “We try to make our walk more of a family experience,” Andrew Buroker, chairman of the American Heart Association, said of its Heart Walks (three miles). Besides, organizations usually want to include survivors of their disease, and they may not be able to walk far. Some organizers want the challenge of a longer walk. “A 5K walk is over before you know it,” said Craig Miller, president of MZA Events, which produces or helps produce a dozen six-mile (10-kilometer) AIDS walks every year. If six miles shows commitment, how about 100? The Leukemia Society, besides its short Light the Night walks, sponsors about 170 Team in Training events each year, including marathons, triathlons and 100-mile bike rides. Participants undergo a four-to five-month training regimen. “It is a kind of niche market,” said Gregory Elfers, the society’s senior vice president for revenue generation. “It has to be someone who has the wherewithal to do the training and make the time commitment.” That’s why the Avon appealed to me, for the challenge of walking 39 miles. In fact, I did it twice. What didn’t appeal, however, was the other part — the fund-raising. There are two schools of thought about this. Avon says the goal is to raise a significant sum of money, which goes along with the significant distance. So I had to raise $1,800 per walk, and hated every second of it. At the other extreme, Mr. Miller’s AIDS walks and the American Lung Association’s asthma walk have no minimum or registration fee. The Komen walk requires a fee of $15 to $25 (the amount is up to the local affiliate), while the Heart Walk and Relay for Life suggest but do not require $100 donations. “If you tell people that they have to raise $75, that’s what they’ll raise,” said Karen Wertheimer, chief development officer for the Lung Association. “If you don’t tell people $75, and you encourage them to raise as much as they can, they raise a lot more.” In fact, walks with high minimums tend to bring in a lot more money per walker than the low-minimum events. Some organizers with low minimums, though, say that dollars are not the only goal. They say that they keep the financial requirement small and the distance short to enable more people to join in. Whatever the specifics, Robert Evans, a board member of the Giving Institute, a trade association for fund-raising consulting firms, is skeptical of walking. “These are very difficult events to organize,” he said. “They’re people-intensive, and the results are unpredictable.” While his institute recommends that no more than 12 percent of donations go to expenses, the walks soak up twice that percentage. The rest of the proceeds go to research, patient services and public education. Walk organizers say that other fund-raising approaches can be just as inefficient. Direct mail has a notoriously low response rate of less than 5 percent. Galas have to cover room rental and other expenses. For me, walking for dollars is over. While I exceeded the Avon fund-raising requirement both times, I cannot harass my friends and family to donate any longer. If only walking could lead directly to better medical care. If with each step a dollar would fly to a research lab or a mammography center, then I would gladly walk for any disease.

567-> Democracy, Here (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Democracy’s Long Haul’’ (column, July 13): The model for democratic reform that David Brooks discusses can also be applied to what has happened domestically in the United States over the past half-century. Democratic reform during the 1960’s created, among other laws, the Civil Rights Act and statutory desegregation. The disillusionment caused by the war in Vietnam and the failed leadership of the Nixon administration brought on a decades-long struggle for power that has led to the current situation of a shrinking middle class and a new battle for social equality fought by homosexuals and immigrants. Fortunately, just as Mr. Brooks’s model suggests, democracy may yet prevail. I look forward to November and beyond with hopes that his premonitions will come true.

568-> Airline Programs: How Your Frequent Flier Miles Can Disappear
WITH airline partner programs that let travelers earn miles for everything from dining out to ordering contact lenses, there is no shortage of ways to rack up frequent flier miles these days. But redeeming them for a free ticket — as many travelers have learned — is not as simple. Blackout dates, limits on eligible seats, and competition among frequent fliers for popular destinations often make it so difficult to trade miles for flights that travelers just give up. But if you have not touched your frequent flier accounts in a while, now might be time to do some mileage upkeep. At least two major carriers — Delta and US Airways — are quietly imposing new rules that reduce the amount of time a frequent flier can leave an account inactive without forfeiting it. Starting Jan. 31, US Airways Dividend Miles accounts will be closed, and all miles forfeited, if there has been no activity, either earning or burning miles, within 18 consecutive months. That’s down from the current three-year mileage account expiration date. Delta is cutting the life span of frequent flier miles down to two years from three and has instituted a retroactive deadline. On Dec. 31, miles in SkyMiles accounts that haven’t been touched over the last two years will expire. The airline says it is sending letters to frequent fliers whose miles are in jeopardy and will follow up by e-mail. But Delta frequent fliers who have not updated their postal or e-mail addresses — or who regard airline messages as junk mail they don’t need to read carefully — could be caught off guard. “What has always kind of given me pause since I’ve been aware of this,” said Tim Winship, publisher of FrequentFlier.com, which tracks loyalty programs, “is the way they are doing it — retroactively. This will catch a lot of their members unaware unless they do a real bang-up job at getting the word out between now and the end of the year.” And the introduction of the shorter life spans, he said, could very well trigger a change in what has been a common rule of major carriers: that miles do not expire as long as there is some kind of account activity every three years. For now, however, airlines including American, Northwest and United have not followed suit and are sticking with the three-year rule. Some frequent fliers may be confused to hear that they could lose their hard-earned miles. That’s partly due to airline semantics. Northwest and Continental, for example, insist that miles do not expire. But accounts can be canceled. If no activity is posted for a given period (three consecutive years for Northwest, 18 months for Continental), the account is subject to termination, and all accrued mileage can be lost. Some discount carriers, like Southwest and ATA, known for having among the least consumer-friendly award policies, have actually been loosening their rules. Until August 2005, Southwest Rapid Rewards credits expired after just 12 months. That policy has since been liberalized to allow credits to stay active for 24 months. ATA announced earlier this month that points earned on qualifying flights and partner transactions on or after Oct. 1, 2006, would be valid for 24 months instead of 12. JetBlue points still expire 12 months after they are earned. But in August, JetBlue began allowing frequent fliers to extend the longevity of points for a year by using a JetBlue Card from American Express either to buy a JetBlue ticket or to spend $200 on other purchases. The number of reward tickets the airlines doled out last year was about 15.6 million, up 6.5 percent from 2004, according to the IdeaWorks Company, which analyzes the annual financial statements that major domestic airlines file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (known as 10-K reports) to determine frequent flier reward activity. But the total reward liability — the approximate value that the airlines place on future reward tickets — increased even more, by 13.9 percent, suggesting that airlines increased the number of miles given out. A significant number of those miles are deleted by the airlines each year. “The airlines are financially benefiting from the expiration of miles,” said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorks. “They anticipate a certain percentage won’t be redeemed.” Last year, for example, 14 percent of miles earned on Southwest Airlines expired or sat in inactive accounts, according to IdeaWorks. Nearly 18 percent of rewards earned on United Airlines and 24 percent earned on US Airways expired or went unused. Airlines are quick to point out how easy it is for a traveler to extend the life of a frequent flier account and keep miles from disappearing. One of the easiest ways is to buy something through an airline partner. All the major carriers have retail partners, allowing customers to earn miles with mundane purchases. Northwest and Continental, for example, have partnerships with a wide range of online stores including Apple.com, Barnesandnoble.com and Target.com that let fliers earn a few miles for every dollar spent. All frequent flier members must do is go to the retailer’s Web site through a link on the airline’s site, rather than directly. Travelers can also keep their accounts active by spending miles through links on the airline’s Web site for charitable donations or small purchases, like a magazine subscription for 400 miles. Reactivating miles after they expire is not as easy. Most airlines simply won’t let you do it, and the few that do charge hefty fees. Until the end of 2007, American Airlines will allow its frequent fliers to buy back miles that expired on or after Dec. 31, 2002. Every 5,000-mile block costs $50, with a fee of $30 per transaction. In conjunction with its new mileage expiration deadline, US Airways is introducing a reactivation policy that will allow its frequent flier members to buy back their miles and extend their accounts for an additional three years. Cost: one cent per mile, plus a $50 fee for each transaction. But in many cases it’s better to cut your losses. “Let’s be blunt,” Mr. Winship said. “It’s a bad deal if you calculate it out.” If 25,000 miles had expired, he said, the cost to reactivate them would be about $300. For that price, or not much more, you can buy a round-trip ticket from New York to Los Angeles outright. Besides, he said, “It really is hard to justify from a consumer’s standpoint reactivating those miles which really you already paid to earn once.”

569-> Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Port Authority Capital Plan
The board of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is scheduled to vote today on a 10-year capital plan that calls for $26 billion in investments by 2016. More than one-third of that money is allocated to required projects like the upkeep of the region's tunnels and bridges. The authority and other agencies also plan to spend $8 billion at the World Trade Center site. It has committed $2 billion for a tunnel under the Hudson River to be used by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit, and $2 billion for regional transportation programs that could include construction of a Second Avenue subway, an extension of the No. 7 subway line and a connection between the Long Island Rail Road and Grand Central Terminal.

571-> Obesity Surgery Often Leads to Complications, Study Says
WASHINGTON, July 23 — Four of every 10 patients who undergo weight-loss surgery develop complications within six months, the federal government said Sunday. The number of such surgical procedures has been rising rapidly, along with the incidence of obesity, which now afflicts 30 percent of adults in the United States, health officials said. Obesity surgery is helping thousands of Americans lose weight and reduce the risk of diabetes and other life-threatening diseases, said Dr. Carolyn M. Clancy, director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, a unit of the Public Health Service. But she added, “This study shows how important it is for patients to consider the potential complications.” Many of the complications were so serious that patients were readmitted to hospitals or visited emergency rooms within six months. In the procedure, known as bariatric surgery, doctors reduce the number of calories that a person can consume and absorb. One of the more common techniques restricts the size of the stomach and the length of the intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. Federal researchers found that complications from obesity surgery significantly increased costs. Over all, said William E. Encinosa, an economist at the health research agency, medical spending averaged $29,921 for obesity surgery and six months of follow-up care. For patients who experienced complications, spending averaged $36,542. And for those with complications that required readmission to a hospital, the average was $65,031. Past studies found that 10 percent to 20 percent of patients had complications while they were in the hospital. In the new study, Mr. Encinosa said, federal researchers found that 39.6 percent of patients had complications within 180 days of surgery. The most common complications included vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal hernias, infections, pneumonia and respiratory failure, as well as the leaking of gastric juices caused by imperfect surgical connections between the stomach and the intestines. Joanne Kayser, a retired New Hampshire state employee, said she weighed 320 pounds when she had weight-loss surgery in 2003. “The operation went well,” she said in an interview. “It reduced my food intake. After the surgery, I lost 60 pounds.’’ But Ms. Kayser, now 64, said: “My incision did not heal for seven months. I could not exercise, and I stopped losing weight. The incision became infected, and I had to have surgery by a wound care specialist. In addition, after four months, I developed a hernia, a bulge in my tummy.’’ Bariatric surgery often alleviates conditions that occur with obesity, like diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. That was the case with Ms. Kayser, who said she no longer needed to take diabetes medications because her blood sugar levels were under control. Dr. Philip R. Schauer, president of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, estimates that 175,000 to 200,000 weight-loss procedures will be performed this year, up from 47,000 in 2001. The number of people receiving the operation “may be less than 1 percent of those who need it,’’ said Dr. Schauer, director of bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic. The government study was based on insurance claims filed with health plans offered by 45 large employers in 49 states. The data included information on 2,522 weight-loss operations in 2001 and 2002. Dr. Schauer said surgical techniques and the quality of care had improved, so patients were less likely to suffer complications. In 2001 and 2002, he said, “there were not a lot of standards for doctors and hospitals getting into the field of bariatric surgery.” Since then, he said, the society has adopted standards, and some hospitals that specialize in the procedure have been designated “centers of excellence.” In addition, Dr. Schauer said, more than half of the operations are now done with a technique known as laparoscopic surgery, which requires only tiny incisions. This approach sharply reduces some types of complications, he said. In the cases reviewed by federal researchers, 85 percent of the patients were women. Dr. Schauer suggested several reasons: “Women have a somewhat higher incidence of obesity. Women seek medical care more than men. And obesity is more socially acceptable in men than in women.” But Dr. Schauer said, “Obesity is more deadly in men because they are more likely to have secondary effects of obesity like heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes.” Arthur G. Richards, an insurance agent in Portland, Ore., said some insurers were refusing to pay for obesity surgery and its complications. Such complications can lead to lawsuits, even when doctors meet the prevailing standards of care. Mr. Richards said his company was developing special insurance policies that would pay doctors for treating foreseeable complications.

575-> Americans Head Out Beyond the Exurbs
ARCHER COUNTY, Tex., the place that "The Last Picture Show" made into a symbol of the decline of small-town life in the 1950's, is growing. New houses line the farm roads that lead north into Wichita Falls, the nearest city, and arrivers now outnumber leavers at a level that puts its rate of influx in the top 10 percent of American counties. "For $250,000 or $300,000, you can live in a big house," said Paul Wylie, the county judge. Every year, hundreds of thousands of Americans pick up and move to someplace new, and they are increasingly choosing places like Archer County. The Internal Revenue Service monitors the peregrinations of taxpayers by counting the number of households leaving from and arriving in all 3,142 United States counties. The New York Times looked at the most recent five years of this data, highlighting places that gained a net of 6 percent or more of their taxpaying households during that time — that is, the top 10 percent of gainers. With the single exception of Las Vegas, no city proper makes the list of substantial gainers; American taxpayers by and large are outward bound. But this isn't uniformly a migration to exurbs, or to traditional Sunbelt or Western destinations like Florida or Arizona. The trails often lead north, to the lakes of Minnesota and Wisconsin; to the foothills of northern Georgia; to the forests of northern California; to the fields of northern Michigan. Cass County, Minn., 120 miles from Minneapolis, is on the list, as is Shasta County, Calif., 180 miles from San Francisco. While Michigan, hard hit by auto industry cuts, is losing population overall, six of its counties are among the top gainers. Yet the logic is not obscure: The new destinations are precisely the places, like Archer County, that have been undervalued — whether by industry or agriculture or mass leisure or urban flight. They are the places where you can still get something that feels like a good life, without the salary of a chief executive. "South of the Twin Cities, it's much richer soil, and more intense farming, and the land prices are high," said Marty Ringham, a real estate agent who lives 80 miles north of Minneapolis in the heart of a remote boom area. "Here the soil has more clay content, and the agricultural value is not so high. It's not an exact science, but we figure that the same house is about $1,200 cheaper for every mile you go north." William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, said there were "whole regions that people have been locked out of" by high housing costs. "People are forced to look beyond the trendy areas," he said. "These are places that are beyond the exurbs, it would seem." The movers represent multiple demographic trends. Many are retirees, but young families are involved as well. Some are successful 50-somethings, who can buy lakefront property in a place like Vilas County, Wis. — another notable destination, 220 miles from Milwaukee and Minneapolis — for less than half a million dollars. Some are just people with a dream and an Internet connection. "We get a lot of people that have jobs where they don't have to report in daily," said Joanne Fischer, a real estate agent in Blairsville, Ga., which is 80 miles north of Atlanta. "I just sold a house to a woman who works at the Centers for Disease Control, but she only has to go in to work one day a week." Worries are growing in some precincts about what gas prices will do to this trend. "That's the big question," said Warren Karlenzig, an executive with SustainLane.com, a research organization based in San Francisco. "Are the people moving to these areas dependent on jobs and services far out of their area?" His group recently published a study of the best places to live during a gasoline crisis. That study concluded that New York City, because of its density and public transportation, was the place you should be when prices hit $100 a barrel. Amanda Peterson, 27, a machine shop worker, moved from Zimmerman, Minn., a fast-growing exurb 40 miles north of Minneapolis, to Milaca, a small town 20 miles farther out, to find a house she and her fiancé could afford. "We saved forty to fifty thousand dollars on a house, and that buys a lot of gas," she said. "It's always a tradeoff between housing costs and commuting costs," Dr. Frey said, "and up to now people have said the commute is something I can put up with to get a nice house. But when you get to $100 a barrel, that's different. That could be the one thing that stops the American movement" from spreading farther out.

578-> Family Blames Power Failure in Death of Woodside Man, 60
Although city officials say the blackout in Queens has not claimed lives, the family of Andres Rodriguez, a Woodside man who died on Friday, said yesterday that he would be alive but for the combined effects of sweltering heat and no electricity. “If we had power, we wouldn’t be going through this,” said Andres G. Rodriguez, Mr. Rodriguez’s son. A spokeswoman for the city’s medical examiner’s office said yesterday that Mr. Rodriguez apparently died from effects of his prior medical conditions, and that his death did not appear to be related to the heat. Mr. Rodriguez, 60, had driven from his home at 65th Street and 37th Avenue to pick up his wife on Maspeth Avenue and was waiting in the car when he suffered some type of attack about 4:30 p.m. on Friday, his son said. Mr. Rodriguez’s wife, Maria Rodriguez, 54, found him “suffocating in the car,’’ the son said. Mr. Rodriguez was pronounced dead a short time later at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn. The younger Mr. Rodriguez said that his father, a painter, was usually in bed by 8 p.m. and up by 5 a.m., but had gone largely without sleep last week because of the heat. Since the blackout began last Monday, Mr. Rodriguez had been restless, staying up until midnight every night and sitting outside “trying to catch a cool breeze,” his son said. Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the office of the chief medical examiner, said yesterday that Mr. Rodriguez had a history of heart disease and diabetes and that his death was apparently caused by one or both of those conditions. “This is apparently a natural death,” she said. If the heat had been the cause, she said, then his body temperature would have exceeded 105 degrees before his death, and it apparently did not. His son said, however, that when Mr. Rodriguez had been examined a week before his death, his doctor suggested that his condition had improved. Although Mr. Rodriguez had been examined weekly for his high blood pressure, his son said, the doctor instructed Mr. Rodriguez at the most recent session that he need not continue regular examinations, so long as he took his medication. “The heat was definitely affecting him,” the son said. “He couldn’t sleep for three nights straight, and his health was going downhill.” The son said last night that the family had not decided whether to accept an offer by the city to have an autopsy performed on his father.

The New York City Board of Health voted yesterday to adopt the nation’s first major municipal ban on the use of all but tiny amounts of artificial trans fats in restaurant cooking, a move that would radically transform the way food is prepared in thousands of restaurants, from McDonald’s to fashionable bistros to Chinese take-outs. Some experts said the measure, which is widely opposed by the restaurant industry, would be a model for other cities. Chicago is considering a similar prohibition that would affect restaurants with more than $20 million in annual sales. “New York City has set a national standard,” said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, who predicted that other communities would follow suit. Trans fats are the chemically modified food ingredients that raise levels of a particularly unhealthy form of cholesterol and have been squarely linked to heart disease. Long used as a substitute for saturated fats in baked goods, fried foods, salad dressings, margarine and other foods, trans fats also have a longer shelf life than other alternatives. While the trans fat regulation captured the most attention, the Board of Health approved a separate measure — also the first of its kind in the country — requiring some restaurants, mostly fast food outlets, to prominently display the caloric content of each menu item on menu boards or near cash registers. Health officials said displaying calorie counts was meant to address what is widely regarded as a nationwide epidemic of obesity. The city’s prohibition on trans fats, which would be phased in starting in July, was a victory for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, an outspoken health advocate, and his activist health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden. After the city’s aggressive campaign to ban smoking in restaurants and in public places that goes back more than a decade, the regulation governing trans fats has again thrust New York to the forefront of a significant public health issue. Experts say eliminating trans fats need not change the taste of foods, but chefs and restaurant owners say it is hard to replicate the taste and texture of some items without them. Both the trans fat and calorie regulations would be enforced by the health department’s restaurant inspectors. Inspectors would check the packaging of ingredients used in restaurant kitchens for the amount of trans fats they contain, but prepared food would not be routinely tested. Violators would face fines of at least $200. Both measures have come under fire as impractical and unwanted intrusions by the government into free enterprise and civil liberties. “This is a misguided attempt at social engineering by a group of physicians who don’t understand the restaurant industry,” said Dan Flesher, a National Restaurant Association spokesman. He said one or both measures could be challenged legally. Mayor Bloomberg said the city is “not going to take away anybody’s ability to go out and have the kind of food they want, in the quantities they want.” “We are just trying to make food safer,” he added. Still, some restaurant workers said the trans fat ban would represent a challenge. “This will be better for people’s health, but we’d like to know where to go from here,” said O’Neil Whyte, a baker at Sweet Chef Southern Styles Bakery in Harlem. “Things without trans fat are harder to get and more expensive.” With artificial trans fat increasingly seen as a health risk, many city restaurants had begun seeking alternative ingredients long before the new regulations were proposed. Most packaged food manufacturers began removing them on a large scale in 2004, in anticipation of federal rules that trans fat content be disclosed in nutritional labeling. The rule took effect in January. Some restaurant chains are following suit. Wendy’s has switched to a soy-corn blend cooking oil in its 6,300 restaurants in the United States and Canada, and KFC says it will eliminate trans fat in its food by April. Chicago’s proposal is under discussion. “I’m disappointed we’re losing bragging rights to be the first city in the nation to do this,” said Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman who is pushing the ban. New York’s Board of Health, made up mostly of physicians and health professionals appointed by the mayor, can adopt regulations without approval by any other agency. Still, the board granted concessions to the restaurant industry, which had complained vehemently that it was not being given enough time to experiment with new ingredients and recipes that would preserve or improve the taste of their food. Restaurants will still have until next July 1 to eliminate oils, margarines and shortening from recipes that contain more than a half-gram of trans fat per serving. By July 1, 2008, they would have to remove all menu items that exceed the new limit, including bread, cakes, chips and salad dressings. But under terms adopted yesterday, some foods will fall under the later deadline, including doughnuts, fritters, biscuits and deep fried items that the board said were particularly hard to prepare with a trans fat substitute. “We want the taste, and the experience of food, to be the same or better,” Dr. Frieden said. The requirement for posting caloric content will take effect next July 1, and applies to restaurants that before March 1, 2007, already provided calorie counts on Web sites or in some other public format. Health officials said it would apply to about 10 percent of the city’s restaurants, mainly large chains that have highly standardized menus and portions. Restaurants can decide how to display the calorie counts as long as they are near the places where diners pay for their food, officials said. “We want to allow creativity,” said Dr. Lynn Silver, an assistant health commissioner. “If someone has a better way of doing this, great.”

581-> H.P. Board Cuts Its Ties With Lawyer
Hewlett-Packard’s board has ended a crucial advisory relationship with Larry W. Sonsini, the powerful Silicon Valley lawyer, according to a person with close connections to the board. The move is the latest repercussion from the company’s spying on directors and journalists, which has led to the criminal prosecution of its former chairwoman and a senior company lawyer by California authorities, several federal investigations, $14.5 million in civil fines as well as considerable embarrassment for a company that prided itself on ethical behavior. After the year’s end, Mr. Sonsini and the firm he helped build, Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, will no longer serve as outside counsel to the board. The law firm will still do legal work for Hewlett-Packard. A company spokesman said yesterday that “Wilson Sonsini will continue to have a relationship with H. P.” Mr. Sonsini and his firm were not involved in the spying, which began after Patricia C. Dunn, the H. P. chairwoman, directed company lawyers and investigators to find the source of board leaks. But he was caught up in the events, and was criticized for failing to prevent the incident from damaging the H.P. H.P.’s search for another lawyer to serve as outside counsel is expected to set off a scramble among Silicon Valley firms. “It’s not a big revenue item for a law firm, but being able to say to other clients that ‘I give advice to H.P.,’ is a prestige thing,” said a lawyer who did not want to be identified because he has done work for the company. A spokeswoman for the Sonsini firm, Courtney Dorman, said, “There is a lot of ongoing work with H. P.” The firm handled the transactional work for H. P.’s recent $4.5 billion acquisition of Mercury Interactive, a business software company. Mr. Sonsini, who serves as chairman of the firm he joined in 1966, had no comment. Ms. Dorman also said that the firm’s chief executive, John V. Roos, had no comment. Mr. Sonsini has served as H. P.’s outside counsel since the mid-1990s and he advised the company during its contentious battle with shareholders over the merger with Compaq. The firm’s clients include some of the region’s most important companies, among them Apple, Google, Sun Microsystems and Applied Materials, and Mr. Sonsini helped take many of them public. He also serves as the chairman of the Regulation, Enforcement and Listing Standards Committee of the New York Stock Exchange and as chairman of its Legal Advisory Committee. Mr. Sonsini has been faulted by some lawyers for not protecting the company after a director, Thomas J. Perkins, disclosed the practice of pretexting: the use of false identities to obtain the private phone records. H. P.’s detectives used the technique to get records of certain directors and journalists who covered the company. In May 2006, another director, George A. Keyworth II, was identified as the source of the leak and was asked to resign. He refused to do so, but Mr. Perkins resigned, he now says, in anger over the investigation. After the resignation, Mr. Sonsini, in his role as outside counsel, immediately interviewed Mr. Perkins. But he did not find that Mr. Perkins had resigned because of a disagreement with the company, which would have prompted the board to disclose the circumstances to the Securities and Exchange Commission. That has prompted an S.E.C. investigation. Mr. Perkins also alerted the board to the use of pretexting, calling it illegal. In a response, Mr. Sonsini told him that the pretexting was “within legal limits,” though that opinion turned out to be based on the advice of the H. P. lawyer, now facing charges, who in turn had received the opinion from a Boston lawyer sharing an office with one of H. P.’s private investigators. The Sonsini firm in late August interviewed people involved in the spying, as well as Mark V. Hurd, the company chairman and chief executive, and concluded again that nothing illegal had occurred. In early September, the company filed a statement to the S.E.C. disclosing the pretexting and stating that it was “not generally unlawful.” A Congressional subcommittee asked Mr. Sonsini to testify during its investigation of the spying. He was called to testify alongside Ms. Dunn and had to sit in the witness seat for more than five hours, though she got the brunt of the queries. He defended his law firm’s work during the hearing and said that he considered pretexting to be unethical and improper.

583-> Jersey City: Man Is Sentenced in Newborn Baby’s Death
A West New York man who twice impregnated his daughter and told her to throw both newborns out a third-story bathroom window — which she did, killing one — pleaded guilty yesterday in State Superior Court to aggravated manslaughter, aggravated assault and aggravated sexual assault. The man, Jose Julio Ventura, 45, acknowledged in court that he started having sex with his daughter, Lucila Ventura, now 19, when she was 13. In September 2005, the authorities found a baby boy alive in an air shaft, and the next day they found the body of a newborn girl buried under garbage.

586-> A Subway Nightmare Will Be the Focus of Yet a Third Trial
What happened to Kendra Webdale seven years ago was a New Yorker's nightmare: She was pushed in front of a subway train by a mentally ill man who had stopped taking his antipsychotic medication. Ms. Webdale, a 32-year-old journalist and photographer, was killed instantly. Her assailant, Andrew Goldstein, now 36, was convicted of her murder in March 2000 and was sentenced to up to life in prison. Now he will be tried again. Last December, the state's highest court overturned his conviction, saying that Mr. Goldstein's constitutional right to confront witnesses against him at his trial had been violated. Yesterday, the United States Supreme Court declined to review that decision. A spokeswoman for Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said prosecutors would retry Mr. Goldstein, who remains in custody. Ms. Webdale's sister, Kim, said through the family's lawyer that the family would attend every day of the new trial, as they had his two previous ones. "What Kim said, was, it's going to bring up memories, but we're prepared to go through it a third time if necessary," the lawyer, Jay Dankner, said. "The family will be there as they were the first two trials, and await the jury's verdict." Natalie Rea, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society who represented Mr. Goldstein in his appeal, said she was gratified that the Supreme Court had declined to hear the district attorney's appeal. "Obviously, they agreed with us," that the case did not present any new issues for the highest court, she said. In the meantime, Mr. Dankner said yesterday, there have been developments in a civil lawsuit filed by Ms. Webdale's family in 2000 against seven hospitals and clinics that cared for Mr. Goldstein before Ms. Webdale's death. He said he had obtained records detailing Mr. Goldstein's treatment in the weeks before he pushed Ms. Webdale to her death on Jan. 3, 1999, off the N-line platform at 23rd Street. "We see numerous prior assaults," Mr. Dankner said. "He was striking out at nurses and psychiatrists. This guy was a walking time bomb." In their civil suit, the Webdale family contends that Mr. Goldstein was discharged from North General Hospital in Harlem because the state reimbursement for 21 days of treatment had expired and there was no financial incentive to keep him there. Instead of going to a community-based facility, as he was supposed to, the lawyer said, Mr. Goldstein went back to his apartment, and stopped taking his medication. "Andrew Goldstein fell between the cracks in this system that we call mental health care in New York State as it existed in 1998 and 1999," Mr. Dankner said. In the seven years since Ms. Webdale was killed, her mother, Patricia, who lives in Fredonia, in upstate New York, has gone through a transformation. Mrs. Webdale, who has five other children, has become an advocate for the mentally ill, and she lectures across the country on the need for better treatment. She pushed for what became known as Kendra's Law, passed by the State Legislature in 1999. It allows families of mentally ill people, their roommates and mental health workers to petition the courts to require outpatient treatment for people who otherwise might not take their medication or follow their treatment plans. In an interview last winter, after Mr. Goldstein's conviction was overturned, Ms. Webdale said that in seeking supervision of the mentally ill, she is trying to prevent others from being victimized as her daughter was. The jury deadlocked in Mr. Goldstein's first trial, forcing a mistrial. In his second trial, his lawyer argued that Mr. Goldstein pushed Ms. Webdale onto the tracks while suffering from a transient psychotic episode, perhaps made worse by his failure to take his medication. The prosecution said Mr. Goldstein knew what he was doing, and had a history of using his mental illness as an excuse for bad behavior. Last December, the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, ruled that the psychiatrist who testified for the prosecution should not have been allowed to testify about what other people  including Mr. Goldstein's former landlady  had told her about him, unless those people were available to be cross-examined by the defense. The state court cited a 2004 Supreme Court decision, Crawford v. Washington, in saying that Mr. Goldstein had a constitutional right to confront such witnesses. The prosecution's contention that Mr. Goldstein "was sane when he killed Kendra Webdale was a strong one, but we cannot say it was so strong that no rational jury could have rejected it," Judge Robert S. Smith of the Court of Appeals said, writing for the majority.

590-> Ramírez and Wood Decide Wrigley Is Home
CHICAGO, Nov. 12 (AP)  Coming off a career year at the plate, Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramírez gave up a chance to explore the free-agent market Sunday, agreeing to a five-year, $73 million contract to stay in Chicago. On the first day free agents could negotiate money with all 30 teams, the oft-injured pitcher Kerry Wood also opted to stay with the Cubs, agreeing to a one-year, $1.75 million deal that could be worth as much as $6 million. Ramírez, who joined the Cubs midway through the 2003 season in a trade with the Pirates, had opted out of the final two seasons of a four-year, $42 million contract and filed for free agency Oct. 30. His new deal contains a mutual option for 2012. Ramírez set career highs last season for home runs (38) and runs batted in (119) and batted .291, thanks to a strong finish. Wood, the 1998 National League rookie of the year, has been bothered by arm problems throughout his career.

591-> Manhattan: Ruling Against City in Reservoir Case
A federal appeals court has upheld a penalty against New York City for violating the Clean Water Act by adding silt to an upstate trout stream that carries part of the city's water supply. Ruling on Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by environmentalists six years ago, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sent the case back to the trial judge to recalculate the original $5.7 million penalty, which lawyers said could be trimmed by about $500,000 after a correction in its calculation. The appeals court said that the City Department of Environmental Protection needed a special pollution permit because it added so much silt to the Esopus Creek at the eastern edge of the Catskills. Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the department, said the agency believed that it was inappropriate to apply Clean Water Act rules intended to regulate sewage and industrial waste water to the conveyance of untreated, natural drinking water.

597-> The Merchant of Modernism
“CÉZANNE to Picasso,” a fine masterpiece sampler at the Metropolitan Museum, wends through rooms and rooms of van Goghs, Gauguins, Bonnards and Matisses — not all the usual ones, fortunately — to add to the rooms of them already there. The come-on title turns out to be slightly misleading. The star of the show is not any of the artists. It is a dealer. How apt in our flush days. Ambroise Vollard, born in 1866, the son of a notary, arrived in Paris in 1887 from the Île de la Réunion, a tiny French colony in the Indian Ocean. Big, swarthy, he stuck out on the street. A raconteur who developed as a writer and playwright of satirical and anecdotal charm, he was by nature secretive, enigmatic and aloof, an outsider by birth and by temperament. Maybe this otherness is what attracted him to the avant-garde. Later in life Vollard would say that his childhood habit of collecting pebbles and broken bits of crockery prepared him for his career. In any case, rather than studying the law, as he was sent to Paris to do, he haunted the bookstalls along the Seine, buying engravings and drawings for next to nothing with the allowance that his father cut off once he learned what his son was really up to. With these beginnings of a dealer’s inventory, Vollard also contrived a shrewd plan to acquire a group of Manet’s drawings and unfinished paintings from the artist’s widow for very little money, exhibiting them in his minuscule gallery. That show attracted Renoir, Degas and Maurice Denis, who introduced Vollard to Bonnard and Vuillard, from whom he purchased yet more pictures. Around this time, Père Tanguy, the color merchant, died, and from his estate Vollard acquired — again for a pittance — works by three artists that hardly anyone had heard of: Gauguin, Cézanne and van Gogh. So you can imagine. By the end of World War I, when he was absorbed in the minutiae of publishing exquisite artist books, a labor of love (for which, as always, he turned an eventual profit), Vollard had become stupendously wealthy, despised by some as greedy and ruthless, admired by others for his perspicacity, identified with artists who now defined an era. He became, in other words, the archetypal modern dealer. If you scan his voluminous writings, they indulge hardly at all in aesthetic reveries, if he had any. Along with Cézanne and Picasso, he handled no-talents and oddballs like Jean Puy, Francisco Iturrino and Jacqueline Marval. His taste seems almost irrelevant. Successful dealers, it is often said, have good ears, meaning they listen to what people like and want. Clearly Vollard did. It’s a pity that the Met, allergic to mediocrity, didn’t in this case dilute the show’s content by including some of the Marvals (there’s one in the catalog, of a nude with cheetah, that begs to be hung over a white leather sofa) if only to demonstrate the promiscuity of Vollard’s dealings. Notice that I have avoided saying Vollard’s collection. The show’s organizers are right that Vollard was never a collector, notwithstanding that he died, in a car crash in 1939, with a horde of art piled willy-nilly around his house. He was a dealer. Everything that came into his hands was potentially for sale, even some of the portraits that painters, including Picasso, did of him. He would sometimes tell buyers who craved a Cézanne, for example, that he didn’t have any, although they could perfectly well see Cézannes gathering dust in the next room. He napped while collectors waited for an audience. (He was a notorious napper.) Louisine Havemeyer, the great American collector, while in Paris hunting for a Cézanne, politely cooled her heels for hours before she finally informed Vollard, who had been chatting with somebody, that she had a boat to catch. If she wanted a Cézanne, Vollard told her, she could catch the next boat. Generations of aspiring Vollards, capitalizing on the covetousness and masochism of true collectors, have profited from copying his hard-to-get strategy. With artists, Vollard was not the eternally nurturing, self-sacrificing sort. He could be generous when it served him. He lent Picasso a country house. He provided Rouault with a studio. Cézanne, whose reputation he almost single-handedly rescued from obscurity (and who, having money himself, didn’t care that Vollard made a fortune selling his works for more than he had paid Cézanne to acquire them), regarded him with undying gratitude. But then there was Gauguin, who in 1895 attempted to persuade Vollard to sell his new Tahitian pictures. Vollard didn’t bite. Gauguin tried auctioning them off himself; the sale was a catastrophe, perhaps not helped by Vollard’s decision to show other Gauguins that were better received. Gauguin retreated to Tahiti, defeated and furious at Vollard. Vollard then went about cornering the market in Gauguins, which he could buy for a song. Enraged, Gauguin nonetheless benefited from Vollard’s sales of his pictures. He reluctantly consented to a stipend from Vollard in exchange for art, which Gauguin shipped through friends whom he instructed to skim off the best stuff. In the end Vollard made a fortune, and he made Gauguin famous. Morality, generally speaking, doesn’t have much to do with the art market. Posterity does. I said before that the title of “Cézanne to Picasso” was misleading, because the show isn’t simply a masterpiece sampler. The works chosen are eye candy, sure, but they also passed through Vollard’s hands. “Tarascon Diligence” was in the first van Gogh show that Vollard organized, which flopped. The portrait of Dr. Félix Rey was in the next. It had gone from the doctor to his mother, who used it to plug a hole in a chicken coop. From her it went to Vollard, who sold it to his colleague, Paul Cassirer. It eventually passed to Sergei Shchukin, the great Russian collector, after which it ended up in the Pushkin State Museum. Picasso bought a Matisse still life and a Renoir bather from Vollard. They’re both here. So is Cézanne’s “Bathers,” which Monet bought; and Cézanne’s “Battle of Love,” which Renoir got. And Cézanne’s “Three Bathers,” about which Matisse, who acquired it when he had next to no money, wrote years later: “It has sustained me morally in the critical moments of my venture as an artist. I have drawn from it my faith and my perseverance.” From America, John Quinn and Albert Barnes, along with the Havemeyers, came to shop at Vollard’s. Havemeyer’s collection became a cornerstone of the Met. From Germany, Harry Kessler and Baron Kurt von Mutzenbecher arrived; from Russia, Ivan Morozov as well as Shchukin. All of which is to say that Vollard became the single greatest source, before World War I, for the spread of modernism in Europe and across the Atlantic. The show’s catalog, overseen by Rebecca A. Rabinow and written by the various organizers, contains years of fresh research based on previously unexamined documents. It is a rare thing when art so well known and a figure as familiar as Vollard can be presented in a new light. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, the art. What’s worth noting are less the landmarks than the byways: a Renoir portrait of Vollard dressed as a torero. (Vollard padded his calves to look more manly.) A funny Bonnard of Vollard presiding over one of his famous dinners in the damp cellar of his gallery, where he served his family’s chicken curry to rich, flouncing guests and artists, a precursor to such affairs today. Several late nudes by Degas, difficult and misunderstood by rival dealers, attest to Vollard’s attachment to an artist who had been one of his earliest patrons. And some Matisses, from before 1904, when Vollard organized a Matisse show, which tanked, document a genius whose imminent breakthrough Vollard missed. He also missed Picasso’s Cubism. (The Picasso portrait of Vollard that he sold off was Cubist.) But he grasped Rouault, whose obsessive, deeply spiritual pictures, widely undervalued, emit an uncanny light. The one called “Sunset,” with its church tower like a beacon glowing against a darkling sky, is by itself an argument for his revival.

599-> Shaking Up Tradition in the Way Ads Are Sold
The new media are giving a new twist to one of the oldest rituals on Madison Avenue, the "upfront" market. The unexpectedly fast and furious embrace of new media by the big broadcast television networks is drastically affecting the plans of advertisers and agencies to buy billions of dollars worth of commercial time. Advertisers could spend the same amount of money this year on, for example, the ABC drama "Lost," but spread their messages across the television show, and the repeats the networks now offer free online. "The networks are recognizing that the way people are consuming television is changing, and the money is going to follow that," said Joe Mandese, editor of MediaPost in New York, an online and print trade publication, adding that this upfront could well be "a watershed." The annual rite, which dates back decades, is known as the upfront because the negotiations between the buyers and the network sellers take place in the spring, ahead of the fall TV season. The 2006-7 upfront starts today, with the presentation of the NBC prime-time lineup, and continues through Thursday. After the unveiling of the schedules, bargaining begins over how much the advertisers will pay as well as which shows they will sponsor or snub. But the rapid migration of TV shows off TV and onto Web sites, iPods, cellphones and other fledgling venues is shaking up the conventions of this year's upfront market. "How is this upfront different from all other upfronts?" asked Charlie Rutman, chief executive for North America at MPG in New York, the media agency owned by Havas. He then answered his own question: "This upfront will be different because of all the choices. "I've been doing this for 30 years, and the idea of getting up in the morning, coming in and trying to find the new 'beachfront property' is exciting. The networks are doing a terrific job in opening up these new avenues to us." Along with NBC and ABC, the networks wooing the advertisers with elaborate events and parties this week are CBS; the new CW, which replaces UPN and WB; Fox Broadcasting; My Network TV, also new and a sibling of Fox; and Hispanic channels that include Sí TV, TeleFutura, Telemundo and Univision. A major difference the new media are making, Mr. Mandese said, is to shift the balance between supply (the networks) and demand (the advertisers). In previous upfronts, the networks tried to raise ad rates by stressing the limits on the number of commercials that can run during the evening hours of prime time, when TV viewing levels are highest. "There's a finite supply of time on TV," Mr. Mandese said. "But multiple platforms create multiple sources for new ads." "As a result, I don't think there's a feeling this year that the advertisers have to rush into the marketplace to make their buys," he added, which could weaken the bargaining hand of the networks. Whatever the effect on ad rates of expanding the inventory of commercial time by offering programs through new media, the networks realize they cannot stand pat. The reason is that marketers have not been waiting for the upfront market to decide between mainstay media and their new-media rivals. Rather, they are turning over a significantly increasing portion of their ad budgets to new-media specialists like AOL, Comcast video-on-demand, Google, MSN and Yahoo. "You already see ad dollars leaving the traditional media and going into the digital space," said Bill Cella, chairman and chief executive at Magna Global in New York, part of the Interpublic Media unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The trend "is becoming more pronounced," Mr. Cella said, adding: "I look at it not as fragmentation, but as hyper-fragmentation. It's mind-boggling." Just as "our clients have to follow their customers" into the new media, Mr. Cella said, "the networks have to follow their viewers" there. And follow them they are, with a rapidity and an enthusiasm that is surprising many agency executives on the other side of the bargaining table. "We don't know what exactly all the opportunities are going to be, but I do applaud the networks for trying," said John Muszynski, chief executive at Starcom in Chicago, part of the Starcom MediaVest Group division of the Publicis Groupe. "It would be silly of us to believe this is all going to be changing at once, but I do believe the upfront the way we've known it is no longer the case," he added. Perhaps the most prominent foray by broadcasters into the new media is the availability of shows from ABC, Fox and NBC at the iTunes Music Store (itunes.com) operated by Apple Computer. ABC is also offering episodes of selected series on its Web site (abc.com). CBS is doing the same, branding its service as Innertube (cbs.com/innertube). Last spring, during the upfront market ahead of the 2005-6 season, advertisers agreed to buy an estimated $9.1 billion worth of commercial time on the six biggest broadcast networks. That was slightly less than they bought in the upfront before the 2004-5 season, suggesting that the movement of money to the new media was under way. Because of the uncertainty that new media are bringing to this upfront market, analysts are not offering as many forecasts as they usually do. Some predict the total could increase modestly, by $100 million to $300 million, because of the appeal of the new-media opportunities. Others say those media outlets will only slow the flow of ad dollars from broadcast TV, resulting in a total similar to or down slightly from last spring's. The analysts say ABC and Fox may fare best among the major broadcasters because of the strong ratings for series like "American Idol," "Grey's Anatomy," "Lost" and "24." NBC, which is still struggling with ratings losses, may take in less money for a second consecutive year, the analysts say. Typically, the networks sell 70 percent to 80 percent of the commercial time available in a coming season during the upfront market. They sell the remainder during the season, in what is called the scatter market.

600-> Former Employee Charged in Extortion Scheme Against Security Company
A former employee at Blackwater U.S.A. was charged with trying to extort $1 million from the company by threatening to leak information about four contractors killed in Iraq in 2004. The woman, Laura Holdren-Nowacki, 35, of Moyock, was charged Monday with one count of extortion, Sheriff Tony Perry of Camden County said. Sheriff Perry said Ms. Holdren-Nowacki, a former fleet vehicle manager for Blackwater, a security company, threatened to release documents about the contractors' deaths to the news media, members of Congress and family members of the men. Ms. Holdren-Nowacki said the accusations were untrue. After the contractors were killed, their bodies were mutilated and strung up on a bridge. The men's families have sued Blackwater.

601-> Man Kills Estranged Wife, Then Himself, at Her Door
A Brooklyn mother of two was killed yesterday afternoon while accepting a housewarming gift when her newly estranged husband rushed up and shot her with a shotgun he had hidden up his sleeve, the police and witnesses said. He then reloaded and shot himself to death. The woman, identified by friends as Karen Skellas, 44, an administrative worker at Lutheran Medical Center, had just days ago moved into an apartment at 2261 East Second Street in Gravesend, having left her husband, Ioannis Skellas, 49, with plans to divorce him, said a coworker, John D’Atri. Mr. D’Atri dropped by to deliver a housewarming gift shortly before 1 p.m. yesterday, he said, and watched in horror as a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt approached and shot Mrs. Skellas. “I was standing outside her house and talking to her. He came out of nowhere,” Mr. D’Atri said. “They spoke. She kept saying, ‘No, no, no,’ and something in Greek, and he fired.” Mr. D’Atri’s first thought was that he was witnessing a joke of some sort. “I didn’t know who it was,” he said. “He was apparently hiding his weapon in his sleeve. He fired once. I don’t know if it misfired or hit what she was carrying in her hands. I wasn’t sure if it was real or if it was a Halloween prank. He backed up a little, and then in the blink of an eye he came forward again and fired a second shot.” That shot killed Mrs. Skellas, he said. Mr. D’Atri said the weapon appeared to be a sawed-off shotgun. He ran away, seeking refuge at a neighbor’s house. Another neighbor who declined to give his name, said he saw what happened next. “He shoots the woman. He goes back and drops the shells,” apparently reloading, he said. Then the man returned to Mrs. Skellas’s fallen body on the sidewalk and shot himself. “He blasted away and went down right on top of her,” the man said. “He must have shot himself in the stomach.” The police said there was no history of domestic violence between the two. Friends described Mr. Skellas as a construction worker who enjoyed hunting. He did not appear to have a criminal record, the police said yesterday. The couple had two children in their 20s, a son who is a contractor and a daughter who is planning to enter the New York City Police Academy during the next term, neighbors of the family’s Bay Ridge home said. George Lykourezos, 52, the owner of Spartan Souvlaki, where Mr. Skellas often came for Greek salads, said Mr. Skellas approached him about four days ago with a hint that there was trouble in the marriage. “He came in and asked if I knew any investigators,” he said, referring to his friend as everyone did yesterday, by the name John. “I said, ‘John, I don’t know anybody.’ ” The next day, Mr. Skellas returned, Mr. Lykourezos said. “He said, ‘Forget about it. I took care of it. I don’t need him anymore.’ ” The owner of a nearby deli in Bay Ridge, who gave her name only as Mrs. Lee, 59, said Mr. Skellas came in most days for his favorite chewing gum, and yesterday also bought a loaf of Italian bread, displaying no sign of what was to come. “He’s such a nice person. Nothing trouble. Like a happy family,” Mrs. Lee said, describing Mr. and Mrs. Skellas walking their pet pit bull together. “Every time quiet, and he smiled.” No one from the neighborhood seemed to know about trouble in the marriage. Mr. D’Atri, the coworker, said he believed Mr. Skellas had threatened violence in the past, leading to the separation. “To my understanding, she was waiting to see his reaction to the divorce, if there was going to be a necessity for an order of protection,” he said. “She had felt threatened in the past.” After witnessing the shooting, Mr. D’Atri’s attempts to find refuge on East Second Street were futile, with neighbors frightened by the loud gunshots. One neighbor, Rina Louzieh, said she was startled when a man appeared at her door. “We just heard shots, three shots. This man came to our home,” she said. “He said, ‘Please open your door. Someone wants to kill me.’ He pushed too much. He’s too big. “He said, ‘Please, someone wants to kill me.’ I said, ‘Let him kill you outside.’ And that’s it, I shut the door.”

602-> World Briefing | Americas: Canada: Move To Raise The Age Of Sexual Consent
For the first time in more than a century, the government introduced legislation to raise the legal age of sexual consent, to 16 from 14. Under an exemption in the bill, youths 14 and 15 could continue to have a legal sexual partner who is up to five years older. "Adults who sexually prey upon young people are the targets of these reforms, not consenting teenagers," the justice minister, Vic Toews, said. CHRISTOPHER MASON (NYT)

Dodgers first baseman Nomar Garciaparra tore his left quadriceps while running out an infield single in the fourth inning of Game 2 on Thursday night and will be limited to a pinch-hitting role, Manager Grady Little said. "Running is the hard part," Little said. Garciaparra, who hurt his quadriceps in a game on Sept. 15, did not leave Game 2 until the sixth inning. He will be replaced in the lineup by the rookie James Loney, who batted .284 in 48 games and tied a franchise record with nine runs batted in on Sept. 28 at Colorado. BEN SHPIGEL (NYT)

604-> Two Events, Lots of Time Aloft
On Oct. 21 the first World Women’s Elite Team Tournament ended in Wuxi, China, and the third World University Team Championship began in Tianjin, China. One pair, Marion Michielsen and Meike Wortel, from the Netherlands, played in both events, flying between the two sites. They finished second of eight in Wuxi and ninth of 27 in Tianjin. Michielsen in particular is highly regarded. In Round 16 against Italy in Tianjin she defended well on the diagramed deal, the last of the match. At the other table Francesco Ferrari, the Italian East, overcalled one spade. After South rebid two diamonds, Alberto Sangiorgio (West) competed with two spades, ending the auction. Jeroen Bruggeman and Bob Drijver defended carefully to defeat the contract by one trick. Michielsen (East) decided against overcalling one spade and sold out to two diamonds. Wortel led the club eight. In the tournament world when defending against a suit contract, leading third-highest from an even number and lowest from an odd number is much more popular than fourth highest. On average “thirds and fifths” supply suit-length information quicker than “fourths.” And one is more likely to make an opening lead from a three-card suit against a trump contract than against no-trump (where fourth highest still rules). The declarer, Andrea Boldrini, won with his club jack and played a trump to the jack and king. East shifted to her heart five, selecting the high card to feign weakness in the suit and to dissuade her partner from returning a heart. West, getting the message, won with her king and led back the club queen for East to ruff. Michielsen paused to consider her next step. With the actual layout, East could have continued with the ace and another trump. But she was not sure about the heart count. If South had started with 2-2-6-3 distribution, East had to return a spade to set up a trick there before declarer could obtain a discard on dummy’s heart queen. Once East had decided to shift to a spade, she recalled the “surrounding play.” This is a typical example: NORTH 10 8 4 WESTEAST A 7 2K J 9 5 SOUTH Q 6 3 If East leads the five, declarer can play low from his hand and take a trick in the suit. But East has dummy’s ten (in the hand on the right) surrounded by the jack and nine and holds a higher nontouching honor (here, the king). In this situation, the correct lead is the jack, the second-highest card. That allows the defenders to run the suit. Michielsen realized this spade layout was a variation on that textbook theme. She had dummy’s nine surrounded by her ten and seven — as long as her partner held the critical eight-spot. So East made the killing switch to the spade ten. Declarer covered with his jack and took West’s queen with dummy’s ace. After the heart queen was covered and ruffed, declarer guessed correctly, continuing with the diamond queen to pin West’s ten. But East won with her ace and led back her remaining trump. Stranded in his hand, South tried a spade to dummy’s nine, but East won with her king and returned a spade to defeat the contract. The defenders took two spades, one heart, two diamonds and one club ruff. Plus 50 in both rooms gave the Netherlands 3 imps on the board and victory in the match by 6 imps. • In the deal in Saturday’s column, Joel Wooldridge was sitting North, not South, and John Barth was South, not North. They had been incorrectly listed in online sources and in the daily bulletin.

605-> Maxi Baier, 86, Olympic Skating Champion, Is Dead
GARMISCH-PARTENKIRCHEN, Germany, Oct. 28 — Maxi Baier, who teamed to win the 1936 Olympic pairs figure skating title at 15, died here Oct. 20. She was 86. Her death followed a lingering illness, her daughter said. Baier captured the pairs with her future husband, Ernst Baier, at the Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. After the Olympics, they won the European and world championships three years in a row before turning professional in 1941. Baier was pushed into skating by her father when she 5, and she switched to pairs when she met Ernst in 1932. In 1935, they were the surprise winners at the European Championships. They married in 1940 and formed an ice revue, the Berliner Eisrevue, which toured the world. In the 1950s, she concentrated on rearing their children. In 1965, the couple divorced and Baier became a skating teacher in Garmisch-Partenkirchen.

608-> New York to Examine Creating Citywide Broadband Network
Even as a contractor moves ahead with plans to install wireless networks in 10 parks, New York City intends to study whether to establish a citywide broadband network similar to those planned by cities like Philadelphia and San Francisco. The study, commissioned by the city's Economic Development Corporation, will examine "whether there is a need for a citywide broadband network as a municipal initiative" and what legal, technical, logistical and economic challenges such a project would involve, according to a request for proposals that the city released on June 14. The request for proposals was mentioned in a brief item in Crain's New York Business on June 26, but has otherwise attracted little attention until yesterday when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg mentioned it. The mayor was addressing a project by the Department of Parks and Recreation to bring wireless Internet access to 18 locations in 10 major city parks, including Central and Riverside Parks in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn and Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt Parks in the Bronx. Asked why no Staten Island parks were included, Mr. Bloomberg said: "The parks on Staten Island tend to be very small, and that's much harder to provide Wi-Fi to. So the first thing we're going to do is do the big parks, and then we'll take a look at the others. And we have actually started to do a study as to what it would take to do long, thin parks or very small parks, finding an economic way to do that." Consultants' proposals for conducting the broadband feasibility study are due on July 21. The first goal would be to assess "the existing state of broadband services" and decide whether a citywide network  or a more limited network  is needed. If the answer is yes, the Economic Development Corporation could have the consultant stay on to develop an economic and technological approach for the project. The request for proposals noted that "broadband availability is already high" in many neighborhoods, but also asked whether wireless access could be made widely available "at competitive prices" and whether a network could strengthen the local economy. In August 2004, a plan announced by Mayor John F. Street of Philadelphia to blanket the city's 135 square miles with broadband signals attracted national attention. A nonprofit organization created to oversee the project, Wireless Philadelphia, signed a contract in March with EarthLink, an Internet service provider based in Atlanta, to install transmittal devices on about 4,000 streetlights and create 22 free "hot spots" around the city. Other cities have followed suit. In April 2005, the city of Tempe, Ariz., hired the MobilePro Corporation of Bethesda, Md., to build a wireless network covering the city's 40 square miles. Last April, San Francisco selected EarthLink and Google to provide free or low-cost wireless Internet access across the city's 47 square miles. Last week, EarthLink opened a Wi-Fi network covering the central area of Anaheim, Calif. All of the city's 50 square miles are to be covered by the end of the year. Dana Spiegel, executive director of NYC Wireless, a local nonprofit group that has been hired by several business improvement districts and companies to set up wireless networks in public spaces, cautioned that the other cities might not be the right model for New York City to follow. "We're a much bigger city and have a much more complicated set of connectivity problems," he said. "It's unclear that municipal broadband at a citywide level is the solution for New York City."

To the Editor: Re "Conservative Christians Warn Republicans Against Inaction" (front page, May 15): Since 2001, Republicans have fed the maw of the religious right with hundreds of millions of dollars for its "faith-based initiatives," done everything possible to restrict abortion here and abroad, subverted science by forcing "abstinence only" AIDS prevention policies, stacked the federal bench with conservative zealots and relentlessly sought to eliminate any financing for gay-related health and social service programs.

611-> As the Jobs Go South, the Hope Goes With Them
McMINNVILLE, Tenn. — You may have seen Don Rackley before. You see people like him every election cycle. The human prop, he calls himself. He says it with a ring of bitterness. He is the sort of man you see on television sitting at the counter of a diner in a down-and-out steel town, or a struggling textile town, some American place teetering on despair. The candidates come for the morning, roll up their sleeves, promise changes. The cameras snap the pictures. Then everybody leaves. In February 2004, John Edwards, the senator from North Carolina and a White House hopeful, was that candidate in this part of the country, a place of chicken pens and cotton fields in the triangle of Nashville, Knoxville and Chattanooga. The region was once humming with factory jobs paying $15 an hour to start, with benefits and vacation. But the Carrier Corporation, an industrial air-conditioning manufacturer and the financial anchor of Warren County, had just announced it was shutting its profitable plant and shipping many of the 1,300 jobs to Mexico, the latest in a string of closings in the area. Mr. Edwards came on a cold February morning. Checkered tablecloths were put out at Prater’s BBQ out on Manchester Highway. Workers were rounded up. Mr. Rackley, the president of the Sheet Metal Workers Local 483 and a crew leader in the Carrier plant, was there. James Mears, the recording secretary, wore his union jacket and cap. They had a heart-to-heart with Mr. Edwards over bad coffee. “Mr. Edwards promised he’d try to get Nafta repealed,” Mr. Rackley said afterward as reporters took notes. Then, the senator left. The reporters left. And, last year, the factory left. Left behind were thousands of people who once had a piece of the American middle class, including Mr. Rackley. The million-square-foot factory squats empty in a green pasture, like an elephant in the death field. The only reminder of Don Rackley’s 28 years there are the salt and pepper shakers collecting dust on the cafeteria table where he used to eat lunch. “I got to give Edwards some credit,” Mr. Rackley said from the porch of his prefabricated home deep in the country across from a corn field. “At least he showed up.” Mr. Edwards had tapped into a simmering resentment, he said. The Two Americas: the haves and the have-nots. But Mr. Edwards did not articulate a third type of America, Mr. Rackley said. The one he finds himself part of: “The used-to-haves.” The factory employs six people now, security men making sure the place doesn’t burn down. When it was boarded up, Mr. Rackley, 48, looked for another job, but there were few beyond the convenience-store counter or the gas station. With the screw plant and box factory gone and the electric motor company in the final stages of shutdown, Mr. Rackley tried tree-stump grinding for a while, but business was catch as catch can. Now he drives a sod truck for a third of what he used to make. His wife, Jovella, 51, has a little beauty parlor next to their house, past the white church beyond the railroad tracks, with goats and chickens roaming behind it. She charges $8 a haircut. “Some guys are living off their unemployment,” Mr. Rackley said, his cheeks flush, his fists clenched, looking as if he might punch the man who asked the stupid question. “Worst, some guys are living off their wives.” Mr. Rackley began working at the Carrier plant out of high school and thought he would retire there. He worked his way from the assembly line to brazing metals to crew chief. After a while, the Rackleys were able to afford property. They raised a family and bought a new truck now and then. But that life ended in November of last year, when he punched the clock for the final time. There are thousands of people in the area filling out unemployment applications. The Rackleys’ daughter is not working either. Nor is her husband. Eleven percent of the county is unemployed. It is the highest unemployment rate in Tennessee. The severance checks run out sometime next month. Mondays at the unemployment office are like an Irish wake: middle-aged people telling worn-out stories, laughing through their circumstance. The place has an Orwellian name: Tennessee Career Center. James Hash, standing in line with a ball cap pulled over his eyes, put it like this: “Here you are standing in an employment line at my age. Nobody wants you no more.” “You’re left out. You’re not American no more.” They come to the unemployment office to get yellow cards, and it works like this: They go someplace and ask for a job; they are rejected, and receive a yellow card proving they have been rejected. This is how they earn their $275-a-week unemployment check, before taxes. They call it the barn dance, and one of their first employment-rejection stops is the struggling dry cleaning shop next door. But Mr. Rackley refuses to take the handout. “I was raised to work,” he said, “so I swallowed my pride, and now I drive a sod truck.” He makes too much money to receive state-financed health care, makes too little to afford his own. “The American way has slipped away,” he said, having just finished a 12-hour day that paid him $100. “I don’t know what those people are going to do when those unemployment checks run out,” he said. “People’s going to go crazy.” He stalks off to kill a chicken for dinner. His wife is near tears. She’ll probably never see Disney World now. She said quitting her Virginia Slims cigarettes would save some money, but there was too much stress for that. She sweeps the parlor floor in silence for a while. She probably won’t vote in the midterm Congressional election. “I’d like to see the politicians come back now,” Mrs. Rackley said. “We’re hurting bad down here. It’s like they used us, then forgot about us.”

614-> Clinton, in Arkansas, Says Democrats Are 'Wasting Time'
ROGERS, Ark., July 15 — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, returning to her red-state ties, chastised Democrats Saturday for taking on issues that arouse conservatives and turn out Republican voters rather than finding consensus on mainstream subjects. Without mentioning specific subjects like gay marriage, Mrs. Clinton said: “We do things that are controversial. We do things that try to inflame their base.” “We are wasting time,” the senator told a group of Democratic women here, on part of a two-day swing through a state that could provide an alternate hub to New York if she starts a national political campaign. On recent weekends, Mrs. Clinton has been traveling the country and raising money at an extraordinary pace. But the trip to Arkansas this weekend had a more sentimental feel, reuniting Mrs. Clinton with her former political allies and giving her a platform to broadcast her more centrist background. After speaking to the Arkansas Federation of Democratic Women, Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to visit the first home in Fayetteville that her husband bought for her, and where they were married. But she made the trip solo: Former President Bill Clinton has been in Africa, visiting projects run by the Clinton Foundation. Mrs. Clinton said her husband had called her to report that he had learned on his trip that the American ambassador to Malawi was from Arkansas, part of what she jokingly referred to as the “Arkansas diaspora.” Arkansas supported Mr. Clinton, its former governor, when he ran for president in 1992 and 1996, but went for George W. Bush in 2000. Mr. Bush made the northwest Arkansas region one of his final stops before the election that year, confident that he could solidify Southern gains. And he did: just 46 percent of Arkansas voted for Al Gore, and four years later, the percentage of votes for the Democratic candidate fell, with 44 percent backing Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. Although the state’s two senators are Democrats, Arkansas has been increasingly seen as a Republican stronghold at the presidential level. In front of an almost entirely Democratic crowd Saturday, Mrs. Clinton made a glancing reference to the current turmoil in the Middle East. “We just have to turn on the news, don’t we, to see what it’s like going on around the world — so many conflicts,” Mrs. Clinton said. “We need to get back to building partnerships and alliances, to making friends so we can influence decisions that other people make and have people working with us to stem the tide of terrorism and the threats that we confront.” She added: “If we have to use military power, yes, we have to use it. But use it as a last resort, not as a first resort. Use it after all else has failed.” Mrs. Clinton, who voted to authorize the use of military force in Iraq in 2002, has grown increasingly critical of the Bush administration’s approach to the invasion and its diplomacy in recent months.

617-> The Cure for a Cold Heart
“Aurora Borealis” stars Joshua Jackson as Duncan, a boring, damaged, apathetic 20-something whose major claim on our attention is the type of bathetic cuddliness perfected by wet puppies and Mark Ruffalo. The fixation of independent movies on the arrested development of bourgeois dullards may have less to do with the relevance of the topic than the class of people who get to make movies. Whatever the case, James Burke directs from a screenplay by Brent Boyd. Set in dead-of-winter Minneapolis, a ready-made metaphor for (groan, shiver) the chill in Duncan’s heart, the movie tells how life warms up when he goes to work at a nursing home. He takes the gig because hey, why not, and also so the filmmakers can place him in proximity to his crusty grandfather (Donald Sutherland). But the spark comes from connecting with Kate, a free-spirited nurse played with live-wire attention by Juliette Lewis. Ms. Lewis excels as sexpots (“Natural Born Killers”) and psychopaths (“Natural Born Killers”) and, in her capacity as the lead singer of a rock band, she has mastered the art of crowd surfing in a bikini, but “Aurora Borealis” hints at an untapped talent for playing mature, textured women. Kate is spry, avid, generous and autonomous. You don’t doubt her galvanic effect on Duncan; you only wonder why she, and this film, care about him in the first place. Directed by James Burke; written by Brent Boyd; director of photography, Alar Kivilo; edited by Richard Nord; music by Mychael Danna; production designer, Taavo Soodor; produced by Scott Disharoon and Rick Bieber; released by Regent Releasing. Running time: 110 minutes. WITH: Joshua Jackson (Duncan Shorter), Donald Sutherland (Ronald Shorter), Juliette Lewis (Kate) and Louise Fletcher (Ruth Shorter).

619-> Fielder of Dreams
Most biographies of great athletes are tinged with melancholy, for three reasons. Athletic greatness is often achieved by a narrowing, even infantilizing, monomania about physical things. Sport compresses life's natural trajectory of ascent, apogee and decline. And often an athlete's life after sport is a long, dispiriting decrescendo. David Maraniss's splendid "Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball's Last Hero" is different, for three reasons. Roberto Clemente was an unusually elegant, even noble, athlete. He was emblematic of a social transformation. And he had no life after baseball. Maraniss's biography of Bill Clinton is still the best of the first president formed by the 1960's. He is also the author of one of the best books on the 1960's, "They Marched Into Sunlight: War and Peace, Vietnam and America, October 1967." And now he has produced a baseball-savvy book sensitive to the social context that made Clemente, a black Puerto Rican, a leading indicator of baseball's future. Clemente was not the first Latino player, but as the first Latino superstar — the National League's first Latino batting champion and M.V.P. — he propelled baseball's "southern strategy" for finding talent. Baseball has come a long way since the San Francisco Giants' manager Alvin Dark, in 1964, banned Spanish in the clubhouse. In 1989 and 1990, five of the 26 major-league teams had a starting shortstop from the same Dominican town, San Pedro de Macorís. In 2005, 29 percent of the players on the 30 teams' opening day rosters were born outside the United States — 70 percent of them from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela or Puerto Rico. Among the nearly 1,200 players on the 40-man rosters this spring, 10 of the 16 most common surnames were Hernández, Gonzalez, Perez, Ramirez, Rodriguez, Cabrera, Guzman, Lopez, Peña and Sanchez. The emblematic Pirate of the 1960 World Series-winning team was, as Maraniss notes, "ethnic" — second baseman Bill Mazeroski, son of a coal miner from nearby West Virginia. Not until the late 1980's did California supplant Pennsylvania as the state that had produced the most major leaguers. California's climate provides opportunities to develop baseball talent. Pennsylvania provided incentives — escape from the mines and dark satanic steel mills. Latin America has both the climate and the incentives. The report on young Fred Astaire's screen test said: "Can't act. Slightly bald. Can dance a little." When the Pittsburgh Pirates drafted Clemente out of the Brooklyn Dodgers' farm system in 1954, they said, "He can run and throw — and we think he can hit." Oh, yes. In his last at-bat, in September 1972, he became the 11th player — 15 others have done it since — to get 3,000 hits. A bad-ball hitter with a "nose to toes" strike zone, he was difficult to walk. But then, as the saying goes, you can't walk off an island. In 18 seasons, all with the Pirates, Clemente used the whole field. Maraniss believes that two factors — Clemente used an unusually heavy bat, and had chronic back and neck discomfort from a 1954 automobile accident — kept Clemente from being a home-run-seeking pull hitter. Instead, he sprayed line drives into the left- and right-field power alleys. Tim McCarver, the first catcher ever to lead either league in triples, once said hitting a triple is better than sex. Most of us are unable to make that comparison, but if Clemente, who hit 166 triples, agreed with McCarver, he played in two home ballparks built for ecstasy. The Pirates never led the league in home runs while playing in Forbes Field, but its spaciousness — 365 feet to left, 416 to right-center, 457 to the deepest part of center field, where the batting cage was kept on the field of play — turned many Clemente drives into triples. So did the hard fake-grass surface of cavernous Three Rivers Stadium, to which the Pirates moved in 1970. The first black Puerto Rican to play in the American League was Clemente's friend Vic Power, a flashy-fielding first baseman. Like Clemente, he was incensed by the 1950's contrast between Puerto Rico's easygoing race relations and America's segregation. But unlike Clemente, Power responded with wit. When a waitress said her restaurant did not serve Negroes, he replied equably, "That's O.K., I don't eat Negroes." Clemente, playing in a city with a minuscule Latino population, said he felt like a "double nigger." As late as 1971 — in one game that year, the Pirates became the first team ever to have nine black players in its starting lineup — some sportswriters still quoted him in phonetic English: "Eef I have my good arm thee ball gets there a leetle quicker." Arrestingly handsome, at 5 feet 11 inches and 185 pounds he was about the size of today's smaller middle infielders. But the smoldering energy of his national and professional pride and resentments seemed transmuted into energy at bat and in the field. Right fielders need the strongest arms, to give runners second thoughts about going from first to third on singles. In the golden age of right fielders (Hank Aaron, Frank Robinson, Reggie Jackson, Al Kaline), Clemente's arm was the best. A Clemente line drive broke the leg of one Hall of Fame pitcher (the Cardinals' Bob Gibson, who pitched to three more batters before collapsing) and, Maraniss believes, hastened the retirement of another, the Dodgers' Don Drysdale. In August 1969, after a Clemente shot whistled into the outfield, Drysdale flicked what felt like an insect off his neck, but discovered blood on his fingers. Clemente's drive had torn the skin off the top of Drysdale's ear. Shaken, Drysdale walked Clemente the next time up and retired six days later. The last act of Clemente's life was in character. On Dec. 23, 1972, a severe earthquake devastated Nicaragua. Clemente, making use of his heroic status, threw himself into organizing Puerto Rico's charitable response. Incensed by reports that agents of Nicaragua's dictatorship were diverting, and profiting from, the shipment of aid, he chartered an ancient DC-7. He did not know it was a ramshackle contraption operated by a shady pilot with an untrained crew. Hoping his presence could force the Nicaraguan officials to distribute his materials, he boarded the plane. Overloaded and unbalanced, it plunged into the sea a few thousand yards from the end of the San Juan airport. His body was not recovered. "The mythic aspects of baseball," Maraniss concludes, "usually draw on clichés of the innocent past, the nostalgia for how things were. Fields of green. Fathers and sons. But Clemente's myth arcs the other way, to the future, not the past, to what people hope they can become. His memory is kept alive as a symbol of action and passion, not of reflection and longing. He broke racial and language barriers and achieved greatness and died a hero." In 2005, 33 years after Clemente's death, Ozzie Guillen, the Venezuelan manager of the world champion Chicago White Sox, said his home has a shrine to the player he most reveres, Roberto Clemente. Now, thanks to Maraniss, Clemente's legacy is suitably defined and explained.

620-> Frances-Marie Uitti Interprets Giacinto Scelsi’s ‘Trilogy’
Among the impulses that stir composers to create, an encounter with an exceptional performer ranks high. But the relationship between the Italian maverick Giacinto Scelsi and the American-born Dutch cellist Frances-Marie Uitti went beyond simple inspiration. After an initial encounter in 1974, Ms. Uitti worked closely with the reclusive, eccentric Scelsi until his death in 1988, her prodigious technique enabling him to refine his demanding scores. That period, filled as much with philosophical discussion and meditation as with musical collaboration, made Ms. Uitti a singularly persuasive advocate for Scelsi’s unorthodox music and one of its most authoritative interpreters. On Friday at the Italian Academy at Columbia University, she performed “Trilogy,” an elaborate, extensive solo work that Scelsi had entrusted to her care and allowed her to edit. Running just short of an hour, “Trilogy” comprises two triptychs flanking an arc-shaped centerpiece. “Triphon” (1956) opens with bold, annunciatory single notes bowed on one string and repeated on another as dim echoes. Using a limited tonal range, Scelsi concentrated on continually varying timbre and density. Still, shards of melody and martial rhythms suggest the sort of abstract-expressionist language that he had abandoned. Ms. Uitti underscored the startlingly abrupt endings of the second and third sections with dramatic sweeps of her bow. “Dithome” (1957), the centerpiece, is more concentrated. Tonal qualities of a given pitch change as it relocates from one string to another, while exaggerated vibrato and more unorthodox techniques produce even finer gradations. The piece rises from near silence to frenetic outburst; a brief, plain-spoken melody offers repose; then “Dithome” reverses course in a glassy retreat to stillness. Despite its seeming spontaneity, “Ygghur” (1965) is precisely calculated. The cello is retuned so that the performer can play a unison across all four strings, each notated on a separate staff; with a central pitch meandering through neighboring microtones. But for all the control Scelsi exerted, “Ygghur” (“Catharsis” in Sanskrit) sounds primal, its variegated drones quietly sublime in cumulative effect. Ms. Uitti’s new recording of “Ygghur,” issued recently by ECM, situates her within a resonant, churchlike ambience. In the dry acoustics of the Italian Academy’s concert hall, the music seemed more introverted, less a public performance than a private reverie. The audience — silent and rapt throughout the concert, which was presented without pause — provided another sort of catharsis with its explosive ovation.

GADGETRY, the source of inspiration for many a holiday gift, is no longer just for the home-entertainment altar or car dashboard. In fact, it is now enhancing objects like shower mirrors, refrigerators and ... rabbits. LG’s icebox TV is one of this year’s biggest examples: a 26.2-cubic-foot titanium-finished refrigerator-freezer with a 15-inch liquid-crystal-display screen in the door. Although LG first released a refrigerator-TV unit in 2004, this model includes an additional four-inch weather and information L.C.D. screen above the ice dispenser. “We wanted to provide some of the interactivity and function that people might get from a computer, while doing it in a relatively cost-effective way,” said Tim Kavanaugh, the director of merchandising for LG’s digital appliance division. The smaller screen includes an electronic bank of recipes and a U.S.B. port that can be used for transferring images into the appliance’s personal digital photo album. More information on this model is in the home appliances section at us.lge.com; the unit itself costs about $3,500 at Best Buy or other appliance stores. Smaller and less expensive appliances are also fusing the outside world with the inner sanctum of the kitchen. The Melitta Smart Mill and Brew coffee maker displays weather conditions, forecasts and other information from the MSN Direct wireless data-cast network on its L.C.D. screen. The weather function does not require an Internet connection, so there are no monthly fees. The Melitta Smart Mill and Brew sells for about $200 or less at Amazon.com and Sharper Image. More information is available at yourgrindredefined.com. Moving into the bathroom, the Discovery Tri-Fold Wireless MP shower mirror uses an FM transmitter to pull in the audio signal of any TV set, MP3 player or CD player within 100 feet. The $100 mirror (available at shopping.discovery.com/product-63516.html) includes an FM radio and digital clock. For those who want to keep their iPods close at all times, there is the Atech Flash iCarta stereo dock on a toilet-paper holder that mounts on the wall. Compatible with most recent iPod models (and presumably all brands of toilet paper), the iCarta comes with four integrated speakers to bounce sound off the bathroom walls. With its electrical adapter, the iCarta charges the iPod while it is parked in the dock. The system sells for around $100 and is available at many online electronics stores. There is a “where to buy” list and more details at atechflash.com/products-icarta.html. While the iCarta adds a twist to the concept of musical toilet-paper dispenser, the picture frame is being taken a step further, too. Although a digital picture frame, where photos can be transferred from a computer to a stand-alone screen, is not new, companies like eStarling are adding wireless networking to the mix. The 7-inch eStarling wireless frame ($250; for pre-ordering at thinkgeek.com/electronics/cameras/7edc/) accepts photos from memory cards and RSS feeds from Flickr. The frame can display photos that are e-mailed to it after it has been configured with standard POP3 mail account settings. You can also set up a dedicated e-mail address just for the eStarling frame to receive pictures from friends and relatives. If an ever-changing electronic photo frame is not enough of a conversation piece around the house, how about the Nabaztag Wi-Fi Smart Rabbit? Nabaztag, which happens to be Armenian for “rabbit,” looks like a plastic toy rabbit. Once it is connected to the home wireless network, however, this rabbit leads you right to Internet wonderland. From wherever it is in the house, the bunny can recite weather and news headlines out loud, announce the time and light up in different colors when your e-mail has arrived. The rabbit’s many functions can be set remotely by logging into a Web page and selecting the actions. Why a rabbit? “Our objective was to make an object that was independent from the PC,” said Rafi Haladjian, a founder of Violet, which is based in Paris and makes the Nabaztags. The first version arrived in the United States last spring, and a newer Nabaztag/tag (“rabbit/bit”) will be out soon. The upgraded one comes with a microphone in its belly button for voice commands and the ability to stream Internet radio and podcasts. It also has an embedded reader that can recognize objects tagged with a radio frequency identification sticker. Violet plans to release two more “smart objects” next year, neither of which will be animal-shaped. For now, the Wi-Fi rabbit can be found at nabaztag.com; it sells for about $180 or less. While the computerized house has not quite reached the fantasy level of “The Jetsons,” some of the products this year can add a modern touch to your humble home on a room-by-room basis.

627-> My Neighbor, My Buyer
SANFORD I. WEILL, the former chairman of Citigroup, and his wife, Joan, sold a co-op penthouse last month at 14 East 90th Street to Elizabeth A. Sackler, the arts patron known for her contributions to the Brooklyn Museum. The apartment, which has a large terrace, had an asking price of $10.5 million. Mr. Weill, 73, stepped down as the chairman of Citigroup in April. He ranked No. 562 this year on the Forbes magazine list of the world’s richest people, with a net worth estimated at $1.4 billion. His Citigroup pension is reported to be valued at more than $1 million a year. He continues to be paid as a consultant for the bank and receives a car and driver and free travel on company jets. Property records show that Mr. Weill also owns a house in Greenwich, Conn. Ms. Sackler, who already lives in the 13-story building but on a lower floor, is a trustee of the Brooklyn Museum. She has given money to the museum to create the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art, where Judy Chicago’s “Dinner Party” will be displayed. A foundation created by Ms. Sackler donated the work to the museum in 2002. The center will open next year. Ms. Sackler is also known as an advocate for returning ritual items to American Indian tribes. In 1992, she bought three ritual masks at a Sotheby’s auction and returned them to the Hopi and Navajo tribes. The same year she established the American Indian Ritual Object Repatriation Foundation. A representative for Mr. Weill said he was traveling and was not available for comment. Mr. Weill’s broker, Kyle W. Blackmon, a vice president of Brown Harris Stevens, said he was not permitted to discuss the transaction. Three calls to Ms. Sackler were not returned. THE actress Emily Mortimer and her husband, the actor Alessandro Nivola, paid $2.45 million last month for a 25-foot-wide four-story town house on Dean Street in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. The house is half a block from a town house that the actor Heath Ledger bought for $3.6 million last September. Jim M. Kerby, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said the home was listed for $150,000 less than the couple paid for it. He received offers from about a dozen interested buyers, he said, and that drove up the price. “I think we hit the right season,” Mr. Kerby said, describing the reaction to the house when it came on the market in March. “I guess it was just home-buying time. There was an incredible frenzy. It’s a 25-foot-wide house, one of those things that attract everybody who wants a big house. They want a wide one.” He said the previous owners put on an unusual semi-circular addition at the back of the house, on the second floor, containing the kitchen and a breakfast area. Other than the addition, which he compared to something from a spaceship, Mr. Kerby described the home as “a classic old Greek Revival house.” He said that at an open house in March, the proximity to Mr. Ledger’s new home, which has a three-car garage, was a frequent topic of conversation. “I think everybody asked about the Heath Ledger house,” he said. “They wanted to make sure the value was there. I pretty much let them discover that for themselves.” Ms. Mortimer, daughter of the British playwright and author John Mortimer, has appeared in numerous films, including the recent Woody Allen movie “Match Point” and in the remake of “The Pink Panther.” She and her husband met while filming “Love’s Labour’s Lost,” which was released in 2000. They were married in 2003. Mr. Nivola has also acted in “Laurel Canyon,” “The Clearing” and several other movies. A lawyer for the couple, Howard M. Brickner, said they planned to move to Brooklyn from the West Coast. AHMASS L. FAKAHANY, a vice chairman and the chief administrative officer of Merrill Lynch, paid $4.92 million last month for a 1,800-square-foot penthouse at 230 West 56th Street, a condo building known as the Park Imperial. The apartment was owned by Moya Doherty, the producer of “Riverdance,’’ the Irish music and dance extravaganza, and her husband, John McColgan, the show’s director. They bought it in 2004 for $675,000 less than they sold it for. Mr. Fakahany and his wife, Alsun Keogh, had previously owned a co-op at the Police Building at 240 Centre Street, which they sold last month. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing listed Mr. Fakahany’s total compensation for 2005, including bonuses, as $21 million. Mr. Fakahany did not respond to a request for comment. IF Gov. George E. Pataki signs a bill that would make co-op apartment sales prices public for the first time, the boards of many co-op buildings will probably take steps to protect the identity of buyers from prying eyes, according to lawyers and real estate professionals. Arthur I. Weinstein, a lawyer and the vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said co-op boards might allow buyers to buy apartments in the name of a corporation or a trust as a way of keeping their names out of public records. That would be a change for many co-ops that still require apartments to be bought by individuals, not by corporations or other entities. For many years that was a legal requirement, Mr. Weinstein said, but a change in tax law in 1986 allowed corporations or trusts to own co-op shares. Slowly, boards began to adapt, and today there are many that allow such purchases when it benefits the buyer because of tax or estate planning reasons. But a key element of co-op ownership is being able to control who your neighbors are. So when a trust buys an apartment, Mr. Weinstein said, the board will most likely insist on side agreements that specify who is allowed to live there. It might also require the real buyer to sign a guarantee that maintenance and other charges will be paid. Mr. Weinstein said the proposed law would probably make those kinds of purchases more common. “There may be greater pressure to do so, certainly for celebrities who want to maintain privacy or any individual who wants to maintain privacy,” he said. “But in those cases the co-op will have to enter into occupancy agreements to make sure the co-op knows who the occupant will be.” The bill, which was proposed at the request of city officials, was passed by the State Legislature last month and will be sent to the governor for his signature later this year. Mary Ann Rothman, the executive director of the co-op and condo council, said that she thought the change was unnecessary and an incursion into privacy. But she added that council leaders had decided not to oppose it, largely because they considered its passage inevitable, since it had the city’s backing. The change is intended to make the process of determining appraisal figures and property taxes more transparent. By including co-op sales figures in an online database, it will also make more information available to buyers and sellers. Gregory J. Heym, the chief economist for Terra Holdings, which owns Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property, said that buyers and sellers would still need brokers to give them a full picture of the market. A sales price on its own means little, he said, without information about the size or condition of the apartment. And that is still something that most people will have to get from a broker.

628-> Reaching Inside Herself and Across Genre Lines
Stable definitions hold little interest for Cassandra Wilson. She is a jazz singer who rarely dips into the standard repertory, and she works with a rhythmic pull that could only loosely be described as swing. She is a magnetic yet introverted performer who has a habit of disappearing into the swirl of the music onstage. She exudes strength and vulnerability, often at the same time. Her latest Blue Note album, “Thunderbird,” sounds like a crossover attempt, but makes some obstinate demands. Ms. Wilson looked radiant at Town Hall on Wednesday night. But she referred to recent hardship: she has spent the last year taking care of her mother in Jackson, Miss., she said, and “bearing witness” to the area’s gradual recovery since Hurricane Katrina. That early disclosure helped explain the weighty feeling of Ms. Wilson’s performance, which was richest when she was digging into the blues. Notably, this wasn’t country blues, the kind Ms. Wilson has favored throughout her career. It was electric and rhythmically straightforward, with a sound recalling the Chicago bands of the 1960’s. Ms. Wilson brought sultry languor to “I Want to Be Loved,” a Willie Dixon song that Muddy Waters memorably recorded; each time the title phrase appeared in the chorus, the band stopped, and Ms. Wilson drawled it out, making a two-bar break feel like an excursion. “Easy Rider,” an even more venerable blues standard, was the highlight of the show. It began with a long introduction by the guitarist Norris Jones and settled into a sparse arrangement that left Ms. Wilson’s dark contralto largely exposed. A few minutes in, the band kick-started a whiplash backbeat, and Ms. Wilson had to stretch to keep above the fray. The rest of the concert was uneven because of the material as well as the execution; “Thunderbird,” a T Bone Burnett production, has a gleam that would be difficult to recreate onstage. Ms. Wilson’s six-piece band made the album’s originals sound funkier, but that didn’t make them better. And there were unaccountably long instrumental solos, by the keyboardist Federico Gonzalez Peña and the drummer Gene Lake, that had little to do with the songs they preceded. Ms. Wilson revisited just a few songs beyond “Thunderbird,” including Robert Johnson’s “Come On in My Kitchen,” from her first Blue Note album, and “You Move Me,” her contribution to the soundtrack for the film “Love Jones.” Her take on Cyndi Lauper’s “Time After Time” was a crowd-pleaser, though Ms. Wilson assiduously avoided the melody and slowed the tempo to a crawl. Almost every song featured a harmonica solo by Grégoire Maret, who often struck a welcome note of felicity. But it wouldn’t have hurt to throw in another ringer, like the sharp young trumpeter Christian Scott, who opened the concert with his own electric band. Mr. Scott was neither introduced onstage nor billed on the poster at the Town Hall entrance, but he handily won over Ms. Wilson’s audience. This made a kind of sense: the two artists may hail from different generations, but they seem to be reaching for much the same thing.

629-> Hewlett Unveils Servers Meant to Cut Costs
SAN FRANCISCO, June 14 — Hewlett-Packard announced a new line of servers on Wednesday that it said would play a major role in its vision of the next generation of data centers that operate with less energy and almost no people. The company said its new BladeSystems c-class servers could reduce the cost of building and running a data center by almost half in some cases. The new line will join one of the fastest-growing categories in the computer industry: blade servers, which contain multiple circuit boards, often with many processors, in a single chassis. About $1.2 billion in blade servers were sold last year, a figure expected to double this year. The concentration of circuitry means the blade servers occupy less space, but use more power and generate more heat. To solve that problem, Hewlett said the new servers use a special system of fans inside the boxes. The fans cut air-conditioning airflow by 30 percent and energy consumption by 50 percent compared with traditional fans, the company said. Software that runs the servers would also be able to adjust the performance of the fan and the server to reduce the heat on any blade that is overheating, rather than cooling the entire room to solve the problem, the company said. Reducing power consumption is one selling point. Ann M. Livermore, the executive vice president overseeing Hewlett's technology solutions group, said the new servers would save a company up to 41 percent on the equipment itself, 96 percent on setting it up and 60 percent on running the data center. The company said it would announce prices of the servers in July. The servers also play an important strategic role for Hewlett. Mark V. Hurd, the company's chief executive, wants to find a new source of growth in data centers that use these servers and a collection of proprietary software that automates most functions. Hewlett executives predict that its hardware and software will be able to reduce personnel by a factor of 10. To demonstrate its direction, as well as to reduce its own information technology costs, the company has said that it is consolidating its 85 data centers worldwide into six, located in three cities in the United States, with a goal of saving $1 billion in the next three years. "It's a showcase for the technology and to give customers a proof point of what is possible," said Randall D. Mott, Hewlett's chief information officer, who used to run information technology operations at Dell and Wal-Mart. The new servers are central to Hewlett's growth plans because their low installation and operation cost are intended to allow technology managers to use their budgets to buy yet more equipment. Ms. Livermore said the competition for this new market would come mainly from I.B.M. The leader in blade sales, I.B.M. announced a line of servers in February called the BladeCenter H, which it said moved data quickly, with less energy use. I.B.M. has positioned those servers to compete against mainframe computers, while Hewlett is aiming its c-class servers at a lower-price segment of data center computers called rack-mounted servers, said Brent A. Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. Prices of blade servers have risen during the last two to three years, which Mr. Bracelin said suggests that companies that buy them do so to lower maintenance costs, not acquisition costs. He said he expected Hewlett to keep its server prices low to grab a larger share of the data center market.

630-> That After-Dinner Speech Remains a Favorite Dish
The after-dinner speech that refuses to go away has scored another distinction: top of the charts. An audio version of the roast of President Bush by Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central rose to the rank of No. 1 album at Apple's iTunes store on Saturday, three weeks to the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner. Also in the Top 10 were new releases by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam and Paul Simon. The audio version of Mr. Colbert's speech was delivered to iTunes through Audible.com, a company that provides audio content for downloading, including books, radio shows and shorter performances, and costs $1.95 to download. Neither C-Span nor Audible was able to say how many downloads there had been. Mr. Colbert was traveling and could not be reached. By many accounts, Mr. Colbert's performance landed with a thud among his influential audience of journalists and politicians, who were more overtly enthusiastic about a comedy routine involving Mr. Bush and a professional George W. Bush impersonator. But the broadcast of the speech is enjoying a lucrative afterlife online, an unusual development for its owner, the nonprofit cable network C-Span. Earlier this month, C-Span ordered more than 40 versions of the speech removed from the popular video sharing sites youtube.com and ifilm. C-Span said it ordered the clips removed to assert its copyright on recordings of the performance, and shortly thereafter allowed Google Video to stream it free. In the two weeks since, it has been at or near the top of Google's most popular videos. Over the weekend, it was still No. 4 there. C-Span says it owns anything it films with its own cameras — that is, everything that appears on its three channels except for what is said on the floor of the House and Senate, where government cameras are used. The network was invited to cover the correspondents dinner, said Rob Kennedy, executive vice president of C-Span, with the understanding that there would be no restrictions on what it could film. Now that another iteration of the performance, the Audible recording at $1.95 a download, is spreading among the public, C-Span, which was founded in 1979 and gets 95 percent of its financing from the cable industry, says it is uncomfortable with the impression it is a commercially minded content provider. Under its agreement with Audible, Mr. Kennedy said, C-Span receives a nominal monthly fee and Audible can choose what material to make available at its site and via iTunes. The network says copies of a DVD of the event, priced at $24.95, have sold only in the "very low thousands." Providing DVD's "is something we have been doing all along," Mr. Kennedy said. "It is just a small piece for us, and I would not characterize it as a financial windfall." The attention has had a value, Mr. Kennedy conceded. "We're a network that tries to provide a public service, and we enjoy it when people find our network." Audible says much of its other material has reached the top of the iTunes charts, including an audio version of the short story that was the basis of "Brokeback Mountain." Likewise, free C-Span downloads, including testimony before the 9/11 Commission, have been immensely popular; but the Colbert routine is the first material from C-Span to reach the pay-to-download charts. Donald R. Katz, the chief executive of Audible, said it was not such a surprise, because Mr. Colbert's speech was in essence "a comedy routine," and in this case, "you had to not be there to get it — the people in the room were not willing to join in the merriment." Mr. Colbert's speech has also become a cause célèbre among many commentators, writing online and off, who charged that the mainstream press ignored his performance because it was so mocking of the president and of the Washington media. Last week, the public editor of The New York Times, Byron Calame, writing on his Web journal about the paper's lack of initial reporting on Mr. Colbert's speech, printed a statement from Richard Stevenson, a deputy bureau chief for The Times in Washington. Mr. Calame said he agreed with Mr. Stevenson that there should have been "a separate story that anticipated the reaction the routine generated and explained its political significance, rather than waiting to capture it after the fact."

I've enjoyed the Funny Pages and "Building Stories," by Chris Ware, in particular. I was constantly surprised and delighted at the way in which a simple change of a facial line or the addition of a shadow in the progression can convey changes in mood. Even though all the action takes place in a single setting, the various perspectives and angles in the panels have ensured that each is a tiny, intriguing work of art that can stand on its own. Thank you for running it. I was sorry to see the series end, but I look forward to future contributions from Chris Ware. Mary Kennedy Ridgewood, N.Y.

633-> Berkeley, Calif.: Takara Sake USA
At Takara Sake USA’s elegant tasting room and sake museum in Berkeley, Calif., the manager, Mika Tsuchiiwa, serves up drams of the company’s rice-based beverages in delicate ceramic cups every day. Takara’s parent company, one of the largest sake producers in Japan, established its American branch in Berkeley in 1982 with the acquisition of Numano Shuzo, another sake company. An extensive renovation followed in 1997, in which the sake museum was created. It features exhibits on sake-making in 19th-century Japan and the history of the process in America, and displays old-fashioned tools, including giant shovels. The gleaming, open-roofed display was built from reclaimed Douglas fir, and the room’s granite floor tiles contain glass recycled from sake, beer and whiskey bottles. Takara currently has 13 sakes on its list, all sold under the Sho Chiku Bai label. They are organized into five categories: classic (served warm); ginjo (premium sake that is fruity, smooth and served cold); nama (unpasteurized, served cold); nigori (unfiltered sake that is still cloudy with rice particles, served cold); and tokubetsu junmai (a special sake made from 100 percent rice, without added alcohol to aid in fermentation; it can be served warm or cold). All of the sakes are in fact junmai, or naturally fermented, and are made using water from the Sierra Nevada, which is low in iron and makes for what Ms. Tsuchiiwa calls an ideal, softer-textured sake. In addition, Takara also manufactures Koshu plum sake (sake blended with plum essence and sugar), mirin (a sweet sake used for cooking), shochu (a distilled spirit made from rice, grain, or barley) and two brands of plum wine, Kinsen and Takara. Plum wine actually has no sake in it, and consists of Napa chardonnay blended with plum essence and sugar. From the tasting room, one can see sake being bottled in the adjoining warehouse space, about 5 million liters (about 1.3 million gallons) a year. Visitors can buy sake products from the tasting room (but not shochu, since the establishment doesn’t have a liquor license). During the tasting, Ms. Tsuchiiwa and her staff give a brief tutorial on sake-making, questioning guests playfully about the displays and the 10-minute video that is shown periodically in the room. Usually, patrons sample sakes from each of the five categories, but it “depends on their tolerance,” said Ms. Tsuchiiwa. “We don’t like them to get drunk.” Takara Sake USA, 708 Addison Street, (510) 540-8250, ext. 8; free tastings and museum entry; www.takarasake.com. Bottles of sake range from $1.95 (for 180 milliliters) to $100 (for a two-liter specialty antique bottle imported from Japan).

636-> Attracting Bodies to Rooms Geared to the Soul
IT used to be enough to just get away from it all. But these days, you're not getting the most out of your travel experience unless you're pursuing a higher state of well-being, as "wellness" has become the new buzzword in the hospitality industry. From resorts and spas to cruise lines and hotel chains, companies are betting that their customers are looking to eat healthier, keep up with their exercise routine, sleep more soundly and even address some nagging health issues while on vacation. Last month, the luxury cruise line Silversea announced a new wellness program aboard its ships, including a morning yoga class and a seminar on nutrition. Meanwhile, Costa Cruises plans to debut a ship in July — the Concordia — which claims to have the largest "wellness center" ever built on a ship, the 20,450-square-foot Samsara Spa. So what exactly is "wellness"? If you trace the wellness movement back to its roots, it's all about nurturing one's mind, body and spirit. "Wellness is an attitude of responsibility for one's health and well-being," said Deborah Coryell, health and wellness director for King Ventures, which owns several mineral springs resorts, including Two Bunch Palms in Desert Hot Springs, Calif. Ms. Coryell helped develop one of the first wellness programs, at Canyon Ranch in Tucson, Ariz., and said the five elements she and her colleagues identified in the early 1980's were still relevant today: exercise, nutrition, stress management, environmental attunement and self-realization — all areas a growing number of hotels, spas and resorts are concentrating on in some way. As for the spread of the wellness movement, Ms. Coryell said: "There's a part of me that sort of cringes. On the other hand, I like to go to a hotel where there are healthy snacks in the mini-bar." That said, she emphasized that the travel industry can't provide a fast track to well-being. "It's still about the individual's responsibility to learn what they need to learn to change their behavior," she said. But there are places you can go or stay that aim to nudge stressed-out travelers along the path to a healthier, more balanced way of life. When Chris Johnson, general manager of Marriott's Fairfield Inn and Suites in Chicago, first contemplated creating a hotel room dedicated to wellness, he was inspired by a guest preparing for surgery at a nearby hospital. But the rooms he unveiled in September — "wellness suites" — have proven popular with perfectly healthy travelers seeking to unwind on the road, in an atmosphere Mr. Johnson describes as cultivating "the balance of mind, body and soul." That means sleeping on organic cotton bedding (washed with biodegradable detergent, free of scents and chemicals); breathing air free of pollen, odors, mold, mildew and dust mites (thanks to an air purification system); bathing in filtered water (with biodegradable, all-natural shampoo, soap and conditioner); and perhaps taking advantage of an in-room yoga kit and instructional videos. The rooms also feature a selection of hypoallergenic pillows (including aromatherapy "dream sachets") and a minibar stocked with healthy drinks and snacks. Rates for the wellness suites start at $209 a night, $30 more than the rack rate — though that $30 is donated to the American Heart Association. And competition is keen: the hotel (312-787-3777; www.fairfieldsuiteschicago.com) has only two of these suites, and occupancy has been running at about 95 percent, Mr. Johnson said. Kimpton (800-546-7866; www.kimptonhotels.com) operates 41 boutique hotels in the United States and Canada, each with a unique personality but with the common goal of helping guests maintain and enrich their lifestyles on the road. Kimpton's Topaz Hotel in Washington is sort of the poster child for that emphasis on well-being, billing itself as "a tranquil oasis of positive energy" where every aspect of the hotel's design "was conceived to please body and soul." Toward that end, the Topaz Hotel offers specialty suites that enable guests to keep up with their exercise routines without traipsing down to a gym. Guests can reserve a room with an exercise bike, treadmill, stair climber or elliptical trainer, or choose one with yoga props, a dimmed lighting system and instructional tapes. These rooms cost about $20 more than other rooms in the hotel, with weekend rates starting at $179 a night. "It's not so much that we're charging extra for the gear, but we charge extra for the bigger room," said Steve Pinetti, Kimpton's vice president for sales and marketing. Kimpton also has a 24-hour yoga TV channel in all its hotels, and an on-demand channel offering televised yoga, Pilates and meditation classes is being installed. The company is also putting more spa services into guests' rooms, offering manicures, pedicures, massages and facials as room service-type options. So you can run three miles, take a shower, get a massage and then order dinner — all without leaving your room. Miraval has always offered a heavy dose of mindfulness with its massages and mud wraps (its motto is "Life in Balance," and one of its signature services, the Equine Experience, uses horses to explore behavioral patterns). But the resort (800-232-3969; www.miravalresort.com), outside Tucson, Ariz., plans to expand on that emphasis with a Wellness Center scheduled to open in the fall of 2007. Harley Mayersohn, Miraval's vice president for branding and marketing, said that the center would offer integrative health treatments like acupuncture, advice on nutrition and fitness, therapy for sleep disorders or consultation with an herbalist. Miraval recently appointed Dr. Andrew Weil as its Director of Integrative Health and Healing. Dr. Weil will help develop the center's programming, and May 11 to 14, will lead a "healthy aging" workshop at Miraval. The program starts at $2,800 a person, double occupancy, including all meals. Mr. Mayersohn attributes the industry's increasing focus on wellness to a growing acceptance of alternative medicine and to baby boomers concerned about aging. "They want to live until they're 90, but they want to live with great energy and health," he said. Within a national park on St. John in the United States Virgin Islands, Caneel Bay (340-776-6111; www.caneelbay.com) is already an escape. But the resort's Self Center aims to enhance the experience of getting away from it all, providing services to help guests "nurture their desires for mental, physical and spiritual well-being." Or as the center's founder and director, Jan Kinder, put it, "When you go on vacation, it takes days to unwind, and then it's time to go home. The Self Center really speeds up relaxation and getting present where you are." Besides offering group classes in resort staples like yoga, Pilates and meditation, the Self Center offers a more eclectic options. Among them: jing energy flow therapy, which relies on principles of Chinese healing and energy medicine to ease "energy blocks"; vibrational sound therapy, which uses tuning forks along with light and color to "harmonize mind, body and spirit"; and shamanic healing, a ritual that aims to remove barriers to finding and living one's life purpose. Each, 75 minutes, costs $150.

637-> Russians, Busy Making Shrouds, Are Asked to Make Babies
Moscow PRESIDENT VLADIMIR V. PUTIN drew from the Soviet past on Wednesday when he championed the role of motherhood in preventing Russia from becoming a state short of citizens. Russia's population is shrinking, and demographers warn that it is within a generation of plummeting. If the most pessimistic models hold, the decline could make the country a vast, underpopulated state within four or five decades, a country with too few healthy people for a competitive work force or a capable army. Russian life, for the peasantry and the proletariat alike, has always been unforgiving. And in a speech reminiscent of Soviet pledges of the state helping the masses so that the masses might help the state, Mr. Putin chose the familiar Soviet solution of encouraging stalwart reproduction, telling his obedient Parliament to enact programs of financial incentives to women to have more children. The Kremlin-friendly news media here, a place that often feels like the land of the family with a single child, crowed in approval. The president had spoken: Here is the money, he had essentially said; Russian mothers, fulfill your role. Beneath the enthusiasm was a question Mr. Putin did not address. Will cash incentives work? The data would say: Not quite. There is little doubt that for Russia to be a power through the 21st century its demographic trends must be reversed. There also seems to be no question that Russian mothers, short of feats of fertility unseen in the industrialized world, cannot save Russia alone. "You have to do this in a variety of ways," said Dr. Murray Feshbach, a demographer who studies the Russian population and its health. The problems can be found in the numbers. Russia has roughly 143 million people, and the population drops an average of 700,000 each year, largely because of the wide gap between the number of those born and the number who die. More babies will help. But as the population shrinks, Dr. Feshbach said, it risks an accelerating collapse that fertility itself cannot reverse. This is in part because the low birthrate is more than two decades old, and the number of women ages 20 to 29, the most fecund segment of the population, has already fallen to 12 million, he said. In the next several years, women that age will fall to eight million or fewer — a small contingent to bear the next generation. And as analysts at the World Bank and the United Nations have pointed out, the threat to the population is not just low birthrates but high death rates. The Russian people are deeply unhealthy, so much so that there is no demographic group in the industrial world as ailing and prone to fatal injury as the Russian male, whose average age at death is about 59. Abysmal mortality trends separate Russia from other industrial nations that offer incentives to stimulate population growth, including Japan and Australia. Moreover, pernicious infections have entered the population since Soviet times, making the country a growing reservoir of people recently infected with tuberculosis, H.I.V. and hepatitis C. Many of these infections have not yet turned into high rates of disease, but public health authorities say that as the incubation periods run their course over the next several years, their effects on national health will be evident. Tuberculosis is already at epidemic levels, and an expected surge in AIDS cases and hepatitis complications could, by the most dire models, kill more than half a million people a year in a generation or two. There are signs that Russia is waking to the problems. Last month, the Kremlin pushed through a roughly twentyfold increase in its paltry financing for AIDS prevention, diagnosis and treatment — a sign of an understanding of the severity of the problem, said Dmitry Rechnov, a deputy director of AIDS Foundation East West, a private organization here. "If we keep on this track, there can be a number of positive developments," he said. Still, the Kremlin's attention to public health has been uneven, and expected increases in mortality related to infectious disease would push up a death rate already driven above norms in industrial nations by high rates of heart disease, cancer, alcoholism, accidents, violence and suicide. The potential consequences are clear. In a report released last year, the World Bank warned that if Russia did not adopt comprehensive public health programs, it risked a shrinking work force, destabilized families, strains on national security and a drain on the gross domestic product. And not everyone agrees that cash incentives, which are not part of a comprehensive health program, will even achieve what the Kremlin hopes — more healthy and productive children. If Mr. Putin's proposals pass, as they almost certainly will, then next year mothers will receive bonuses worth about $9,000 for giving birth, as well as a graduating scale of monthly cash allowances for infants and subsidies for day care. Many women said in interviews that they welcomed the plans. With low salaries, tiny, crowded apartments and rising costs of living, they at last saw a president offering relief, however small. Let the baby boom begin, one said. "Many women will start having children," said Katya Druzhchenko, 19, a student who hopes to have three. "Right now if you think about the economic situation for young women, it is just totally impossible." But Dr. Ivan Safranchuk, a middle-class father of two and director of the Moscow office of the World Security Institute, an international think tank, said money-for-motherhood incentives would not work. Russian parents, he said, opt for few children not just because of financial worries but because infrastructure — parks, schools, hospitals, entertainment centers, transportation — is strained. He pointed to surging rates of car ownership to make a point. "The message of the president, that people cannot afford kids, is not true," he said. "Look at the rate of new cars in the country, especially of imported cars. All of these people can afford to give birth to kids, but they do not." This is also because attitudes have become unwelcome to child-rearing, he said. "When you go to a restaurant or a social setting, the whole social infrastructure is unfriendly to your kids." Dr. Safranchuk suggested that Russia ought not offer cash incentives, but tax breaks. There are no child deductions on personal income taxes, except a small one for education costs. Rather than create a well-raised new generation, he said, the subsidies could encourage the poorest and least-educated women to have children, while having little influence on the family decisions in the middle class. Mr. Putin, he said, "has created a system which converts oil and gas into money; now he is creating a system that converts money into nothing, or that converts money into problems." Mr. Putin did not go as far as past Kremlin leaders, like Stalin, who encouraged women to repopulate a nation thinned by repression and war by offering Medals of Maternal Glory to mothers who brought forth seven, eight or nine children. The medals bore the words Mother-Heroine. Even were Mr. Putin to do so, the numbers suggest, without shifts in attitudes and widespread improvements, the traffic at maternity wards will remain slower than the Russians' rush to the grave.

639-> World Business Briefing | Europe: Ireland: Ryanair Raises Stake in Aer Lingus
The discount airline Ryanair Holdings has raised its stake in a rival, the Aer Lingus Group, to 25.2 percent in a renewed push to take over the airline, one of Ryanair's financial advisers confirmed. The adviser, Davy, said that it bought nearly 31.8 million Aer Lingus shares for about 87.4 million euros ($115.2 million) on behalf of Ryanair, raising the carrier's stake from 19.2 percent to 25.2 percent, or nearly 133.4 million shares. The chief executive of Aer Lingus, Dermot Mannion, conceded that Ryanair's interest "isn't going away any time soon," but reiterated the company's determination to remain independent. The higher stake does not markedly improve the chances that Ryanair's bid will be successful; investors opposed to a buyout control more than 46 percent of Aer Lingus shares.

It's official: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, France's blunt-talking interior minister, is running for president, on pledges to recharge the country by breaking with coveted job protections and better integrating disillusioned minorities. But the conservative Mr. Sarkozy's widely expected presidential campaign started with a fizzle. The left-leaning newspaper Libération leaked on its Web site an interview he had given to regional newspapers in which he announced his candidacy and which was to be published today. Polls show Mr. Sarkozy, the leader of the right-wing UMP party, neck and neck with his Socialist rival, Ségolène Royal. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, once seen as a potential rival to Mr. Sarkozy, called the announcement "a serious personal act." An aide to Ms. Royal, Gilles Savary, called it "a spectacular nonevent." The UMP is expected to nominate Mr. Sarkozy on Jan. 14.

Iceland's central bank, Sedlabanki, unexpectedly raised its benchmark interest rate a quarter-point to a record 14.25 percent after a widening current-account deficit threatened to weaken the krona and push up inflation. It was the 18th increase since May 2004, the bank said on its Web site. Higher borrowing costs may bring recession to an economy that was one of Europe's fastest-growing last year, expanding 7.5 percent. Investment in aluminum smelters, which fueled growth, has drawn in imports, pushing the current-account deficit to 27 percent of gross domestic product in the third quarter.

The scandal centered on damaging, but false, allegations that Mr. Sarkozy had secret bank accounts. The judges said they were questioning Mr. de Villepin, a protégé of President Jacques Chirac, as a witness rather than a suspect. Suspicions that he was involved in the scheme, combined with his shelving of proposed labor reforms that led to violent protests last spring, appear to have dashed his hopes of running for president, while Mr. Sarkozy, widely seen as a victim, emerged strengthened.

652-> A Dot-Com Survivor’s Long Road
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 29 — When Jim Clark started Shutterfly, the online photo printing service, in December 1999, a 2-megapixel digital camera could set you back $800, investor enthusiasm for e-commerce was soaring and the words “Internet” and “bust” were rarely used in the same sentence. For his part, Mr. Clark had something of a Midas reputation when it came to technology investing, having started Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon. But what was expected to be a sprint at the peak of the dot-com boom turned into a marathon — one in which Shutterfly, at times, appeared to be faltering. Late last month, the company finally crossed a finish line of sorts when it became one of just a few e-commerce companies to go public since the dot-com bust. While the offering may have enriched Mr. Clark and other early Shutterfly backers, it has been a money-loser so far for most who bought into it. And it has not brightened the decidedly downbeat mood of venture investors, whose fortunes depend on a healthy market for public offerings. Shutterfly’s shares had a brief run-up after their market debut on Sept. 29, but since then they have dropped to $13.35, or 11 percent below the offering price of $15. “It’s been an extremely difficult I.P.O. market this entire year,” said Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, noting that only 37 venture-backed companies had gone public through the end of the third quarter. “Then you see something like Shutterfly, which a lot of people were excited about, but has not performed as well as we were expecting.” Mr. Heesen cautioned that “one I.P.O. does not make a trend,” and he noted that eHealth and other companies that have gone public recently had done well. But he said there were no indications of a pickup in the overall market for initial offerings. Citing restrictions imposed by securities regulators, Shutterfly declined to comment or make Mr. Clark, who is chairman, available for an interview. The company is scheduled to report earnings on Nov. 7. While seven years is not an unusual amount of time for a venture-backed firm to go from start to public offering, the pace was often much quicker back in 1999. Coming in at the tail end of the boom, Shutterfly had no choice but to take its time — and weather some difficult periods. “It’s been a long process,” said George Zachary, one of the original investors in Shutterfly. Attracting customers “was slower and consumed more money than we would have liked,” he added. Mr. Zachary, formerly a partner at Mohr Davidow Ventures, the second-largest investor in Shutterfly after Mr. Clark, is now a partner at Charles River Ventures and no longer sits on Shutterfly’s board. Shutterfly has been profitable for three years, but it is facing a digital photography market that is much different from when it started. Mr. Clark promised at the start that Shutterfly would usher in a revolution in digital imaging, and seven years later, there is no question that digital technology has revolutionized the world of photography. But Shutterfly appears to be more a product of the revolution than its standard-bearer. Shutterfly’s two main competitors in online photo printing, Ofoto and Snapfish, have been acquired by Kodak and Hewlett-Packard, respectively. (The Ofoto service was renamed Kodak EasyShare Gallery.) These deep-pocketed patrons have challenged Shutterfly on price, hurting its profit margins. Meanwhile, a large new crop of Internet companies is capitalizing on the explosion of digital images taken not just with cameras but also with cellphones. Most of these companies, which include Photobucket, ImageShack, Slide and Flickr, which was acquired by Yahoo last year, emphasize online sharing over printing. Tapping a younger generation of consumers for whom photography has become a form of online self-expression, often as part of blogs or social networking sites like MySpace, they have, in some cases, dwarfed Shutterfly’s audience. “The competitive landscape is very crowded,” said Sam Snyder, a research analyst at Renaissance Capital, an independent research firm that runs a mutual fund focusing on initial offerings. Shutterfly “has huge competitors breathing down its neck, undercutting it on price,” he said. Early last year, the standard price of a 4-by-6 print was around 29 cents. Today, they cost 19 cents at Shutterfly, 15 cents at Kodak and 12 cents at Snapfish, though volume discounts are available. Shutterfly was founded by Dan Baum and Eva Manolis, who had been engineering managers at Silicon Graphics. After receiving financing from Mr. Clark and Mr. Zachary, another Silicon Graphics alumnus, the fledgling company moved into a modest office suite above a Jenny Craig Weight Loss Center in Menlo Park, Calif. The humble surroundings apparently did not impress representatives from major photo-printing equipment firms like Fuji and Konica, whom the company was courting. “They didn’t know whether to take us seriously or not,” said Mr. Baum, who is now an executive at Adobe. Still, Shutterfly managed to obtain the hardware it needed, and by the time it was ready to open its virtual doors it had moved to new headquarters in Redwood City, Calif., where it is still based. Coincidentally, the company was started the same day as Ofoto, which counted James Barksdale, the former chief executive of Netscape and therefore a business partner of Mr. Clark, among its investors. “Ofoto and Shutterfly were like two identical petri dishes,” said James Joaquin, the former chief executive of Ofoto. He said that the shorthand for the rivalry between the two companies was “Clark vs. Bark.” There were many similarities between the two — not just the features on their Web sites but also their enthusiastic embrace of the Internet boom’s get-big-fast mantra. That meant giving stuff away. Ofoto promised 100 free prints to its first million customers, a promotion valued at tens of millions of dollars. For its part, Shutterfly was giving away 85 percent of its prints by mid-2000. The collapse of the Nasdaq, and the demise of e-commerce pioneers like eToys, Kozmo, Webvan and others, changed all that. “When we got into the postbubble, things really tightened,” Mr. Baum said. “It was tough. Fortunately, we had a real business.” Still, by early 2001, the company was forced to cut a quarter of its work force, and kept having to go back to investors, including Mr. Clark, for more money. The extra rounds of financing continued even after the company turned its first annual profit in 2003. By the time it was ready to go public, Shutterfly had received nearly $90 million in financing, and Mr. Clark owned 40.3 percent of the company, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Clark’s share has dropped to 30.4 percent since the public offering. His stake is valued at about $96 million. Mr. Clark has moved to South Florida, where he has started a real estate development company with Tom Jermoluk, another Shutterfly investor and the former chief executive of the failed broadband company Excite@Home. Forbes recently estimated Mr. Clark’s wealth at $1.1 billion. Shutterfly, which is now led by Jeffrey T. Housenbold, its fourth chief executive, has said it plans to use some of the proceeds from its $87 million offering to expand its printing and production operations. As 4-by-6 prints have increasingly become a low-margin commodity, the company has focused on selling more lucrative products, like customized calendars, greeting cards, photo books, mugs and mouse pads. The company now calls itself an “Internet-based social expression and personal publishing service.” “Shutterfly’s specialty is a very robust catalog of photo gifts and merchandise,” said Alan Bullock, an analyst at InfoTrends, a market research firm. Recent partnerships that Shutterfly announced with Scholastic Media and HIT Entertainment emphasize the merchandise business, Mr. Bullock said. The deals allow customers to place their own pictures — or more likely those of their toddlers — in books alongside well-known characters like Thomas the Tank Engine or Clifford the Big Red Dog. The books start at $35. Shutterfly said it has sold about 370 million prints since its inception and has stored a billion photos in its online archives. Its sales grew to $83.9 million in 2005, up from $54.5 million the year before, while net income reached $28.9 million. Without a tax benefit of $24.1 million, profit for 2005 would have been $4.8 million. Shutterfly, whose sales peak in the fourth quarter, reported losses of $3.7 million in the first six months of this year. Shutterfly’s growth rate shows that customers like its products. The bigger challenge for the company may be whether it can stay profitable by staking out a position as the premium brand in a cutthroat market. “It’s a tough story to sell,” Mr. Synder said.

653-> CURRENTS: EMERGENCY GEAR; The Big Box of Preparedness
A billboard on I-95 in Connecticut asks, "Does your family have an emergency plan?" Er, no. Leslie Fastenberg, a self-described soccer mom from Old Westbury, N.Y., steps into the breach with a mammoth (and stylish) emergency kit called the ICE-Qube. The 85-pound box is stocked with enough necessities, she said, for a family of four to survive for four days: $850 plus shipping at (516) 650-7690 or ice-qube.com. Over 100 items are within, like toothbrushes, a crank radio, Jif peanut butter and condoms. I wondered about those last two items. "What, do you want the peanut butter from Whole Foods instead?" she said, adding that condoms were a "high-value, small-mass product." PENELOPE GREEN CURRENTS: EMERGENCY GEAR

655-> Chávez Praises Belarus
MINSK, Belarus, July 23 (Reuters) — President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela on Sunday praised Belarus, which is accused in the West of crushing fundamental rights, as a model state and called for joint efforts to counter “hegemonic” capitalism. Mr. Chávez, a self-described leftist revolutionary who commands vast oil revenues, stopped in Belarus on a world tour that is partly aimed at winning support for his effort to gain a place for Venezuela on the United Nations Security Council. “Belarus is a model of a social state, which we are also building,” Mr. Chávez told reporters at the Minsk airport at the start of a two-day visit. “We must defend the interests of the individual and not the hegemonic interests of the capitalists, wherever they may be, in Europe or Latin America.”

Three of the five girls wounded in a massacre at an Amish schoolhouse last month in Nickel Mines are back in school part time, and more than $3.2 million has been donated to help the survivors, a community group said. Two of the girls need extensive reconstructive surgery, the Nickel Mines Accountability Committee said. One of the two girls who suffered severe head wounds remained in the hospital but should be released soon; the other is home but semicomatose and is likely to have lifelong disabilities. The fifth girl is attending classes full time.

658-> Democracy, Plutocracy (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Politician, Police Thyself,” by Josh Chafetz (Op-Ed, Dec. 2): Americans like to imagine that our country is democratic, but being pragmatic people, we are really a tense mixture of democracy and plutocracy. And until recently, it worked, to our national advantage. Otherwise, we would have never allowed K Street to accrue the enormous sway over Congress that it presently enjoys. But hasn’t the time arrived to reconsider? The citizenry would be far better off today if Congress were to wean itself completely, once and for all, from every form of corporate financial inducement.

659-> Washington Post Reporters to Join Politics Web Site
The Washington Post, which has long prided itself on the depth and breadth of its coverage of national politics, lost two of its top political reporters yesterday to a fledgling multiplatform news organization, albeit one with deep pockets. John Harris, The Post’s political editor, and Jim VandeHei, a national political reporter, said yesterday that they were leaving The Post to join Allbritton Communications to create an Internet-focused news organization, as yet unnamed, that will include a politics-only Web site. It will be affiliated with the company’s new newspaper in Washington, The Capitol Leader, which is to start print publication in January. The departures were in the works before The Post, which like many other newspapers is experiencing a drop in circulation and advertising revenue, announced last week that it was making sweeping changes in its newsroom staff. Mr. Harris, 43, will be editor in chief and Mr. VandeHei, 35, will be executive managing editor of the paper and of the overall venture, said Frederick J. Ryan Jr., president of Allbritton, which also owns local television and cable stations. The two journalists are also forming a partnership with CBS News and plan to make regular appearances on morning and evening news programs and on “Face the Nation” on Sunday. Mr. Ryan said the company would soon be hiring a handful of other well-known journalists. The departures disrupt plans at The Post to expand its political coverage and capitalize on an intense interest in politics with the Democratic takeover on Capitol Hill and the 2008 presidential campaign. “We had hoped that John Harris and Jim VandeHei would help lead this effort on the Web,” Leonard Downie Jr., The Post’s executive editor, and Philip Bennett, the managing editor, wrote in a memorandum yesterday to the staff. They said they planned to “reconfigure” the role of the paper’s political editor and would be seeking new political reporters for the national staff and for the Web site. The Post lost another member of its team last week when David von Drehle, a longtime Post writer and editor who was to become the lead political writer for the Style section, announced he was leaving to become a national correspondent for Time magazine. It is too soon to say whether the departures of Mr. Harris and Mr. VandeHei are early evidence of a migration by veteran print journalists away from ink-on-paper reporting. “No one should interpret this as people are taking flight from the old media,” Mr. Harris said. “This is a time, obviously, of change and unquestionable anxiety for the news business as a whole, but neither of us felt anxiety about our roles or pessimism about the robust future of The Post.” Mr. VandeHei, who said he got 95 percent of his news online, said he was not sure if the departures signaled a coming trend, but said: “From the number of big-name journalists I heard from today, I can say there’s a huge appetite for what we’re doing.” Mr. Ryan said the future was in a multiplatform approach to news, “without the baggage of a long-term print institution.” He said the idea originated in discussions with Mr. VandeHei, whom The Capitol Leader had approached about joining the newspaper. As it happened, Mr. VandeHei and Mr. Harris had been talking with each other about what it would be like to start a multiplatform news organization with top journalists from scratch. “This is not a statement about The Post,” Mr. VandeHei said. “It’s about having a rare opportunity to be given what it takes to build your dream news organization.”

660-> Paper Maker to Sell Unit
The International Paper Company said yesterday that it had agreed to sell its coated paper unit to a private equity firm, Apollo Management, for $1.4 billion. The division employs 3,000 workers at four paper mills in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota and generated $1.6 billion in sales last year, International Paper said. The transaction is the third major sale by International Paper since July, raising $9.1 billion. International Paper has sold forestlands in New Zealand and the United States and plans to sell chemicals and wood-products units, bringing the total proceeds to $11 billion. Since the end of the second quarter of 2005, International Paper has trimmed total debt by $2 billion, to $11.5 billion, through asset sales and the repatriation of overseas earnings, said Dennis Ruggles, an analyst at Fitch Ratings in Chicago.

661-> A Band’s Move From Funk to Pop Takes In Hip-Hop Too
Green Gartside, Scritti Politti’s songwriter, makes an unlikely hip-hop fan, much less a rapper. He’s a 50-year-old Welshman with an elfin voice, a gift for melody and a shy, thoughtful demeanor. A sticker on his guitar read “Philosophy” when he performed at the Bowery Ballroom on Friday night as part of the band’s first American tour. Yet Scritti Politti’s new album, “White Bread Black Beer” (Nonesuch/Rough Trade), starts with “The Boom Boom Bap,” a ballad that describes the boom-bap hip-hop beat as “the beat of my life.” And in the middle of the set Scritti Politti played a funk vamp while Mr. Gartside rapped Jeru the Damaja’s “Come Clean,” touting a “freaky freaky freaky freaky flow.” Mr. Gartside’s idea of pop mingles the intellectually convoluted and the sweetly catchy. Scritti Politti got started in 1978, an era of art-punk bands. But Mr. Gartside had a panic attack during an early concert, stopped performing in 1980 and retreated to the studio for decades, returning to the stage only this year. In his seclusion Scritti Politti’s music changed from dissonant post-punk to gleaming, keyboard-centered, danceable pop, aiming not for some arty in-group but for the Top 10. Scritti Politti had a 1985 hit, “Perfect Way,” that sounded closer to Michael Jackson and Madonna than to Gang of Four. (The band didn’t play that song at the Bowery, though it did perform another major hit, “Wood Beez.”) Hip-hop — with its novel sounds and its complexly rhymed, free-associative lyrics — now feeds into Mr. Gartside’s music along with the yearning, harmonically convoluted ballads of Brian Wilson, the ebullience and structural experiments of the Beatles, the slick rhythm tracks of dance music and R&B, touches of reggae and speculations about meaning and identity, including pop’s racial subtexts. They all add up to songs that are simultaneously commentaries on pop and pure pop pleasures. Introducing a song called “Robin Hood,” Mr. Gartside said he usually described it as being about “the end of utopian socialism, but it really has more to do with the end of utopian socialist theories.” And so, in a way, it does: “One day we’ll share the treasures of the world, oh yeah, and I will get the girl,” he sang. Like many of his new songs, the music was bouncy 1960s-flavored pop, though at the end Mr. Gartside quoted a Beastie Boys song title: “Hold It Now, Hit It.” As both songwriter and performer, Mr. Gartside is acutely self-conscious, attentive to every detail and implication; one pause, he said, was “evidence of my almost painful sincerity.” Yet onstage, as in an overwhelming majority of its recordings, Scritti Politti never came across as purely cerebral. The tangled ambitions were endearing, and both the melodies and the ideas were supple. Mr. Gartside thinks seriously, but his songs have all the heart they need.

662-> A ‘Sweet Bird’ Diva Who Evokes Williams
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., July 20 — Omigosh, that’s What’s-Her-Name, isn’t it? You know, the Hollywood star who had the big breakdown and then the big comeback? The one who’s supposed to be such a piece of work — a minion-flattening, substance-abusing, man-eating diva? C’mon, you know. Well, let’s see, I can think of about 30 names off the top of my head that fit that description, as could any self-respecting reader of junk biographies and The Star. Part of the pleasure — the guilty part — of Margaret Colin’s fine performance in the affectionate revival of Tennessee Williams’s “Sweet Bird of Youth” at the Williamstown Theater Festival is how many of those famous names she manages to evoke in her portrayal of the show’s stormy heroine. That’s Alexandra del Lago, a k a the Princess Kosmonopolis, the rapidly aging film goddess who spends much of her time looking for misplaced items (hashish stash, oxygen mask) and memories in a Gulf Coast hotel room and who remains the principal reason to revisit this lush mess of a play from 1959. As Ms. Colin presents her, this frightened Hollywood princess most often brings to mind the brittle, late-career Judy Garland, but you also catch tantalizing glimmers of Ava Gardner, Elizabeth Taylor and the middle-aged Natalie Wood (the only one Ms. Colin actually resembles physically). Not that Ms. Colin is a female version of a female impersonator. On the contrary, her Alexandra displays little of the purple hysteria associated with the part, memorably created on stage and screen by Geraldine Page (and played in a television version by Ms. Taylor, who was born to do it but didn’t quite). Instead of the traditional overblown neurotic, Ms. Colin delivers an Alexandra who is scared, yes, but also hard and smart and brutally self-aware. Her giant ego is her shield as well as her nemesis, and she reminds you that it takes toughness as well as tremulous sensitivity to be a successful artist. Make no mistake, this Alexandra believes she is a genuine artist. By the way, did I mention that she also has a lot in common with a certain famous playwright? “I’ve probably made every speech she made,” Tennessee Williams said of Alexandra, “and I meant them twice as much.” Watching David Jones’s production, which runs through Sunday at the Main Stage Theater, you begin to think this is a play that could have been written by Alexandra — self-dramatizing, disorganized, paranoid, and both cold-eyed and compassionate in a single glance. Suddenly it seems clear that Alexandra’s warm yet fatalistic attitude toward her doomed boy toy, Chance Wayne (an affectingly skinless Derek Cecil), is much like that of Williams toward all the lost souls of his plays. This is the kind of revivifying insight you don’t expect to find in summer theater, where rehearsal periods are short and budgets limited. (Even plain old entertainment value, never mind insight, was in limited supply in the festival’s first offering this season, a skeletal production of “Anything Goes” staged by Roger Rees, the company’s artistic director.) Nearly all the principal cast members, starting with Ms. Colin and Mr. Cecil but extending to parts traditionally rendered as villainous gargoyles, turn in performances that speak of thoughtful consideration of their characters. (Beth Fowler and Betsy Aidem, for example, find authentic life playing bookends of the madonna-whore spectrum of Southern womanhood.) Mr. Jones’s staging, too, has an air of gentle sincerity and care that lets you know he takes this play seriously. Derek McLane’s airy set, with its sense of ocean vistas, David Weiner’s mercurial lighting and John Gromada’s ethereal music, dominated by a lonely flute, do their best to convince that “Sweet Bird” is as much of one lyrical piece as are “The Glass Menagerie” and “A Streetcar Named Desire.” It’s not. The first act, in which Alexandra and Chance share their self-assessments with each other and the audience, is still a spellbinder. But all the dreamy atmospheric tricks at a director’s command can’t conceal the harsh truth that the play’s second act (and a lot of its third) is second-drawer Williams, stirred into an overheated potboiler. That’s the part where Chance, a 29-year-old gigolo trying to recapture the glory of his promising youth, seeks out the girl he left behind in his hometown, St. Cloud, Miss. Her name is (oh, dear) Heavenly Finley (Bess Wohl), and she is the daughter of Boss Finley (the excellent Gerry Bamman), a politician and staunch segregationist who wields power like a set of brass knuckles. Despite the actors’ wit and conviction, there’s no disguising that Boss and his henchmen, including his Neanderthal son (Christopher Evan Welch), are especially crude embodiments of a Darwinian society that eats dreamers for breakfast. Williams had already created more fully fleshed models of Boss (Big Daddy in “Cat on a Hot Tin Roof”) and the victimized Heavenly (Catherine in “Suddenly Last Summer”); they are not so much reincarnated here as lazily recycled. And in always going for poetry over melodrama, Mr. Jones cheats us of the play’s cruder natural pleasures, ending scenes with trailing ellipses that should by rights conclude with exclamation points. Golden-haired and willowy, Mr. Cecil, principally known for television work, brings out the imperiled fragility in Chance. He’s a far cry from the studly, guarded version by the young Paul Newman, who originated the part opposite Page. But though it is hard to credit Mr. Cecil as a former small-town prom-king type, he touchingly illuminates Chance’s kinship to beautiful, self-deluding losers like Blanche DuBois. And he makes it all the clearer why Ms. Colin’s Alexandra is a survivor in ways Chance is not. A great and shamefully underused natural resource of the New York theater, Ms. Colin explored the imprisoning nature of celebrity in the title role of “Jackie: An American Life,” Gip Hoppe’s short-lived Broadway play from 1997 about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Here she takes the exploration deeper with a remarkable absence of sensationalism and sentimentality. Her Alexandra has the reflexive imperiousness of a woman who has learned to out-exploit an exploitative world. She hates what time and circumstance have done to her, but she deals with it. What’s the choice? Ms. Colin needs to scale up the fear and panic that are always waiting for Alexandra in the shadows. Like the rest of this production, she is perhaps too careful in avoiding easy dramatic effects. But it would be hard for any actress to top the layers of self-contempt, self-satisfaction and self-knowledge that are always legible here. “Aren’t you ashamed?” Chance asks, after his patroness clinches a baldly financial deal for sexual favors from him. “Of course I am,” purrs Alexandra. “Aren’t you?” Standing on a bed in a slip, arms akimbo, body swaying in unsteadiness and insinuating confidence, Ms. Colin summons an entire life of triumph, defeat and acceptance in those two simple sentences.

A Stanhope man was missing after his canoe capsized in the Passaic River early yesterday, the police said. The man, Joseph Rivera, 27, was one of four people who set out in the canoe around 3:30 a.m., the police said. The group turned for shore when the river proved too rough, but the canoe capsized before they could reach land, said Sgt. Edward Drwiega. Three men swam ashore, but Mr. Rivera had not been found by 9 a.m. yesterday, when the search was called off because of rough water, he said.

665-> A Small Slip in the Defense, And Two Women Blaze a Trail
The Sixth World Youth Pairs Championship took place from June 30 to July 2 in Piestany, Slovakia. The diagramed deal was the final one of the event. Going into this board Cecilia Rimstedt and Sara Sivelind from Sweden were just ahead of Jacek Kalita and Krzysztof Kotorowicz from Poland, with Marion Michielsen and Vincent de Pagter from the Netherlands third. The Dutch pair defended against three spades doubled by North. East led his singleton heart. If declarer had won with dummy’s ace, he could have escaped for down two, minus 500, but he unwisely tried the heart finesse. Now the defenders took two spades, one heart, two diamonds and two heart ruffs for plus 800 and 126 match points out of 140 to secure their third-place finish. Sivelind opened the West hand with two clubs, which was natural, showing 11-16 high-card points with at least five clubs. East raised to three clubs, inviting game, and West jumped to five clubs. At first glance, with the two rounded-suit aces to lose, it seems as though declarer must pick up the diamond queen, but Sivelind made the contract without needing to resort to the diamond finesse. South, after winning the first trick with his heart ace, shifted to a deceptive diamond seven. West rose with her ace and played a trump to the eight on the board, South ducking smoothly. If declarer had played another trump, South would have gone in with his ace and played a third round, leaving West to pick up the diamond suit. But Sivelind took dummy’s two top spades, discarding diamonds from her hand, and crossruffed two spades and two hearts before playing a second trump to South’s ace. West’s last three cards were the heart king, diamond king and club king. She won South’s heart return, drew his last trump and claimed. Plus 600 was worth a tad over average. Kalita opened the West hand with one club, which usually means that he has a balanced hand with 12-14 points, but he could have a much stronger hand. East’s one-spade response guaranteed at least seven points. North’s raise to three hearts was highly debatable. And West’s third-round double was for penalties. West led his diamond ace, then shifted to the club king. Declarer won with his ace, ruffed a club on the board and played a diamond to his queen and West’s king. Kalita switched to a low trump. South overtook dummy’s seven with his eight, ruffed his last diamond on the board and perforce played a spade. East went in with his king and West threw a club to give this end position:  NORTH J 10 8 7 6 4 — — —  WEST — K 10 5 J Q 10 EAST A 9 5 — 10 J 9  SOUTH Q A Q 9 6 — 7  On the spade ace West discarded his club ten. East now led the diamond ten, but declarer ruffed low and played a club to West’s queen, which forced West to lead away from his K-10-5 of hearts. South lost only one trump trick, going down two. Plus 500 gave the Poles 71 match points. But let’s go back to the diagramed position above. Suppose West discards not the club ten, but the club queen. Then East can cash his club jack and lead a spade or a club. West would overruff South and exit with his diamond jack, guaranteeing a second heart trick. (The same defense is possible if West discards the diamond jack instead of the club queen.) That would have resulted in down three. It is also true that East should have known that South had started with three clubs. If West had had six clubs, he would have bid three clubs on the second round. So, before cashing the spade ace, East should have taken his club jack. Then West could not have erred. Plus 800 for the Poles would have been worth 125 match points. Would those 54 match points have made a difference? Yes. By 36 match points, 17-year-old Cecilia Rimstedt and 24-year-old Sara Sivelind had become the first women’s pair to win an open world title.

666-> When Science Sniffs Around the Kitchen
LAST week I went to Stanford University to hear a lecture on the molecular biology of smell, and then drove home buzzing with thoughts about what it might mean for people who love to eat. The speaker, the Nobel laureate Linda Buck, never mentioned food. She gave an overview of the fast-developing understanding of smell, including the pioneering work for which she shared the Nobel in Physiology or Medicine in 2004. Along the way she explained how, given what is known about the way smells are represented in the brain, the combination of two aromatic substances could create a third smell sensation that would be unlike the smell of either of the partners. And she presented evidence that certain aromatic chemicals  amines, which are found in the bodies of all animals and also in a variety of foods  trigger a brain circuit of their own. They act as pheromones in other animals, and may do the same in humans. I came away filled with new ideas about the alchemy of cooking. Can one flavor plus one flavor equal three flavors? How much of the effect of combining ingredients happens on the stove, and how much in people’s heads? Are there examples of this kind of virtual ingredient creation in familiar dishes? Can a rational awareness of flavor chemistry and amine circuitry influence and heighten our actual sensory experience of food? If we know more about how we smell, can we smell more? Does more sensation mean more pleasure? It was 30 years ago in a university library that I first stumbled across the scientific approach to food in the pages of Cereal Chemistry, The Journal of Food Science and similar publications. As I browsed through a couple of issues I couldn’t help grinning at the incongruity of high scientific language and high-tech instrumentation being applied to utterly ordinary, everyday things. It was strangely exhilarating to see such intellectual firepower aimed at the kneading of bread dough or the grilling of a hamburger or the mitigation of the gassy effects of beans, to be confronted with startling scanning-electron-microscope close-ups of the bacteria in yogurt, the mold in blue cheese, the surface of cooked spaghetti. At first it all reminded me of Lemuel Gulliver visiting Laputa and Balnibarbi, of severely cockeyed scholars eating geometric foods and trying to extract sunbeams from cucumbers. But the Swiftian thought quickly faded: this was funny, yet fascinating and substantial at the same time, something I just had to run out and share with my friends. Not long afterward I had my first book contract and a new career. Now, after three decades and two books about the science of cooking, that initially strange literature is familiar territory to me  familiar and still full of surprises. My heart leaps when I collect my mail and spot the blue-sky cover of The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. The superb library collections in food and wine at the University of California, Davis, are less than two hours from my home, and I always feel an edgy anticipation when I exit Interstate 80 to immerse myself for a day or two in The Journal of Texture Studies, Aquaculture Research, Flavour and Fragrance Journal, Annals of Microbiology, Chemical Senses and American Journal of Enology and Viticulture. I never know what I’m going to learn, or by what remarkable means it will have been figured out. I haven’t collected the data, but I’m confident that never before in history have so many people in so many corners of the world used so many powerful instruments to peer into food  and into people as they consume food. Samples from my last immersion: physicists at the University of Nottingham, England, probe the surface of caramel with an atomic-force microscope to understand the molecular nature of its stickiness. A laser-scanning microscope at the French National Institute for Agronomic Research reveals bacteria in ripening Emmenthal cheese lining tiny pockets of milk fat, just where they can generate the most flavor. At the University of Bristol in England, gene-chip analysis  the marriage of DNA chemistry and silicon electronics  shows that the same variety of wheat expresses its genes very differently depending on whether it’s grown in conventional or organic conditions. Then there’s magnetic resonance imaging, the modern workhorse for looking within living things: in Japan, M.R.I. studies show how dry beans absorb water; in Denmark and Norway, how water moves into and out of pork when it’s brined and cooked; and in Rome and London, what parts of the brain sommeliers use as they taste and identify wines. This occasional column, the Curious Cook, will be a window on that big and busy world, on the endless intricacies of foods and the ingenuity of the people who make them and study them. The column is meant to share the buzz, to pass along news of interesting scientific research on food, cooking and eating. Because some of the larger issues are well covered elsewhere  nutrition, the influence of diet on long-term health, food production and the environment, genetically modified organisms  I’ll pay more attention to studies of particular foods, the kinds of subjects that originally drew me away from teaching literature and into the mysteries of emulsions and glutens and Maillard reactions. To start off: news that an old kitchen worry has now been explained in full and converted from a worry into an opportunity. I hear every year from cooks who have been alarmed at seeing normally pale garlic turn bright green and even blue, sometimes when the cloves are pickled whole, sometimes when they’re chopped and cooked with other ingredients. I’d often been puzzled by little blue-green specks when I made garlic bread with loaves of sourdough, but I was really rattled the first time I puréed raw garlic, onion and ginger together in a blender to make chicken in yogurt from Madhur Jaffrey’s “Invitation to Indian Cooking.” When I fried the purée the entire mass turned turquoise blue. I asked a couple of Indian friends who happen to be plant biologists whether they knew what was going on. They said they had never seen the blue purée, because Indian cooks don’t grind onions and garlic together. They grind or chop them separately and usually fry the onions first. For them, blue was the color of an American shortcut. For me it’s been a reliable curiosity every time I cook Ms. Jaffrey’s happily efficient recipes for chicken and cauliflower and okra, one that goes away as the purée browns and I add turmeric and the rest of the ingredients. As I learned from one of my regular food-chemistry reads, it’s not necessary to see these color changes as problems. The northern Chinese think of them as attractive and auspicious. They make an intentionally intensely green pickle by aging fresh garlic heads for several months, then peeling the cloves and immersing them in vinegar for a week. The resulting Laba garlic pickle is served with dumplings to celebrate the New Year. According to chemists at the China Agricultural University in Beijing, aging the garlic gives it a chance to accumulate large quantities of one of the chemicals that generate the color; fresh garlic doesn’t green much at all. And a strong green color develops in Laba garlic only with acetic acid, the main acid in vinegar (also found in sourdough), because it’s especially effective at breaching internal membranes and mixing the cell chemicals that react together to create the green pigment. The pigment itself turns out to be a close chemical relative of chlorophyll, which gives all green leaves their color. Two recent reports from the House Foods Corporation in Japan detail exactly how the garlic and garlic-onion pigments develop. Their creators are the same handful of sulfur compounds and enzymes that give the allium family its unique pungent flavors. Under the right conditions these chemicals react with each other and with common amino acids to make pyrroles, clusters of carbon-nitrogen rings. These rings can be linked together into multipyrrole molecules. The ring structures absorb particular wavelengths of light, and thus appear colored. The two-pyrrole molecule looks red, the three-pyrrole molecule looks blue and the four-pyrrole molecule looks green, as does its cousin tetrapyrrole, the chlorophyll molecule. Like chlorophyll, all the pyrrole pigments are perfectly safe to eat. A mixture of onion and garlic favors a blue hue. All the pigments result from a combination of enzyme activity and simple chemical reactions, so you get the most intense color by puréeing the garlic and onion to mix enzymes thoroughly with their targets, then holding the purée on low heat to speed the enzymes without denaturing them, and finally heating it to a simmer to speed the nonenzymatic reactions. The tint can be muted through higher heat and faster cooking times, a procedure favored by Ms. Jaffrey, who is as unnerved as anyone when the onions in her pan turn turquoise. “I can’t bear that greenish color,” she said. “So I quickly sauté the paste to give it a more acceptable pinkish-brown hue.” So scientists have solved the mystery of the blue alliums. Which leaves curious cooks with a new challenge: how to use that knowledge to create a dish that celebrates the blue rather than toning it down. A homage to Krishna?

668-> Roll Over, Holmes, Tell Watson the News: Clairvoyance at the British Crime Scene
Psychics take the joy out of murder mysteries. When soothsayers, mediums and clairvoyants descend on an elementary-my-dear-Watson traditionalist and smugly produce the killers off the top of their heads, the fun stops. That’s because psychics don’t deduce anything. They don’t assemble clues. They’re not keenly observant. They don’t display the kind of wits a viewer might hope to match. All they do is talk to ghosts who, with minor coaxing, give it all up. I’m not saying it’s not creepy and stressful to talk to the dead, but if you happen to have the “Ghost Whisperer” or “Medium” knack, it can’t be rocket science. You don’t need the mind of Marple or Holmes to listen to a shivery apparition tell you it was Peacock with the dagger, or Plum with the pipe. On “Afterlife,” an imported series that begins tonight on BBC America, the British try their hand at the all-the-rage drama of the sixth sense. The series is pleasingly presented, with grace notes to spare. The opening scene of tonight’s first episode, a macabre but also achingly sweet family Christmas, is vividly conceptualized and executed. Throughout the series, the outdoor scenes, especially, have a precision and freshness that suggest painstaking preparation and a single take. The frightened attention that Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), the psychic, brings to the near-hallucinatory world around her is doubled in the movements of the camera, which, like Alison, cannot tear its eyes away from a world teeming with zombies. The conceit of “Afterlife” is that Alison acquired her psychic powers, or refined them, in a mysterious childhood accident. Since then she has been hoping to stifle her magic and lead a normal life. A period of hospitalization evidently didn’t help. As the series opens, she has moved to the half-gloom of Bristol, where she’s hoping to flee her past. In short order, it catches up. For canned-soup money, she’s doing some kind of small-scale John Edward-style performance one night when she encounters her costar, a psychologist named Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln). Robert is like a hero out of an Ian McEwan novel: an academic, a rationalist, a skeptic  but one plagued with doubts about his doubts. He’s impatient with the idea of psychic powers, but he needs a psychic’s help with some not-so-subtle personal problems. On this night, though, he has brought his university students to Alison’s show to prove to them that psychics are nothing but phonies, preying on the gullibility of those in pain. But soon Alison has discovered something scary about one of Robert’s students, and everyone has to take the batty lady a bit more seriously. (Ms. Sharp is terrific as the clear-eyed madwoman.) The British take the eternal reason-faith debate extremely seriously  from the looks of the nonfiction best-seller list, it seems Americans do too  and the centerpiece of “Afterlife” seems to be the imperative that Robert cave in and admit that Alison is onto something with her seeing-dead-people project. But like a mystery solved by a psychic, that feels too easy. “Afterlife” is beautiful to look at. But unless it gets more complicated, it’s not going anywhere.

669-> Visitors to America (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “U.S. Is Dropping Effort to Track if Visitors Leave” (front page, Dec. 15): Tracking visitors who leave the United States is prohibitively expensive, logistically challenging and doesn’t accomplish the desired goal. Instead, we should track visitors who break the law by staying in the United States after their visas expire. That is less expensive, easier and identifies those who violate the contracts under which they entered our country. As guests, visitors rarely have the same rights as citizens. Visitors to my home don’t get the same rights and freedoms as those who live there. Why should my country do any less? Denise Nitterhouse Chicago, Dec. 17, 2006

670-> Pittsburgh Pirates
How should we think about the very rich? The easy answer, of course, is to mime their uncritical celebration by television and Madison Avenue — even though great wealth has provoked sharp doubts and even bitter anger since the nation’s founding. In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson subtly anticipated our complex feelings by substituting “the pursuit of happiness” at the end of Locke’s familiar statement that all men had an inalienable right to “life, liberty and property.” Benjamin Franklin then offered practical application of his co-signer’s implicit ideals by telling in his autobiography how, after business success, he’d found a far richer life cultivating science, philosophy and public service. Getting and spending, these founders seemed to say, should be thought of as instruments, not ends, lest we (their heirs) recreate Old Europe’s ancient inequalities, and thereby undermine our fragile new democracy. A century later, a second American revolution, ignited by industrialization, gave us a new generation of leaders — we might even call them the second founders. But as they swept away Jefferson’s hopes for an enduring rural, agrarian and small-town America, their new world of cities, factories and vast inequalities indeed revealed all the dangers our original founders had feared. Presiding over that Gilded Age (or robber-baron era, if you prefer), those second founders — the Rockefellers, Fricks, Morgans, Goulds, Carnegies and Mellons — between the Civil War and 1900 transformed America into the world’s largest and fastest-growing economy. Exercising far more unchecked power than today’s billionaires, these gargantuan figures grew rich beyond imagining, but also nearly overturned democracy, as poverty and corruption spread like a plague across the land. David Nasaw’s “Andrew Carnegie” and David Cannadine’s “Mellon” recreate those tumultuous times through the often related stories of two of the best-known second founders. Yet reading these two hefty biographies (between them almost 1,700 pages), one quickly sees that their subjects’ contrasting characters, behaviors and worldviews — and the reactions they produced — give us much to reflect on, including our own era of globalization and postindustrial titans. At first glance, Carnegie and Mellon look a good deal alike. Both were of Scots descent (Carnegie freshly arrived, Mellon a first-generation Scotch-Irish American). Both acquired fortunes in the violent, exploitative and dankly polluted world of coal-and-steel Pittsburgh, the Silicon Valley of its day, through ingrained Calvinist self-discipline and persistence — calling them “inspired” at what they did is not too strong — but also, despite their pious denials, through ruthlessness and deceit. Eventually both also won fame and influence as more than industrial titans, Carnegie as America’s best-known philanthropist and Mellon as one of the nation’s longest-serving secretaries of the Treasury and as founding donor of the National Gallery of Art in Washington. But there the similarities end, and a revealing set of juxtapositions emerges. Carnegie was always far better known, not just because his authentic rags-to-riches life fit the Horatio Alger archetype (unlike Mellon, who’d been born to wealth) but, more important, because he — also unlike Mellon — early on mastered the new “science” of public relations, cultivating the press as assiduously as Donald Trump has done today. The popularity of his autobiography and of essays like “The Gospel of Wealth” in fact made him an unusual Gilded Age star — Bono-cum-Warren-Buffett is the best analogy — because even as he helped drive the forces upending the old Jeffersonian world, Carnegie was declaring (seditiously, quite a few fellow plutocrats thought) that all the new wealth was “not chiefly the product of the individual ... but largely the joint product of the community,” and that therefore, while ambitious men might naturally pursue great fortunes, those riches should be returned in one’s lifetime to do public good. To the era’s compassionate conservatives, his famous claim that “the man who dies thus rich dies disgraced” deftly attached the first founders’ values to the new super-rich, an updated affirmation of both Calvinist “election” and democracy’s community duties (though to middle-class reformers and working-class radicals, such talk was scandalous pettifoggery, a bromide that substituted charity for equality). Who was this unusual man? Carnegie had migrated to Pittsburgh in the 1840’s as a young boy who grew into a diminutive dynamo — he was just over five feet tall — of charm, diligence, intelligence and stamina. As Nasaw — a historian at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York — fluidly and colorfully tells the story, Carnegie swiftly rose from teenage messenger to district manager of the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad, promoted by bosses who valued his whirlwind drive and mastery of railroads’ complex accounting and scheduling systems. He soon discovered how smart young railroad men made real money. Following his bosses, he borrowed heavily to invest in the stock of railroad contractors who’d secretly taken the railroad managers as silent partners, thereby assuring a steady flow of well-padded contracts. By his mid-30’s, Carnegie had followed this early “crony capitalism” to his first fortune, at which point he decamped for Manhattan and further fortune, first by selling the bonds of the same railroads and suppliers, then by managing his growing investments in them. Yet over the next 30 years, he was hardly a conventional capitalist: working only a few hours each day, he spent most of his time as a budding author, world traveler (he usually spent half the year abroad), patron of the arts and bon vivant who chastely charmed (as best one can tell, since he lived with his mother) attractive women half his age, as well as an ever-growing list of presidents, prime ministers, scientists, professors and poets on both sides of the Atlantic. Riding the winds of industrialization, his fortune soared. Shifting shrewdly from iron to steel, then from rails to structural steel, he constantly reinvested in modernization — as well as in clandestine price-fixing and market-pooling deals, hefty rewards for pliant Republican legislators and party bosses (he hated Democrats), and when needed, ruthless suppression of organized labor. (His avowed support for both “socialism” and Herbert Spencer led one wit to call him a “Socialist Darwinist.”) When his partner Henry Clay Frick violently put down the Homestead strike in 1892, the damage to Carnegie’s cherished reputation was enormous — but he was privately soothed by the profits he and Frick made thereafter. Expanding to produce steel-plate armor for the American and Russian navies, by 1900 Carnegie was manufacturing half the nation’s structural steel and soon after, thanks to J. P. Morgan’s purchase of his empire, he arguably became the world’s richest man. Still boundlessly energetic at 65, Carnegie threw himself into a new role as the world’s pre-eminent philanthropist. Many thought he resembled Santa Claus — he was now plump and wore a snow-white halo of hair and beard — as he bestowed free public libraries by the hundreds here and abroad; offered free tuition to students and pensions to professors; built scientific research centers, art galleries, music halls and museums; endowed a fund to honor everyday heroes; and — as World War I grew closer — earnestly financed all manner of projects devoted to world peace. The war’s carnage shattered not just the Gilded Age’s residual faith in benign private wealth but the confidence of its most visible exponent: Carnegie died, cut off from friends and influence, less than a year after the war ended. Andrew Mellon, who presided over a much more diverse business empire — an iron-and-steel fortune, Gulf Oil, Alcoa, Koppers, Carborundum, the Mellon National Bank, and extensive insurance, real estate and shipbuilding investments — by comparison comes across today as a paler, more pinched, much less likable or even interesting figure. Unlike Carnegie, Mellon was unusually reserved, even dour. (For years, he walked daily to his office past scores of employees without speaking a word.) He was also, for most of his life, parsimonious. On his death bed, when his son Paul asked for two small Corot paintings, he replied by offering to sell them for $50,000. He was, needless to say, not the ideal father. Nor, apparently, was he the ideal husband. Like Carnegie, he waited until his 40’s before marrying a woman half his age. Carnegie’s was by all accounts a happy union, but Mellon’s wife soon felt so neglected that she commenced a scandalous affair, then abruptly left him. Her husband’s passions, according to his biographer’s account, were far more animated by the bitter divorce proceedings than they ever had been by the marriage. Cannadine, a historian at the University of London who wrote this book at the request of Mellon’s son, consequently faces greater difficulty than Nasaw in holding our interest, a problem he occasionally compounds. As Mellon builds his art collection, for example, we’re never taken past the prices paid (and some tawdry backroom dealings) to savor the beauty of what he’d bought. But Cannadine does try to raise Mellon in our estimation by emphasizing how, late in life, he chose public service as Treasury secretary — a post he held under Harding, Coolidge and Hoover — and then, shortly before death, gave us the National Gallery of Art, an authentic treasure. One senses Cannadine would like us to feel these acts somehow balance — on an admittedly complicated measure — Mellon’s far less attractive behaviors. Yet do they? Cannadine exaggerates the economic impact of Mellon’s tax-cutting at a time when few earned enough to pay income tax at all, and is too uncritical of his support for the gold standard, tight money and balanced budgets even as the Depression closed in, policies modern economists agree exacerbated the economy’s collapse. And we soon learn that Mellon compromised the integrity of his “public service” at Treasury by continuing to oversee his business empire, covertly intervening with other government officials for his own interests, and even using the department’s tax specialists to prepare — and artfully minimize — his own taxes. (The “brazen lies” Mellon told in defending himself, Cannadine writes, reflect the fact that “he simply never understood or accepted the notion of conflict of interest.”) And Mellon’s art collecting leaves its own troubling questions: ignoring a strict trade embargo on the Soviet Union, Mellon secretly paid millions for old masters that Stalinist agents had taken from the Hermitage on the dictator’s orders, money that indirectly helped finance the starvation of millions of Russian peasants who resisted collectivization. After leaving office when the New Deal arrived, Mellon soon found himself facing both congressional and Internal Revenue Service investigations. Cannadine argues (rather lopsidedly) against the merits of these inquiries, conducted, as he sees it, in a “stridently hostile” soak-the-rich atmosphere fostered by Franklin Roosevelt’s “infuriating raillery” and demagogic desire for revenge against men like Mellon. Under such circumstances, we are meant to see nobility in Mellon’s donation of the National Gallery — but not all will, after noticing that he focused on it only after hostile tax audits began and waited until the jury in his prolonged tax trial adjourned before proposing his gift to the government. Do these long-gone men offer us lessons for today — and for our own titans, the Gateses and the Buffetts (not to mention the Lays, the Ebberses and the Kozlowskis)? Earlier in our own Gilded Age, the financier Ivan Boesky, now disgraced, declared to surprisingly wide acclaim that “greed is healthy.” Is it — or is it merely greed? America’s first founders left us with one set of answers, while the second gave us another. It’s fair to say we haven’t decided yet which is right.

672-> Professor, Just Speak Into the Screen, Please
School's out for summer, but you should still be able to find a use for the Belkin TuneTalk Stereo. This small microphone system lets you record lectures, or the occasional live indie band, using your video iPod. The TuneTalk, which will be available later this month for $70, connects directly to the bottom of any 30- or 60-gigabyte video iPod. Storage space is limited only by the amount of free disk space on the iPod. There is no software to install — just plug in the device and the iPod automatically goes into recording mode. An L.E.D. on the front lights up when recording. Later you can play back the audio, which Belkin says is CD quality, through the iPod's ear buds. The TuneTalk is one of the first iPod peripherals to record in full 16-bit stereo, using its two discrete microphones or a separate mike plugged into its auxiliary jack. Battery usage is negligible when the device is plugged in, and a port at the bottom makes it easy to charge the iPod via a U.S.B. or power cable while recording.

673-> A Long Way Traveled, With Farther Still to Go
The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in “Hermanas” (“Sisters”), a perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio), a restless journalist, has traveled to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother struggling to distance herself from her family’s turbulent past. But as the women seek reconciliation across a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions, the discovery of a novel written by their father raises specters neither can ignore. By means of extensive flashbacks to the sisters’ teenage years during the military dictatorship, “Hermanas” taps into a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. Though constrained by a directing style that insists on coloring within the lines, the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the sisters renegotiate their relationship and in which Elena, struggling with English, endures the painful process of assimilation. A scene in which she embarrasses her young son by swearing during a fumbling conversation with his teacher is both surprisingly touching and stingingly authentic. Moments like this reveal more about the sisters than the political secrets that drive the film, and Ms. Solomonoff allows them to resonate. “Make me look good,” pleads Elena when Natalia takes her radical views — and a thrift-store pick-up — to a party organized in her honor. She doesn’t. But both actresses make their director look very good indeed. Written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) and directed by Julia Solomonoff; director of photography, Ms. Solomonoff; edited by Rosario Suarez; music by Lucio Godoy; produced by Vanessa Ragone, Florencia Enghel and Mariela Besuievsky; released by Cinema Tropical. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Valeria Bertuccelli (Elena Levin), Ingrid Rubio (Natalia Levin), Adrián Navarro (Sebastian Morini), Nicolás Pauls (Martin Garcia Solis), Milton De La Canal (Tomás Morini), Horacio Peña (David Levin), Mónica Galán (Marta Levin) and Eusebio Poncela (Luis Morini).

674-> Atomic Balm?
  orkers at the Alvin W. Vogtle nuclear-power generating station sometimes describe it as being in the middle of nowhere, and in many respects they’re right: situated on a bend in the Savannah River, in the thick pine forests of central Georgia, the plant is an hour south of Augusta and a two-hour drive, if you disobey the speed limit, from the outskirts of Atlanta. On the final approach to Vogtle, a narrow country road cuts through vast stretches of undeveloped land punctuated with small ranch-style homes; in some places, you can still discern remnants of convenience stores and cheap motels set back from the pavement, all now shuttered, some barely standing. When Vogtle (pronounced VOH-gull) was being built in the 1970’s and 80’s, it was more aptly described as the middle of everything, a bustling, improvised city of engineers and tradesmen, some 14,000 workers in all, many of whom lived nearby in tents and trailers. It was one of the largest construction projects in the history of Georgia. An entire concrete factory, now defunct, was built here during that time; so was a factory to manufacture ice, a necessary ingredient in making the superdense nuclear-grade concrete required for the reactor-containment buildings. To Ellie Daniel, a local man who has worked as an administrator at Vogtle for more than two decades, only two significant things have happened in the history of Georgia’s Burke County. “One is the Civil War,” he told me. “The other is Plant Vogtle.” The boom that swept through the region as Vogtle rose from the forest floor — its immense cooling towers are each 548 feet tall — ended somewhat badly, however, at least in a financial sense. The plant took almost 15 years to move from blueprints to being operational. And by the time it began producing electricity in the late 1980’s, its total cost, $8.87 billion, was so far overbudget that Vogtle became yet another notorious example of the evils of nuclear energy. In the public mind, the issue was safety. For the industry, the larger concern was economics. Indeed, as originally designed in the early 1970’s, Vogtle was intended to generate a total of around 4,500 megawatts of electricity, enough power to serve the needs of several million homes. The grand plan was to have four reactors. Instead, it was scaled back to two, Vogtle Unit 1 (finished in 1987) and Vogtle Unit 2 (1989). Today these reactors together produce about 2,400 megawatts, satisfying about 15 percent of the state’s power needs. One day this May, on a brisk morning so clear that I could see its cooling towers from 20 miles away, I visited Vogtle on one leg of a tour to assess what many in the energy industry are calling a nuclear renaissance. Thanks partly to large government incentives and to market forces that have pushed the price of other electric plant fuels (especially natural gas) to historic heights, the prospect of starting a new nuclear reactor in this country for the first time in 30 years has become increasingly likely. By early summer a dozen utilities around the country had informed the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which oversees all civilian nuclear activity in this country, that they were interested in building 18 new facilities, nearly all of which would be sited next to existing nuclear reactors. Vogtle was in this group of 18. In fact, the Southern Company, the large utility that runs Vogtle, also announced that it would formally apply to the N.R.C. next month for an early site permit, the first step in readying the community for a nuclear project that would complement the existing reactors. Whether Vogtle will turn out to be the 1st, 5th or 10th next-generation plant to break new ground is difficult to say; trying to predict which utility will be able to overcome formidable obstacles — public approval, regulatory scrutiny, billions in financing and complex engineering challenges — is akin to predicting the winner of a presidential election years in advance. Still, if things move smoothly (a rarity when it comes to nuclear power in this country), the Southern Company will receive a license to build and operate a new plant in 2010. Construction will take five years. Electricity will begin to flow to the residents of Georgia in 2015. Over the past year, the debate over nuclear power has increasingly been framed as an environmental one, as several commentators — most notably Patrick Moore, a founder of Greenpeace (and now estranged from the organization); the British conservationist James Lovelock; and the Whole Earth Catalog founder Stewart Brand — have stepped forward to assert that global warming requires an embrace of new nuclear plants, because unlike gas- or coal-powered plants, nuclear reactors produce electricity without emitting greenhouse gasses. The nuclear industry, in turn, has capitalized on the chance to adopt a green tinge, or at least greenish one; among its recent slogans is the exhortation to “Go nuclear: because you care about the air.” Most environmental groups have not softened their opposition, however. “This is more a propaganda exercise than a serious discussion of the viability of the industry,” Jim Riccio, the nuclear policy analyst at Greenpeace, told me. By using global warming, he added, “the nuclear industry is trying to find some fear greater than the nuclear fear to be their selling point.” Nonetheless, whether any new nuclear plants are built in the United States depends less on the sentiments of the American public than on the country’s individual utilities. And for conglomerates like the Southern Company, which runs Vogtle as well as two other nuclear plants in Georgia and Alabama, the determining factor is not air quality. It’s money. Over the next 12 to 24 months, as utilities like Southern determine what to do, their fundamental concern is the bottom-line cost. And the feeling among many in the industry is that the financial prospects are almost certainly looking up. One afternoon at Vogtle, Ellie Daniel took me just west of the plant. The reactors here sit amid 3,150 acres of wilderness; the snap of pine in the air and the low hills that roll toward the riverbank lend it the serenity of a fine vacation spot. We drove past the old concrete factory, past the crumbling foundation of the ice works and halted by a clearing at the side of the road. At the edge of the clearing, small pine trees had been planted in neat lines, stretching like vineyard rows up the hill to Vogtle Units 1 and 2. The ground beneath our feet was covered in a carpet of fallen needles. It’s all part of the effort to preserve the area as a pristine environment, Daniel explained to me: “We’re trying to return the area to how it looked before we built here.” Much of this will be swept away, though, if plans progress the way the Southern Company hopes. In the clearing, some engineers at Vogtle had painted a green circle, about 60 feet in diameter, to mark the location and size of the planned reactor building. And in the center of the circle was a pole, also painted green, to mark the hot reactor core. This would be Vogtle Unit 3, Daniel said. Not far off, perhaps a few hundred yards, was another pole and another green circle. If you can imagine it, he added, this would be Vogtle Unit 4.  On the evening before my visit to Vogtle, the prospect of new reactors at the site was the subject of a public meeting, convened by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, at a technical college in Waynesboro, Ga., a small town about 30 minutes from the plant. Anyone intrigued or appalled by the idea of new construction could come to ask questions. These kinds of community gatherings have become a frequent occurrence around the country over the past year as utilities have shown a renewed interest in building reactors. “We’re in what’s called the preapplication space for Plant Vogtle,” David Matthews, the head of new-reactor licensing at the N.R.C., told me as people milled about before the evening meeting. Matthews brought a dozen colleagues with him — engineers and science advisers, mainly — to address any technical points that might arise after he made a few brief remarks explaining the N.R.C. licensing process. But some attendees had come not so much to ask questions as to encourage the Southern Company to build Units 3 and 4. “Can you do it any quicker?” asked one representative from the local chamber of commerce. Meanwhile, a number of antinuclear advocates wanted to quiz the commission officials about the possible hazards of a new plant design and the plant’s radioactive (and highly toxic) spent fuel; some had even set up tables to distribute brochures alongside the agency’s own informational pamphlets. The rancorous debates that defined these sorts of public meetings two decades ago were largely absent: the exchanges followed a protocol that kept tempers in check while lending the meeting a formality that N.R.C. representatives, all dressed in formal business attire, tried to promote. Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were serious business. The received wisdom about the United States nuclear industry is that it began a long and inexorable decline immediately after the near meltdown, in 1979, at Three Mile Island in central Pennsylvania, an accident that — in one of those rare alignments of Hollywood fantasy and real-world events — was preceded by the release of the film “The China Syndrome” two weeks earlier. To be sure, the events at T.M.I., as those in the industry invariably refer to it, as well as the radioactive steam explosion at Chernobyl seven years later, galvanized public opinion against nuclear power as never before. In the case of Long Island’s Shoreham plant, steadfast community opposition eventually stopped a newly finished plant from ever operating. But the fortunes of the nuclear business have been defined by many factors that aren’t so conspicuous. Several years before T.M.I., the growing expense of new nuclear projects, coupled with the realization that many predictions for future electricity demand were overblown, had already hobbled the business. New orders for plants had fallen off drastically by 1978. “The industry was in a depressed state,” says J. Samuel Walker, the historian at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. “And what T.M.I. did was finish things off.” In fact, T.M.I. didn’t kill the industry. It killed the growth of the industry — ensuring, in a way, that nuclear power would not assume more than a fraction of the U.S. electric business. The last year a plant was approved for construction by the N.R.C. was 1978. But interminable construction schedules meant that many facilities approved before T.M.I., like Plant Vogtle in Georgia, were finished long after the accident. Some didn’t even start generating power until a few years ago; the last was the Watts Bar plant in eastern Tennessee, which began operations in 1996. Since then the contribution of nuclear energy to our electrical grid has remained fairly steady. All told, the 103 active nuclear reactors in the United States supply about 20 percent of our electricity. And in some places the contribution is much larger. New York gets 29 percent of its power from nuclear energy, New Jersey 52 percent. Abroad, nuclear energy has its hot spots too — in France, for instance, 78 percent of the electricity comes from nuclear energy. There are currently 337 working reactors in 30 countries outside the United States, and there may soon be many more, as India and China embark upon ambitious plans to build dozens over the next decade to satisfy their thirst for electricity. In the U.S., each of the commercial nuclear plants has been granted a 40-year operating license by the N.R.C. This life span was originally based upon the hypotheses of engineers and physicists in the early 1960’s who weren’t sure how long a large nuclear plant could safely operate, because none had ever been built before. While there have been numerous incidents of mechanical defects over the past few decades, the 40-year projection has by and large proved a conservative estimate, and in the past few years, the N.R.C. has been granting 20-year extensions so that some older plants that pass workplace inspections can run for a total of 60 years. Even with such licensing renewals, though, it’s doubtful the current fleet of plants will run for, say, 80 years. When I visited Nils Diaz, the longtime chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, who retired at the end of June, he pointed out that even if one passed muster for safety, a plant that old might require so much upkeep as to make it uneconomical. That means the industry, in a way, is in a race against time. Recently, Paul Joskow, a professor of economics at M.I.T., sent me a chart that looks ahead to the output of America’s reactors over the next half-century. As the current 103 nuclear reactors continue to generate electricity for the next few decades, the line on the chart remains mostly flat. But then the plants’ electricity production falls off a cliff. “I think this is the first time in many years, perhaps 20 years, that the combination of government policy, economic conditions and environmental constraints are reasonably favorable for nuclear,” Joskow told me. “If they can’t move forward now, it would be very difficult in the longer run.” It may even be more urgent than that. One conclusion to be derived from the chart is that nuclear power in this country is dying. Unless someone starts building soon, it will begin to disappear in 15 or 20 years, as one plant after another exhausts its operating permit and goes dark. And it will effectively be extinguished as an energy source by around 2050. For those with deep misgivings about the safety and expense of nuclear plants, life without them may indeed be a cause for celebration. Yet their absence would probably pose tremendous challenges for the United States. The first is where 20 percent of our power would come from; the second is whether a substitute fuel for that power would emit carbon dioxide. It is, in many ways, a long-term dilemma, one closely related to global warming, and one that is poorly suited to a society that focuses on short-term results. For Wall Street, which concerns itself with our publicly traded utilities’ quarterly earnings, the primary worry is whether companies (and investors) that choose nuclear power will quickly be saddled with burdensome debts. For elected officials, the main concern is whether support for nuclear energy will hurt or help their standing in the next election cycle. Yet to spend a few months listening to those who study the earth’s energy resources is to get the feeling that we are in for a very difficult century — and one that depends on an immediate future of difficult and unpleasant choices. “If you want a different energy system in 2050, you really have to start changing it now,” says John Holdren, a Harvard professor and one of the country’s most esteemed thinkers on energy and the environment. “You can’t get there and say, ‘Oh, I want a different energy system.’ ”  When it comes to America’s future energy needs, one of the larger points of confusion is the somewhat tangled relationship between fossil fuels and electricity. Current prices at the gas pump, for instance, or the possibility that we are approaching a moment of “peak oil” — the point at which the global supply of crude peaks and then diminishes forever, with cataclysmic consequences for transportation, trucking and the economy in general — actually have little to do with the future supply of power. Making electricity is generally about creating a source of heat and steam, and using that steam to turn giant turbines and generate power. Less than 3 percent of our electric power is generated from oil. Besides the 20 percent contribution from nuclear power, 50 percent of our electricity comes from burning coal, 18 percent from burning natural gas and (in a heat-free method that is often the cheapest) 6.5 percent by harnessing the energy of water moving through dams. Wind and solar power make up less than one-half of 1 percent of what we use on a typical day. In part because the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine (and in part because wind turbines and solar cells are expensive to build) neither technology is yet good enough to generate large, reliable quantities of inexpensive electricity, or what utility companies call “base load” power. At at some point in the future, oil and electricity may fight for supremacy: Toyota recently announced it is developing a plug-in car in addition to its hybrids, for instance, and electricity has the potential to help manufacture clean-burning fuels like hydrogen for the future. Over the past few years, the executives at Georgia Power, a division of the Southern Company as well as the utility that owns the majority share of the Vogtle plant, have tracked the population growth of the region and tried to look ahead, as all utilities do, at what the demand for electricity might be several decades from now. At the moment, the company’s 20-year projections suggest that power needs in the region will grow by 30 percent. So that’s one consideration. Another is that some outmoded plants in their system will need to be replaced. Building Vogtle Units 3 and 4 would, essentially, be a bet that a nuclear power plant will be superior to a new coal or gas plant in the long run. “I think based on what we know today, it would be the best option, but there’s still a lot of work to be done,” Oscar Harper, a vice president at Georgia Power, told me. Yet even if Georgia Power makes a decision in favor of nuclear, it still needs the state’s public utility board to agree that it’s in the best interest of Georgia residents. None of this is assured. Moreover, what makes the choice of fuels such a knotty problem is that something that is cheap now, like coal, may not be so cheap in 10 years. This isn’t because we’re running out; we probably have at least a century’s worth of coal reserves in the United States alone. But if the government were to impose a tax or a cap on carbon emissions, something that almost everyone I spoke with in the energy industry believes is inevitable, or if new laws mandate that coal plants must adopt more expensive technologies to burn the coal cleaner — or to “sequester” the carbon-dioxide byproducts underground — the financial equation will change: a kilowatt-hour generated by coal suddenly becomes more expensive. There are other contingencies at play, too: fuels, like natural gas, could experience a supply interruption that leads to enormous price spikes. As for the hope that wind and solar power will generate large amounts of clean, affordable electricity in the near future? I encountered great skepticism inside and outside the utility companies. “Maybe in 40 years,” Paul Joskow, of M.I.T., told me. Meanwhile, nuclear power has several appealing factors: the cost of uranium is fairly low, the supply is abundant (and mostly found in countries friendly to the United States) and big plants like Vogtle can generate large amounts of inexpensive electricity. The fuel, which takes the shape of thousands of pellets that are loaded inside long metal tubes and then placed into the reactor core, is strikingly potent; just a few pellets stacked together to resemble the size, shape and color of a black crayon can generate enough electricity for an entire family for a year. On the other hand, the list of negatives is long. Uranium mining is a messy business, and some Western states are still cleaning up the detritus of mines and mills from a half-century ago. A catastrophic reactor accident here or abroad — one that could be the equivalent of a so-called dirty bomb, killing thousands and rendering hundreds of square miles of surrounding land uninhabitable — would immediately destroy any revival of the industry. Then there are byproducts and proliferation. Until the Yucca Mountain underground repository in Nevada is completed (and the site probably will not be approved for construction before 2011), spent fuel has to stay on the site of nuclear facilities. And the possibility of irradiated fuel in the hands of a terrorist or rogue government has become increasingly worrisome in recent years. The most immediate challenges, at least for the utilities, are the capital costs of building new plants, which when factored into the cost of the electricity, as they need to be, have a history of striking terror into the hearts of public-utility board members. A coal plant costs significantly less than a nuclear plant — as much as 50 percent less — and a gas plant is much cheaper than a coal plant. When I asked David Ratcliffe, the C.E.O. of the Southern Company, about the choice he’s facing at Vogtle, he explained: “When you line up the three fundamental technologies — gas, coal and nuclear — you’re lining them up from lowest capital cost and lowest construction time to greatest capital cost and greatest construction time. You’re also lining them up from greatest fuel-price volatility to least fuel-price volatility.” Probably the best comparison of gas, coal and nuclear energy was done with Joskow’s help in 2003, when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published an exhaustive analysis of the future of nuclear power. The M.I.T. study concluded that nuclear energy is competitive, but only under certain circumstances. One instance is if the costs of building a plant are significantly reduced (by shortening the length of construction, for example). Another is if coal and natural-gas plants are taxed on carbon emissions. Because nuclear plants don’t produce carbon dioxide and wouldn’t be taxed, their electricity could conceivably cost no more to generate than that from coal and gas, or even less. There is a counterargument to building large new power plants. One view — voiced most forcefully, perhaps, by Amory Lovins, a physicist who runs Rocky Mountain Institute, which advises corporations and utilities on energy efficiency — is that we don’t need to increase our electrical supply. We need to decrease demand by rewarding utilities for getting customers to reduce electricity use by, say, updating their appliances, furnaces and lighting. Lovins, a longtime critic of nuclear power, contends that it remains financially uncompetitive and that the 30-year absence of new plants is proof that the market has rejected nuclear power as a viable technology. When we spoke about whether utilities need to build more big generating plants in this country, he told me no — not now, not in 15 years, not even after that. “I think if you do,” he remarked, “your shareholders and ratepayers will be asking awkward questions that you would really rather not want to answer.” Yet the concern, even among Lovins’s admirers, is that if he is mistaken — that is, if either his estimates on efficiencies can’t accommodate population and industrial growth, or because what is possible in principle for energy efficiency is not possible in the real world — then the utilities will require an alternative plan. And that would entail more supply, likely meaning more big base-load plants (whether they rely on uranium, gas or coal) as well as large investments in renewable sources like wind and solar power. When I asked John Holdren at Harvard whether the potential for efficiencies is as large as Lovins says, he replied, “The savings could be huge.” Yet Holdren also maintains that creating a clean and reliable energy supply for the future is going to be so daunting that nothing should be taken off the table. Clean coal, renewables, nuclear — we’ll need them all. To those in the electricity business, this is known as creating an energy portfolio: build everything, use everything and rely on nothing exclusively. “I’ll be very happy if Amory’s right,” Holdren added, “but I’d like to hedge my bets.” For 30 years the debate has been defined by a perfect and almost maddening symmetry, not only in terms of opinion but also of facts. The answer to whether nuclear power is risky can be framed many ways, for instance: you can tally the number of injuries and deaths to citizens from U.S. nuclear plants (zero) or consider the potential number of injuries and deaths in a serious accident (many). Is nuclear power clean because it doesn’t produce carbon? Or is it dirty because it produces radioactive waste? Is it very expensive? Or are the economics competitive over the long run, especially if fossil fuels are taxed for warming the planet?  For a utility that wants to go shopping for a nuclear plant, there are no blueprints floating around to help you do it yourself. If you have access to $2 billion or $3 billion, you pretty much have only three options. You can begin negotiations with General Electric or a French company called Areva for their newest designs, known as the E.S.B.W.R. and the E.P.R., respectively. Or you can start talking with Westinghouse, as the Southern Company has done, and check out its new reactor, the AP1000. If the Southern Company’s Georgia Power division decides to build Vogtle Units 3 and 4, this is the model. Unlike G.E.’s and Areva’s models, the Westinghouse design was approved and certified this year, after a complex multiyear process, by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Still, as I was reminded during my tour of Vogtle, an AP1000 has never been built anywhere in the world. Westinghouse’s offices are about 30 minutes outside Pittsburgh, in a complex of squat, black, glassy modernist boxes that seem to have been dropped gently from the heavens onto a campus of several hundred verdant acres. The company continues to license its all-American name for home appliances, and its switchboard still gets calls every December from homeowners having trouble with their old Westinghouse Christmas lights. But this is now a nuclear company, and a nuclear company only, from top to bottom: Westinghouse services existing plants, sells fuel and sells new plant designs. All its other divisions have been shed, most of them during a corporate fire sale in the 1990’s. “At that point in time, we didn’t anticipate nuclear coming back here in the U.S.,” Steve Tritch, the company’s C.E.O., told me when I met with him in his office. So Westinghouse looked to Europe and Asia for new plants and concentrated on selling fuel and consulting services. “Barring some tremendous technological discovery that was going to produce energy, my own personal belief was that if you looked at the basic situation with fossil fuels, then nuclear was going to be used again here,” Tritch said. Still, in those days he assumed that Westinghouse wouldn’t see much new business in the U.S. until perhaps 2015. About two-thirds of the plants in the United States are based on Westinghouse designs, including Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and the first commercial reactor ever built in this country, in Shippingport, Pa., which began producing power in 1957. In the mid-1950’s, the Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, allowed the development of nuclear power for civilian uses. The fuel was to be far less volatile than that used in a weapon, which is why a nuclear plant can’t be detonated like an atomic bomb. Yet it took at least another decade before the industry gained any traction, and much of the early momentum came from government financing and the willingness of companies like G.E. and Westinghouse to sell plants for tremendous discounts. Many utilities couldn’t resist. In the early years, most of the engineers who designed plants came out of the U.S. Navy program for nuclear submarines, which explains the industry preference for nautical terminology (the “fleet”) and to some extent its nautical design motifs. Walking through the industrial interiors of Plant Vogtle and of Grand Gulf, a nuclear plant I visited in Mississippi, I had the odd sensation of being in the hold of an immense freighter, bound for somewhere. In retrospect, the nuclear dream of the 1950’s and 60’s was at least partly delusional. Those infamous predictions from the early days — that nuclear power would be “too cheap to meter,” as Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, told a conference of science writers in 1954, or that the country was destined to have the nuclear power of 1,000 plants by the year 2000, as the commission predicted in the early 1970’s — seem farcical in light of what transpired in building the plants: the billions in overruns, the endless years of construction. Steve Tritch told me that inside the Westinghouse offices in the 1980’s, executives kept a list of domestic plants they expected would be decommissioned even before their 40-year licenses expired. The trend for utilities was to get out of nuclear power as fast as possible, not in. The so-called renaissance may turn out to be just a brief flurry of enthusiasm, entailing the construction of a few new plants over the next decade. But if nuclear power does catch on again — and there are a number of reasons to think it might, the most obvious being strong government encouragement driven by the attitude that a portfolio of energy options creates a more stable economy — then the seeds of its revival would almost certainly date back to the late 1980’s and early 1990’s. At that point, it was clear that the industry had massive, intractable problems. Most of the plants in the country were of customized designs, making repairs difficult and efficiencies of scale challenging. Many utilities had no expertise in operating a nuclear plant even after purchasing one. Meanwhile, the process for getting a facility approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was done in two steps: first a construction permit and then, years later, an operating permit. The process all but ensured long delays and wasted resources as N.R.C. regulators identified construction errors and design shortcomings at very late stages and as legal opponents challenged the licensing process over the course of many years. At around that time, a number of nuclear-friendly groups focused on hammering out a strategic long-term recovery plan for the industry. One of these, the Nuclear Power Oversight Committee, made up of several utility executives, created a blueprint for an industry revival that bears an uncanny resemblance to the way things are turning out today. “They said you have to have a new licensing regime at the N.R.C., because we can never have a Shoreham again,” Ed Cummins, Westinghouse’s chief engineer, told me. Shoreham, estimated to cost about $260 million in the 1960’s, before construction started, was completed in 1984 for $5.5 billion, sold to New York State for $1 in 1992 and immediately decommissioned. Cummins also recalled that the oversight-committee plan listed about 15 other industry and regulatory changes before anyone would again consider building new nuclear plants. Many of the resolutions involved safety features and maintenance. If nuclear power were to ever get another chance, a new fleet of plants had to be standardized in design, easier to build and simpler to maintain. Above all, of course, they had to be far, far less expensive.  No two factors have been quite so important to the revived prospects for nuclear power as the high price of natural gas and large incentives offered by the Department of Energy, amounting to several hundred million dollars, to help finance the first few reactors. But there have been a great number of helpful factors inside the industry too. By the late 1990’s, for instance, several utilities, notably Exelon (based in Illinois) and Entergy Nuclear (Mississippi), had developed specialties in buying and operating nuclear plants. With Westinghouse’s help, the companies proved that refueling the plants, a complex choreography that occurs every 18 months or so and results in the temporary shutdown of the plant, could be done in about 35 days rather than the customary 60 or 70. The profits in decreasing that refueling period (many nuclear plants take in revenue of about $1 million a day) have been tremendous. Indeed, the companies became so adept at refueling and day-to-day operations that they began acquiring old nuclear plants whose owners either didn’t want them or couldn’t manage them. And they have proved that building a nuclear plant and buying a nuclear plant are entirely different business propositions. A company like Entergy, for instance, has purchased plants like Indian Point in Westchester County and Pilgrim in Massachusetts, updated them, retrained the work force, sped up the refueling process and reaped a nice financial reward. When I traveled to Jackson, Miss., to meet with Entergy’s executives, its C.E.O., Gary Taylor, pointed out that the company’s fleet, which now numbers 10 reactors, accounts for about $250 million in annual profits. What’s more, it has been companies like Entergy and Exelon that in the 1990’s began to give the engineers at Westinghouse and G.E. suggestions for the next generation of nuclear facilities, if they were ever built, rather than the other way around. According to Tritch, the Westinghouse C.E.O., company executives had to listen. “They had been operating plants for 25 years,” he says. “It was no longer a core competency of ours. It was a core competency of theirs.” One great challenge in designing nuclear power plants is that making something safer and making something cheaper are often conflicting priorities: the less you spend, the less safe it is, and vice versa. This was what Westinghouse engineers began to wrestle with as they explored designs that could be built more efficiently. For any new project, the same basic technology would still be used to produce electricity: uranium pellets, encased in fuel rods, would undergo a controlled chain reaction in the core, release energy to heat pressurized water and generate steam, and the steam would turn giant, magnetized turbines to generate electricity. But they theorized that if the plant was physically smaller and it used less in the way of materials, it would help reduce costs and construction time. Also, a cheaper plant could be built off site from poured concrete modules and assembled on location, rather than through a huge works project on the scale of the Great Pyramids, as at Vogtle. Most important, perhaps, the engineers began to ponder what’s known as “passive” safety features. Years before, the U.S. military had asked Westinghouse to design a small, underground nuclear reactor to power missile silos. The reactor was never built, according to Howard Bruschi, the company’s former chief technology officer, but the lessons were not forgotten. Passive safety measures included backup systems that would kick in automatically in the event of accidents or mechanical problems. Hundreds or thousands of working pipes and valves might be replaced by, say, a tank of cooling water mounted high so it could be emptied by gravity rather than by an electric pump. Complexity reduced, money saved. And at least in theory, there was an improvement in safety, too. The company’s project was given a name: the AP600. It stood for Advanced Passive reactor; the 600 represented the output in megawatts. Westinghouse financed part of the AP600 effort through its research budget, and the company also received a generous grant in the early 1990’s from the U.S. Department of Energy. But even those sources of money weren’t enough to supply the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to create the large working models to test the efficacy of the safety systems. “So we basically went to other countries that had nuclear programs and invited them to help with their test facilities and engineers,” Bruschi says. Within Westinghouse, I heard it said that Bruschi went around the world, hat in hand, looking for help. I asked him how many countries he visited. “Italy, France, Japan, England, Scotland, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Latvia and Poland,” he told me. Eventually he went to China and Indonesia, too. It paid off when the N.R.C. approved the design for the AP600 in 1999. But there were no buyers. Not one. Ed Cummins, the Westinghouse engineer, says that one major utility executive set him straight on why. Any utility could build a gas plant for far cheaper, he was told, and sell the electricity at a lower rate. So why build this? The AP600 was too small. It generated too little electricity to justify its construction costs. “He was right,” Cummins says, and in response, he and his staff spent several years expanding the AP600 into the 1,100-megawatt AP1000. It cost more, but its larger electric output made it more competitive. When I visited Westinghouse in late May, the company was just putting the finishing touches on a simulated control room for the new plant, a sleek space near Cummins’s office to demonstrate for buyers and regulators how operators will monitor the plant on just a few computer terminals and one large, central screen. Unlike the control rooms I visited at Vogtle and Grand Gulf, where operators are in charge of literally thousands of buttons, switches and meters, the technology at the AP1000 simulator, like the aesthetic, is modernized, simplified and streamlined. The look is part of the marketing effort, of course. But the appeal of the AP1000 remains doubtful, even as 11 utilities, including the Southern Company, have expressed interest in the design. Westinghouse maintained to me that the cost will ultimately be somewhere between $1.4 billion and $1.9 billion. “We’re negotiating contracts,” Dan Lipman, who runs the new-power-plant division at Westinghouse, told me over lunch at the company cafeteria. “We’re well beyond the should-we-do-nuclear phase. It’s now a matter of, How should we do it?” So I asked Lipman what it would mean to actually cut a deal with a utility for a new plant, the first in 30 years. Would it happen a year from now? Two years? “If your definition of a deal is, when do you first start getting money, then that could happen very soon,” he said. “I look for that this year, with big money committed after licensing by the N.R.C.” From his continuing negotiations, Lipman said, it’s clear that his customers are interested in “off-ramps”: clauses in the contracts that allow them to bow out if they hit an unexpected financial or construction snag. Still, if there is some circumstantial evidence that the price of new plants hasn’t hit the point of affordability — the on-ramp, essentially, where utilities stop negotiating and start signing contracts and building — it might be the decision by the Tennessee Valley Authority to refurbish an existing nuclear facility at Browns Ferry in Alabama, rather than sign a contract for a new one. “The fact that the T.V.A. is spending $1.8 billion to fix up an old plant, rather than just spend it on a new plant, suggests that a new one costs well over $2 billion,” David Lochbaum, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me in Washington. Lochbaum, a nuclear engineer and former consultant in the industry, agrees that carbon taxes could make a new nuclear plant financially viable. For now he says that the AP1000 just costs too much. This is something Westinghouse will not concede, but company executives did say they are fully aware that it isn’t passive safety or modular construction that will sell their designs. It’s the price tag, as well as proof that for the first time in history, a slew of nuclear plants can be built quickly, smoothly and within a budget.  What really keeps the utilities and the nuclear industry up at night is risk — not just the risk that something will break down at one of the existing plants and thus wipe out two decades of improvements in operations, but the risk that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is a black hole, an organization that will accept the new applications for plants and wait (and wait) before approving a construction-and-operating license. The N.R.C., which has streamlined its review process since the debacles of the 1970’s, fields criticisms from both sides. Nuclear-safety advocates like Lochbaum, at the Union of Concerned Scientists, find it too accommodating to the industry; the industry, in turn, finds it too tough, slow and bureaucratic. But no one denies that the agency holds extraordinary power over the fate of the nuclear business in this country. It can shut a facility down, levy fines of $130,000 per incident per day, bar employees from working in the industry and delay and deny licenses. In addition to several thousand employees in its Rockville, Md., offices, the agency places at least two N.R.C. employees at every plant in the country. (They have total access at every plant to review day-to-day operations.) The agency is not known for partisanship; the commission membership is split in party affiliation, and the employees are civil servants. If anything, the engineers I met at the N.R.C. are a kind of hybrid scientist-cop, people of formidable intelligence with very little patience for companies or plants that deviate from the letter of the law. Nuclear power plants are arguably the most complicated machines in the history of civilization, and the review process for new plants reflects that complexity. Essentially, a utility will need three stamps of approval from the N.R.C. to build a new facility: a site permit, an approved reactor design and a construction-and-operating license. Only then can a utility move forward. In the case of Vogtle, the Southern Company is finishing a site-permit application this month that will explore the suitability of those green circles on the forest floor as future reactor sites. The application will run thousands of pages and include an array of scientific data — “seismology, meteorology, hydrology, just about all the ologies I can list for you,” says David Matthews, the head of the reactor-licensing division at the N.R.C. The agency, in turn, will spend two to three years reviewing it. The Southern Company has already said it would use the AP1000, meaning that it has chosen a certified design. So an approval of the site should eventually lead to the next step: a construction-and-operating application that includes detailed engineering data and every possible risk assessment. It will probably run more than 30,000 pages. It will take the N.R.C. at least another three years to review it. The question of whether various utilities are serious about reviving nuclear power might be measured by their seriousness in pursuing such an involved process. They’re spending hundreds of millions of dollars to have the chance to build a nuclear plant within a few years. Just for the option of building Vogtle Units 3 and 4 — not for any construction at all — Georgia Power expects to spend $51 million. As David Ratcliffe, the Southern Company’s C.E.O., put it: “We’re marching down this road.” I asked many people in the industry whether the N.R.C. can grant licenses with the kind of speed that would preserve the integrity of its safety reviews and still satisfy the utilities. Nils Diaz, the recently retired chairman of the commission, told me that with new management procedures and employees — the N.R.C. is hiring hundreds of scientists and engineers to ready itself for the blizzard of work — the agency is up to the task. But most of the utilities, and many financial analysts who cover the electricity business, maintain a more guarded attitude. In fact, the industry has tried to create several cushions to insulate itself from potential hang-ups, since a delay doesn’t mean only that it will take longer for a plant to produce revenue but also that a utility will have to pay interest on any money it borrows to finance a plant. (At Vogtle, for instance, nearly $3 billion of the final $8.87 billion cost was the finance charge on debt.) For starters, the Department of Energy has created a kind of risk insurance available to utilities that are the first movers in building a new plant. If one of the new plants hits regulatory delays during construction, the D.O.E. will reimburse the utility for at least a part of those costs. The second cushion is the creation of an industry consortium, called NuStart, to test the licensing process. NuStart is filing several applications for nuclear plants, on behalf of its members, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. These applications — for the Grand Gulf plant in Mississippi and the Bellefonte site in Alabama — have preceded all others and may end up being built first. One goal of NuStart is to prove to Wall Street that utilities can get a license in a timely manner. Another goal is to establish a way for the industry to pool risk and information. If NuStart’s construction-and-operating applications for its two sites are approved, in other words, any utility in the consortium (including Entergy, Exelon and Southern Company) can copy huge parts of the approved application for its own use, thus saving time and money. The Southern Company would do this for Vogtle. The hypothetical nuclear plant then hits the next set of obstacles. In the South, at least, there appears to be little in the way of community opposition. When I spent the day in Port Gibson, Miss., the tiny town next to the Grand Gulf plant, the local politicians were adamant in support of any new reactor. “We’ve not been able to prosper like other communities,” James Miller, the country administrator, told me. “We see this as our golden opportunity.” The industry seems more concerned about the logistics of building a plant — that is, the actual construction. Several executives told me that they worried most about finding enough craft labor to work on the special aspects of plant construction. They also worried about steel orders, since the domestic industry that long ago forged the massive reactor vessels no longer exists. Only Japan Steel Works, these executives say, has such capacity now. “This country hasn’t built really a lot of whole infrastructure in 20 years, and it hasn’t licensed a new nuclear plant in 30 years,” Gary Taylor, the Entergy Nuclear C.E.O., told me. “Most of the hard manufacturing moved offshore. In many ways that may be a bigger challenge than anything else.” Then there’s the question of safety. The performance of American plants in this regard has improved markedly over the past 10 years; the industry, moreover, has gone to great lengths to help operators at plants around the world share information on mechanical or safety issues. Yet the specter of an accident has never really disappeared — nor will it. Nils Diaz told me that the role of the National Regulatory Commission is not to regulate the industry to a “zero-risk factor.” That would be impossible, he said. It’s to make sure there is the “reasonable assurance of adequate protection.” Many industry critics wonder if even this goal is achievable. David Lochbaum, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, has pointed out the existence of a “bathtub curve” that applies to the safety of nuclear plants: statistically, they are most dangerous either when they are first brought online (as was the case with T.M.I. and Chernobyl) or at the very end of their life cycles. Many of our existing plants, Lochbaum points out, are edging closer to old age. As for the next generation of plants, the risk assessments on the AP1000 suggest its design is between 10 and 100 times safer than existing models. But until one is actually built, this remains a hypothetical. Engineers at the N.R.C. told me they will retain a healthy skepticism for passive safety until there’s a track record in a working plant. They also noted, as a separate concern, that design safety (in any plant) does not necessarily translate into operational safety. “It’s difficult to model and predict human action,” Jerry Wilson, an N.R.C. analyst, told me. “It’s much easier to model the technical details.” Finally, what about a wild card — that is, the remote possibility of an attack on a plant? It is not easy to get into a nuclear facility these days. It took me several weeks just to gain access to report this article, and I was first subjected to a thorough background check. At the gates of both Vogtle and Grand Gulf, I was met by heavily armed guards; later, I was escorted through many phalanxes of protective structures — razor wire, concrete blocks, fences, steel turnstiles, security doors, explosives sensors and so on — before ever getting near the reactor. At Grand Gulf, guards even patrolled inside key buildings with AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. Walking unescorted was out of the question. At least from the ground, the plants seemed impregnable. And the reactor-containment buildings, where the core resides — the small domed buildings that are the heart of a nuclear plant (the high cooling towers carry no radioactivity) — are some of the strongest man-made structures in existence. They’re engineered to withstand earthquakes, fires, floods, internal explosions. Yet the details of the N.R.C.’s own security reviews of plants (the agency periodically stages “force on force” mock attacks) have not been made public since 9/11 for reasons of national security, so there is no way to know how some facilities, if any, are deficient in protective measures. In 2000 and 2001, the last set of statistics the N.R.C. made public, 6 of 11 plants that were tested failed to prevent reactor damage when defending against the simulated attacks.  To John Holdren of Harvard, the essential problem with nuclear power is that it is “too unforgiving of either human error or human malice.” At the same time, Holdren points out, every source of electricity has its negatives. In the case of oil and gas, the question is whether there are enough reserves. For other fossil fuels like coal and tar sands, the question is whether our atmosphere can tolerate the emissions. For ethanol, the question is whether there is enough land to grow the necessary crops. For wind and hydropower, the question is whether there are enough good sites. Enough sunlight hits the planet to power civilization 2,000 times over, Holdren says, but solar power from photovoltaic cells is too expensive. “I can design a world that runs on photovoltaics,” he says, “but at current costs, electricity would be three or four times what it costs today.” That would wreak havoc on the world economy. What complicates things further is the specter of great climate changes. This month, Jim Hansen, a NASA scientist, declared that we have, at most, 10 years to alter the trajectory of global greenhouse emissions. Holdren, similarly, says he believes that the problems from global warming could become so acute so quickly — as in a few years, rather than a few decades — that there really isn’t much time to decide which way to go. Among the most influential ideas these days about how to change the system are those from the research of two Princeton professors, Stephen Pacala and Robert Socolow, who wrote an academic paper in 2004 on what they called “stabilization wedges.” It is an encouraging document, in that it presents a manageable way to think about how to address global warming — basically, to approach it on many fronts simultaneously — without suggesting we need one big, magical fix. Pacala and Socolow looked at what we can do now, using current technologies, and barring any sort of startling new scientific developments, to freeze carbon dioxide production and thus slow down global warming. They assert that we could reduce carbon emissions incrementally. In pursuing one of these “wedges,” we would reduce carbon emissions slightly; but in pursuing all of them, we could succeed in flatlining the growth of carbon emissions entirely by the century’s midpoint. There are 15 different wedges. These include increasing vehicle efficiency, reforestation, improving the efficiency of buildings, capturing carbon in power plants, replacing some coal power with wind power and replacing some coal power with solar power. Nuclear power is a wedge, too. It is curious, though perhaps unsurprising, that to various advocates some wedges have proved more appealing than others: supporters of nuclear power, for instance, stressed its environmental wedge potential to me while playing down the viability of wind and solar power. The opposite is true as well. In the film “An Inconvenient Truth,” Al Gore refers to the Pacala and Socolow research, citing several wedges, but not the nuclear one. He stresses renewable energies. To consider nuclear energy in the environmental framework, though, may be the same as asking whether the utilities that pursue new plants might be giving us a valuable wedge. Because without the environmental contribution from new nuclear plants, we may need to find a wedge somewhere else. And ultimately, the essential, agonizingly difficult question of nuclear power is not whether it’s good or bad, or whether it’s worse than wind and better than coal, but whether we will have a better future with or without it. “By 2015, I think everyone in the world will be convinced that our interventions in climate are going to be intolerable,” Holdren says. “I’m often asked, ‘Can you solve the climate problem without nuclear energy?’ And I say, ‘Yes, you can solve it without nuclear energy.’ But it will be easier to solve it with nuclear energy.” Of course, that does not necessarily address the questions of plant security, proliferation and operational safety. Or economics. But it does suggest, as the M.I.T. economist Paul Joskow told me, that “there is a value” in the development of at least a few new plants and in keeping the nuclear option alive. This line of thinking might ultimately bring you to a cautious support for nuclear power simply because allowing it to die seems more dangerous than keeping it alive. You are against its demise, rather than for its advancement. There are many in the nuclear industry, meanwhile, with far grander visions. Gary Taylor, for instance, the C.E.O. of Entergy Nuclear, says he believes a doubling of the number of nuclear plants around the world is inevitable, both to satisfy energy demands and to counter global warming. As Taylor puts it: “The reality is, what is scalable in the time frame that addresses the issues? If it isn’t this technology, I don’t know what it would be.” Diaz, the former head of the N.R.C., told me he sees a similarly bright future for nuclear. “The world is going to go nuclear, because they do not have any other real alternatives,” he says. I met plenty of other engineers within the industry who went even further. Their feeling about nuclear power is close to evangelical, in that they seem to approach the technology with moral certitude while being loath to acknowledge any of its many negatives. Would that include the utility executives who will ultimately decide if — and what — to build? I’m not sure it would. To those I spoke with in the uppermost ranks, nuclear power isn’t a belief system. It’s a business. And to them, what might come out of, say, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 — the waste and the power and the profits — would be nearly identical to what comes out of Units 1 and 2. At least that was my conclusion in Georgia, where Jeff Gasser, the Southern Company’s chief nuclear officer, took me through a long tour of the plant. He was smart, meticulous and intensely committed to the obscure safety protocols that go on at nuclear power facilities. Most of all he was forthright about the advantages and disadvantages of the nukes business. When we went to visit the spent-fuel pool in Vogtle, where the used fuel-rod assemblies are stored under 20 feet of protective water, Gasser let me know that we would die if we pulled one of the fuel assemblies out of the pool. “We would receive, before we could get to the exit door a few feet away, a lethal radiation dose,” he said. I quickly had to check the radiation dosimeter I was wearing — another legal requirement of the N.R.C. — to see if I was already glowing. (It read zero.) “The communications people hate it when I use words like ‘lethal’ and ‘irradiated,’ ” Gasser continued. “But the fact is, there is no perfect way of generating electricity. There are byproducts for every type.” Like many others, he went through the positives and negatives of coal, gas, solar, wind and nuclear. In his opinion, he added, with Vogtle’s engineering, redundancy of safety systems and its trained operators, it was a safe, reliable and efficient way of making electricity. That was his sales pitch. We had already passed through the containment buildings, where the reactors heat the pressurized water. So Gasser took me through the turbine building, an enormous room the size of a soccer field, where the steam turns the fan blades. Eventually, we went out a back door into the sunlight. The deafening sounds of turbines and machinery subsided to a dull thrum. We removed our earplugs and walked over to a small forest of electrical transformers, our backs to the plant. The electricity from the turbines inside comes out here, Gasser explained, its voltage is transformed, and it is then put into the grid. Gasser made a pushing motion toward the green hills before us. “Once the power is sent out of here, it can go everywhere,” he explained. And I could see that it did go everywhere. The high-tension wires stretched away from where we stood, in several directions, through deep cuts in the pinelands, as far as I could see.

675-> California: Charges Dropped
The former suspect in the JonBenet Ramsey killing left jail after a judge dismissed child pornography charges against him, saying prosecutors did not have enough evidence to take the case to trial. The judge, Rene Chouteau of Sonoma County Superior Court, ordered the defendant, John M. Karr, released immediately, bringing an end to his two-month odyssey in the criminal justice system after he was extradited from Thailand on suspicion of killing the 6-year-old JonBenet. The misdemeanor pornography case fell apart after investigators admitted losing vital computer evidence that was seized from Mr. Karr, 41, in April 2001 when he was working as a substitute teacher in Sonoma and Napa Counties. Mr. Karr did not comment as he left the Sonoma County jail with his lawyers.

684-> World Briefing | Europe: Spain: U.S. Flag Returns To Military Parade
United States troops carrying the American flag marched in Spain's national day military parade in Madrid for the first time in three years. Spain invited American troops to participate in the parade in 2001, as a sign of solidarity after the Sept. 11 attacks. But in 2003, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, then the Socialist opposition leader and a critic of the American invasion of Iraq, caused an uproar by remaining seated in a V.I.P. stand as the American honor guard passed. He became prime minister in 2004, brought home the 1,300 Spanish troops that had been sent to Iraq, and stopped the practice of American forces marching in the military parade. The Defense Ministry said the Americans were invited this year as part of a tribute to countries in the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo. French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Swedish troops also marched. As a Marine honor guard marched past with the American flag, Mr. Zapatero stood but did not applaud.

687-> In Study, Distance Running Is Tied to Skin Cancer Risk
Marathon runners may have an increased risk for skin cancer, a small published Monday suggests, and excessive sun exposure and exercise-induced suppression of the body’s immune system may be involved. The lead author of the report, Dr. Christina M. Ambros-Rudolph, said the pilot study had reached no conclusion about the exact increase in risk that marathoners face. But, Dr. Ambros-Rudolph said, “Our results show that there is a difference, in particular in sun exposure and measurable consequences such as increased solar lentigines.” Solar lentigines are “age spots” caused by long-term sun exposure. The researchers, from the dermatology department of the Medical University of Graz in Austria, studied 210 marathon runners and a control group of 210 nonmarathoners matched for age and sex. All the subjects, runners and nonrunners, were white, a risk factor for malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Each participant had a total body skin examination, and the scientists recorded information for all participants on eye color, skin shade, history of severe sunburn and family history of skin cancer, all known risk factors for skin malignancies. Even though, by chance, the nonrunners had more benign moles and freckles and significantly higher sun sensitivity as determined by eye color and skin shade, the runners had more solar lentigines and more lesions suggestive of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, two less aggressive skin cancers. The study appears in the November issue of The Archives of Dermatology. Sun exposure may not be the only risk factor that distance runners face. The authors write that although there is no question that regular exercise is important to good health, there is good evidence that high-intensity training and excessive exercise can lead to suppressed immune function. “This is quite well established,” Dr. Ambros-Rudolph said. “Many alterations in immune cell function have been noted at the cellular level in marathon runners. “For example, there is the association between excessive exercise and immunosuppression reflected in the increased incidence and severity of upper respiratory tract infections in marathon runners after races.” The exact mechanism is unknown, but there is evidence that trauma sustained during extreme exercise can induce the release of cytokines, proteins that can stimulate the growth and activity of various immune cells and that may limit the ability of the immune system to fight potential cancers. Clinical examination by dermatologists showed that none of the participants had lesions that suggested malignant melanoma. But 24 of the marathon group and 14 of the control group were referred for surgical treatment of lesions that appeared to be basal or squamous cell carcinomas or the precancerous lesions called actinic keratoses. Follow-up reports on these patients were not available because of the limits in Austrian laws on personal privacy. About a third of the marathoners ran up to 25 miles a week, and nearly half ran 25 to 45 miles. Almost 15 percent ran more than 45 miles a week. Those who trained the most intensively had the highest rates of skin lesions. Almost all the runners dressed in clothing that exposed the legs, arms, shoulders and upper back, and only about half used sunscreen regularly. Physical exercise on sunny days can be more harmful to the skin than other kinds of sun exposure, the authors suggest, because sweating may significantly increase the sensitivity of the skin to ultraviolet radiation, making sunburn more likely. Moisture on the skin reduces the UV light to shorter wavelengths that are more easily absorbed and decreases their reflection and dispersion. Dr. Ambros-Rudolph emphasized that the main problem, for both casual runners and extreme exercisers, is sun exposure. “We hear a lot about sun exposure and skin cancer,” she said. “But we forget about it when participating in outdoor sports. Sunscreen alone is not the ultimate answer. It’s also important to wear reasonable gear that covers the shoulders and upper back, and to avoid training in peak sun hours.”

690-> In Riga, Creating an Identity Through the Arts
IT’S 2 a.m. in Riga, and the cobbled streets of the Old Town are crowded. The pelmeni shop, where you can fill up on stuffed noodles (the ex-Soviet world’s answer to ravioli) for a dollar or two, is doing a brisk business. A line of teenagers, good-humored and mildly raucous, snakes out the door of Pulkvedim Neviens Neraksta (No One Writes to the Colonel), the reigning alt-music temple. And windows on every street frame views of people dancing to loud, loud music: in a restaurant, booked for a private party; in a nightclub that has reserved a window spot for its strippers’ pole; and, most incongruously, in a tearoom, where exuberant bodies have carved out a dance floor amid the little round tables and echoes of gently clinking cups. Rules? What rules? Riga, cultured, energetic and young, is making them up as it goes along. Latvia is the poorest country in the European Union, but high-end Riga, its capital, is the most cosmopolitan city in the Baltics, with upscale shops, new museums, modern hotels and restaurants and only traces of what Latvia now calls the Soviet occupation (a term that’s created a certain chilliness in Latvian-Russian relations). Entrepreneurs here are learning that new ideas can make money. Why, for example, shouldn’t a restaurant turn into a disco at night? Why should the city’s chefs remain constrained by fish, dark rye bread and boiled peas with bacon — traditional Latvian fare — when there are so many new “fusion” ingredients: litchi nuts and jalapeños, hoisin sauce and dim sum? And why, say the city’s fathers and mothers (women play a huge role in this young society), should Riga’s cultural institutions remain bound by the past? Riga’s classical concert life, which was abruptly cut adrift from the Soviet system, is now in flux, about to spawn yet another orchestra; Riga’s curators are planning the construction of a contemporary art museum; and Riga’s opera company is widely acknowledged as one of the best in the former East Bloc. The opera house is a fine metaphor for the new Riga: its cultivated facade masks an underlying exuberance. Pale and neo-Classical, it stands in the strip of parkland that divides the two halves of the city: the old-world Old Town and the newer section that grew up outside the walls of the old fortress in the 19th century and is now known, somewhat confusingly to visitors, as the Center. The theater has been restored to its 1863 splendor, with gleaming wood floors, gilt trim and reliefs in hand-pressed plaster; modern additions have expanded rehearsal space and offices. The whole thing has been run for the last 10 years by a charismatic and unconventional general director named Andrejs Zagars, who presents cutting-edge young directors and singers from beyond Latvia’s borders. Mr. Zagars, who stands about six and a half feet tall, with the piercing gaze and square jaw of a movie star and the mien of a contented cat, brings to his job a blend of artistic and business backgrounds. In the 1980’s and early 90’s, he was a successful actor; after the breakup of the Soviet Union, he opened and operated a string of restaurants. “I want to poison the Latvians with opera,” he says, speaking in his office before the company’s recent premiere of “Das Rheingold.” “I want to create an addiction.” He has certainly created a lot of buzz, not least with this new production. Riga’s opera company has taken on Richard Wagner’s “Ring” cycle for the first time in more than 100 years, giving each of the operas to a different stage director and presenting one a year through 2009, in co-production with the Bergen International Festival in Norway. “Das Rheingold” is directed by a pleasantly controversial German-based wunderkind named Stefan Herheim: in his vision, the gods appear as German cultural icons like Nietzsche and Mozart and Bismarck; Wotan and Alberich are Richard Wagner; and the Rheingold and Valhalla are Wagner’s real-life Grail, the opera house in Bayreuth. Although Wagner himself lived in Riga for two years, it’s open to question how many of Riga’s citizens, long deprived of the composer’s music, got all of Mr. Herheim’s clever German references, but productions like these, showcased in the annual opera festival in June, have certainly gotten their interest: ticket sales have soared from 67 percent to 85 percent, Mr. Zagars said. Mr. Zagars, continuing in the new Latvian tradition of making up one’s own rules, has even started directing opera himself. This season will see a new “Traviata.” Culture is anything but tangential in a country seeking to create an identity. Latvia has been aware of this since the start of its first, short-lived spate of independence in 1919: it immediately created a system of state museums and an Academy of Fine Arts to foster the Latvian school of painting. (Yes, there is a Latvian school of painting. In the State Museum of Art, slightly surreal because the styles are familiar but all of the artists are Latvian, you can see striking works by Jazeps Grosvalds, who helped create the Riga Artists Group before his death at 29 in 1920, or Aleksandra Belcova, who blended the vocabularies of Cubism and Russian Constructivism in her portraits.) Latvia got to be a country for only a couple of decades before the Soviet Union took over; but with freedom in 1991 came a new sense of artistic self-definition. The Arsenal, a hip exhibition space in the Old Town that’s part of the state museum network, recently mounted the first-ever retrospective of Latvian art after World War II. A permanent home for this collection is a priority of the culture minister, Helena Demakova. Ms. Demakova’s plans also include the construction of the long-planned National Library, designed by the Latvian expatriate star architect Gunnar Birkerts, and a concert hall to replace the shabby Great Guild Hall, where the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra performs in an auditorium accessible only via several flights of chipped terrazzo stairs. These new edifices — assuming Ms. Demakova manages to secure the funds to build them before the anticipated shake-up of national elections this fall — will give tangible form to the question of just how Latvian culture is to be integrated into Riga’s conglomerate, polymorphous landscape. On the one hand, the city seeks to establish itself in terms of the European mainstream. But on the other, Riga, an ancient capital (it celebrated its 800th birthday in 2001) in a young country, has a layered profile, both architecturally and culturally, and its quirkiness is part of its charm. Riga’s cityscape spans centuries, from the crooked Dutch Renaissance houses along Maza Pils Iela in the Old Town to the Soviet-era monuments — the concrete slab of the Reval Hotel Latvija or the turreted Academy of Sciences, unaffectionately dubbed “Stalin’s birthday cake” — of the Center. Among its distinctive features are the low wooden 19th-century buildings that incongruously dot the modern Center, relics of the first settlements outside the stone fortress walls; and the amazing Jugendstil facades in the residential streets of the Center, heavy with curlicues and sphinxes, rampant lions and human faces two stories high, as if the architect had channeled some early European antecedent of Walt Disney. (The architects included Mikhail Eisenstein, whose son Sergei directed “Battleship Potemkin.”) Then there are the wooden villas of Jurmala, the seaside resort half an hour from Riga: dark weathered gingerbread buildings tucked among birch and pine woods just over a rise from the flat pale sands of the beaches along the Gulf of Riga. This was a beloved vacation spot of Soviet functionaries, who built a broad highway from Riga’s airport that was dubbed “Ten Minutes of America” for its putative resemblance to American Interstates. Yet perhaps the best architectural allegory of Riga’s Soviet period is in the heart of Old Town, in Town Hall Square, where the graceful, gold-tipped Dutch Renaissance facade of the reconstructed guild building called the House of Blackheads contrasts dramatically with the black, blocky edifice that lies like a crushing footprint across one end of the square. This Soviet-era building today houses the Occupation Museum, chronicling life under the Soviets (and, briefly, the Germans) from 1940 to 1991. Opera, painting, classical music: these are all ways to reestablish a national identity. But there’s another, folksier side to Latvian culture. By day, the streets of Riga’s Old Town are crowded not with clubgoers but with the stalls of countrywomen selling traditional crafts: amber, linen, knitwear, beeswax products. More flavors of Latvia are offered at the vast Central Market, housed in a set of former Zeppelin hangars near the train station: smoked fish thrust into a bucket like dried flowers; huge wheels of the sweetish, dark rye bread called laci; traditional dairy products like cannabis butter and the caraway cheese that’s eaten on Midsummer Eve. Midsummer, or Jani, is a huge celebration that empties out Riga as everyone goes to the country to join in song and much Latvian beer. Worried that such traditions might fade in a consumer-oriented society, the Latvian government recently instituted free workshops to teach or remind people how the festival is celebrated. So what, in the new Latvia, should take priority: the All-Latvian Song and Dance Festival, a huge event drawing thousands of Latvian singers from around the world every five years (the next is in 2008), or the furtherance of a struggling classical music scene? Ms. Demakova, the culture minister, is bent on establishing a new chamber orchestra, but some Latvian musicians question whether there are enough qualified players, in a country of 2.2 million, to support it. The lure of higher salaries draws the best musicians abroad; and the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra already employs a full complement of players, for a season of only a few concerts a year. The answer will lie in the hands of whoever has the vision and energy to come up with a new set of rules. At the Latvian National Symphony Orchestra, the latest candidate is a clarinet player named Ints Dalderis, formerly the orchestra manager of the opera orchestra, who was appointed to the symphony to achieve there the kind of results Mr. Zagars has gotten at the opera. It’s a tall order — or a stimulating challenge for a young Latvian helping to guide his country’s new direction. “The exciting thing about working here,” Mr. Dalderis said, “is that things can change so fast. If I went to play in a German orchestra, everything would be fixed for three years; there would be no surprises. Here, I feel I can really make a difference.” Flights to Riga from New York involve changing in Europe. Continental out of Newark with a transfer in Brussels starts at about $1,000 in early August, for example. Ryanair advertises flights for $16 from Stansted, serving London, starting in September. Riga’s top-of-the-line boutique hotel is the (83/85 Elizabetes Iela, in Berga Bazars, 371-777-0900, www.hotelbergs.lv, $200 to $375), designed by a leading Latvian architect.

To the Editor: I read “ ” (front page, Oct. 6) with mixed feelings.

692-> From the Top: Five, Six, Seven, Eight!
For five thrilling, fleeting minutes, it’s heaven on Broadway, one of those hallowed occasions in theater when anxious expectation is transformed in a heartbeat into sweet consummation. What occurs shortly after 8 p.m. at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, where the otherwise pedestrian new revival of “A Chorus Line” opened last night, is a sort of time bending that Einstein would have trouble explaining. Light, music and a mass of bodies in motion combine to allow you to exist both in 1975, when this musical was first staged, and 2006. This what “A Chorus Line” was when I saw it in 31 years ago, and yet it feels so fresh that you stop to catch your breath. The ecstasy of this “Chorus Line” — which in its first incarnation ran on Broadway from 1975 to 1990 and won pretty much every award on offer — arrives and departs prematurely, as that introductory rush of timelessness congeals into a time warp. Watching the show, directed by Bob Avian, is like drinking from a pitcher of draft beer: You never repeat the tang or sting of that first swig. But since that initial swallow is so ambrosial let us savor it. Because anyone who wants to know why “A Chorus Line” was such a big deal when it opened at the Public Theater, then called the New York Shakespeare Festival, in 1975 (where I saw it in previews as a college student) need only experience the first scene of this revival. Just what is it that’s happening up there, when the lights come up? A lot of dancers in rehearsal clothes are trying out new steps for an audition for a show. So what? Isn’t this the stuff of corny old backstage movie musicals? But there’s a merciless intensity about this scene, both exciting and scary. These kids are as tight and vibrant as newly plucked violin strings. And though there are more than two dozen of them, in just a few minutes you’ve become aware of every one as an individual, with the potential to soar or snap. Creating that awareness was the original goal of Michael Bennett, the great choreographer and director who shaped “A Chorus Line” from a series of taped interviews with seasoned dancers. Collaborating with his co-choreographer, Mr. Avian, the composer Marvin Hamlisch, the lyricist Edward Kleban and the librettists James Kirkwood and Nicholas Dante, Mr. Bennett sought to paint in kinetic strokes a group portrait in which each subject came, if only briefly, into detailed focus, like the inhabitants of densely peopled canvases by Velazquez or Rembrandt. What gave Mr. Bennett’s exercise its special sentimental wallop was that his inspiration was people who generally registered onstage as a shiny, anonymous throng: human scenery with flexible limbs and rhythm. “A Chorus Line” shined a spotlight (literally and figuratively) on the components of this dancing machine, as the show’s director (and Mr. Bennett’s alter ego) interrogated the finalists, unearthing the kinds of confessions usually reserved for psychiatrists’ couches. The paradox of this production is that, from that opening scene onward, the characters never register more fully as individuals than when they’re dancing in an ensemble. It’s when they step forward to tell their stories that they turn into types. The line, in this instance, is stronger than its parts. As Zach (Michael Berresse), the show’s director and ersatz Freudian analyst, and Larry (Tyler Hanes), his assistant, lead their auditioners through increasingly elaborate routines, the fascination is in the tension of the dancers trying (and often failing) to become the dance. Baayork Lee, who was Mr. Bennett’s dance captain on (and a cast member of) the original “Chorus Line,” seamlessly recreates his self-anatomizing choreography. It’s stream-of-consciousness dancing; we can hear the performers’ self-correcting, self-assuring thoughts as they go through their paces. These numbers still brim with vicarious anxiety and exhilaration, neatly captured by the melody-warping dissonance of Mr. Hamlisch’s score (using the original orchestration by Jonathan Tunick, Bill Byers and Hershy Kay with minor changes). But if much of the dancing feels newly reborn, the rest of the show feels recycled. The producer, John Breglio, has assembled as much of the original creative team as possible, starting with Mr. Avian and Ms. Lee. Theoni V. Aldredge’s costumes are almost exactly as I remember them from 30 years ago, as is Robin Wagner’s rehearsal-studio-of-the-mind set. (Natasha Katz has adapted Tharon Musser’s original lighting design.) Since “A Chorus Line” left Broadway only 16 years ago, to have it return more or less exactly as it was makes it feel like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again. Now isn’t one of the points of “A Chorus Line” that musicals are not machines? It doesn’t feel fair to the cast members to have them stand in the same poses and the same clothes as their predecessors, on whom the roles were custom-fitted. The original performers of “A Chorus Line” were playing parts inspired by their own reminiscences or those of people they knew. “All that background was fabulous for the show,” said Donna McKechnie (the original Cassie), in “On the Line,” an invaluable backstage account of the making of show. “That’s why the original cast could never be replaced. Not just because of us individuals but because sharing all of that background enriched our performances.” That many of the dancers had little previous experience in acting turned out to be an asset. The dynamic of the director Zach’s manipulating their characters into self-revelation mirrored the often uncomfortable relationship of Mr. Bennett with his cast. There was a rawness in those performances that personalized the show’s sentimental clichés, which could sometimes seem as quaint as the backstage scenes in “42nd Street.” With only a few exceptions the current cast members have yet to forge intimate connections with their characters. By and large they’re bright, personable and cute as the dickens, which would be fine for “Fame: The Musical,” the synthetic cousin of “A Chorus Line.” It’s hard to separate professional shtick from their private selves, which defeats the show’s purpose. Consider, for example, the roles that won Tonys for their originators. As the sardonic Sheila (created by Kelly Bishop, who won for best supporting actress in a musical), Deidre Goodwin captures (and heightens) the memorable armor of insolence but fails to convey the essential woundedness beneath. Jason Tam is ingratiatingly boyish, younger-brotherish and strangely unsullied as Paul, who tells the agonized story of his humiliating stint in a drag show in a monologue that brought shattered audiences to tears when Sammy Williams delivered it (winning best supporting actor). Charlotte d’Amboise would seem to be a natural for the central role of Cassie, the talented dancer (and former lover of Zach) who is trying to return to the chorus after failing as an actress. Like Ms. McKechnie, who won her Tony for best actress in the part, Ms. d’Amboise is a dancer of distinctive elegance who has never achieved first-tier musical stardom. But whereas Ms. McKechnie exuded a heartbreaking eagerness to please, Ms. d’Amboise registers a sharp, tough cookie who is perfectly capable of looking after herself. She is excellent in the group scenes, when you can sense Cassie’s nervousness in struggling to fit in. But there’s little sense of desperation now in Cassie’s big solo, “The Music and the Mirror.” Mr. Beresse seems so sinister and robotic in coaxing the dancers into psychological stripteases that he’s like Werner Erhard with a songbook. It’s a hard part to get right, but couldn’t it have at least the perfume of humanity? (It feels telling that Mr. Hamlisch’s score sounds freshest at its creepiest, in those sustained brassy vamps that suggest human beings morphing into automatons). Ken Alan achieves a winning nervous narcissism as Bobby. But the one performer who unconditionally owns her role is Jessica Lee Goldyn, who as Val sings “Dance: Ten; Looks: Three,” an ode to the career-enhancing benefits of plastic surgery. Strutting her chassis with a breasts-forward walk, and speaking like someone who decided as a child that her role models would be Bond girls, Ms. Goldyn creates a deliciously credible study in self-invention. Breast augmentation, of course, happens to be a subject that has only gained in topicality. But even the stale blame-the-parents group-therapy-style revelations could still work if we felt the characters’ pain. The show’s power anthem, “What I Did for Love” (led in serviceably solid voice by Natalie Cortez), sounds as pop-pretty as ever. But for the song to stir, you need to believe that each of the people singing it is, as it were, on the line. You can still sense the urgency that once propelled “A Chorus Line” in some of the ensemble pieces. But in providing us with an archivally and anatomically correct reproduction of a landmark show, its creators neglected to restore its central nervous system and, most important, its throbbing heart.

Joseph Kaiser, 39, and Trish Abbot, 39, art directors in Los Angeles Palm Springs, Calif. 3-bedroom house Joseph: A few years ago, we developed an interest in midcentury modern architecture. We loved the simplicity and well-thought-out floor plans of the houses designed by Donald Wexler in Palm Springs. About two and a half years ago, I saw this one online. It was the ugliest mess I’d ever seen. Out of sheer morbid curiosity, I had to see it. It was even worse than we’d expected. The house was surrounded by crazy overgrown plantings, endless junk, clutter and old tires. But you know you’ve found a good house when you and your partner give each other the eye. We bought it on the spot. Trish: It may have been the fastest renovation in history. We went through there in less than six months. We hired someone to clear the brush, scrape off the cottage-cheese ceiling, pull up the dirty carpet and jackhammer the crumbling concrete patio around the pool. Every Friday, we’d race up to check on the progress. It was like an art project. We’d get ideas from architecture books, then go on eBay and to thrift shops to restore the original aesthetic. Joseph: And during all this, we planned a wedding. Trish: Imagine, we’re still married! Joseph: Then we learned that Jack La Lanne used to cruise by the dilapidated property because it had once been his house. I e-mailed him some pictures and told him we’d bought the house. They mailed us a mounted collage of Jack back in the day, wearing his suit and belt, with a note thanking us for taking care of the house.

699-> The Mall Is an Armory Where Zombies Roam
I NEVER realized how many deadly weapons were lying around shopping malls until the zombies came. The sports store had baseball bats and hockey sticks, and the hardware store had crowbars and chainsaws. At a snack shop, I discovered that pouring cooking oil on the floor would cause zombies to slip and slide helplessly. Even items left behind by janitors came in handy; a bucket could be shoved on a zombie’s head, blinding it, and a lawnmower left on the grounds mowed more than grass. Then there is the gun shop. In Capcom’s action game Dead Rising, almost everything is a weapon, including mall benches, mannequin arms, stuffed animals and wire hangers. Not that beating a zombie with a stuffed animal is very effective, but you can do it. The game begins as Frank West, a photojournalist, arrives by helicopter in a small town that has been sealed off by the National Guard. The game begins, not with killing zombies, but with photographing them; one can unlock new skills through points awarded for photos of zombie hordes, imperiled humans or the cleavage of scantily clad female zombies. To get the story, Frank lands on the roof of a shopping mall and tells his pilot to return in 72 hours. The mall is teeming with slow, shambling zombies who ignore Frank until he is a few feet away and then attack with surprising swiftness. Frank can often zigzag past them, but if his path is blocked, he must charge through with a knife, a shotgun or even a soccer ball, which when kicked will bounce from one zombie to the next. As weapons break with use, Frank must grab whatever is handy, like frying pans or brooms. While many video games pride themselves on the canny artificial intelligence of their monsters, Dead Rising’s zombies are amusingly stupid and will simply walk off platforms or take pratfalls down stairs. Unfortunately, that same stupidity is present in the nonzombified mall dwellers Frank must save. Some must be carried, some must be led by the hand and some can use weapons, but all are idiots who will inexplicably stop in a semicircle of zombies, ignoring an easy escape until it is too late. The carnage has driven some survivors mad, and these “psychopaths” go after you with homicidal glee. Apparently madness makes people virtually invincible; many villains can take 30 bullets in the chest before dying. Frank locates psychopaths and other survivors through the constant cellphone updates from a helpful janitor, Otis. By constant, I mean the phone rings about every 15 seconds throughout the game, which is incredibly annoying, especially since Otis often appears to be calling just to repeat a previous message. I say “appears” because Otis’s dialogue, like that of the survivors, is text only, and is done in type so small I could not quite read it. Game programmers working on the best equipment often use text that is hard to read on my aging TV, but the advent of the HDTV-compatible Xbox 360 has made things worse, as designers playing on large-screen, high-definition monitors are not able to see a problem with using small type. The greatest frustration in Dead Rising is not the tiny text but the game’s unusual structure, which is also, oddly enough, one of the most interesting things about it. The game takes place in real time, with events in the game happening at specific times, when Frank must be in the right location. So if you want to go vanquish a psychopath and save a few survivors, you need to make sure you can make it back to the right location in time for the event. You can save your progress at only a handful of specified locations. Most games give you multiple save slots, allowing you to try something tricky and, if it doesn’t work, go back to a safe time, but Dead Rising gives you only a single save slot. If you save your progress, then find that it is impossible to reach the next key event in time, you simply have to start the game over. There are a lot of places to explore and a lot of things to try in the game, but the save structure makes experimentation very costly. Each time you start over, though, it will be a little easier, because as Frank saves people and takes pictures, he becomes stronger and faster, and when you die, you can restart the game with all the upgrades you have earned intact. This makes for a fascinating but infuriating experience reminiscent of the movie “Groundhog Day”; you have to keep reliving the same three days over and over, each time saving a few more people and killing a few more psychopaths until you perfect your game. Like most games from Capcom, Dead Rising is clearly designed by and for hard-core gamers who enjoy perfecting their skills by playing a game to death. I would unhesitatingly recommend the game to such players. But I would also recommend it to people who are put off by the idea of having to play the game and individual sections of it over and over (although they may want to wait until they can buy it cheap on eBay). Dead Rising is so much fun at its best that it sort of makes up for its many, many aggravations. When some people hear that a game lets you run down zombies with a lawnmower, they will be desperate to play it, but other gamers will be just as desperate to avoid it. The latter might prefer Eets, an adorable puzzle game from Klei Entertainment. Eets is an odd little creature who must navigate a series of floating platforms to collect puzzle pieces. To get Eets past obstacles, the player must carefully place and use explosive mushrooms, gravity pills that allow Eets to walk upside down and whales that can suck up objects and shoot them out their spouts. The game is reminiscent of the Incredible Machines puzzle games, which required players to build Rube Goldberg-style contraptions. The difference is Eets, whose abilities are affected by his emotions: an angry Eets can leap huge chasms, a fearful Eets refuses to jump at all. You can manipulate his mood in various ways; pelting him with chips from a chocolate cloud will make him angry, while eating chocolate chips will make him happy. The game gives players as many wondrous ways to move Eets as Dead Rising gives players ways to kill zombies; there are platforms that are affected by Eets’s moods, angry but easily distracted robots and irritable pigs that shoot out explosive baby pigs. The designers of both games were clearly having fun, and whether you are shooting mood-altering mushrooms out of a whale’s spout or beating zombies senseless with a giant stuffed teddy bear, it’s all about having fun.

702-> Graffiti Movies; Birth of a Movement
To the Editor: S. T. Vanairsdale's article "Graffiti Cinema Turns Moody" [Oct. 15] failed to note that the first documentary film dealing with New York's subway graffiti was my "Stations of the Elevated," filmed in 1977. It was released in 1980 and shown at the 1981 New York Film Festival. It was this film, first shown at the Mannheim Film Festival, that "helped make the nascent graffiti movement a subject of fascination around the world." It has had a long life; next spring it will be rereleased on DVD together with my new follow-up film, "Spray Masters," which presents the key writers of the time and their work today.

703-> Vengerov, Fresh From His Sabbatical, Returns to Carnegie Hall
Last year the hyperkinetic Siberian violinist Maxim Vengerov did what more topflight soloists should do from time to time: he took a sabbatical. Well, sort of. He had big plans for learning to play jazz violin, to dance the tango and to ride a Harley-Davidson. Word has it he accomplished the first two of the three. And what's more, taking time away from the concert circuit seemed to pay off musically, at least judging from his appearance with the New York Philharmonic last month. Under the baton of Mstislav Rostropovich, he blazed through Shostakovich's First Violin Concerto, matching his usual technical excellence with what seemed like a newfound maturity and self-possession, a penetrating depth of expression that this listener had not heard before in his playing. Naturally that concerto performance ratcheted up expectations for his Carnegie Hall recital on Saturday night, but unfortunately they were not quite met. Accompanied by the pianist Lilya Zilberstein, Mr. Vengerov seemed back to his pre-sabbatical self, sailing through works by Mozart, Beethoven, Prokofiev and Shostakovich with gleaming technique and his familiar extroverted style. But that extra incandescence and deeper probing quality in his playing proved elusive. Even so, well before Mr. Vengerov took time off, he was one of the most popular young violinists of the day, and his recital offered plenty of reminders why. Opening his program, he effortlessly unspooled Mozart's Adagio in E (K. 261) with long lines and a pure, silken tone. A vigorous, well-profiled reading of Beethoven's Violin Sonata No. 7 followed, even if a broader interpretive vision, shared by violinist and pianist, was not always clear. Prokofiev's savagely dark Violin Sonata No. 1 should have been the keystone work on this recital, and while Mr. Vengerov tore into the wild second movement with impressive power, the piece overall fell short of the bone-chilling extremes to which it can be taken. It didn't help that Ms. Zilberstein was at times overly assertive, covering Mr. Vengerov in some of the first movement's would-be haunting passages, like the hushed shivery scales that the composer famously likened to "wind in a graveyard." Their reading of the finale also could have benefited from more unity of intention and execution. Mr. Vengerov closed the program with a handful of vivid, seldom-heard piano preludes by Shostakovich (Op. 34), transcribed by Dmitri Tziganov. The violinist's lightness of touch and virtuoso flair drew a lively ovation from the crowd, and he responded with two encores, including Kreisler's "Liebesfreud," played with elegance and poise. The grateful audience listened intently; no one seemed in a hurry to leave.

705-> A Contrast in Ideologies (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “Fathers Defeated, Democratic Sons Strike Back” (front page, Aug. 14): Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a potential 2008 presidential candidate, is mistaken if he thinks that “it shouldn’t be about ideology.” Ideology is what the Democrats lost so long ago. That ideology should be every bit as compelling, more so, than that of the Republicans. Jack Carter, a candidate for the Senate in Nevada, hints at the key when he suggests that the ideology should contrast itself to that of the Republicans by actually embracing the values and concerns of the majority of Americans instead of just saying so.

706-> Profit Up at Safeway
Safeway, the nation’s third-largest grocer, posted a 42 percent rise in quarterly profit yesterday, matching expectations, but its shares fell as the growth failed to surpass forecasts. The company said it was comfortable with analysts’ average profit forecast for the year, an estimate that is within the company’s previous forecast range. Shares of Safeway closed down 42 cents, at $29.11. The results came two days after the second-largest grocer, Supervalu, said its quarterly profit almost quadrupled after an acquisition. The nation’s biggest grocery chain is the Kroger Company. Safeway’s profit rose to $173.5 million, or 39 cents a share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 9, from $122.5 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier.

707-> Looking to ’08 Games, Super 8 Expands in China
Super 8 Hotels is getting ready for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. Last month, the company, owned by Wyndham Worldwide, opened six franchise hotels in China, including three in Beijing. Now, having just signed up its 100th hotel in 54 cities (34 of which are open), Super 8 has become the largest foreign economy hotel operator in mainland China. With more than 500,000 overseas visitors and one million domestic tourists predicted for the 2008 Olympic Summer Games, Super 8 is aiming at the midmarket traveler in China. “There is a good array of high-end hotels here,” said Mitchell A. Presnick, chief executive officer of Super 8 China. “What they need for the Olympics is more economy hotels, and we are hoping to support Beijing in their efforts by getting as many of them open as we can.” Yet there may be a need for more high-end hotels too. Of the 1.5 million anticipated visitors, 50,000 are meant to be Olympic corporate sponsors who are expecting to be housed in luxury hotels during their stay. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Trade counts 570,000 available beds in the entire city, nearly a million short. Those ready to reserve their Olympics rooms today might want to call the Beijing Peninsula, near Tiananmen Square. It recently underwent a $34 million renovation, and now has the Peninsula Arcade, with 50 designer stores, as well as a spa and fitness center. The Web site is www.beijingpeninsula.com.

708-> Manhattan: Helping Teachers Buy Homes
Two banks, the teachers union and a community organization, Acorn, announced yesterday what they described as a new program offering low-cost mortgages, grants for down payments and closing costs, and other assistance to help New York City school teachers buy homes in the city. Officials from Citibank, Bank of America, the United Federation of Teachers and New York Acorn said they were loosening the eligibility guidelines for several home-buying assistance programs. That would enable teachers making as much as 165 percent of the area median income, or $117,000 for a family of four, to qualify for low-interest mortgages, mortgage-insurance waivers and the down-payment and closing-cost grants.

710-> Soaking Away Troubles in a Spa’s Hot Spring
One guaranteed way to chill out these days is in a hot spring at a thermal spa. One of the latest to open is the Thermae Bath Spa in Bath, England, next door to the city’s famous excavated Roman baths. The spa (www.thermaebathspa.com), whose water naturally bubbles up at a steamy 113 degrees Fahrenheit, has two outdoor baths and two indoor pools (one enclosed by a glass cube) and offers treatments like watsu, massage therapy in the water, and dry flotation, relaxation body-wrap treatments on water cushions. Guests can enjoy a two-hour spa session for £19, about $35, at $1.89 to the pound, or opt for one of the resort’s spa packages, which include facials and massages, and range from £58 for two hours, to full-day sessions at £195, complete with a two-course lunch. The modern spa at the Hotel Therme in the Alpine village of Vals, Switzerland, was designed by Peter Zumthor using 60,000 slabs of quartzite stone. The spa (www.therme-vals.ch), which has the only mineral thermal spring in the area, also has six lighted indoor and outdoor pools — both hot and cold — Jacuzzis and treatment rooms. Six million liters of geothermal seawater is the attraction at the Blue Lagoon, a popular spa in Iceland (www.bluelagoon.com). A waterfall, a lava cave, a steam bath and boxes of white silica mud (for exfoliation treatments) are also available. New showers and a new restaurant, built into the surrounding lava cliffs, are scheduled to open before spring, part of a redesign that will enlarge the entire complex by 100 percent. Closer to home, in California, is the Hope Springs Resort (www.hopespringsresort.com), which has only 10 rooms but 3 mineral pools. The resort, a celebration of the midcentury modern esthetic, is 20 minutes from Palm Springs. Rooms start at $175 and spa treatments at $85.

712-> Moons of Pluto Renamed
Two small moons of Pluto, formerly known as S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2, now have the names Hydra and Nix. In May 2005, astronomers discovered the two moons, each probably less than 100 miles wide, using the Hubble Space Telescope. In Greek mythology, Pluto is the god of the underworld, so the discoverers proposed as names for the moons Hydra, the serpent with nine heads, and Nyx, the goddess of darkness. The International Astronomical Union in Paris, which governs astronomical nomenclature, changed Nyx to Nix because an asteroid had already been named Nyx.

713-> Pay for the Music, the Lights Are Included
Massive Attack stayed in the shadows for most of its hypnotic performance at Roseland on Wednesday, the second show of a three-night run. The spectacular light show was the real star, adding another layer of emotion to the band’s enigmatic beatscapes. Twenty towering columns of small lights flickered abstractly in beautiful patterns, then suddenly approximated a silvery city skyline, or a nation’s flag. During the thudding climax of “Angel,” a sinister love song, from 1998, about a woman who can “neutralize every man in sight,” the lights morphed into glimmering orange flames. For their first shows in New York in eight years, the founding members Robert Del Naja and Grant Marshall (a third partner, Mushroom, left in the 90’s) brought a full live band that included two drummers and the former collaborators Horace Andy, the reggae star, and Elizabeth Fraser, the ex-vocalist of the Cocteau Twins. Massive Attack, which formed in Bristol, England, in the late 80’s, is credited with spawning the trip-hop genre, thanks to its fusion of rap, electronica, dub and R&B: ghostly, seductive sounds over sleepy beats. By its 1998 album, “Mezzanine,” the band had incorporated a menacing goth-rock edge, which set the tone for Wednesday’s stunning set. Spaced-out dub grooves like “Karmacoma,” from “Protection” (1994), were given metallic, guitar driven makeovers. The uplifting soul of “Unfinished Sympathy,” from “Blue Lines” (1991), gradually transformed into an apocalyptic wall of sound, propelled by a mix of thunderous live drums and programmed beats. But the band didn’t mess with the ethereal nature of Ms. Fraser’s songs. “She sings like an angel,” Mr. Del Naja said as he introduced her. During the shimmering “Teardrop,” she sang shyly with her head bowed and her hands clasped behind her back, but her voice sounded huge. Toward the end of the evening Mr. Del Naja, an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, said dryly that this is the part “where we talk about politics, et cetera, et cetera.” He mentioned the situation in Darfur and Tony Blair, but he spoke so quietly and quickly it was hard to understand him. Then the lights eloquently took over. As the guest vocalist Deborah Miller belted the mournful “Safe From Harm,” from 1991, they shifted into Times Square-style news tickers, with statistics about Iraq scrolling by in enormous red figures: the number of people killed, the cost of the war in money. “You can free the world, you can free my mind/Just as long as my baby’s safe from harm tonight,” Ms. Miller sang. The statistics rolled by faster and faster, until they became a blood-red blur.

718-> Invaders at the Gate, and Slipping Past It
A previously little-seen type of spam, containing images that foil many filters, now makes up roughly a third of all spam handled by the e-mail monitoring company Postini, which processes some 1.3 billion messages a day. So-called image spam consists of a digital image, or a constellation of images, generally depicting a page of text with a spamlike message — exhorting recipients to buy a stock, for example. Since the message is conveyed in an image, it eludes spam filters that are designed to scan only a message’s text. Some filters try to compensate by scanning e-mailed pictures for images of text. But the process is slow, and spammers make this difficult by lacing the messages with eccentricities like colored letters or unseen images that swirl in the background. A side effect has been to drive up sharply the size, in bytes, of the spam that e-mail providers must handle. The volume of spam filtered by Postini has more than doubled since October 2005, rising 128 percent. But the size of that spam has risen 227 percent.

719-> Arts, Briefly; Spider-Man Unmasked
"My name is Peter Parker, and I've been Spider-Man since I was 15 years old." This is just part of the speech the web-spinning superhero delivers in the second issue of Civil War, a mini-series from Marvel Comics. Normally, nothing comes between a superhero and his secret identity. But in this case, Spider-Man, right, wants to make a point: that he will support the government's Superhuman Registration Act in the hope of once again gaining public trust for heroes. The act was passed after the reckless behavior of a group of glory-seeking young heroes caused hundreds of civilian casualties. Spider-Man's revelation is "not a dream sequence," said Joe Quesada, Marvel's editor in chief. He described "Civil War" as a "story-driven event" that would affect the heroes for years to come. The immediate follow-up to Spider-Man's revealing his identity will come in Amazing Spider-Man No. 533 and Civil War: Front Line No. 2, both on sale June 28. GEORGE GENE GUSTINES

720-> Clinton Is the Life of the Democratic Party
WASHINGTON, June 5 — In what promises to be his most intensive campaign season since he left office, former President Bill Clinton is scheduled to appear at more than two dozen fund-raisers for Democrats around the country, hoping to collect at least $20 million for his party's drive to recapture Congress. "In contrast to Republican candidates who are running away from George Bush, our candidates are clamoring for him in every part of the country," said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, Tracey Schmitt, said President Bush was very much in demand this campaign season, noting that he had appeared at 37 fund-raising events that had raised nearly $125 million since the beginning of 2005. Ms. Schmitt also took a jab at Democrats, criticizing them as relying on the assistance of a politician no longer in office. "Given the current lineup of Democratic leaders in Washington," she said, "it's no surprise that many Democrats would turn to Bill Clinton for help." Mr. Clinton's advisers say he is entirely motivated by his desire to resurrect his party's political fortunes. "President Clinton's goal here is helping Democrats win in 2006 to put Congress in the hands of the party that will get the country back on the right track," said Jay Carson, a spokesman for Mr. Clinton. Yet there is another potential beneficiary of his largess: his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is running for re-election in New York this year. Should Mrs. Clinton decide to run for president in 2008, some Democrats who reap the benefits of her husband's fund-raising this fall may feel a loyalty to him that could extend to her. In the coming weeks, for example, Mr. Clinton plans to appear at a fund-raiser for Democrats in New Hampshire, an important presidential primary state that his wife has avoided so as not to fuel speculation about any presidential ambitions. Mr. Clinton has already made a series of appearances on behalf of other Democrats. One was at an event in New York a few weeks ago that raised $1.5 million for the Democratic National Committee, whose fund-raising lags behind that of the Republican National Committee by about $72 million in the current campaign season. In the last week, Mr. Clinton made five appearances, collecting $3.5 million in visits to Arizona, California and Maine. He has also taken time to help his wife, appearing at several events for her in recent weeks that brought in $1.5 million, his office said. (In all, he has raised $3.4 million for Mrs. Clinton in the current election cycle.) That said, Mrs. Clinton is a fund-raising machine in her own right, and her efforts on behalf of the Democratic Party have made her a popular headliner among Democrats nationwide. She has helped the party and its candidates raise about $55 million since taking office in 2001. Mr. Clinton's office says he also intends to appear on behalf of Democratic candidates for governor around the nation. He is scheduled to appear in nine states but is likely to add more as the campaign season heats up, his office says. Democrats need to pick up 15 seats to win control of the House and six to capture the Senate. Mr. Clinton's aides say he believes the Democrats are in their best position in years to retake control of Congress. But Republicans and many analysts say his emergence in the 2006 campaign also comes at a time when Democrats are still trying to find galvanizing themes to pull together the disparate elements of their party. Mr. Clinton was a tireless fund-raiser throughout his time in the White House. And despite his busy summer schedule, his office said, he also plans to continue focusing his energies on the Clinton Foundation, the nonprofit organization he set up to work on issues including AIDS, poverty, childhood obesity, and religious and racial reconciliation. In some places, Mr. Clinton plans to squeeze political and foundation work into the same trips. He will appear at the New Hampshire fund-raiser, for instance, after attending an event highlighting childhood obesity with Dr. Susan Lynch, a pediatrician and the wife of Gov. John Lynch. Mr. Clinton's fund-raising schedule has included states with competitive races, like Arizona, where Democratic efforts to unseat Senator Jon Kyl, the two-term incumbent Republican, could prove crucial to the party's goal of recapturing the Senate. Mr. Kyl's Democratic challenger, Jim Pederson, a wealthy shopping mall developer, said in an interview that Mr. Clinton's presence in the state had helped elevate the profile of his campaign. "I think people will stand up and take notice," said Mr. Pederson, whose campaign collected $500,000 at a recent event featuring Mr. Clinton. The former president also plans to appear in Denver at a June 16 fund-raiser for Senator Robert Menendez, who faces a strong challenge in New Jersey. Mr. Menendez said in an interview that he had asked Mr. Clinton to headline the event — which was being set up by his colleague from Colorado, Senator Ken Salazar — when he learned that Mr. Clinton would be in town that day. Mr. Menendez estimated that the former president's presence would increase the total proceeds of the event by about 50 percent. "He is of enormous value to Democrats," Mr. Menendez said.

721-> Pods in the Living Room and Soaking Tubs Outside
I HAVE always been attracted to new solutions to the age-old problems of space planning. Where does one put the kitchen? How big can the bathroom be? How can one maximize storage space? And is it possible to add a bit of charm and romance to what could otherwise be a dry contemporary interior? So, having heard that there was something clever going on at Jade, a 57-unit condo conversion at 16 West 19th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Manhattan, and that Philippe Starck had a part in it, I was curious to take a look. I met Marci Sutin Levin, an executive vice president of Shvo Marketing, in the sales office. Expecting a cool modernist space, I was surprised to find soft seating, a pink and beige Moroccan carpet and Moroccan lanterns that cast romantic shadows even at 9 a.m. While Mr. Starck was somewhat involved (more on that later), it is Jade Jagger (jewelry designer daughter of Mick and Bianca) who is being touted as the condominium’s creative spirit. “The idea is to experience Jade as a brand,” Ms. Levin said while handing me a bottle of water with a label that reads “Live Jade Jagger Style, Ibiza, New York, London.” The location of the 14-story building, Ms. Levin explained, is “Central Chelsea.” “It’s near the Flatiron District,” she said, “but it has the look and feel of a Chelsea mentality.” “And,” Ms. Levin continued, “the building is dedicated to a fairly young denominator, someone in their mid-20’s to late 30’s.” Although that eliminated me as a tenant, I was still eager to take the tour and get in sync with Ms. Jagger’s sense of trendy sophistication, which comes with quite a hefty price tag. The units range from $550,000 for a 460-square-foot studio, with an estimated monthly common charge of $431.91 and estimated monthly taxes of $397.24; to $3.7 million for a three-bedroom, three-bath, 1,822-square-foot penthouse, with a 635-square-foot terrace and a common charge of $2,012.61 and taxes of $2,672.36. An 896-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bath apartment on the fourth floor is $945,000 and has an $841.29 common charge and $682.54 in real estate taxes. With her design partner, Tom Bartlett, Ms. Jagger worked for Yoo, a company with offices in London and New York that specializes in large residential projects and is headed by John Hitchcox and Mr. Starck. There’s the connection. “Jade has homes in Ibiza and London, and this is her first residential project,” Ms. Levin said. Wondering exactly what an English residence or a house on a Spanish island had to do with a Manhattan conversion, I followed Ms. Levin into the adjacent room to experience Ms. Jagger’s point of view as she starred in an audiovisual presentation that was projected on the room’s four walls. “Jade is with us for the duration of the sales office experience,” Ms. Levin said, as I saw Ms. Jagger, accompanied by a tune she produced, smoothly breeze through a video that includes a glimpse of the condo’s future sexy communal space on the 13th and 14th floors that will be landscaped with exotic plants and equipped with soaking tubs and an entertainment center. “Customers love walking around with her,” Ms. Levin added. I was sort of getting into it, especially when I started to hear about the heart of the matter: The perfect pod (described as a “jewel box” or a “fabulous suitcase”) is a cubelike structure that incorporates a mosaic-tiled bathroom, a sleek kitchen (with Miele and Sub-Zero appliances), a closet and a washer-dryer. When closed, the pod looks like an architectural cube set down in your living space. It comes in four color variations — all of which Ms. Jagger has masterminded — from the gold Luxo to the black and red Baroco. “The pod was conceived for efficiency of space and so that each apartment could have a loftlike feel,” Ms. Levin explained. By this time, the audiovisual had ended and I was spirited into a model apartment where I could see a pod in all its glory. I thought of Mr. Starck and his talent for designing ingenious and charming modern objects (from fly swatters to bowl-shaped sinks), as well as the innovations of Joe Colombo, the extraordinary Italian architect whose 1960’s projects of multifunctional living have never been surpassed. Not at Jade anyway. The model apartment, with its pale ash wood floors and its open bedroom, dining and living areas, and of course its pod, was a pale version of visionary space-age living. There are 22 floor plans from which to choose. (Each apartment comes with a pod in varying dimensions.) The buyer cannot choose the configuration of a pod, only its color. In addition to the two schemes mentioned above, there is also an Aristo pod: pale-blue cabinetry, dark green bathroom tiles and English country overtones (a stretch for me); and the Boho pod: pale lilac, beige and lapis blue tile that reminds Ms. Jagger of the “sea breezes” of her island home. There are examples of the four color variations in an adjoining room. But no substitutions, please. Therein lies the catch. Choosing a color scheme is a pleasant diversion in the game of “Who am I?” But I found it hard to decide if the pod would really solve the problems of urban living in terms of storage and functionality. I would also have trouble choosing an apartment only from its floor plan, trying to visualize the views, or even how it would be to actually live there. All but six units have been sold from the 20 apartments put on sale the last week of June, according to the marketers. A group of 15 units (at increased prices) will be released next week, with the remaining apartments available when these are sold. So maybe the skepticism is only mine. I did say that this building was not for my generation. But, for a few minutes, I succumbed to Ms. Jagger’s virtual spell. That was sort of fun after all.

The fire marshal who inspected a nightclub a few months before a fire there killed 100 people said he had failed to notice flammable foam around the stage, because after he saw an exit door that swung the wrong way, “I really didn’t look anywhere” else. A previously unreleased transcript of a state police interview with the former fire inspector, Denis Larocque, was among more than 3,000 pages of evidence made public from the criminal case of the 2003 fire at the Station nightclub in West Warwick. The attorney general’s office expects to release tens of thousands of pages about the case over the next several weeks, said Michael Healey, a spokesman. When fire tore through the single-story wood building on Feb. 20, 2003, the exit door still had not been repaired, prosecutors have said.

730-> THE WEEK; Ramp to Link Taconic With 9A Heading South
Drivers heading south on Route 9A into Mount Pleasant come tantalizingly close to the Taconic State Parkway. But for people hoping to make a quick switch, there is only frustration: They must exit at Route 141, wait at a traffic light and navigate a confusing collection of highway signs before getting to the parkway. Relief is one the way: Construction crews have begun working on a ramp that will provide drivers moving south on Route 9A with a direct connection to the Taconic. A ramp already links the Taconic to 9A heading north. Robert Dennison, the Hudson Valley regional director for the State Department of Transportation, said he expected the connector to shave 10 minutes off the average peak-time commute. The Taconic connects to the Sprain Brook Parkway just south of the planned ramp and provides access to the Westchester Medical Center, the Westchester mall and a network of office parks lining Interstate 287.

731-> ART REVIEW; A Designer's Career, Neatly Packaged
'Raymond Loewy: Designs For a Consumer Culture' History Museum, Long Island Museum of American Art, History and Carriages, 1200 Route 25A, Stony Brook, (631) 751-0066. Through May 21. Although Raymond Loewy has been dead for 20 years, not a day goes by that his presence isn't felt all around us. From the pattern in the Formica breakfast tabletop to the china cup that holds the bedtime cocoa, his designs are everywhere. Name a familiar brand logo and, likely as not, he either dreamed it up or modernized it. In 1949, Life magazine called him the Great Packager. This excellent survey of his career, organized by the Hagley Museum and Library in Wilmington, Del., details Loewy's progress from childhood tinkering to fame and fortune as one of the 20th century's most prominent industrial designers. Born in France in 1893, he came to New York in 1919, just in time to take advantage of the demand for consumer goods that burgeoned after World War I. Together with a small group of innovators (whom he generously credited in a promotional video for Frigidaire), he pioneered the concept of disguising a product's functional parts under a fashionable shell. Thus, when fashions changed, the old model had to go, even though the workings remained serviceable. It did not hurt Loewy's career that he was as suave as the products he designed. But while his Gallic savoir-faire undoubtedly appealed to his corporate clients, his success hinged on knowing what would appeal to average consumers, on the practical and the aesthetic levels. He streamlined everything from locomotives to Coke dispensers, whether or not it made any functional difference, because streamlining is glamorous. But he was also responsible for introducing curved rear windows in cars -- as illustrated by the 1954 Studebaker Champion on display -- to give better visibility, and for sensible improvements like more headroom inside airplanes and smooth kitchen surfaces for easy cleaning. The exhibition includes many examples of how Loewy and his design team shaped American taste. There is plenty of evidence outside the museum, too. If you seek his monument, look around. 'Power Dressing: Men's Fashion and Prestige in Africa' Parrish Art Museum, 25 Job's Lane, Southampton, (631) 283-2118. Through May 28. Organized by the Newark Museum and largely drawn from its own collections, this exhibition surveys styles of male attire in cultures across the continent, from Morocco to South Africa. The material is organized thematically, with items grouped according to function rather than by geography, which makes for some intriguing juxtapositions. In the "Fit for a King" section, for example, one finds everything from beaded slippers to a gilded crown and personal ornaments modeled on European regalia. Informative labels make it clear that all are potent symbols of authority. Although most of the items are based on traditional forms and materials -- like the chief's robe from Ghana, made of kente cloth -- they often incorporate cross-cultural influences. From colonialism to tourism, from tribal hegemony to symbols of pan-African unity, the garments express adaptation to political, social and economic development in Africa over the last century. Among the many fascinating examples of appropriation is a Nigerian white-beaded crown modeled on the wig worn by English barristers. The ruler's exalted status is thus associated with both divine right and judicial authority, implying that the king governs in both spheres. At the opposite social extreme, the elaborate costumes and flamboyant headdresses of Zulu rickshaw drivers allude to their warrior heritage. Like performers in a historical drama, the so-called Rickshaw Boys of modern-day Durban, South Africa, use personal adornment as an affirmation of identity that transcends their humble status, as well as a lure to attract customers. Whether magnificent or mundane, the outfits reflect the many ways in which, to put it in contemporary terms, the clothes make the man. 'There's the Rub' Islip Art Museum, 50 Irish Lane, East Islip, (631) 224-5402. Through June 4. The technique of laying paper over a surface and lifting an impression with a crayon or pencil is traditionally used to collect names from tombstones and images from memorial brasses. But that is not the only way to make a rubbing, as this group show demonstrates. Joy Taylor applies powdered graphite to sheets of polyester film to create delicate layers of stenciled imagery derived from natural objects like leaves. Complex tonal variations are achieved by feathered edges, superimposed forms and cutout overlays, as in "No. 5," which is subtly enhanced by crumpled surfaces and threads that tie the layers together. Like Ms. Taylor, Paul Moran uses rubbing as an additive process, building up modulated atmospheric paintings that exploit the translucency of thinned oil paint. In the spirit of the 19th-century Tonalist painters, but more abstractly, his dreamy canvases evoke imaginary landscapes illuminated by mysterious diffused light. Rubbing may also be reductive, as is the case with Jim Dingilian's smoke drawings on silver trays and dishes. After applying the darkening agent to the surface, the artist erases areas to create imagery that mimics the ephemeral quality of old photographs. These shadowy, enigmatic pictures blend with the metallic background, like fading sensations momentarily emerging from the mist of memory. By impressing the texture of patterned cloth onto thin Japanese paper and adding to and subtracting from the result, James Nelson uses positive and negative rubbing procedures. Darkening some parts with graphite and deleting others, he causes the focus to shift almost imperceptibly from one area to another, enlivening an otherwise uniform surface.

732-> Lessons of Life Interpreted Through Novels
It’s not the kind of notion commonly advanced by an English professor at one of our great universities, and certainly not in an era, even if faintly waning, of steel-springed critical theory. Novels, Edward Mendelson writes, should be interpreted and understood from a personal point of view, and not just historically, thematically or analytically. “A reader who identifies with the characters in a novel is not reacting in a naïve way that ought to be outgrown or transcended, but is performing one of the central acts of literary understanding.” Mr. Mendelson, a Columbia University professor, argues further that literary critics should get in touch with their own feelings. “Criticism is always more memorable, more convincing, more valid, when the critic’s voice is — and sounds like — the personal voice of someone who has learned from unique personal experiences, rather than a dispassionate impersonal voice that sounds like the product of advanced professional training.” Proust scholar: cork-wall your study? Melvillean: sign aboard a Norwegian whaler? Not really, though Mr. Mendelson performs an occasional outsize personal turn in this refreshingly idiosyncratic literary study. His footnote to the denunciation of adultery as murder in “Middlemarch” hazards that nowadays it might serve as a mercy killing to a hopelessly ailing marriage. “The Things That Matter” studies seven classical novels by Mary Shelley, Emily and Charlotte Brontë, George Eliot and Virginia Woolf. The essays mix in a number of specific thoughts about how the novels work with an overarching thesis that surfaces, often engagingly, but not always rigorously, and sometimes arguably. All the authors are women of course. Mr. Mendelson has chosen them, he writes, out of the belief that what is most valuable in literature is not the single individual, but the interweaving of emotions and relationships among a group of people. Because society in the 19th century and much of the 20th tended to treat women impersonally and as a category, it was female writers who were most strongly motivated to explore and develop the personal. It is the personal that Professor Mendelson prizes. He argues that the most honored writers of the 20th century turned to myths and archetypes, elaborating ingenious forms to express them while neglecting human emotion. He would empty the Joyce-Yeats-Eliot pantheon and house Woolf, Auden and Beckett instead. There is a compelling case to be made for Woolf, and the author makes it in his book’s last and most dazzling section. Still, it’s hardly necessary to shove Joyce off his summit to accommodate her. Literary summits are roomy. And to dismiss the personal in “Ulysses” is to pass over the humanity and backchat of its Dublin streets and pubs, let alone “The Dead” and other stories in “Dubliners.” Beckett vis-à-vis Eliot is interestingly suggestive. As for the third pairing, Mr. Mendelson is an Auden specialist, and no doubt Auden comes closer to his criterion. But it surely takes a touch of the tone-deaf to think of Auden’ s poetry rivaling let alone displacing Yeats’s. Mr. Mendelson finds grounds for his suspicion of the heroic male archetype in Shelley’s “Frankenstein.” The protagonist is the extreme of the will to power. Control is the goal of his scientific tinkerings, and to create a life without the communion of sex is to pursue total control. Which, of course, leads to its total and disastrous loss. The rather cloudy essay on “Wuthering Heights” singles out childhood rather than adult love as the passion binding Catherine and Heathcliff. The opposite is true in “Jane Eyre”: Childhood was torment. She rejects Rochester until, an invalid and widower, he can become her husband without threatening her autonomy. “Reader, I married him,” she announces; Mr. Mendelson points out: not, “we were married.” He calls “Middlemarch” the greatest English novel (though considering the whole of their work, he finds Woolf and Dickens the greater novelists). But here, as in some of the previous pieces, he proclaims better than he evokes. He has much to say about the novel, and there’s no reason to doubt his engagement, although the reader may be left feeling as if Mr. Mendelson is even more engaged with the points he has to make. With Virginia Woolf engagement with her books and success in evoking them are virtually absolute. The essays on “Mrs. Dalloway” and “To the Lighthouse,” though relatively brief, manage to seize their heart, brain and radiance. His prismatic evocations of the Mrs. Dalloway who is defined by her position, obligations and party preparations and her inner Clarissa — that essential being she glimpses for a moment at the end, thanks to the suicide of Septimus and the steadfast love of her childhood friend, Peter — implant the life and breath of one masterpiece in a masterly work of criticism. The same magic is worked with Mrs. Ramsay in “Lighthouse.” Professor Mendelson surpasses himself in these final pieces. The highest achievement of literary criticism is to make the reader hunger to go back to the book and reconfirm what has been opened up. And they reconfirm what I suspect: that to read and love Woolf makes me more intelligent, and more aware of what I knew without quite knowing it.

733-> Farmers Vow New Procedures; Bacteria Eyed in Boy’s Death
SALINAS, Calif., Sept. 21 — Amid growing governmental pressure and public concern about an E. coli outbreak caused by tainted spinach, California farmers promised new procedures for growing, handling and shipping their produce on Thursday, even as health officials in Utah said the death of a 2-year-old boy there on may be linked to the bacterium. The boy, Kyle Algood of Chubbuck, Idaho, died from hemolytic-uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure often linked to E.coli, said Ross Mason, a spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. “This child also apparently had consumed some raw spinach in some kind of spinach smoothie that someone made for him,” Mr. Mason said. “That combination leads us to believe he very likely died from E. coli.” Tests for a confirmed cause of death were not complete. The new crop procedures were announced just hours after federal and state health authorities met with hundreds of concerned and occasionally angry farmers crammed into a Farm Bureau office here to offer their help in ending a crisis that is estimated by trade officials to have already cost the spinach industry $50 million. Federal authorities said on Wednesday that they had narrowed the focus of their investigation to nine farms in three California counties — Monterey, Santa Clara and San Benito, all on the Central Coast — but spinach remained off the shelves nationwide. But whether the warning would be lifted soon enough to save what was left of the Salinas Valley crop, or to plant spinach in counties farther south, remained to be seen. Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration, said there was no timetable for lifting the warning, saying it could happen “maybe tomorrow, maybe over the weekend, maybe next week.” Later Thursday, at a news conference here, representatives for two trade groups said the proposed guidelines represented a “war on food-borne illnesses” as well as opportunity to avoid new rules from lawmakers. “Obviously the industry and most of the regulators would like to see us handle it,” said Thomas Nassif, the president of Western Growers, which represents 3,000 farmers and shippers in California and Arizona, who produce about half of the fresh produce in the country. “Sometimes, when you get into legislation, which can be mandatory, it ends up being a political solution rather than a scientific or health-related solution, and that’s what we’d like to avoid.” Mr. Nassif said the guidelines would cover what he called the “the three W’s” of possible contamination: water, work force and wildlife. Among the changes being considered are advanced testing of irrigation water and field soil, more sanitary mechanical harvesters, and even labeling of where specific spinach products were grown. The push for new voluntary guidelines came as federal authorities announced that the outbreak had sickened 157 people, of whom 83 had to be hospitalized, including 27 with serious kidney problems. Speculation continuted about how this virulent strain of E. coli, bacteria in the intestines of many warm-blooded animals, might have entered the food chain. Among possible culprits, food safety experts say, are irrigation water or groundwater that could have been polluted by runoff from dairy farms or cattle ranches, or spread to vegetable fields during floods. But Dr. Acheson said it was “way too early” to focus on water as a culprit. Suspicions about Central Coast farms have been raised before, with eight E. coli outbreaks over the last decade linked to lettuce grown in the Salinas Valley, which is sometimes called “the salad bowl of the world.” Mr. Nassif said he and other trade representatives were aware of the past problems and would be flying to Washington in the next few days to try to complete approval of the guidelines. He said he had been told that the F.D.A. had finished inspections of three or four farms and had yet to find “anything significant.” “If the source is never found,’’ Mr. Nassif said, “it won’t change what we’re going to do. We have to assume that certain aspects of our operations are possible sources. And we have to attack them.”

734-> Merck Loses Protection for Patent on Zocor
This is the day that Merck — and Pfizer — have long dreaded. Today, Merck's cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor loses its United States patent protection, becoming the largest-selling drug yet to be opened to cheap generic competition. That change will cost Merck billions of dollars a year. But it could be nearly as damaging to Pfizer, whose rival cholesterol drug, Lipitor, is the world's most popular medicine, with global sales last year of $12 billion. Now insurers are hoping to convince patients and doctors that cheap clones of Zocor will make full-priced Lipitor an unnecessary luxury. Zocor, which until now has sold for about $3 a daily pill, generated sales last year for Merck of $3.1 billion in the United States and $4.4 billion worldwide. But beginning today, three other drug companies will be legally allowed to sell simvastatin, the active ingredient in Zocor. And starting this December, any company will be allowed to make simvastatin, as long as it can prove that its version is chemically equivalent to Zocor. As a result, the price of a dose of simvastatin will probably drop 30 percent or more in the next few days, and by as much as 90 percent next year, to about 30 cents a pill. Merck has already told insurers that it will cut the price of branded Zocor to be competitive with generic simvastatin, an unusual move that analysts say may cause the price of the generic to fall quickly over the next few months. The falling price of Zocor will save insurers and patients billions of dollars a year — and cost Merck a similar amount. But it may have even more impact on Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, analysts say. Pfizer's Lipitor, which has been comparably priced with Zocor and had United States sales alone of $8 billion, is the most profitable medicine yet invented. Lipitor, whose patent runs until 2011, and Zocor are both statins, drugs that slow the liver's ability to produce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, often called bad cholesterol because it can build up in blood vessels and lead to heart attacks and strokes. In clinical trials, both drugs substantially reduce bad cholesterol, though Lipitor is more potent than Zocor. At its highest dose, Lipitor lowers bad cholesterol by 57 percent, compared with 47 percent for Zocor. But because most patients on statins do not require the highest doses, many doctors consider Zocor comparable to Lipitor. And anticipating the arrival of inexpensive generic versions of Zocor, many insurers in recent months have given Zocor a preferred position, enabling patients to get a month's supply for a co-payment of only $10, while moving Lipitor to a second- or third-tier status, with co-payments of $20 to $35. That strategy by insurers appears to have had an impact on Lipitor's market dominance. In the first quarter, United States sales of Lipitor rose to $1.97 billion, up 3 percent from the period in 2005. But sales of Zocor jumped 13 percent, to $830 million, even though Merck has largely stopped promoting Zocor in advance of the patent expiration. And in terms of new prescriptions, Lipitor's market share has eroded since the beginning of the year, down 4 percentage points of market share, to 35 percent. Meanwhile Zocor has gained 2 points, to 16 percent, according to prescription data from Salomon Smith Barney. That trend may now accelerate, analysts say. "Lipitor is poorly positioned strategically," said Albert Rauch, an industry analyst at A. G. Edwards, a regional brokerage firm based in St. Louis. The challenges go beyond generic Zocor. For years, Pfizer tried to promote Lipitor as the most potent statin, arguing that patients should use the drug that lowered their cholesterol the most, Mr. Rauch said. But now Lipitor faces competition from two drugs that lower cholesterol even more than Lipitor. One is Vytorin, made by Merck and Schering-Plough, which combines Zocor and Zetia, another cholesterol-lowering drug that has a different mechanism of action than statins. Merck is now heavily promoting Vytorin, which had sales of $378 million in the first quarter — about double its sales for the period last year. The other Lipitor challenger is Crestor, a drug from AstraZeneca that is generally considered the most potent statin. As a result, Lipitor is being squeezed between cheap simvastatin and the new, stronger alternatives, Mr. Rauch said. "Some people may want lower cost, some may want higher potency." David S. Moskowitz, an industry analyst at Friedman, Billings Ramsey & Company, said Lipitor would continue to lead the cholesterol-lowering market because it works well and doctors and patients are very familiar with it. But Lipitor will probably lose another 5 to 6 percentage points in market share, Mr. Moskowitz said. Concerns about Lipitor's shrinking share have hit Pfizer's stock, which is down 3 percent this year and near an eight-year low, while the average drug company stock is up 3 percent. Pfizer closed yesterday at $22.65, down 4 cents. Meanwhile, Merck has risen 11 percent this year. To fight back, Pfizer is pointing to data that shows Lipitor's effectiveness in cutting heart attacks and strokes. Since introducing Lipitor a decade ago, Pfizer has conducted more than 400 clinical trials on the drug, said Dr. Michael Berelowitz, a senior vice president at Pfizer. Crestor and Vytorin, the newer statins, have not yet shown that they can reduce heart disease as effectively as Lipitor, Dr. Berelowitz said. "Other agents come in and all they can talk about is that they lower cholesterol and LDL," he said. "They have none of the evidence of cardiovascular risk reduction and mortality risk reduction." And Zocor is simply not as potent as Lipitor, Dr. Berelowitz said. But health insurers argue that most patients do not need the 57 percent reduction in cholesterol that the 80-milligram dose of Lipitor provides. At Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania, which covers about 600,000 people, 81 percent of people taking Lipitor are taking 20 milligrams or less a day. Only 4 percent are taking 80 milligrams, said Frank Koronkiewicz, director of pharmacy management for Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Patients on lower Lipitor doses can easily be switched to Zocor, Mr. Koronkiewicz said. "We believe they're very similar," he said. "Zocor has innumerable studies proving its effectiveness and its safety." At the beginning of 2006, Blue Cross of Northeastern Pennsylvania put Zocor on its first tier of preferred drugs, while switching Lipitor to its third tier. Zocor, as a result, costs patients $10 a month, compared with $35 for Lipitor. The insurer mailed letters to patients taking Lipitor to inform them of the change and encourage them to try Zocor. The results have been striking, Mr. Koronkiewicz said. Since January at the insurer, Lipitor's market share has fallen to 34 percent, down from 55 percent. Zocor's has almost doubled, to 31 percent. "I think there's further room for movement," he said.

738-> A Vote for Draconian Measures
To the Sports Editor: The baseball world continues to grope its way through the steroids morass without a clearly defined end game. Solutions revolve around punishment to a player who tests positive. This approach misses an important aspect of the problem. Taking enhancers benefits the violator as well as his teammates. With a team's success, owners attract more fans, management is viewed as a savvy signer of talent, the news media get to write upbeat stories. Fans celebrate the team's success regardless of how it is earned. In short, cheaters, who take all the risk, are viewed as a positive force for the team. The trick is to change them into a negative one. To do this, athletes who violate drug policies should receive the prescribed suspension, and the team should lose 10 games in the standings. Owners would then instruct general managers to sign only clean players. This solution can work. James K. Collins Ardsley, N.Y.

Executives from manufacturing giants like Caterpillar and Procter & Gamble met with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and other officials who will travel to Beijing next week. The National Association of Manufacturers president said its No. 1 goal was to make progress in the area of China's currency, which American manufacturers believe is undervalued as much as 40 percent, making Chinese goods cheaper for Americans and American products more expensive in China. China announced in 2005 that it would permit its currency to rise in value, but it has risen only slightly against the dollar since then.

748-> Remote Java Villages Still Without Quake Aid
BANTUL, Indonesia, May 30  Three days after a powerful earthquake rocked central Java, many devastated villages within the two worst-hit districts have yet to receive any help, residents said Tuesday. Swarms of aid workers flew into Yogyakarta's airport and descended on the Bantul and Klaten districts, the two most severely damaged areas, causing traffic to be rerouted to ease congestion. But the villages in these districts, a lush farming region south of Yogyakarta, are spread thinly among large rice paddies and connected only by single-lane roads. In one village, Tegal Dowo, residents rooted through rubble in the blazing sun on Tuesday afternoon. They said no relief agencies had yet made contact with them, and they pleaded for help from the international community. "We have barely enough food and supplies to survive," said Iwan, 37, whose village was leveled. "I don't know how to live anymore." Amfani, 40, who pulled his wife out of his wrecked home Saturday morning, only to watch her die by the side of the road, said he was now worried about his two young sons. "Please send money, send food," he said, adjusting his footing as an aftershock rumbled underneath him. "My family is desperate. Our market, our only source of income, was destroyed." The official death toll rose to roughly 5,700, according to news agency reports, with about 15,000 injured and more than 100,000 homeless. Some officials think those numbers will rise because more wrecked villages have been discovered by the military and aid agencies southeast of Bantul. "People are just starting to realize that there is more destruction outside of Bantul and Klaten," said Paul Armour, country manager for Catholic Relief Services. In the Gunung Kibul district, southeast of Bantul, bodies were still being pulled from collapsed houses, he said. Mr. Armour's team had gone to Yogyakarta two weeks ago to coordinate relief for a possible eruption of Mount Merapi, a volcano north of the city that has been stirring lately. Mount Merapi continued to rumble Tuesday, with lava bubbling from its crater and streaming down, merging with rivers below. The 9,800-foot mountain also released a number of hot gas clouds throughout the day; when they descend, they can burn people severely or even kill them. Volcanologists fear the collapse of the mountain's lava dome, which they said would set off a large eruption. Some believe the dome was weakened after the quake on Saturday. Like other organizations, Oxfam International on Tuesday began focusing its relief effort on the outlying communities. "Reaching people in the more remote villages has been challenging, but we're confident that we'll very soon be delivering aid to those people who've been cut off from relief until now," Craig Owen, an Oxfam spokesman who arrived from Aceh this week, said in a statement. A steady flow of aid, however, continued to arrive Tuesday, as relief agencies and other groups surveyed the area and started distributing supplies. Helicopters buzzed above ruined towns for the first time since the quake. United States marines helped in the distribution effort. Ambulances continued to race between villages and overcrowded hospitals. Earlier this week, the Indonesian Finance Ministry told the United Nations that it would provide subsistence grants to survivors and grants to help rebuild homes. The government intends to complete a rehabilitation plan in two weeks. In Yogyakarta, a major tourist destination and center of classical Javanese culture, life was returning to normal. Despite serious structural damage to some larger buildings like malls and universities, many stores reopened and residents returned to their jobs. Electricity across the city of half a million was restored. Fears of disease began surfacing Tuesday as displaced residents packed into makeshift tents set up by local communities. The World Health Organization sent a surveillance team to Yogyakarta to monitor possible epidemics of measles, diarrhea and other sicknesses easily spread in unsanitary conditions. "These epidemics happen when displaced persons are tightly packed together and often lacking basic infrastructure, such as clean water and safe sewage disposal," said Dick Thompson, a World Health Organization spokesman. Although the stench of decomposing bodies was evident in some areas, most families immediately buried their relatives. A mass grave was dug in Bantul for unidentified people, said Sudibyo, a forensic doctor from Yogyakarta who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. A number of those bodies were driven in ambulances on Tuesday afternoon from hospitals to the mass grave in the village of Dukuh Kurahahan. There, about 20 men, buckets in hand, bailed out the rainwater that had accumulated in the grave the night before. Donning surgery masks, they tossed the bodies in. Standing barefoot in the mud, one villager said a short prayer before the team started filling in the grave using crude shovels, sticks and their hands.

749-> Micki Watanabe and Harley Spiller
Migiwa Kei Watanabe, an artist, and Harley Judd Spiller, an arts administrator and collector, are to be married tonight at the New York City Fire Museum in Manhattan. Judge Judi Clippinger, a justice of the town of Smyrna, N.Y., is to officiate. The bride, 38, is known as Micki. Her sculpture has been shown at the Brooklyn Museum and the Bronx Museum of Art. Her handmade books — scaled-down model rooms in booklike boxes — are in the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Public Library. She is also an adjunct faculty member teaching three-dimensional design at Parsons the New School for Design in Manhattan and an adjunct assistant professor of art at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. She graduated from the Kansas City Art Institute and received a Master of Fine Arts from Ohio State. She is the daughter of Tsugie Watanabe of St. Louis, a nurse anesthetist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital at Washington University Medical Center there. The bridegroom, 47, is the administrator of the Franklin Furnace Archive, a 30-year-old arts organization in Brooklyn. It was established to present avant-garde works and now primarily puts live art and its archives online. He is also an adjunct professor of cooking at Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn and is a graduate of Northwestern. He is the son of Harriet and Mortimer Spiller of Buffalo. His parents retired as the owners of the Mortimer Spiller Company there, which promoted consumer products. Mr. Spiller is an inveterate collector — of graffiti, of chewing gum in flavors unavailable in this country like banana Chiclets, and of Chinese restaurant menus — and his collections have been exhibited at the Cooper Hewitt, National Design Museum and the Museo de Bellas Artes in Caracas, Venezuela. When people heard about Mr. Spiller’s passion for collecting and for keeping his collections in his 280-square-foot studio apartment on the Upper East Side, they invariably asked: “Do you have a girlfriend? Are you married?” “It was not easy to find someone who wouldn’t run away,” he said. Ms. Watanabe, however, was not deterred. But she acknowledged some pangs of trepidation the first time she visited him at home after they met at a Franklin Furnace party in December 2004. “I was afraid I would be walking into a Collyer brothers atmosphere, but I was shocked to see how organized everything was,” she said. “I had to ask, ‘Where are your pink and blue straws?’ and he produced them. Everything is put away, so there is no avalanche of things.”

750-> World Business Briefing | Europe: France: Lafarge Sells Roof-Tile Unit
Lafarge, one of the world's biggest makers of building materials, agreed to sell its roof-tile unit to the private-equity firm PAI Partners for 1.96 billion euros ($2.6 billion) to concentrate on more-profitable cement operations. PAI will also take on 420 million euros ($560 million) of debt, with the transaction forecast to add to earnings next year, said Lafarge, which will buy back a 35 percent stake in the division. Lafarge had invited bids for the tile unit after earnings were eroded by falling prices in Germany, where 25 of its plants are located. PAI is buying just as a recovery in building demand in Germany is poised to end a decade-long construction slump.

751-> Darcy Wolcott, Thomas Proctor
Darcy Michael Ann Wolcott and Thomas Patrick Proctor were married yesterday at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in Ridgefield, Conn. The Rev. Mark Delcuze performed the ceremony. Mrs. Proctor, 30, works in western Massachusetts and southern Vermont for Bayer Diabetes Care, a part of Bayer HealthCare of Tarrytown, N.Y.; she works with the sales staff, teaching health care professionals about the use of the company’s blood glucose monitors. She graduated from Cornell. She is the daughter of Diane Durland Wolcott and Peter B. Wolcott of Bridgewater, Conn. Her father finances and leases commercial and industrial equipment in Bridgewater. Her mother is an interior designer there. Mr. Proctor, 31, is a product manager for the Capewell Components Company of South Windsor, Conn., a manufacturer of hardware for parachutes and for aircraft that drop cargo. The bridegroom joined the Navy in 1998 and flew combat missions over Iraq and Afghanistan. He was a lieutenant when he left the Navy in 2006. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. He is the son of Lucile Stafford Proctor of Princeton, N.J., and Dr. Robert G. Proctor of Reno, Nev. His mother is a sales agent for Gloria Nilson GMAC Real Estate in Princeton. His father retired as an obstetrician and gynecologist with the Northern Nevada Medical Group, a practice in Reno. The bride and bridegroom each have family trees with roots sunk deep into American history. Through her maternal grandmother, Ann Verplanck Durland, the bride is a direct descendant of Miles Standish, as well as of Abraham Isaac Verplanck, one of the first settlers of New Amsterdam. She is also descended from Roger Sherman and Oliver Wolcott, who signed the Declaration of Independence, and from William Samuel Johnson, who signed the Constitution. Mr. Proctor’s forebears, the Hood and Towne families, settled the towns of Topsfield and Ipswich, Mass., in the early 1600’s. One ancestor, Mary Towne Easty, was hanged as a witch in 1692 in Salem. The couple met in a way that their ancestors could never have foreseen — online on Match.com — and in a place they would have had difficulty envisioning, Dave and Buster’s, a bar and video-game parlor in Providence, R.I. But their history was an integral part of the attraction. “I really enjoy genealogy and history, so I was excited to find out that she had lots of good roots in the Revolution,” said Mr. Proctor, a member of Sons of the Revolution. It took a bit longer for the subject of his witch heritage to come up. “We didn’t delve into that until we went to Salem for Halloween of 2005,” the bride said. “We went looking for her grave but didn’t find it.”

755-> Drinking Deeply
Not so long ago, the wine writing business had a reasonably tidy trans-Atlantic division of labor. The United States manufactured wine critics, Britain produced wine writers. We gave Cabernets points, the British gave them poetry. But with Americans succumbing to oenophilia in ever larger numbers, a more literary style of wine writing is suddenly flourishing here. It stands to reason that its foremost practitioner is a novelist, and that the novelist in question is that well-known boulevardier, Jay McInerney, who is enjoying a very successful sideline career as the wine columnist for House & Garden magazine. Back in 2000, McInerney gathered together some of his greatest hits in a wryly entertaining book called “Bacchus and Me.” He has now returned with another witty compilation, “A Hedonist in the Cellar: Adventures in Wine.” One of the charms of “Bacchus and Me” was its tone of droll self-effacement. McInerney cast himself as the uncredentialed interloper of wine chroniclers — a mere “wordsmith with a wine jones,” as he put it. Six vintages and many columns and legendary bottles later, he has become a little less modest about his own abilities, and for good reason. By now, he has logged enough hours in dank cellars to claim genuine expertise, and he clearly has an able palate. (He names the underappreciated Domaine Jasmin as his desert-island Côte-Rôtie, a sign of impeccable taste in my book.) His advice and opinions no longer require disclaimers. Although McInerney has lost none of his fondness for literary, art, music and pop culture metaphors, some winespeak has crept into his prose — various wines are described as being “food-friendly” or “turbocharged.” But these are minor offenses; indeed, what’s impressive is how fresh and jargon-free McInerney’s wine writing remains a decade into his House & Garden gig. From start to finish, first sip to last, “A Hedonist in the Cellar” is crisp, stylish and very funny. McInerney on the siren allure of Burgundy: “Burgundy is a wine for chronic romantics — those for whom hope perennially triumphs over experience. If you are a sensible person with a family, a full-time job and a sound belief in cause and effect, you might want to avoid the Côte d’Or. Once you’ve experienced the transport of a great bottle of Burgundy, you may end your days broke, drooling on Burgundy Wine Company catalogs, offering sexual favors to sommeliers — all in the vain hope of re-creating that rapture.” In “Bacchus and Me,” McInerney generally confined himself to the usual subjects — Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Napa, Sonoma. “A Hedonist in the Cellar” goes farther afield and features more on-the-ground reporting. He makes several visits to northeast Italy, travels to South America and South Africa and even takes a spin up to the Finger Lakes region of New York (which produces surprisingly good Rieslings). He also ventures beyond wine; a column about drinking absinthe in post-Katrina New Orleans, which includes some frank references to his past drug use, is the best entry in the book. If I have any complaint, it is that some of the pieces are too short. The interesting and informative article about the so-called shedistas — low-budget wineries that have sprouted up in and around Santa Barbara that are now turning out some of California’s most exciting wines — would have been even better with a few more pages. Good wines leave you wanting more; so, too, good wine writing. One of McInerney’s many virtues as a wine writer is that he seems to have no agenda apart from maximizing his pleasure. He is admirably receptive to a broad range of wine styles; ignoring his own counsel, he admits to a growing predilection for red Burgundies (actually the mark of a true connoisseur — I said it, he didn’t), but he is not above uncorking a Martinelli Zinfandel — a beast of a wine, the complete antithesis of a red Burgundy — to celebrate his birthday. Similarly, he has no interest in being a combatant in the various quasi-religious disputes — about the critic Robert Parker’s influence, about the importance of terroir, about soaring alcohol levels — that periodically roil the wine world. Although a column profiling the British wine experts Michael Broadbent and Jancis Robinson is provocatively entitled “Do the Brits Taste Differently?,” McInerney focuses solely on their colorful personalities and refuses to be drawn into the endless Anglo-American squabbling over wine. (Parker acolytes habitually portray Broadbent and other British writers as tweedy fusspots who are more interested in a wine’s pedigree than its quality; the British tend to see us as point-chasing, fruit-seeking simpletons with more money than taste.) McInerney does believe that Americans ought to lighten up a bit about wine. “In Europe, where wine has been a part of daily life for thousands of years, American oenophiles are sometimes viewed as monomaniacs — zealous and somewhat narrow-minded converts to a generous and pantheistic faith,” he writes. “American wine lovers need to broaden their vision and relax: to see wine as just another aspect of the well-lived life.” I’ll drink to that.

But it was short-lived. Two weeks ago, Mr. Redstone roiled Hollywood by declaring that Viacom's Paramount movie studio would not be renewing its longstanding relationship with Tom Cruise because the actor's off-screen behavior had, in Mr. Redstone's view, damaged his box-office returns. Yesterday, Mr. Redstone abruptly replaced Thomas E. Freston as Viacom's chief executive, sending another blaring signal to the media world and Wall Street that he does not intend to fade away.

761-> Self-Worth Is Not in Dollars
To the Editor: As a visual artist with an Ivy League education (Penn '94), I thought "Money Changes Everything" (May 7) provided an interesting (and relevant) read. I imagine I am describing the financial states of many of my colleagues when I confess that I have no savings; I carry monstrous student loans; and I sometimes overdraw my checking account to pay for my health insurance. Do I feel shame? Sometimes. Is it warranted? I hope not. So when I read, "Feeling awkward about the differences in net worth is not just an issue for those on the bottom of the equation," I felt irritation. Not only don't I recognize myself as someone "on the bottom," I'm also pretty certain of my "net worth," and proud there's no dollar sign attached to it. JENNIFER WROBLEWSKI New York

762-> Sysco’s Profit Falls on Fuel and Options
The Sysco Corporation, a food distributor, posted an 11 percent decline in quarterly profit yesterday, hurt by soaring fuel costs and stock options expenses. The company, which sells food and supplies to restaurants, hotels, schools and hospitals, reported a profit of $254.1 million, or 41 cents a share, down from $284.7 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Results in the latest period included costs of 4 cents a share for stock options. Sales in the period, which ended July 1 and was the fourth quarter of Sysco’s fiscal year, rose 6.6 percent, to $8.51 billion. Operating expenses as a percent of sales rose to 14.7 percent, compared with 13.6 percent in the quarter last year, on higher fuel prices and pension expenses. Richard J. Schnieders, Sysco’s chairman and chief executive, said he was pleased with the results. “Entering the first quarter of fiscal 2007, many of the higher expenses we encountered in fiscal 2006 will become more comparable, and I am optimistic about our sales, earnings and market share growth opportunities in the new fiscal year,” Mr. Schnieders said in a statement.

764-> When You're Here, You're Family
BLOOMFIELD PICTURE a sprawling, brawling crew of feuders, with names like Cousin Louie, Uncle Rudy and Great-Uncle Graziano. You got it — another extended Italian-American family from New Jersey doing what extended Italian-American families from New Jersey do best. And HBO is nowhere in sight. Joseph Gallo, whose work developing film and television projects includes a biography of the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, has dipped into his own memories to create "My Italy Story." The result is a warmly nostalgic monologue — if, for the most part, not deeply revealing or nuanced — about a fictional family called the DaGatos. This 80-minute stand-up routine, which closes the season here at 12 Miles West Theatre Company, focuses on Thomas DaGato, a yuppie account executive with a visceral connection to the entire DaGato clan. For Thomas, memories of joyful Sundays at Grandma's and of serving as the old lady's official spaghetti-sauce taster trigger his ongoing attempts to force a rapprochement between battling family factions. As affectionately directed by Frank Licato, and as winningly played by a charming young actor named Vincent Sagona, Thomas is a compelling page turner of the DaGato family album. He introduces us to his immediate family, including his sister, whose christening party in honor of her newborn son attracts only some of the DaGato brood. First to arrive is Cousin Louie of "I'll have one, if you have one" fame. Cousin Eugene and Aunt Florence will not be appearing because of a mysterious, still simmering family dispute, begun many years before, which left everyone swearing vengeance. "Promise me we'll get the family back together," the good-natured Louie begs. Thomas is not so sure. A dream in a cemetery involving an appearance by a shrieking Grandma, dead for nearly 20 years, gives Thomas the nudge to quit his job and plan a trip to Italy. "I want to find my cousin Gerardo," he tells Rudy. "I want to find Villata." Traveling by plane and then by rickety bus, up and down treacherous switchback roads, Thomas finally arrives in Villata, the tiny village that Grandma left in 1921. After meeting and sharing pictures and reminiscences with family members, and armed with two bottles of family-produced wine, he makes his way back home. Once there, old questions continue to demand answers: Will this affable young man bring his contentious aunts, uncles and cousins back into the family fold? Or will ancient grudges and suspicions persist in poisoning the atmosphere no matter how hard he tries? And can a warning in Italian, uttered in anger so many years ago by Thomas's now-dead father when a discussion of Grandma's will turned loving relatives into archenemies, still hold a family captive? Tune in to find out. "My Italy Story," 12 Miles West Theatre Company, 562 Bloomfield Avenue, Bloomfield, through May 28. Information: (973) 259-9187 or www.12mileswest.org.

766-> Art in Review; A Four Dimensional Being Writes Poetry on a Field With Sculptures
Matthew Marks Gallery 522 West 22nd Street, Chelsea Through Aug. 11 Charles Ray is one of the most interesting artists alive. He is a pretty good curator too, judging by the organization of this beautiful, spare and mysterious show of works by three sculptors and a photographer. Mr. Ray is known for offbeat perceptual effects in his own sculpture, like one of a naked family with the two young children enlarged so they stand as tall as their parents. But no special effects are in play in the relatively traditional sculptures on view here. First you encounter one of Giacometti's skinny and crusty standing-woman sculptures. Some distance away is a massive assemblage of variously skewed wooden beams and a found staircase by Mark di Suvero. And a shelf along the rear wall displays a set of doll-scale wooden sculptures representing scenes from the Book of Genesis carved and assembled by the folk artist Edgar Tolson. In the exhibition's catalog essay Mr. Ray ruminates on space, time and sculpture, but a more immediate key to his show may be found in what at first seems its most perplexing piece: a huge photographic transparency on a light box, by Jeff Wall. It depicts a ventriloquist and his alarmingly ugly dummy entertaining children at a birthday party. With some reflection it may occur to you that the dummy is a kind of sculpture, and that the art of sculpture is like ventriloquism: the act of giving dumb material the kind of magical animation that so wonderfully imbues the actual sculptures in this show.

769-> 176 Newspapers to Form a Partnership With Yahoo
A consortium of seven newspaper chains representing 176 daily papers across the country is announcing a broad partnership with Yahoo to share content, advertising and technology, another sign that the wary newspaper business is increasingly willing to shake hands with the technology companies they once saw as a threat. In the first phase of the deal, the newspaper companies will begin posting their employment classified ads on Yahoo’s classified jobs site, HotJobs, and start using HotJobs technology to run their own online career ads. But the long-term goal of the alliance with Yahoo, according to one senior executive at a participating newspaper company, is to be able to have the content of these newspapers tagged and optimized for searching and indexing by Yahoo. In that way, local news — one of the pillars of the newspaper business — would become part of a large information network that would increase usefulness for readers and value to advertisers. “Now the industry has religion about the Internet, based on what has happened to the business in recent years,” said the executive, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak for his company. “So there is a lot more genuine enthusiasm today.” The agreement could also come at an opportune time for Yahoo, which is seeking to regain the confidence of investors and the luster it has lost with some marketers. The deal could also help position the company as a willing partner for traditional media companies, an effective counterpunch to a deal its archrival, Google, signed with 50 papers a few weeks ago, and could help it capture a larger portion of the fragmented local advertising market. For the newspapers, which have struggled in recent years as readers and advertisers have flocked to the Internet, the deal represents an effort to earn a greater share of the fast-growing amount spent online on all types of ads. “There has been a big question asked for a while as to how newspapers will navigate the online future,” said William Dean Singleton, vice chairman and chief executive of MediaNews Group, one of the members of the consortium. “I think this is the answer to that question.” The consortium includes the MediaNews Group, Hearst, Belo, E. W. Scripps, the Journal Register Company, Lee Enterprises and Cox Enterprises. The group owns newspapers in 38 states, among them major metropolitan dailies including The San Francisco Chronicle, The Dallas Morning News, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and The Denver Post, with a combined daily circulation of 12 million. Financial terms of the deal, which is to be announced today, were not disclosed. Details of the HotJobs portion of the agreement were first reported on Saturday by The Wall Street Journal. The agreement grew out of the existing partnership with HotJobs by MediaNews and Belo. During the next year, the partnership will be extended as newspapers begin displaying their news articles and local ads on Yahoo’s online network. Yahoo, in turn, will make available local event listings, maps, search technology and other content and tools on the newspapers’ Web sites. Yahoo will also use its technology to help newspaper sell online ads. The arrangement “gives us the ability to monetize our content, an ability that we have not had great success with in the past,” Mr. Singleton said. The deal comes on the heels of Google’s announcement that it will use its technology to sell ads in the print editions of 50 major newspapers, including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Chicago Tribune. And it comes at a time when competition for the lucrative market for classified ads, which newspapers used to control, is intensifying. But the significance of the partnership, according to some newspaper executives, extends well beyond classified ads. They see the announcement as the most ambitious collective effort by the industry to deal with the Internet since the New Century Network of a decade ago. That effort to form a network of newspaper Web sites and sell online ads spanned nine companies, including The New York Times Company, The Times Mirror Company, The Gannett Company and Knight-Ridder. The New Century Network collapsed in 1998, less than three years after formation. At the time, competition from the Internet had not developed as quickly as feared, and the companies went their separate ways. For the newspaper industry, the worries of the 1990s have come to be realized a decade later. “Newspapers now fully recognize that the Internet is a threat, and this is a way for newspapers to try to preserve their franchise, with a partner that has huge online distribution,” said John Morton, an independent newspaper analyst. The willingness to work closely with Yahoo, Mr. Morton noted, is in stark contrast to the reception Microsoft got in the 1990s when it started its local Web service, Sidewalk. Microsoft sought the cooperation of local newspapers, but they refused. When Microsoft realized how expensive it would be to develop its own local content, it shut down the venture. “Local newspapers have always felt that their core strength was their local content, and they have traditionally been very protective of it,” Mr. Morton said. “This reflects a change in that thinking, and the realization that newspapers need to change.” Despite its position as the No. 1 online destination, with some 131 million users in the United States and 400 million worldwide, Yahoo has struggled with many problems in recent months. In particular, it has faltered in its competition with Google as a search engine, and has been challenged by the growing popularity of sites like MySpace, which offer an inexpensive way for advertisers to reach a broad audience. Yahoo shares are down more than 30 percent this year. The alliance “plays right into the strategy of wanting to be the largest and most comprehensive ad platform out there,” said Sue Decker, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Yahoo. “We believe that the way to achieve that objective is to partner with great brands.” Yahoo executives emphasized the importance of the local and classified advertising market, which they said is expected to grow to $12.4 billion by 2010, from $3.4 billion this year. “There is significant opportunity to materially grow local advertising,” said Hilary Schneider, a former executive for Knight Ridder who recently joined Yahoo as senior vice president for marketplaces. Ms. Schneider is responsible for an array of Yahoo sites that include autos, real estate and jobs, and the three largest classified categories.

773-> Eleanor Leonard, Frazer Dougherty
Eleanor Sage Leonard and Frazer Dougherty are to be married this evening at the closing gala of the Music Festival of the Hamptons, a summer concert series of which the bride is the founder and president. The Rev. Edward L. Schiff, an interfaith minister, will officiate at East Hampton Studios, the bridegroom’s film and television soundstage in Wainscott, N.Y. Archdeacon John A. Greco, who retired from the Episcopal diocese of Long Island, is to take part in the ceremony. Ms. Leonard, 67, is keeping her name. She owns an interior design and architecture firm bearing her name with offices in Miami and New York. She is the daughter of the late Reva Moiseiwitsch Sage and Dr. John E. Sage of Great Neck, N.Y. Mr. Dougherty, 84, was until 1999 the president of LTV, a public access station in Wainscott of which he was a founder. Before then he was an industrial designer who in the 1940’s helped design and build, with Robert Edison Fulton Jr., the Airphibian, a combination automobile and airplane that is now in the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. He is a son of the late Maria Frazer Dougherty and Graham Dougherty, who lived in Berryville, Va. Ms. Leonard and Mr. Dougherty met in 1995 when she was being interviewed about the music festival on “Hello! Hello!” an LTV morning talk show whose host was Mr. Dougherty. At the time, Mr. Dougherty was married to his second wife, and Ms. Leonard, twice divorced, was in a long-term relationship. Nine years later their status had changed. So in November 2004, Ms. Leonard invited Mr. Dougherty, by then a widower, to a party at her home in Amagansett. At the party they found themselves caught up in a discussion about baking bread. She was serving black; he preferred brown, which he had learned to make in Greece. At which point Mr. Dougherty, as accomplished with a line as he is at baking, said: “I’d like to bread with you,” Ms. Leonard recalled. “Frazer bounced into the party and into my life,” she said.

774-> The Last Samba of Summer
ACCORDING to the latest figures, there are some 10 million Brazilians living in New York City. Well,  But you’d be excused for thinking so should you travel to the city for the Labor Day weekend. With many residents gratefully scattered, Brazilians from near and far will repopulate Manhattan and take over a broad swath of Midtown for the 22nd (and ever-growing) Brazilian Day. That is just on Sunday afternoon, Sept. 3. Combine the celebration with the more than a dozen Brazilian restaurants in Manhattan and the more down-home restaurants, shops, salons and night life in New York’s primary Brazilian neighborhood, the Astoria section of Queens, and there’s enough going on to transform the long weekend into New York São Paulo style. (City records placed about 14,000 Brazilians in New York in 2000, the most recent figures available, but many Brazilians say the number is higher.) In the mid-1980’s, Brazilian Day was just another ethnic-pride block party, taking over 46th Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, part of what since 1995 has officially been Little Brazil Street. But now, it attracts more than a million people, according to João de Matos, the president of the event and a partner in several Brazilian businesses in New York, including what is probably the city’s most popular Brazilian restaurant, Churrascaria Plataforma. The day’s centerpiece will be a continuing concert that is scheduled to feature well-known Brazilian acts, two of which, Babado Novo and Banda Calypso, will be making a DVD at the festival. Babado Novo is a band from Bahia that plays axé, a popular dance music, and Banda Calypso is a duo from the state of Pará that plays a modern mix of rhythms, including the country music popular in northeast Brazil known as forró. The other performers include the country singer Leonardo, the youth-oriented pop duet Sandy & Junior and the singer-songwriter Fagner, who will sing Brazil’s national anthem. The festival coincides with Brazil’s independence day, which is Sept. 7. There will, of course, be food, though if the last few years are any indication, you’ll have to sift through the standard New York City fair fare to get to the deep Brazilian stuff. Look for the women in traditional Bahian white dresses who make acarajé, a black-eyed pea fritter spread with a sauce made from chilies and dried shrimp. The rest of the weekend, you could eat yourself silly in Manhattan: Brazilian rodízio-style restaurants abound, including Churrascaria Plataforma and its downtown cousin, Churrascaria Riodizio TriBeCa, as well as less expensive choices like Brazil Grill. More standard Brazilian restaurants populate 46th Street, like Emporium Brasil and Ipanema, as well as the upscale West Village spot, Casa. The regular Samba Saturdays at SOB’s, the popular nightclub that most people forget stands for Sounds of Brazil, is sure to be packed, as is its postfestival party. But the pulse of true Brazil is in Astoria, where every day is Brazilian Day. The fancy churrascarias may be few, but the variety is greater and Portuguese spills into the streets. What used to be the nightclub Ilusiones is now Churrascaria Pontal, where the typical rounds of meat are available for $23.99 (cheaper on weekdays). But the real entertainment comes late on Friday and Saturday nights. Last month, Rabeka do Forró, the country band that previously played at Made in Brazil (a bar that serves a mean caipirinha), took over Pontal on Friday nights, and plans are to keep it going. It’s complemented by D.J.’s. on Saturday nights for Samba Astoria. But the act scheduled for Sept. 2 is an axé band, Pimenta Malagueta. For an experience just as Brazilian but far less well known to Americans than are churrascarias, try one of the self-service restaurants where you pay by the pound, making it possible to stuff yourself on most of the same meats as in a churrascaria and spend less than $10. One classic spot, the once tiny Copacabana, has expanded to half the block and is newly painted in a soothing orange. Also new is Sabor de Minas, the neighborhood’s only restaurant dedicated to food from the state of Minas Gerais, where many Brazilian immigrants are from; it is also self-service. For a more traditional setting, try the family-owned Malagueta. Wherever you go on Labor Day or any other time, you should find that Brazilians, who seem genetically friendly, are a good group to share a weekend with — as long as you steer clear of difficult topics like, say, that recently concluded soccer tournament in Germany. The festival runs from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 3, on 46th Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway and on Avenue of the Americas from 43rd Street to 57th Street. Standard dress: anything green and yellow. The main stage is set to be at the intersection of Avenue of the Americas and 43rd Street; expect the next few blocks to be packed, so arrive early. The music should start around 1 p.m. A smaller stage for performances will be set up at 46th Street and Avenue of the Americas. More information is at www.brazilianday.com. Although Brazilian businesses are scattered throughout the Astoria section of Queens, many are on or near 36th Avenue, which has a station on the N and W subway. 36-21 Steinway Street; (718) 729-6476. 31-13 36th Avenue; (718) 545-3685. 35-48 31st Avenue; (718) 707-0536. 25-35 36th Avenue; (718) 937-4821. 33-07 36th Avenue; (718) 786-7927.

776-> Prognosis: In Smoking, Research Finds, Cutting Back Won’t Do
Smokers who say they just can’t quit are sometimes told to at least cut down. But even if they reduce their intake by half or more, they are unlikely to see much benefit, a new study reports. The , which appears in the journal Tobacco Control, followed the health of more than 50,000 Norwegian smokers over more than two decades. The subjects, men and women ages 20 to 49 at the start of the research in the mid-1970s, were screened once at the start of their involvement and again after 3 to 13 years. A smaller group was screened a third time. On average, the researchers kept track of each participant for about 20 years. The researchers found that those who reduced their cigarette intake by 50 percent or more did not have a better mortality rate from all causes of death than heavier smokers did. They did not even do better when it came to diseases specifically associated with smoking. “In health education and patient counseling,” the researchers wrote, “it may give people false expectations to advise that reduction in consumptions is associated with reduction in harm.” They did say that cutting back probably had value as an interim step to quitting smoking. It is unclear why those who cut back did not seem to be healthier. One possibility, the study said, is that to compensate for the cigarettes they give up, smokers inhale smoke more deeply and smoke more of each cigarette.

777-> Apple Settles Patent Dispute With a Rival
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 23  Apple Computer said Wednesday that it would pay a one-time $100 million licensing fee to use Creative Technology’s patented music player technology, settling a string of recent legal disputes between the two companies. Creative, a maker of portable music players that compete with Apple’s iPod, had accused Apple of violating a newly granted software patent covering the way users navigate music selections. Creative applied for its patent in 2001 and was granted it in August 2005, soon after Apple’s application for a similar patent was denied. Creative filed its suit in federal court in San Francisco on May 15, and at the same time filed a complaint with the United States International Trade Commission to block the importing of iPods, which are made primarily in China. Apple countersued a week later. “This settlement resolves all of our differences with Creative, including the five lawsuits currently pending between the companies, and removes the uncertainty and distraction of prolonged litigation,” said Steven P. Jobs, Apple’s chief executive. Creative was “fortunate” to have been granted the patent as early as it did, Mr. Jobs said. Under the terms of the settlement, Apple could recoup part of its payment if Creative succeeded in licensing its patents to other companies. Apple will get to use Creative’s technology in all its products. Creative, which is based in Singapore and has United States operations in Milpitas, Calif., sells a line of digital music players and accessories for several music devices. As part of the settlement, Creative becomes part of the official iPod ecosystem, giving its products an Apple endorsement and the ability to affix a “Made for iPod” sticker on the iPod accessories it sells. Analysts said the settlement indicated that Creative was looking at expanding its accessory business, a lucrative segment of the portable music industry. According to the NPD Group, a market research company, for every $3 consumers spend on an iPod, they spend $1 on iPod accessories. “We’re very pleased to have reached an amicable settlement with Apple and to have opened up significant new opportunities for Creative,” said Sim Wong Hoo, chairman and chief executive of Creative. Mike McGuire, vice president for research on mobile devices at Gartner, the technology analysis and consulting firm, said an Apple endorsement for its line of iPod accessories most likely gave Creative incentive to settle. The settlement also comes as Microsoft has been developing a portable digital music player to challenge the iPod, reportedly in time for the holiday shopping season. Microsoft executives told financial analysts in July that the company planned to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the next few years to make its product, the Zune, a success. Mr. McGuire speculated that anticipation of competition from Microsoft could have added to the urgency the companies felt to settle. Apple has long led the market for portable digital players, and today its iPod accounts for 75 percent of all retail sales of such players in the United States. The Creative patent, which the company calls the Zen patent for its line of digital audio players, covers the interface that allows users to select a song, album or track by navigating a succession of menus. Creative said Apple’s payment would contribute 85 cents a share to its earnings in the current quarter.

778-> You'll Always Have Paris
PARIS does funny things to people. Imagine, for example, crawling off an airplane, making your way across the city with a bad case of jet lag and waking up the next day to find that you are the new owner of some stranger's apartment in the 17th Arrondissement. That would be where, exactly? And how much did it cost again? "It happened so fast," said Deviyani Nautiyal, sounding surprised even several months later as she recounted a hunt that began at home, in front of a computer. "I can't believe we bought an apartment within four hours of landing." She was on the phone in Rochester, Minn., where she and her husband, Sanjeev Sethi, a pathologist at the Mayo Clinic, normally live, an inconvenient 12 hours and two subway rides from their new second home. It's hard to get figures on how many Americans leave Paris with a souvenir in the form of a French mortgage. But the number is "mushrooming," according to Cecil Jones, president of Just France Sales, a property finders' service for those who speak English. (Incidentally, the number of agencies like his is mushrooming, too.) Lured by such services, low interest rates and hopes that investing in French real estate is a smart way to diversify — if the euro continues to strengthen — Americans are scouring parts of Paris they barely knew five years ago. Consider the 17th, where Ms. Nautiyal, a lawyer, and Dr. Sethi found their 635-square-foot, one-bedroom, 375,000-euro (about $480,000) pied-à-terre in January. Indeed, you might consider it now, before the next wave of buyers spills over from the heavily touristed Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Arrondissements. The 17th may have its funky stretches and seem a bit removed on the far Right Bank, but that's one reason it still has deals, making it the latest destination for Americans who long for a well-priced piece of Paris. Not long ago some of the same people might have focused on Left Bank addresses like the Rue Cler, a lively market street in the Seventh Arrondissement not far from the Eiffel Tower. Today there are so many Americans shopping on Rue Cler for their bread and French butter — and their second homes — that half the voices you hear have a familiar accent. Ms. Nautiyal says that she sees the 17th as an antidote to "Leftitis," and financially, anyway, she is right: according to Paris Real Estate Finders, a search-and-buy service, which helped steer her and her husband across the Seine, the average asking price per square foot in the Rue Cler neighborhood topped $1,050 in May, in contrast to an average asking price in the 17th of $773. And the highly diverse 17th, at least for the moment, has far fewer people from back home. It also has patches that are not so wonderful — the Avenue de Clichy comes to mind — and some that are elegant indeed. C. Randolph Fishburn, a lawyer in New York who frequently works in Paris, paid 1.1 million euros last year for a central-casting two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment on the stately Avenue de Wagram: 1,400 renovated square feet in a 19th-century building "across from the only 24-hour flower shop in Paris," he said. He added that the florist also stocks Champagne — presumably in case of emergencies. Mr. Fishburn said he "realized the market is undervalued and I could do this as investment and a euro hedge." Closing costs were high but carrying costs — property taxes and maintenance fees — are not, and his mortgage rate is below 4 percent. That's lower than this season's high heels. The 17th sits on the Right Bank like a big crooked wedge of pizza, its nose under the Arc de Triomphe and its crust overlapping the beltway that rims the western edge of the city. In the late 19th century, when Paris was expanding like a soufflé, the far-flung 17th was a getaway for the world-weary. Zola retreated there to write (and gave his heroine Nana, an actress turned rich-man's mistress, a 17th Arrondissement address). Impressionists lived and worked there too, recording the train stations rising to the east, their tracks strewn in fistfuls in the 17th. As developers piled in, large apartments rose up to accommodate bourgeois families and well-kept Nanas. Today the arrondissement is a patchwork of neighborhoods plain, fancy and iffy. Grand avenues like Wagram emanate from the Place d'Étoile like spokes in a wheel, and just below the 17th's southern border, in the fashionable Eighth, sits the seductive Parc Monceau. At the eastern edge is the mildly gamy Place de Clichy, to the north the villagelike area called Batignolles. Hidden throughout are quiet streets, green spaces and bargains. An infusion of young families is adding street life to some areas, and there's a pleasant hum around the Place des Ternes, said François Thomazeau, co-author of "The Authentic Bistros of Paris" (The Little Bookroom). "It's — well, not trendy," he said of the 17th, "but interesting." Think of it as the French equivalent of Murray Hill. But with more places to pause: the Square des Batignolles, for its benches, and bakeries like Laurent Connan (38, rue des Batignolles) and Franck Perotti (11, rue Flaubert), for their baguettes. "It is a very community-oriented place," said Janet Rotner, who lives with her husband, Philip, a lawyer, in Chicago and found their 17th Arrondissement apartment in a classified ad in Le Figaro six years ago. During visits, "we go to the markets, we do some cooking, we bring home food from the traiteur," she said, evoking a common fantasy among those who hole up in tiny hotel rooms and are forced to eat out three times a day. One sign of the arrondissement's health is its concentration of baby carriages and renovation construction cranes, said Darrell Halverson, who runs Paris Real Estate Finders with his wife, Stephanie Freedman. Favorite hunting grounds include the area around the Square des Batignolles, "where the streets are narrower and you have the feeling of being in a village, anchored by the park," Mr. Halverson said. The 17th is calmer and less expensive than tourist-filled areas like the Marais and the fashionable Eighth. The Villiers Métro stop is served by two major lines, a big plus. Lively outdoor markets spring up at the Place de Lévis and on the Rue Poncelet and the Boulevard des Batignolles. Parisian co-ops generally do not subject buyers to time-consuming scrutiny, and they generally tolerate the comings and goings of strangers, should one decide to make an apartment available to friends or to renters. It's easy to fall under the sway of the city and its boosters, some of whom flog Parisian properties as if they were a no-risk investment. The market is cooling off slightly and the euro, now trading at $1.29, could get stronger — or weaker. Despite the assurances of some property agents, not all absentee owners have luck finding tourists to rent their apartments by the week, especially in the 17th. Carrying costs can be reasonable but inheritance taxes are high: some Americans arrange to have an heir's name on the deed. The French do not have multiple listings, and many apartments are sold by owners, often through classified ads. Bargains go quickly. Sellers often take their kitchen appliances with them, a French custom, and long-distance renovations can be awkward. The Batignolles area is a hike from stations served by a single line. Taxis can be hard to flag after midnight. Parisians, like New Yorkers, are enjoying a boom (or bulle, as some French economists say), zealously tracking prices with the help of a trade group, the Society of Notaires, which gives square-meter sales prices in dozens of neighborhoods in racing-form style. For the 12 months ending in December 2005, prices were up 11.4 percent over 2004 around the Place des Ternes, and 16.7 percent around Batignolles. Americans often turn to bilingual services like Paris Real Estate Finders (www.parisrealestatefinders.com), which not only sift through the offerings but also help buyers find the requisite notaire, or lawyer, line up a mortgage and survive a French closing. Paris Real Estate Finders scours the classifieds and other sources to find listings placed by owners and real estate agents and charges its clients a percentage of the purchase price. Just France (www.justfrancesales.com), based in Berwyn, Pa., does this without charging a fee (it collects from the listing agent), and it also helps buyers rent out their apartments to tourists. French-owned services include My Home in Paris (www.myhomeinparis.com), and My Flat in Paris (www.myflatinparis.com), which sells apartments as investments and leases them back for three years for use as corporate rentals. Paris Real Estate Finders's advantage is its constantly updated database, which is cross-indexed in multiple ways and has hundreds of listings throughout the city, many in the 17th. Clients fill out a short questionnaire (walk-up or elevator? what price range?) and while still in the United States receive listings that meet their criteria. The system saves time for all involved: clients like Mr. Fishburn and Ms. Nautiyal snap up the first apartments they see. Mr. Halverson, who helpfully translates square meters and euros into terms Americans can understand, has calculated that in 2005 buyers paid an average of $726 a square foot in the 17th, in contrast to $976 in the Sixth. The most expensive arrondissement in 2005 was the Seventh, at $992 a square foot, he said, and this spring the average asking price in the Seventh's select Gros Caillou quartier is, as noted around Rue Cler, even higher. Once you get above $1,000, he said, you may as well buy in New York. Ms. Nautiyal, in Minnesota, said she and her husband had visited Paris together only once before they made the leap. They bought their apartment on his second trip to Paris (she had been there several times before). "It was a big risk and a crazy decision," she acknowledged. But it was in Paris, she explained, away from their busy everyday lives, that they realized how much "we enjoy walking and talking, which we don't have a chance to do most of the time." "We couldn't bear to leave the place," she said. And so if all goes as planned, she said, they will be back again in Paris in August.

783-> Study Sees No Gain in Using Antidepressant to Treat Anorexia
One of the most widely used treatments for the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, the antidepressant Prozac, works no better than dummy pills in preventing recurrence in young women who have recovered from it, researchers are reporting today. The study, the most rigorous to date to test the use of medication for anorexia, should alter treatment for an illness that is often devastatingly chronic and that has a higher mortality than any other psychiatric disorder, experts said. Fewer than a third of the study's participants, who also received regular psychotherapy, remained healthy for a year or more, whether they received drug treatment or not, the study found. An estimated 1 percent of Americans, or about three million people, mostly young women, will at some point suffer from the self-starvation and obsessive anxiety about weight that characterize anorexia, and surveys find that about two-thirds of them receive treatment with Prozac or similar antidepressants, which are considered generally interchangeable. Research suggests that the drugs can be useful in helping people recover from bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder involving bingeing and purging that causes less dramatic weight loss than anorexia. But the new findings put to rest hopes from earlier work that these benefits might carry over to anorexia, experts said. "Physicians who are trying to help people with anorexia remain symptom-free should not count on getting substantial benefits from antidepressants," said Dr. B. Timothy Walsh, the lead author of the study, who is director of eating disorders research at the New York State Psychiatric Institute at the Columbia University Medical Center. "Doctors should be looking at other things, like good psychological treatments," Dr. Walsh said. In the study, appearing in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers from Columbia and the University of Toronto monitored 93 women, ages 16 to 45, who, after receiving intensive psychotherapy, gained enough weight to fall into the normal range. Half the group then received daily doses of Prozac, and the other half took dummy pills. All of them continued in weekly psychotherapy, where they practiced techniques to examine and diffuse irrational assumptions about weight and body image. After a year, 26 percent of those on Prozac and 31 percent of those taking placebo pills remained in a healthy weight range, the study found. The differences between the two groups, in weight and on measures of beliefs about food and weight gain, were not large enough to be significant. "This study will change practice, beginning with the community of doctors who specialize in eating disorders and spreading more broadly" to other doctors, said Dr. Scott Crow, a psychiatrist at the University of Minnesota, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. Dr. Walter Kaye, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh, said the new findings should not rule out the use of antidepressant treatment altogether. In 2001, Dr. Kaye published a small study suggesting that Prozac did help some young women who had recovered from anorexia keep on weight. They were women who did not binge — they ate very little — and did not receive psychotherapy. "For patients like these, who don't have access to psychological treatments, who have a choice between medication or nothing at all, I think the medication could help," Dr. Kaye said. All agree that the new findings emphasize the importance of thinking creatively about treatment. The best psychotherapy available, said Dr. Crow, helps only about a third of anorexia patients recover. Another third learn to moderate and live with their aversions to food, while the rest develop a chronic disorder, putting them at high risk for suicide or death from starvation. Researchers are experimenting with several new therapeutic techniques. One is a type of family therapy for adolescents, in which parents take charge of all meals. The parents decide how much their daughter or son should eat — based on specific guidelines — and reward good behavior, if appropriate. Several studies suggest that this approach can lead to sustained recovery in some teenagers. Some evidence suggests that this kind of close monitoring by a therapist can also help adults with the disorder. Psychiatrists have experimented, so far in vain, with a wide variety of drugs for treatment, including antipsychotic medications, so-called mood-stabilizing drugs like lithium and agents similar to the active ingredients in marijuana. "It's disappointing, really," Dr. Walsh said. "We would like to do better. We need to do better."

784-> DINING/HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON; With Organic Offerings, A Sense of Well-Being
"OH, no!" bellowed an old friend who lives near Hastings-on-Hudson when he saw me in Comfort one recent evening. "Please tell me you aren't reviewing this place." He almost blew my cover, but I had to forgive him. Fans of this year-and-a-half-old restaurant are passionate and loyal, and the last thing they want is to have it discovered by the hordes beyond Hastings. With only about seven tables (in nice weather the front wall of windows opens up and seating is available on the sidewalk), no restrooms and a particularly competitive atmosphere on chaotic weekday evenings, Comfort can't handle too much more love. Still, readers will want to know why Comfort is so popular with the residents of this river town. Offering a short but eclectic menu that focuses on organic ingredients, the restaurant is serving delicious, healthful, well-thought-out dishes that do, as the name implies, envelop you with a sense of being well cared for. Consider the restaurant's most popular dish, the roasted chicken. Comfort starts with Amish Select birds, raised without hormones or antibiotics. They are prepared either with fresh herbs or "Asian spices" (John Halko, chef and owner, won't disclose his recipe, but aniseed is a major ingredient). Both were perfectly crisp on the outside, moist and tasty within. At less than $10 for a half chicken and two sides, they are a great value. Beef or bean tacos in organic corn or flour tortillas, gluten- and grease-free chicken fingers and penne in a light tomato sauce with roasted garlic and just the right amount of crushed red pepper were other winners. A grilled Kobe ribeye, simply seasoned and cooked exactly as ordered, melted in my mouth. Some of the best tastes come from the daily specials. Pan-seared trout in brown butter was tremendously satisfying. Jumbo shrimp were fresh, plentiful and, again, expertly grilled. The pesto dressing was so flavorful it tasted as if it had been made on the spot. Sides are ordered separately and many are good enough to be considered on their own (some regulars make a meal out of several). Low-fat, three-cheese mac and cheese was a gooey, yummy, old-fashioned pleasure. Baked sweet potatoes with glazed pecans, mashed potatoes and sautéed green beans were all terrific. On a recent evening, the peas that came as the daily green were so good and bursting with sweetness that I could have eaten a pasta-size bowl of them and been happy for the night. There were some misses. The sautéed broccoli was a bit overcooked and could have used more sliced garlic. Grilled chicken breast was pedestrian. The apple crumb cobbler was unpleasantly mushy, but like the main dishes and sides, the desserts were mostly wonderful -- a fragrant carrot cake, a complex bread pudding with vanilla sauce and a rich brownie. Comfort's biggest challenges, however, do not have to do with food. The lone waitress I encountered on each of my three visits also had to handle takeout orders and phone calls and was completely overwhelmed. Orders were forgotten or mixed up and it was hard to get her attention. All three waitresses were sweet and trying hard, but they needed more hands. In some ways, Comfort is barely a proper restaurant. It has no liquor license, and it will never get one because there is no room to add the bathroom that the law requires for licensing. (Patrons are now directed to a diner down the street when they need to use a restroom.) Mr. Halko and Angelina DeAngelis-Halko, his business partner and wife, hope to open either a second restaurant in another town or to create a bigger place in Hastings that will allow them to have a bar and a loungelike atmosphere at night. Here's hoping they succeed. Combining their delectable food with more spacious surroundings would be a comfort indeed.

785-> Atomic Pioneers Gather Again to Recall Manhattan Project
LOS ALAMOS, N.M., Oct. 5— The old men stared at one another through squinted eyes on Thursday and began to remember the lives they once lived. Slowed by age and bent with frailty, about 50 veterans of the Manhattan Project gathered at the Best Western Hilltop House Hotel here as part of three days of events to commemorate their work on the atomic bomb. Arthur Schelberg, 85, was recruited in 1943, shortly after earning a physics degree from Princeton. “We knew what was going on before it was ever made public,” Mr. Schelberg said as the sounds of Glenn Miller blared through a hotel ballroom. “I was here from the beginning.” Mr. Schelberg and others spent hours trading anecdotes about their work on the Manhattan Project, the initiative to develop nuclear weapons in World War II. Operating under the Army Corps of Engineers, the project officially began in 1942 out of fears that the Nazis were creating an atomic bomb. About 125,000 people were involved in the effort around the country, with many young scientists and engineers from elite universities. Roughly 5,000 worked here. The recently restored V Site was where scientists assembled the Trinity device, tested in 1945 over Alamogordo in the first nuclear explosion. Daniel Gillespie, 84, worked on Trinity and other ‘Fat Man’ bombs beginning in 1944. Through a wry smile, Mr. Gillespie recalled how the Army had sent him here because of his engineering background, but he was never told why until a friend whispered the details of the mission. “We felt like if we could perfect that bomb and stop that war, then we were doing a good thing,” he said. “We were saving lives.” Cynthia Kelly, president of the Atomic Heritage Foundation, sponsor of the reunion, said it was born out of an effort to preserve the sites where the scientists worked after Congress authorized a cleanup of the national laboratory in the 1990’s. In the process, the foundation contacted veterans and discussed their experiences. Although not the first such reunion here, time is increasingly precious, as a vast majority of the workers are into their 80’s, Ms. Kelly said. “What’s happening is significant, because 20 years from now, very few, if any, of the veterans of the Manhattan Project will be alive,” she said. “So it’s important to get the oral history, the first-hand accounts.” The average age of those at Los Alamos, considered the brain trust of the Manhattan Project, was 25, Ms. Kelly said. She estimated that 20 percent remained alive. “I’m overwhelmed and engulfed with memories,” Paul Numerof, who was in a special engineers detachment, said. “It was a tense, exciting time for all of us. I felt like I was in the presence of scientific royalty.” Dr. Numerof recalled attending Monday night meetings led by J. Robert Oppenheimer. Aside from nostalgia, the reunion also commemorates the restoration of Manhattan Project sites at Los Alamos. They were given a federal grant in 1999, but a forest fire in 2000 heavily damaged them. In celebration of the restoration, the Atomic Heritage Foundation and Los Alamos Historical Society have sponsored events like bus tours of the region and talks by experts like Richard Rhodes, who wrote the prize-winning “Making of the Atomic Bomb,” and Thomas O. Hunter, director of the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque. Not everyone is completely enamored of the reunion. Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch New Mexico, a watchdog group in Santa Fe, said nuclear weapons continued to be produced, in a far murkier geopolitical landscape. “I’m not going to begrudge a bunch of old fellows as reliving their war years,” Mr. Coghlan said. “Every generation has to operate under the exigencies of their time. “The Manhattan Project gentlemen have their reunion, their memories. But meanwhile Los Alamos is getting ready to fight the next war, in which the use of nuclear weapons is entirely possible.” That point was not lost on Ralph Gates, 82, who helped cast explosives at Los Alamos when the Army recruited him because of his engineering studies at Vanderbilt University. Although nostalgic about Los Alamos, he also remains haunted by the power that he helped give birth to. “I wish I could tell young people today how naïve they are,” Mr. Gates said. “We were like that, too, young and naïve. We truly believed that by building that bomb there’d never be another war.”

787-> Footloose and Boot Free: Barefoot Hiking
FIVE minutes into the trail at Oxbow Park, west of Rochester, Minn., the dirt path became a narrow field of sharp rocks. Immediately ahead was a twisting wooden staircase with extruding nailheads. Nothing to be concerned about if you’re wearing shoes. But I wasn’t. Jim Guttmann, my guide to the world of barefoot hiking, walked calmly ahead of me over the rocks, his face a portrait of serenity, and up the steps. Not once did he wince or alter his gait. “Your body adapts,” he had told me. But mine was not adapting fast enough. The Barefoot Hikers of Minnesota were at Oxbow, an Olmsted County park with trails through wooded hills and along a river, for one of their regular get-togethers to challenge nature with feet au naturel. The six members who turned out this particular Saturday ranged in age from David Berg, 26, a tall, tan stay-at-home dad who hiked with thumbs consistently tucked under the straps of his small backpack, to Meg Palan, 67, a former nurse with oversize glasses and mostly white hair. Mr. Guttmann, one of the group’s original organizers, fell somewhere in the middle at 44. None of the hikers seemed to think they were doing anything particularly odd — and from a wide perspective, maybe they weren’t. Going barefoot is still the norm in some cultures in warm climates. Although the half-dozen or so barefoot hiking clubs in the United States tend to attract turnouts in the single digits for hikes, Germany, Italy and other European countries have entire parks devoted to barefoot walking. Broader barefoot lifestyle organizations include the Society for Barefoot Living (www.barefooters.org) and Parents of Barefoot Children (www.unshod.org). The hikers of the barefoot world tramp not only through mud and dust, but also over rocks, tree roots and the frosty ground of autumn (though they usually draw the line at snow). Yet although they may bring to mind tales of fakirs or extreme-sports enthusiasts, barefoot hikers are neither ascetics nor thrill seekers. Almost universally, they say they go shoeless for a sense of communion with the earth and for the sheer pleasure of feeling more of the world with their feet. The Minnesota hikers compared the sensory experience of barefooting to wine tasting. Fresh fall leaves, Mr. Guttmann said, are “crunchy and cool,” and mud is “black dough that squishes up between your toes.” Dennis Slattengren, a 60-year-old nudist who owns a vending machine route and who was at least wearing shorts for this trek, savored the texture of silt that has run onto concrete and partially dried — “like warm velvet,” he said. On the hike at Oxbow, the pace was languid, and although the path was wide enough for two or three to walk abreast, the barefooters frequently walked single file to enjoy the spongy earth or a strip of moss underfoot. “So many people have very little or no connection with our beautiful earth and all of nature,” Ms. Palan later lamented. AS a first-time barefoot hiker, I just wanted to make it through this four-mile hike with all 10 toes intact. Confronting the rocks and the nail-studded staircase, I gritted my teeth and stepped forward, but before I even reached the stones, my right foot came down on a bent stick that buried itself in the tender arch like a stake. I let out a muffled yelp. Mr. Guttmann encouraged me to press on. “It’s like if you always wore a blindfold or earmuffs and then suddenly got exposed to lots of light or sound,” he said. “At first it’s overwhelming, but you get used to it.” Our hike that day took us from a picnic area across a river and into tall maple forest, where we walked a circular route, popping out briefly into small fields and eventually returning to the river. We all waded in to enjoy Mr. Guttmann’s “black dough.” Barefoot hikers take care of their neophytes. Mr. Guttmann showed me how to walk flat-footed on stones to distribute weight across the many sharp points and how to lead with the ball of the foot on the forest floor to roll off any stray twigs or rocks. Mr. Slattengren identified scourges like nettles, whose oil makes the feet itch, and thistles, which can take weeks to fully work themselves out of the foot. Every now and then I noticed a footstep that felt gooey and moist, although no water was to be seen. Mr. Guttmann waved it off. “It’s all in your mind,” he said, laughing. “Just don’t think about whatever it was, and it’ll wear off down the road.” The only other hikers we met were a well-shod family of five who hurried past, glancing askance at our feet and barely returning our friendly greetings. Alan Seaver, who created the Barefoot Hikers of Minnesota with Mr. Guttmann, said that snubs were an exception and that people were generally pretty friendly on the trail. “The funny thing is the number of people who will pass us wearing huge, expensive hiking boots and talk about how ‘they wish they could do that,’ ” Mr. Seaver said. “You can. Just take off your shoes.” He and Mr. Guttmann carry barefoot-hiking business cards to hand out on such occasions, but finding other barefoot enthusiasts is not easy, and the members of this club were happy to have one another. Seasoned hikers, of course, have the advantage of seasoned feet. This group’s looked pretty normal from above, but on the underside were footpads more suited to bears than to humans. David Berg, who was in training for a barefoot marathon, had a particularly remarkable set: his feet resembled those of the Michelangelo statue with which he shares his first name: wide, bulging with muscle and solid as marble. Since a canoe trip in the fall of 2004 when he started “taking the shoes off,” he said, his feet had grown wider and stronger and no longer needed arch support. “My dad thinks I’m crazy,” Mr. Berg said. “My father-in-law can’t imagine how I manage to walk all over his property without shoes or regard to the location of any paths, but my wife has become accustomed to it.” He’s pinning hopes on his children, 2 and 4, who still go barefoot. Although a few barefoot marathoners come along every generation, like the Ethiopian Abebe Bikila, who set a world marathon record while running barefoot in 1960, barefoot trail hiking is pretty much the antithesis of a competitive sport. Still, it has its shining stars. Among them are Susan and Lucy Letcher, sisters who barefooted most of the Appalachian Trail in 2001 — while carrying 45-pound packs. Their feet were tender at first, Susan Letcher, 27, said, but after five days of twigs and sharp pine cones they were ready for anything. At one campsite in New Hampshire, 300 miles into the hike, they realized that they had been walking around on broken glass and hadn’t felt a thing. “The bottoms of our feet were like boot leather,” she said. Their favorite hiking surface is sun-baked rocks, which Susan says feels like “walking on the scales of a sleeping dragon” and which Lucy, 30, describes as “cat’s-tongue’s roughness combined with a lovely warmth.” Barefooters’ abilities to handle trails are no surprise to Edward Tenner, a specialist in the history of technology (including shoes) who is a visiting scholar at Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania. In his book “Our Own Devices,” he cited research in the 1950’s in which the feet of barefoot Hong Kong fishermen were found to be structurally healthier and more dexterous than those of shoe wearers, despite lacerations and deformed toenails. Shoes reshape the feet, Dr. Tenner said, and “if you believe that evolution has optimized parts of the body, it’s presumably healthier for a part of the body to assume its normal shape.” DR. DAVID E. SAMUEL, a podiatric surgeon in Philadelphia, notes that the skin is a very sensitive organ and says that constant barefooting will increase that sensitivity, which seems to explain barefoot hikers’ enjoyment. But he firmly favors shoes. Barefooters risk puncture wounds, nail trauma and the invasion of small foreign bodies or unfriendly organisms, he said, adding, “I’m sure a lot of Neanderthals died from foot infections.” Nevertheless, as the hike at Oxbow Park wore on, I found myself focusing less on the patches of gravel and muck and more on the bushes of purple and white phlox and the shifting greens of the maple leaf canopy. Somehow the extra sensations I felt that afternoon from the ground heightened all the others: I paid more attention than usual to the play of sunlight dappling the ferns and the sounds of bluebirds chirping. Near the end of the trail, we came across a stretch of ground that molded to my feet while still supporting them, like space-age memory foam. I bent down to examine the substance and found it was several packed inches of pulverized leaves — pure compost — and I realized I had a tasting note of my own to share with the group. Soft, spongy, cool but not wet, with just a hint of crackle. SEVERAL clubs around the country run barefoot hikes. Here are a few and the hikes they sponsor. , www.geocities.com/bfhikersmn.

788-> China’s Government to Spend on Water Facilities
China’s government plans to spend 1 trillion yuan ($125 billion) by 2010 to build wastewater treatment plants and upgrade water distribution infrastructure around the country, the Ministry of Construction said. As much as a third of that amount, or 330 billion yuan, will be spent in urban centers, where as many as 278 cities lack proper treatment facilities and at least 30 cities have plants that operate at less than 30 percent capacity, the ministry said. China wants to attract the capital and technology of overseas companies to supply clean water for keeping its economy, the fourth-largest, growing. Natural water shortages, worsened by rampant industrial pollution, plague parts of the country; its central and western provinces are facing China’s worst drought in 50 years. “We welcome water companies from all over the world to participate in the Chinese market,” Qiu Baoxing, vice minister of construction, said at a news conference in Beijing.

789-> Under Sail, Under Wraps
ON the open water of Lake Sakakawea, offshore a mile from the marina at Hazen Bay and into a twinkling sea of sun-striped blue, Mike Quinn turned off the motor to raise the sails. “We’ll get wind out beyond this bay,” he said, gripping the polished wheel of the Sovereign, a white and gleaming craft. “You can see the breeze on the water right up there.” Lake Sakakawea, a deep reservoir of the Missouri River in western North Dakota, appeared endless off the boat’s bow. To the west, the lake faded away oceanic and blue, its mass meshing into a haze of sky at the distant horizon. Sails shuddered as the Sovereign moved out onto the main body of the lake. A depth gauge read 110 feet. Speed, 5 knots and accelerating. By numbers alone, Lake Sakakawea is an imposing body of water, claiming 368,000 acres of surface area and more than 1,200 miles of shoreline, most of it uninhabited and wild. It’s more than 170 miles long, winding westward in massive S-curves to the Montana border. Clear water up to 180 feet deep is measured at the Garrison Dam near the lake’s eastern terminus. But Sakakawea, which is among the world’s largest artificial lakes, is little known outside its home state. In the United States, it is No. 3 in size after Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the highly visited reservoirs of the Colorado River in the Desert Southwest, both administered by the National Park Service. “Sakakawea is a local’s lake,” said Dick Messerly, the manager of Fort Stevenson State Park on the lake’s east end, which gets about 100,000 visits a year. He said out-of-state tourists are always present, but North Dakotans — especially those coming to fish for the lake’s walleyes — make up the majority of the region’s tourist traffic. In total, about a million people visit Lake Sakakawea each year, according to the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees management of the lake and tracks user statistics. The majority come to fish, casting for northern pike, salmon and walleye, and to cruise the clear water in power boats. Sailboats are rarer, but Sakakawea, which is perpetually windy, is regarded as a hidden gem by the sailors who frequent its empty and open waters. “People don’t believe that you can sail like this in North Dakota,” said Mr. Quinn, a 57-year-old municipal judge who guides one-to three-day trips on the lake. He purchased the Sovereign — a 34-foot vessel with teakwood floors and a cabin to sleep five — in 1992 while working as a safety director at a power plant. Today he is a Coast Guard-licensed captain and sails his boat on the lake well into October. On a recent bright Sunday, a crew of four Minnesotans joined Mr. Quinn for an overnight voyage on the lake. The group would set out from the east end, sail all day and sleep under the stars in a distant bay at the edge of the state’s badlands wilderness. An hour into the voyage, with sails aloft and wind blowing strong, Mr. Quinn began giving orders. The crew — three neophytes and an experienced first mate — studied the boat’s deck, a tight and organized chaos of pulleys, sheets, cams, winches, clips and cables. “We’re going to have to tack,” the captain yelled out. Stout little mesas, the first topographic inklings of the badlands to the west, stuck out in silhouette on the land. Stanley Barton, a 39-year-old from Minneapolis who grew up sailing on Lake Michigan, grabbed a sheet, pulling it through at the captain’s request to reposition a sail. Mr. Barton looked out toward the distant hills. “This is beautiful,” he said, “I had no idea the lake would seem so immense.” GEOGRAPHICALLY, western North Dakota is a mixture of rolling grasslands, flat fields and precipitous badlands. Agriculture dominates in the state, but nature preserves and wild lands abound all around Sakakawea, including county-run recreation areas, three state parks and the 15,000-acre Audubon wildlife refuge. In addition, the Corps of Engineers owns much of the land surrounding Sakakawea, keeping the lakeshore almost completely uninhabited. For sailors like Mr. Quinn, Sakakawea’s myriad channels and bays prompt a lifetime of exploration. Tight, long arms of the reservoir, which spread inland like tentacles off the body of the lake, let sailors float into the remote canyons that were flooded a half-century ago when the Garrison Dam was completed. These nautical badlands — scenic and unique to North Dakota — are strange Martian seascapes of tiered and multicolor hills, canyons, hoodoos and ash. Lines of lignite coal lace the hills. Cactuses dot the land. Fossils and petrified trees bake in the summer sun. The pumice stones of the region, airy and million-holed volcanic creations, actually float on water. At 4 p.m., still cruising the open lake but nearing an inlet at the eastern edge of the badlands, Mr. Quinn called out for the crew’s attention. The water ahead was shallow and dangerous. He needed help watching to make sure the keel did not strike bottom. The Sovereign sailed into a narrow channel at the back of a bay, a stratified butte looming hundreds of feet overhead. Depth gauge readings ticked off, decreasing from 12 feet to 10, 8, 7. Large cliffs, shaggy with dust and debris, all limestone and dirt and ash, crumbled in the sun. “We’re going to pull in here for a break,” Mr. Quinn said, spinning the wheel a few degrees to port and nudging the craft toward shore. Grass clung to a steep bank ahead. A pelican, slow and primeval, an archaeopteryx in the air, came down to land in the water near the boat. Dirt sloughed off at a small ravine, tinting Sakakawea’s clear blue with a ribbon of murky red. Mr. Quinn signaled for the anchor to be dropped, and the Sovereign coasted to a standstill, its crew quiet and paused. The pelican bobbed on the water ahead, a wet beak downturned and tucked in. An old cormorant adrift in the shadow of a mesa, turning a wary eye to five strange sailors — a bird at rest for a moment in its bay, pausing before flapping and taking off, flying low past the boat and toward the deep waters beyond.

790-> Brooklyn: Teenager Dies Climbing Fence
A Brooklyn teenager died last night after he hit his head while trying to climb a fence in front of a school in Ditmas Park, and the police said he may have been electrocuted. Luis Rivera, 17, of Rugby Road, was found unconscious shortly before 8 p.m. with head injuries in front of Public School 217 near the intersection of Newkirk and Coney Island Avenues, according to the police. He was taken to Maimonides Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Consolidated Edison employees were at the scene last night trying to determine whether he had been electrocuted, the police said.

President Bush has appointed a conservative television producer to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The appointee, Warren Bell, executive producer of ABC’s “According to Jim,” was first nominated by President Bush in June. In September, his nomination was pulled from the agenda of a Senate committee because of some lawmakers’ concerns about Mr. Bell’s background. In May 2005 he described himself as “thoroughly conservative in ways that strike horror into the hearts of my Hollywood colleagues.” Because Congress is in recess, Mr. Bush can appoint Mr. Bell without its approval.

793-> Quality Check
To the Editor: Today's brides and bridegrooms would be well served to consult product reviews in Consumer Reports and Cook's Illustrated prior to registering. Often there are low-cost kitchen items that significantly outperform their higher-priced rivals. Another piece of advice: I wish I had paid less attention to the quality of my cookware and more attention to the quality of my bridegroom. Perhaps if I had done so, I would still be married (but at least I got to keep the popover pan). AMY GLASER Rockville, Md.

794-> Scorsese’s Hall of Mirrors, Littered With Bloody Deceit
There are almost as many films fighting in “The Departed” as there are guys slugging it out. First among those films is Martin Scorsese’s cubistic entertainment about men divided by power, loyalty and their own selves. Hovering above that film like a shadow is “Infernal Affairs,” the equally sleek Hong Kong assemblage on which it is based and which serves as one of its myriad doubles. And then there is the film conjured up by Jack, as in Jack Nicholson, who when not serving Mr. Scorsese’s interests with a monstrous leer all but subverts those interests with a greedy, devouring hunger. Each Scorsese film comes freighted with so many expectations, as well as the enormity of his own legend, that it’s a wonder the director can bear the weight. Compared with his last fictional outings, the period story “Gangs of New York” and the Howard Hughes portrait “The Aviator,” this new work feels as light as a feather, or as light as any divertissement from a major filmmaker who funnels his ambitions through genre. What helps make “The Departed” at once a success and a relief isn’t that the director of “Kundun,” Mr. Scorsese’s deeply felt film about the Dalai Lama, is back on the mean streets where he belongs; what’s at stake here is the film and the filmmaking, not the director’s epic importance. In “The Departed” the camera work and cutting feel faster, lower to the ground, more urgent than they have in his recent films. (Michael Ballhaus shot it; Thelma Schoonmaker edited.) The speed and Mr. Scorsese’s sureness of touch, particularly when it comes to carving up space with the camera, keep the plot’s hall of mirrors from becoming a distraction. There simply isn’t time to think about the story and whether any of it makes sense, including the astonishing coincidences involving its stealth doppelgängers: Matt Damon’s Colin Sullivan, a bad guy who goes undercover in Boston as a state police officer, and Leonardo DiCaprio’s Billy Costigan, a state cop who infiltrates the underworld. Strangers to each other, Colin and Billy are brothers of a kind when it comes to Frank Costello, the gangster played by Mr. Nicholson. The evil this man does and portends is laid out with precision timing in the hair-raising opening minutes. As the Rolling Stones wail on the soundtrack (“War, children, it’s just a shot away”), Frank moves through the shadows, his face almost entirely obscured. Dispensing Sun Tzu-like truths as if they were Pez candies, he sets his sights on little Colin Sullivan who, with eyes wide as plates, listens rapt. Frank buys the boy groceries, then leans into the girl behind the store counter, whispering something in her ear. (Her face says it’s something dirty.) Minutes later Colin (now played by Mr. Damon) has graduated from the police academy and is thanking Frank for his graduation gift. With a bag of food, the bad man has bought a soul. Mr. Damon enters the story about the same time that Mr. Nicholson exits the shadows. Too bad he doesn’t stay there until the final credits. This Janus-like actor has long presented two faces for the camera, the jester called Jack and the actor named Nicholson. He has worn both faces for some of his famous roles, but over time he has grown fond of the outsize persona called Jack, with his shades and master-of-ceremonies sneer, and it’s hard not to think that the man has become his mask. Mr. Nicholson has some choice moments in “The Departed”: he owns the thrilling opening minutes and is persuasively unnerving in his early scenes with Billy, whom he only knows as a neighborhood loser ripe for the plucking. But as the story twists and twists some more, Mr. Nicholson begins to mix too much Jack into his characterization. In Alexander Payne’s “About Schmidt,” he plays a man whose tamped-down disappointment meant that he had to pull the performance from deep inside; he committed to the part without the help of his sidekick persona. In “The Departed” he’s playing bigger and badder than life with engines roaring. It’s a loud, showy performance. Frank even comes equipped with a trove of gaudy accouterments: a goatee like an arrow, a leopard-print robe, a bevy of babes, a severed hand and a ridiculous fake phallus. Another actor might wear these accessories; Mr. Nicholson upstages them. Mr. Scorsese, no wallflower himself, spends a lot of time vying for attention with his famous star. Mr. Damon and Mr. DiCaprio serve him better. Mr. Damon does some very good work as the buttoned-down gangster hiding a world of darkness behind a facade of normalcy; his boyish looks have rarely looked creepier than when Colin is eagerly doing Frank’s bidding. And Mr. DiCaprio’s own callow looks fit better with his role than they did in either “Gangs of New York” or “The Aviator.” He falls apart nicely, and in the scene in which he stands, anguished and wrung out, over the body of a fallen colleague, you see what Mr. Scorsese might have seen all along: a vulnerability that seems animal-like in its unknowing. The role generally works to Mr. DiCaprio’s strengths since he has to keep a lid on the character and his own tendency to go overly big; even his physical performance, the way his arms and legs jangle, is more controlled. Billy melts down, but he melts slowly, his panic leaking through the cracks opened up by his escalating fear. Terrified that Frank will discover his identity, he unloads on a police shrink (Vera Farmiga, working hard to make a nothing role count), who also happens to be Colin’s girlfriend. The plot thickens, then reaches full boil among further complications, dirty dealings, blood on the floor and excellent performances from Alec Baldwin and Mark Wahlberg (as detectives), who own their every scene. As do the rest of the actors, they prove that what really counts here, in the end, isn’t the film, but all its swaggering men. Fine as Mr. DiCaprio and Mr. Damon are, neither is strong enough to usurp memories of the actors who played the same roles in the original — Tony Leung as the good guy, Andy Lau as the bad — both of whom register with more adult assurance. That’s an observation, not an indictment. Comparisons between “Infernal Affairs” and its redo are unavoidable given how closely the screenwriter William Monahan follows the first film’s beats and scenes. But as fans of “Infernal Affairs” (and its two sequels) know well, the Hong Kong film owes an enormous debt to Mr. Scorsese, whose imprint, along with that of Michael Mann, is all over the trilogy. The Hong Kong and Hollywood action films are themselves doppelgängers of a sort, and Mr. Scorsese, himself larger than life, is one of their biggest, baddest daddies. Directed by Martin Scorsese; written by William Monahan, based on the screenplay for the film “Infernal Affairs”; director of photography, Michael Ballhaus; edited by Thelma Schoonmaker; music by Howard Shore; production designer, Kristi Zea; produced by Brad Pitt, Brad Grey and Graham King; released by Warner Brothers Pictures. Running time: 150 minutes. WITH: Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan), Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan), Jack Nicholson (Frank Costello), Mark Wahlberg (Dignam), Martin Sheen (Queenan), Ray Winstone (Mr. French), Vera Farmiga (Madolyn), Alec Baldwin (Ellerby) and Anthony Anderson (Brown).

795-> Arts, Briefly; Oops! Blogger's Book Makes U-Turn
The entire print run of "The Conservative Soul," a new book by Andrew Sullivan, the blogger and political commentator, is being discarded after Mr. Sullivan, right, spotted a significant production error in the text: half of the fifth chapter had been inserted into the middle of the sixth chapter. Writing on his blog (time.blogs.com/daily--dish), Mr. Sullivan called the mistake "every writer's nightmare, especially as I discovered the error myself while rereading the book late one night last week and couldn't believe my eyes." The finished books were already en route to retailers, so HarperCollins recalled the print run of 26,500, ordered a reprinting and delayed the publication date by one week, to Oct. 10 from Oct. 3. Kate Pruss, a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, said the printer would cover the additional costs. (The total cost of the error has not been determined.) No editorial content will be changed in the reprinted edition, Ms. Pruss said. JULIE BOSMAN

796-> Microsoft Fixing Hole in Media Software
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 13  A solitary computer hacker has entangled Microsoft in a high-stakes battle of wits by repeatedly releasing a free program that strips away the software lock that the company created to protect digital movies and songs from being freely copied by Internet users. While Microsoft has publicly sought to portray the David vs. Goliath contest as a nuisance, the affair escalated to become a genuine challenge to one of the company’s significant businesses this week after the BSkyB, the British satellite broadcaster, suspended its film download service amid fears of illegal copying. The Microsoft system is designed to prohibit Internet users from making illegal copies of movies or songs played in Windows Media 9 or 10 formats. It is used by digital content distributors that include BSkyB, Movielink, RealNetworks and MTV’s Urge music subscription service. In July, the computer programmer, who calls himself Viodentia in Internet postings, released an online tool to remove copy protection from movie and song files. It was a refinement of an existing program, making it easier to use. The program, he stressed, was intended only to enable purchasers of digital media to exercise so-called fair use rights in copying material they had already acquired. Since then, it has been downloaded tens of thousands of times. The cat-and-mouse game began on Aug. 19 when Viodentia released a first version of his program on a series of Web sites around the world. Nine days later, Microsoft responded by patching its system to prevent the hacker’s tool, called FairUse4WM, from working. But within three days a new version of the code-breaking program was circulating, sending Microsoft’s programmers back to the drawing board. The latest version of the hacker’s tool has apparently been more troubling for Microsoft. It has now been 16 days since the company’s last attempt to patch, and Microsoft has still not released a new fix. On Wednesday, the company said it was not ready to announce a date when the service would be patched again. “We are actively working on an update and communicating with our content partners and licensees as we go,” said Marcus Matthias, a senior product manager at Microsoft. Last week the company sent an e-mail message to business customers stating that “we have teams working around the clock” to eliminate the vulnerability. The challenge Microsoft is facing, however, is that the repeated attacks may be undermining the confidence that the music and video industry has in its technology. “It’s impossible to guess whether Microsoft’s next patch will get broken quickly,” said Paul Kocher of Cryptography Research, a security firm based in San Francisco. If it is, he said, “it’ll reinforce the studio perception” that PC-based systems for preventing the illegal copying of media “aren’t ready for prime time.” Analysts said the threat to Microsoft and its licensees might be limited in the short term because the preponderance of high-quality video content is still distributed on DVD rather than by download, and because Apple Computer’s iTunes music service, using a different format, still dominates audio downloads. “The industry’s patience and understanding probably has limitations,” said Mike McGuire, vice president for research for mobile devices and consumer services at Dataquest, a market research firm. The challenge of protecting copy-protection systems is not confined to Microsoft’s software, analysts said. Apple’s FairPlay system for iTunes has been a repeated target of hackers. On Tuesday, hours after Apple released a new version of iTunes, the authors of a program that strips away the FairPlay copy protection had updated their program to work against the new Apple software.

797-> Vermont: Recount Changes Auditor’s Race
A judge has overturned the results of the state auditor’s race after a recount determined that the votes were miscounted. Thomas M. Salmon, a Democrat, was declared the winner by 102 votes over the incumbent, Randy Brock, a Republican. Mr. Salmon was thought to have lost the election by 137 votes, and asked a superior court judge for a recount, which began Dec. 4. Secretary of State Deborah L. Markowitz, who certified the results, said 388 votes that should have been counted for Mr. Salmon were not. Most were accidentally given to a third-party candidate, Ms. Markowitz said.

Floyd Cardoz, the chef at Tabla, always has chutneys on his menu. Now he has bottled them and is selling them to home cooks. There are three vibrant flavors that can top hamburgers, seafood, sandwiches and even scrambled eggs. The tamarind is smooth and tart-sweet. The richness and smoldering heat of the mango will make you forget about the gelatinous versions sold in supermarkets. The tomato kalonji has a spicy bite and a nice textural roughness. The chutneys come in seven-ounce jars and are sold at the restaurant's Bread Bar, 11 Madison Avenue (25th Street) and at Sur La Table stores for $9.99.

799-> Inside the List
On Sunday, Dec. 10, 2000, two days before the Supreme Court decided the election for George Bush, the was already tilting to the right. The No. 1 book on the Times’s list that day was “The O’Reilly Factor.” The No. 1 book on the side? “The Mark,” by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, the eighth novel in their “Left Behind” series about good versus evil in the wake of the rapture. And back then, Bob Woodward had other, less vexing, things on his mind. He held the No. 3 nonfiction spot with a book about the Federal Reserve Board and Alan Greenspan. It seems longer than six years ago. The Bush years have seen waves of pushy best sellers on both sides of the political spectrum, but 2006 was the year the scales tipped decisively against the president. Bill O’Reilly and Ann Coulter and a few other right-leaning commentators had best sellers, but they were swimming against a hard, fast tide. The grim assessments of the president and his administration this year included, in order of their success here: by Bob Woodward (12 weeks on the list and counting), by Thomas E. Ricks (10 weeks), by Ron Suskind (9 weeks), by Michael R. Gordon and Bernard E. Trainor (8 weeks), by Kevin Phillips (8 weeks), by John W. Dean (6 weeks), by Frank Rich (5 weeks), by Madeleine Albright with Bill Woodward (5 weeks), by James Risen (3 weeks), by Michael Isikoff and David Corn (2 weeks) and “A Heckuva Job” by Calvin Trillin (2 weeks). Topping all that off, Barack Obama’s closes the year on top of the nonfiction list. Adding insult to injury, one of this holiday’s most popular literary stocking stuffers was “Bad President,” a book from the people who previously brought us “Bad Cat” and “Bad Dog.” The new book is No. 6 on the “Bad President” isn’t exacting political satire: fans of “The Daily Show” or The Onion probably aren’t the target audience. The jokes here — gag captions that may put you in mind of your high school yearbook — are on the order of printing a photograph of Bush sitting next to a yawning child, over the observation: “I can bore anyone. It’s a gift.” Or a photograph of the president laughing, with the caption: “Can you believe it? I really am the president!” Once in a while the authors crystallize an idea into something that feels almost like wit: “Child informs president he was left behind,” one caption reads. “Bad President,” the authors write in their introduction, isn’t exactly a joke. “We don’t think that George Bush’s presidency is a laughing matter,” they write. “Our hope is that we might soon look back on this maddening time and laugh at jokes that aren’t on us.”

800-> A Southwest Oasis With Plenty of Pines
FOR a long time, Flagstaff was best known as a place you passed through on your way to someplace else. The small city is a stop on Historic Route 66 and is billed as the gateway to the Grand Canyon. True, Flagstaff is less than an hour from the canyon, even closer to the red rocks of Sedona, and is just about two hours north of downtown Phoenix — though, at an elevation of 7,000 feet, the pine-covered terrain could hardly be more different from the desert to its south. Most days more than 100 trains rumble through town. But now Flagstaff, a little college burg where rustic chic is never out of fashion, has itself become a destination, particularly for second-home buyers. Several high-end golf communities are getting the most attention, but for homeowners like Jana Carpenter, a small condominium near the public golf course is just fine. Ms. Carpenter was born and raised in Chicago, and she still spends most of her time there, in a split-level condo on Lake Michigan; she’s the national sales director for UHY Advisors, an accounting firm. Several years ago, Ms. Carpenter swooned over Scottsdale and encouraged her older son to consider applying to a college in Arizona. He wasn’t keen about the heat, but Ms. Carpenter had heard there was a school up north, so the college tour took a detour — to Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. “We were in town 10 minutes, and we were in love,” Ms. Carpenter recalled. In the end, both her sons attended Northern Arizona, and she now owns a one-bedroom condo in Flagstaff, which she visits about six times a year. Midwesterners like Ms. Carpenter and Californians are among the second-home buyers in Flagstaff, and there has been a surge in purchases out of Las Vegas, said Gregg Landauer, an agent with Century 21. But the majority of second-home owners are from the Phoenix area. Temperatures in Flagstaff are typically 30 degrees cooler than in Phoenix, turning a 105-degree nightmare into a 75-degree dream. Ron Shurts, a self-employed financier who owns a second home on the golf course at Pine Canyon, a new development where my own parents recently bought a second home, drives up every summer weekend from Scottsdale. On a Saturday afternoon last summer, Mr. Shurts sat in his dining room, with views of pine trees and bright golf greens disturbed only by the large television set in his living room. A cool breeze blew through open windows and doors. “The tranquillity of being up here is kind of bizarre,” he said. Flagstaff is an outdoor destination, but downtown bookstores, coffeehouses and sushi restaurants mix with the admittedly disproportionate number of sporting goods shops. Local residents boast that there are only a couple of chain stores downtown, and the feel is more organic and independent than in other cities. Although Northern Arizona University just topped out with a record number of students enrolled (more than 20,000), Flagstaff still remains very much a small town. Residents are proud of a new hospital and will also brag that when Barnes & Noble came to town back in 1999, the store was picketed for months. The best restaurant is Josephine’s, which serves modern American fare and is tucked into an old house downtown. Its bar attracts local developers, who are the area’s celebrities. Dress is always casual in Flagstaff — Crocs in summer, hiking boots in winter and a belt if you’re feeling elegant. On weekends, bluegrass bands twang in the town square, and on Thursday nights in summer, there are free movies. On New Year’s Eve, an enormous pine cone drops at midnight from atop a downtown hotel. Flagstaff has a population of around 61,000, but Ms. Carpenter, a self-described “city girl,” said it didn’t feel that small. She likes the diversity of a community that includes university academics, employees from the medical products company W. L. Gore and large numbers of Latinos and American Indians. Ms. Carpenter said she can take a class in African dance or visit the Lowell Observatory. From downtown, it’s a 14-minute drive to the lifts at the Snowbowl ski resort. The most popular park for Frisbee golf is much closer, and many residents can hike through the woods from their back doors. Steve Hjelmstrom lives in Laguna Beach, Calif., and runs a manufacturing company in Huntington Beach whose products include vending machines and auto parts. Several years ago, he started to look around for land as an investment. After considering spots in Florida, Oregon and Utah, he came upon Flagstaff. In 2002, he bought 10 residentially zoned acres on the outskirts of town. He and his family were smitten with Flagstaff, and now plan to build a house there. “If my daughter had her way,” he said, “we’d be living there right now.” She’s 12 and has already decided she wants to attend Northern Arizona University. Her father, a mountain biker, is also thrilled with the restaurants, the bike trails, the elevation and the weather. “It doesn’t get too cold,” he said, “and it doesn’t get too hot.” High temperatures in summer hover around 80 degrees, with late afternoon thunderstorms. In winter, there is an occasional snowstorm. Residents also approve of the town’s efforts to fight sprawl. Because of Lowell Observatory, there are regulations to keep light pollution at a minimum. Obsessive skiers might be frustrated with Flagstaff, depending on the year, because abundant snowfall is never a sure thing. There have been efforts to create artificial snow at Snowbowl, but court battles have blocked that plan so far. Another negative, depending upon your perspective, is air travel. From outside Arizona, it’s best to fly to Phoenix and drive the two hours north, though highway traffic is a growing concern. Mr. Shurts avoids weekend traffic by arriving early and staying late. Ms. Carpenter usually rents a car but recently tried a shuttle and said that it wasn’t bad. And there are plans to expand the region’s airport. While the market has slowed in recent months, prices are still strong compared with those of the last few years. Joe Haughey, a real estate agent and a member of the city council, said Flagstaff has among the highest housing prices in Arizona. Mr. Hjelmstrom paid $180,000 for his property four years ago; he said its value has more than doubled. Mr. Shurts, who was the first homeowner to move into Pine Canyon, paid $849,900 for his three-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom, 3,000-square-foot home. The Pine Canyon sales office estimated that it is now worth about $1.3 million. Ms. Carpenter paid $159,000 in 2005 for her condo, which is 700 square feet with a large balcony. The first apartment-to-condominium conversion, the Arbors, is now under way, with studios (486 square feet), one-bedrooms (675 square feet) and two-bedrooms (926 square feet) from $120,000 to $222,000. Mr. Haughey, who is selling properties for the Arbors project, said it is much needed, not only for second-home owners but for working-class residents. Forest Highlands, an older project similar to Pine Canyon, and Flagstaff Ranch, another new development, are all high-end and have their own golf courses. Pine Canyon homes start at about $950,000, not including a country club membership. Still, Mr. Haughey said, prices are much lower than in other regions. “People from California look at Flagstaff,” he said, “and say, ‘Ooooh, what a deal.’ ”

801-> Museum of Steel: Cartoon History in a Single Bound
BALTIMORE — If Steve Geppi has his way, his new Entertainment Museum will be a cultural institution that children must be dragged out of rather than into. And his idea of children does not mean 12 years old and under. “Whether you’re 8 or 80, you’ll find something here to light you up,” Mr. Geppi said during a recent tour of the museum, which opens here to the public on Sept. 8. The 16,000-square-foot space takes up the second and third floors of the former Camden train station here, whose main floor is home to the Sports Legends at Camden Yards museum. Geppi’s Entertainment Museum celebrates the colorful characters and collectibles that have emerged from comic strips and comic books since the late 1800’s. Its packed displays — of movie posters, animation cels, action figures, board games, advertisements and more — chronicle the evolution of these characters, often reflecting the periods of American history from which they emerged. Mr. Geppi, 56, who owns Diamond Comic Distributors, the largest distributor of English-language comic books, is also the proud owner of every artifact on display. “It’s really fun showing this to people,” he said. “It’s the only time I get to see my stuff.” His goals for the museum reflect his love for his native city as much as his passion for collectibles. “It’s a full-blown metropolis that has the luxury of feeling like a small town,” Mr. Geppi said of Baltimore, as he noted the other cultural attractions that visitors to his museum can enjoy. These include the American Visionary Art Museum, the Babe Ruth Birthplace and Museum and the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African-American History and Culture. Mr. Geppi’s museum shares a historic site with a baseball museum partly because he happens to be a minority owner of the Baltimore Orioles. “It’s purposeful that I mention the other museums,” he said. “We want to be a conduit for people to come to Baltimore, whether it’s by car, by bus, by train.” Mr. Geppi’s enthusiastic appreciation of comic books — “60 years later, comics are finally getting their due,” he said — is evident in the museum’s layout. Most rooms are organized by the era they chronicle, but two rooms stray from that pattern: one will rotate exhibits that highlight a particular artist or theme and the other is devoted to comics that tell “A Story in Four Colors,” as the placard over its entrance declares. This room traces the black-and-white beginnings of comic-strip characters like the Gumps (1917), Winnie Winkle (1920) and Little Orphan Annie (1924), before moving along to the pulps and a large collection of Big Little Books. These pocket-size children’s books measure about 3½ by 4½ inches and feature pictures with facing pages of text. They star the likes of Ellery Queen, G-Man and Captain Midnight, and paved the way for traditional comic books. The collection of comics is boldly colorful, wide-ranging and presented alphabetically within each era. It begins, appropriately enough, with Action Comics No. 1 (1938), the first appearance of Superman. It ends with more contemporary comics, like the gimmicky Superman No. 75 (1992), which chronicled his apparent death and was distributed sealed in black plastic, and the more somber “9-11” (2002), whose proceeds were donated to relief agencies. In between are comics that commemorate the first appearances of Captain America, the Flash, Green Lantern, the Hulk, She-Hulk and Wonder Woman. Like many of the artifacts on display, most of the comics are valuable and kept safely behind glass. But a video kiosk helps circumvent this drawback. Visitors can view Action Comics No. 1 or Superman No. 1 (1939) on a monitor. People can navigate each page with “back” and “forward” options. The presentation uses Mr. Geppi’s vintage copies, so the experience feels authentic: the pages are yellowed with age, the original advertisements are included, and the monitor shows the rise and fall of each page as it is “turned.” Kiosks are placed throughout the museum, each with an interactive offering appropriate to its location. The monitor in the room devoted to the theme “Pioneer Spirit, 1776-1894” displays a video of the museum’s coin-operated banks in motion. Other kiosks offer a trivia quiz, with two levels of difficulty, that is activated by scanning the admission ticket. Those with a passing grade may claim a prize when they exit the museum. Stressing the educational aspects of this pop-culture tour through history is important to Mr. Geppi. So there are plenty of factoids to balance the memorabilia. Outside each room, plaques note the presidents, population, inventions and events of the corresponding time period. Among the first displays inside the “Pioneer Spirit” room is a political cartoon by Benjamin Franklin, published on May 9, 1754, in The Pennsylvania Gazette: the image of a snake in 13 segments, symbolizing the call for the colonies to unite. There is also a display case devoted to the Brownies (1881), believed to be the first characters turned into a merchandising franchise. The potbellied, wild-eyed cast turned up in various publications, most notably St. Nicholas magazine, and their adventures were collected in a hardcover edition, similar to the treatment given popular comic books today. The Brownies appeared on puzzles and building blocks, calendars and rubber stamps. In 1900 Kodak even marketed a camera as the Brownie. More familiar characters turn up in the “Expanding Universe, 1971-1990” room, which spotlights an explosion of merchandising: Star Wars and Transformers action figures, Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and fuzzy Ms. Pac-Man puppets, among others. (There are also some oddities, like a Captain and Tennille doll.) Some of these more recent collectibles were hard to find, but that proved alluring. “It’s the thrill of the hunt: chasing the girl, or the guy, or a dream,” Mr. Geppi said. “The hunt is always more fun than getting there.”

804-> Psychiatric Exam Is Set for Father in Murder Case
A man charged with stabbing his 1-year-old daughter to death must undergo a psychiatric examination before trial, a judge ordered yesterday. The man, Dwayne Palmer, 32, was formally charged in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn with second-degree murder and attempted murder in an attack on his companion, Natasha Martin, and their daughter, Samara Palmer, in Ms. Martin’s apartment in Canarsie early on June 19, during the night after Father’s Day. Ms. Martin’s two sons, who are not fathered by Mr. Palmer, were in the apartment during the attack but were not injured. Mr. Palmer, who was arrested later that morning at his mother’s house, gave a long statement to the police recounting feelings of alienation, routine miscommunications, money problems and perceived slights. In court yesterday, prosecutors filed a summary of his statement, written by the police. “Natasha picked Samara up while he was sleeping and no one said anything to him,” the police wrote. “So he spent Father’s Day by himself.” Mr. Palmer then went to Ms. Martin’s apartment to visit Samara, found the door bolted and “came to the precinct looking for a police escort but could not get one,” he told the police. He returned to the apartment alone and unlocked the door, using a key Ms. Martin did not know he had, prosecutors said. Ms. Martin tried to push the door closed; he was stronger. “He asked her if she loved him and she said no,” the police wrote. “He got a knife from the kitchen area from the knife rack (wood handle). When she said ‘No,’ that she didn’t,’ he snapped. She was on the bed with Samara and he stabbed them. She was telling him she loved him while it was going on. He then left.” In court yesterday, Mr. Palmer wore a trimmed beard, bright orange slippers without laces, and a T-shirt that asked, “Where you at?” He stood quietly and still while his lawyer, Michael A. Millet, entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf and requested the psychiatric tests. The lawyer described a series of hospital stays Mr. Palmer had undergone for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The judge, Matthew J. D’Emic, set a hearing for Sept. 7 on the results of the new psychiatric examination. He ordered Mr. Palmer held in jail, and he issued protection orders for Ms. Martin and her sons. “This is a murder case, Judge,” said an assistant district attorney, Cynthia Lynch, “of a child.”

SOKOLOFF -- Alice Hunt. Died April 29, 2006 in Sun Valley, Idaho. She was born in New York, June 3, 1912, the daughter of the late Dr. James Ramsay Hunt, professor of neurology at Columbia University, who was arguably the pre-eminent neurologist of the 20th century. Her mother was the late Alice St. John Nolan, of Springfield, Illinois. She survived her beloved husband, Dr. Boris Sokoloff, originally of St. Petersburg, Russia, who first came to this country at the invitation of the Rockefeller Institute from the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He also worked at Sloan Kettering and University of Washington Cancer Research Center, authored 27 books, and ended his career as head of The Cancer Research Laboratory at Florida Southern College. He also was editor of the scientific journal, Growth. Her much loved brother was the late James Ramsay Hunt Jr., former intelligence officer with the CIA. She was a loving and beloved mother to Kiril, of Boca Raton, Florida, and Sun Valley, Idaho, and leaves behind her precious grandchildren, Jay and Emily Sokoloff. As the last of her generation by more than 25 years, she was a loving aunt to four nieces and nephews, to whom she was a mainstay of support over the years, and was great-aunt to twelve great-nieces and nephews. Alice was a precocious student, being admitted to Radcliffe when she was only 16. A child of the Depression, she was obliged to leave college after only one year and worked as a researcher and writer in New York City. She was an accomplished pianist and musician who studied composition with Rubin Goldmark and Constantin Shvedoff. She wrote in many different forms and her works include a symphony, several shorter orchestral pieces, three string quartets and works for solo instruments and various chamber groups, several of which have been performed at Carnegie Hall. She was a pupil of Alexander Siloti, considered the greatest pianist of his day as well as a student of Franz Liszt, whose daughter, Cosima Wagner, was the subject of one of Alice's three biographies. Another biography was entitled Hadley: The First Mrs. Hemmingway. It is generally regarded that "A Movable Feast" by Ernest Hemmingway was written by Ernest as a love story for his first wife. The other biography was a riches to rags story, the life of Kate Chase Smith, who was the daughter of Salmon Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, under Lincoln who experienced a tragic fall. For 25 years, Alice wrote classical music reviews for a syndicate of newspapers. In her spare time, she wrote mystery stories, which were published in many popular magazines. When her husband died in 1979, she returned to her roots in Westchester County, where she spent many years as a volunteer in the oncology department of Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco. She considered this the most rewarding work of her life. Sharp until the end, she was passionately interested in current affairs. She considered her childhood summers on the farm in Katonah, New York to have shaped her life. A great dog lover, she took much interest in the myriad canine personalities who became a part of her life over the years. Her loving devotion to and involvement in the lives of the younger members of her family was a sustaining pleasure for her and for them. A memorial service will take place on Saturday, June 3, 2006, 2 P.M. at St. Matthew's Church, in Bedford, New York. Memorial contributions may be made to the Idaho Compassion.

810-> Where There’s Fire, There May Be Heat
WITH winter approaching, homeowners who have fireplaces might consider using them to provide additional heat. In most cases, though, using a traditional fireplace for heat is about as efficient as cooling the house by leaving the refrigerator door open. “Traditional fireplaces are not effective heating systems,” said Alex Wilson, executive editor of Environmental Building News, a newsletter published in Brattleboro, Vt. “In fact, it’s not uncommon for them to lose more heat than they provide.” Even though it might feel warm in front of a fireplace, the system is actually sucking warm indoor air up the chimney and out of the house, he said. And while fireplace doors will cut the loss, Mr. Wilson said, they won’t improve the situation enough to make the fireplace an even remotely efficient source of heat. There are options, though. Tom Oyen, who is president of the Chimney Sweep Online (chimneysweeponline.com), a retailer of hearth products, said one option is a fireplace insert. With an insert, he said, the firebox sits inside the fireplace opening, with the front extending several inches out past the opening. To keep the insert’s heat from being absorbed by the walls of the fireplace and eventually lost, the firebox is encased in a larger metal box (called a plenum) that is vented to the room. The radiant energy “gets reflected back by the plenum, flows out through a vent at the top, and pulls cooler room air in from the bottom,” Mr. Oyen said. In most cases, he said, when installing an insert, it is also necessary to install a chimney liner. “The standard fireplace chimney is going to be way too big to properly vent a wood stove,” he said, adding that the liner is a flexible stainless steel tube about six inches in diameter. The liner is routed down the chimney and connected directly to the stove. A sealer plate at the top of the chimney covers the space between the liner and the chimney walls, thereby allowing for removal of the damper. Depending on size, finishes and decorative elements, fireplace inserts can cost $1,400 to $2,500 or more, not including installation or shipping. Flue liners cost $425 for a 20-foot chimney. Another way to use a fireplace for heat is to install a hearth stove. That is basically a free-standing wood-burning stove installed directly in front of the fireplace opening. Like an insert, it uses the existing flue for its vent. And, as with an insert, this usually means installing a chimney liner. In addition, because the stove sits in front of the fireplace, its vent usually comes out the rear. The most obvious difference between an insert and a hearth stove is the space needed. While the insert takes up little more room than the fireplace itself, a hearth stove takes up a fair amount of space in front of the fireplace and must be set on a noncombustible extension of the hearth. A hearth stove with a rear vent will cost about the same as a similarly sized insert. Another consideration when using either an insert or a hearth stove for heat is the fuel being used. Standard wood stoves, of course, burn logs. And while storage of enough wood to use a stove for heat is possible in rural areas, it may not be convenient in closer quarters. An alternative to logs, though, is pellet fuel. “A pellet stove is great because there is no baby-sitting required,” said Leslie Wheeler, director of communications for the Hearth, Patio and Backyard Association, a trade organization in Arlington, Va. Pellet fuel — which resembles rabbit pellets — is made of recycled sawdust and packaged in 40-pound bags. The stove has a hopper to hold a supply of pellets, and a mechanism to deliver them to the firebox. Pellet stoves range from less than $1,500 to $3,000 or more, and require a source of electricity. Pellets cost about $5 a bag.

811-> Thunder, Rottweilers and Damien at the Zoo in 'The Omen'
When all else fails, pump up the thunder and lightning. That seems to be an operating principle behind the supremely unnecessary remake of "The Omen," the 1976 horror fest that, along with "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist," plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream. The incessant rumbling and flashing that accompanies virtually every other scene underscores the hollowness of a story that in the decades since the original "Omen" has had any freshness trampled out of it by a rampaging army of Freddies, Jasons and Michael Myerses, not to mention assorted "Omen" and "Exorcist" sequels and knockoffs. Another strategy is to empty the dog pound. To go with the thunder and lightning, the movie deploys a veritable kennel of snarling black Rottweilers bounding out of the bowels of hell to announce the presence of Beelzebub. Yet I suppose an "Omen" redux makes sense as a crass gamble in an age of tabloid theology and as a product shrewdly timed to ride on the coattails of "The Da Vinci Code." Its epigraph reads: "From the Eternal Sea he rises/Creating armies on either side/Turning man against his brother/'Til man exists no more." That's what I call Revelation for Dummies. Early in the movie a shot of the World Trade Center in flames, introduced as a portent of Armageddon, sharpens this remake's sour tang of exploitation. Aside from such touches (there's also a Hurricane Katrina devastation shot), the new "Omen," whose screenwriter, David Seltzer, wrote the original, slavishly recycles itself. As before, respectable actors stoop to lend a spurious gravitas to all the muttering and scowling. Assuming the Gregory Peck role of Robert Thorn, the American ambassador to Britain who refuses to believe his wife's hysterical insistence that their demonic little boy, Damien, is the ultimate bad seed, Liev Schreiber labors successfully to keep a straight face. In the Lee Remick role of Robert's wife, Katherine, Julia Stiles has taken another wasteful misstep in her largely mismanaged career; too intelligent and talented for this sort of rubbish, she should be following the same high road as Maggie Gyllenhaal. The casting of Mia Farrow (the mother of "Rosemary's Baby") as Mrs. Baylock, the nanny from hell, lends "The Omen" a twist of gallows humor. Every spoonful of sugar dispensed by this apple-cheeked, sweeter-than-saccharine Mary Poppins is laced with arsenic. Jennings (David Thewlis), the paparazzi snoop whose pictures offer clues to the supernatural shenanigans, is appropriately disheveled. And Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon squander their talents as nostril-flaring loons who know too much for their own good. Directed by John Moore ("Behind Enemy Lines," "Flight of the Phoenix"), "The Omen" is terminally glum and waterlogged (from the downpours with the thunder and lightning). The only smiles to be seen are the faint traces of a smirk on Ms. Farrow's lips as her character carries out the Devil's work. The movie's little jolts are effective for being so sparingly interjected. In the most unsettling scene, Damien's visit to a zoo riles up the animals; a gorilla tries to break out of its cage, and screaming children scatter in panic. The most kinetic sequence is Robert's last mad dash to a church, clutching his screaming boy. A church is the only place where the little demon can be returned to hell. "Get Me to the Church on Time" doesn't begin to describe the horrors that will ensue if he's a split second behind schedule. Opens today nationwide Directed by John Moore; written by David Seltzer; director of photography, Jonathan Sela; edited by Dan Zimmerman; music by Marco Beltrami; production designer, Patrick Lumb; produced by Mr. Moore and Glenn Williamson; released by 20th Century Fox.

812-> The Best Laid Marriage Plans Go Awry, in the Molière Manner
Arnolphe, the protagonist of Molière’s “School for Wives,” hasn’t really thought things out clearly. Terrified of having an unfaithful wife, the sad fate of many of his male acquaintances, he chooses a totally innocent little girl and locks her in a convent for 13 years, keeping her isolated and ignorant until she comes of age, at which time he will marry and mold her. All she needs to know, he believes, is “to pray, to love me, and to stitch and spin.” As the Pearl Theater Company’s pleasant, occasionally quite funny production of this 1662 comedy demonstrates, this plan goes ridiculously awry. Apparently it never occurs to Arnolphe (Dan Daily) that a completely sheltered young woman, not knowing what seduction is, will not know that she is supposed to resist. “A ninny cannot make a fool of me,” Arnolphe patiently explains to his friend Chrysalde (Dominic Cuskern) in the first scene. By the second scene the so-called ninny has already done just that. This production plays with a stereotype, the notion of Asian women as subservient, by casting the lovely Hana Moon as Agnès, Arnolphe’s betrothed. Ms. Moon is quite sympathetic and a satisfying presence to feminists of both sexes when she casually mentions to Arnolphe that she has been visited by a handsome young man, Horace (Noel Vélez), and is in love with him. Arnolphe’s life is further complicated because Horace is the son of a cherished old friend. Mr. Daily, playing a man so foolish that his sexist theories seem harmless, does well at both verbal and physical comedy. The play’s slapstick — directed by Shepard Sobel and enacted mostly by Arnolphe’s dim servants Alain (Bradford Cover) and Georgette (Rachel Botchan) and, in one memorable scene, by the aged, slow-moving Notary (T. J. Edwards, who also plays Horace’s father) — is sometimes strained, sometimes smoothly amusing. Throughout, Molière’s satire is on the side of common sense. The playwright often speaks through Chrysalde, who tells the misguided Arnolphe, “I know a hundred things more terrible” than being a cuckold. One, he adds, would be marrying “a fiend of virtue.”

813-> Online Newspaper Ads Gaining Ground on Print
IN the matchup between the print and online versions of newspapers, signs of the Internet's ascendancy are growing stronger. As Colby Atwood, a newspaper analyst and a vice president at Borrell Associates, put it, "The tail is beginning to wag the dog." According to estimates released on Friday by the Newspaper Association of America, newspaper print ad spending in the first three months of 2006 increased only 0.3 percent, to $10.5 billion, over the corresponding period last year. At the same time, spending for online advertising surged 35 percent. "I think the handwriting is kind of on the wall that there is a large migration to the Web," Mr. Atwood said. "Increasing amounts of revenue and focus should be on the online properties. This is a transition that's taking place over several years here. It's not happening overnight, but it's definitely happening." The numbers are still small compared with print: the first quarter of 2006 produced $613 million in online advertising, up from $454 million in the year-ago period. But it is the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for online ads, according to the association. Analysts say the increases show that newspapers are learning how to harness the potential of online advertising as their print circulation has stumbled. Last month, the Audit Bureau of Circulations released figures showing that in the six-month period that ended in March, daily circulation of American newspapers dropped 2.5 percent, to 45.5 million, over the period a year ago. "I think this industry is in for exceptional long-term growth from online revenue," said Jason E. Klein, the president and chief executive of the Newspaper National Network, a marketing partnership of advertisers and newspapers. Much of the current growth is coming in the technology and automotive categories, he said. Newspapers have been helped by the general growth of online advertising: according to a report issued last week by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers, total Internet advertising revenue reached a record $3.9 billion in the first three months of 2006. But for many newspapers that are still developing an advertising model, online ads are still in their early stages, said Randy Bennett, vice president of audience and new business development for the newspaper association, which is based in Vienna, Va. For now, classified advertising makes up roughly 60 to 70 percent of online advertising for newspapers, Mr. Bennett said. At the same time, Web sites like Craigslist that offer free classifieds are luring advertisers away from sites that charge to place ads. One hope for online newspaper classifieds is the control their staffs can exercise over the content, unlike free sites like Craigslist, which are mostly managed and edited by anonymous users. "I think newspapers will attempt to differentiate their classified products as authentic, reviewed and updated regularly," Mr. Bennett said. "It's a much more authentic database." In addition to classified ads, other opportunities for growth in online advertising include interactive ads, wallpaper ads and ads with streaming video or audio. John Morton, a newspaper industry analyst, noted that newspapers could reap gains as the traffic to their Web sites increased. "The more visitors you get, the higher price you can charge," Mr. Morton said. "And as this transformation continues, the volume will continue to increase." On average, advertising accounts for roughly 75 to 80 percent of a newspaper's total revenue. Mr. Morton estimated that online advertising would make up 6.5 percent of newspapers' total advertising revenue in 2006, up from 5 percent last year. "What a lot of people don't understand about online advertising for newspapers is that it can be highly profitable," he said. And there have been signs that newspaper owners are devoting more resources to their Web sites. Brian P. Tierney, the leader of a group of investors that bought The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Philadelphia Daily News last month, said he planned to improve their Web site with added technology and content. "Right now, the news industry is trying to hold on to the past, and Brian knows that you just can't do it," said Mary Meder, the president of Harmelin Media, a media-buying agency in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. "There's a lot of options out there for advertising, and he has to make his a viable choice."

814-> ‘Sonic Hedgehog’ Sounded Funny, at First
“Lunatic fringe,” “head case” and “one-eyed pinhead” might sound like insults from the schoolyard or talk radio. But these are actually examples of the kind of oddball names that scientists give to genes they discover. The idea is to make the names unique and memorable — with so many genes being discovered and described, a little color helps scientists tell them apart. But the trouble comes when science is transmuted into medicine; what works in the lab may be jarring in the clinic. The names are causing problems for doctors who have to counsel patients about genetic defects with names like “sonic hedgehog” and “mothers against decapentaplegia.” “It’s a serious problem,” said Dr. Sue Povey, a professor of biology at University College London, and head of the genome nomenclature committee of the Human Genome Organization. Her group is renaming some of the most objectionable names, in some cases by requiring that they be referred to by their initials, to render them inoffensive. The move was first reported by the journal Nature. Dr. Chris Doe, a professor of biology at the University of Oregon who specializes in the genetics of the fruit fly, or drosophila, noted that evolution is conservative: a gene that works in one creature is likely to be found in others, and so a version of a gene discovered in the fruit fly or zebra fish may well be found in humans. Many of those genes were given weird names when first discovered. Scientists have come up with names for genes in fruit flies, for example, that may be mystifying (“faint sausage,” “fear of intimacy”), cute (“tribbles,” “groucho” and “smurf”), or macabre (“sex lethal” and “death executioner Bcl-2.”) Dr. Doe said that while he considers himself a fan of colorful gene names — and gives his own discoveries the names like Prospero and Miranda, from Shakespeare’s “Tempest” — he recognizes the potential danger. A gene with a funny name may be linked to a medical condition that can be heartbreaking. The human variant of the fruit fly’s “hedgehog” gene, known as “sonic hedgehog” after the video-game character, has been linked to a condition known as Holoprosencephaly, which can result in severe brain, skull and facial defects. “It’s a cute name when you have stupid flies and you call it a ‘turnip,’ ” Dr. Doe said. “When it’s linked to development in humans, it’s not so cute any more.” Dr. Povey said that a doctor with a good bedside manner could get around the problems caused by whimsical or offensive gene names by explaining the history and function of the names to patients. But, she said, it is simpler to make a change that avoids the rocky situation altogether. Still, she added, she has run into some resistance from the genes’ discoverers. “People get to be very, very fond of the names of things they’ve discovered,” she said. “They don’t like somebody who doesn’t know much about it telling them what to call it.”

818-> Going for Game
Scott Willman, 55, a real estate agent from Three Lakes, Wis. 3-bedroom house Piehl Township, Wis., 140 miles northwest of Green Bay I’ve owned this house for nine years. I bought it because owning the land, of course, means that I can control it and manage the wildlife. Not to mention that with 212 acres, I don’t have to compete on public land with other hunters. I keep a garden at this house, so I visit the property in the warmer months. But come fall, this is a hunting cabin for me. Grouse season started already, but I’ve found that it really doesn’t pay to start hunting grouse until the leaves fall off the trees. Deer season began in September, but only bow hunting is permitted now. During the nine-day gun season in November, friends usually join me. Gun season means hunting dawn to dusk, but in bow season I find that the last two hours of the day are almost as good as the first two hours. That’s good news because I’ve realized I’m too old to get up when it’s still dark outside. Bad weather can throw off a day, and late in the season there can be snow so deep you can’t move around. But the worst is the wolves. If they come in you won’t see a single deer. This house is only about 12 miles from my primary home, but when I come here I really feel as if I’m getting away from everything. The house doesn’t have water, so I have to bring in my own. And a little TV here gets just one station, which is never the one with the football game. Of course, some of the hunting camps in this area have been up here for more than 100 years, and by those standards, my place is luxurious.

820-> After the Bell Curve
When it comes to explaining the roots of intelligence, the fight between partisans of the gene and partisans of the environment is ancient and fierce. Each side challenges the other’s intellectual bona fides and political agendas. What is at stake is not just the definition of good science but also the meaning of the just society. The nurture crowd is predisposed to revive the War on Poverty, while the hereditarians typically embrace a Social Darwinist perspective. A century’s worth of quantitative-genetics literature concludes that a person’s I.Q. is remarkably stable and that about three-quarters of I.Q. differences between individuals are attributable to heredity. This is how I.Q. is widely understood — as being mainly “in the genes” — and that understanding has been used as a rationale for doing nothing about seemingly intractable social problems like the black-white school-achievement gap and the widening income disparity. If nature disposes, the argument goes, there is little to be gained by intervening. In their 1994 best seller, “The Bell Curve,” Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray relied on this research to argue that the United States is a genetic meritocracy and to urge an end to affirmative action. Since there is no way to significantly boost I.Q., prominent geneticists like Arthur Jensen of Berkeley have contended, compensatory education is a bad bet. But what if the supposed opposition between heredity and environment is altogether misleading? A new generation of studies shows that genes and environment don’t occupy separate spheres — that much of what is labeled “hereditary” becomes meaningful only in the context of experience. “It doesn’t really matter whether the heritability of I.Q. is this particular figure or that one,” says Sir Michael Rutter of the University of London. “Changing the environment can still make an enormous difference.” If heredity defines the limits of intelligence, the research shows, experience largely determines whether those limits will be reached. And if this is so, the prospects for remedying social inequalities may be better than we thought. When quantitative geneticists estimate the heritability of I.Q., they are generally relying on studies of twins. Identical twins are in effect clones who share all their genes; fraternal twins are siblings born together — just half of their genes are identical. If heredity explains most of the difference in intelligence, the logic goes, the I.Q. scores of identical twins will be far more similar than the I.Q.’s of fraternal twins. And this is what the research has typically shown. Only when children have spent their earliest years in the most wretched of circumstances, as in the infamous case of the Romanian orphans, treated like animals during the misrule of Nicolae Ceausescu, has it been thought that the environment makes a notable difference. Otherwise, genes rule. Then along came Eric Turkheimer to shake things up. Turkheimer, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia, is the kind of irreverent academic who gives his papers user-friendly titles like “Spinach and Ice Cream” and “Mobiles.” He also has a reputation as a methodologist’s methodologist. In combing through the research, he noticed that the twins being studied had middle-class backgrounds. The explanation was simple — poor people don’t volunteer for research projects — but he wondered whether this omission mattered. Together with several colleagues, Turkheimer searched for data on twins from a wider range of families. He found what he needed in a sample from the 1970’s of more than 50,000 American infants, many from poor families, who had taken I.Q. tests at age 7. In a widely-discussed 2003 article, he found that, as anticipated, virtually all the variation in I.Q. scores for twins in the sample with wealthy parents can be attributed to genetics. The big surprise is among the poorest families. Contrary to what you might expect, for those children, the I.Q.’s of identical twins vary just as much as the I.Q.’s of fraternal twins. The impact of growing up impoverished overwhelms these children’s genetic capacities. In other words, home life is the critical factor for youngsters at the bottom of the economic barrel. “If you have a chaotic environment, kids’ genetic potential doesn’t have a chance to be expressed,” Turkheimer explains. “Well-off families can provide the mental stimulation needed for genes to build the brain circuitry for intelligence.” This provocative finding was confirmed in a study published last year. An analysis of the reading ability of middle-aged twins showed that even half a century after childhood, family background still has a big effect — but only for children who grew up poor. Meanwhile, Turkheimer is studying a sample of twins who took the National Merit Scholarship exam, and the results are the same. Although these are the academic elite, who mostly come from well-off homes, variations in family circumstances still matter: children in the wealthiest households have the greatest opportunity to develop all their genetic capacities. The better-off the family, the more a child’s genetic potential is likely to be, as Turkheimer puts it, “maxed out.” n seeking to understand the impact of nature and nurture on I.Q., researchers have also looked at adopted children. Consistent with the proposition that intelligence is mainly inherited, these studies have almost always found that adopted youngsters more closely resemble their biological than their adoptive parents. Such findings have supported the assumption that changing a child’s life circumstances won’t alter the hard facts of nature. But researchers in France noted a shortcoming in these adoption studies and set out to correct it. Since poor families rarely adopt, those investigations have had to focus only on youngsters placed in well-to-do homes. What’s more, because most adopted children come from poor homes, almost nothing is known about adopted youngsters whose biological parents are well-off. What happens in these rare instances of riches-to-rags adoption? To answer that question, two psychologists, Christiane Capron and Michel Duyme, combed through thousands of records from French public and private adoption agencies. “It was slow, dusty work,” Duyme recalls. Their natural experiment mimics animal studies in which, for instance, a newborn rhesus monkey is taken from its nurturing biological mother and handed over to an uncaring foster mother. The findings are also consistent: how genes are expressed depends on the social context. Regardless of whether the adopting families were rich or poor, Capron and Duyme learned, children whose biological parents were well-off had I.Q. scores averaging 16 points higher than those from working-class parents. Yet what is really remarkable is how big a difference the adopting families’ backgrounds made all the same. The average I.Q. of children from well-to-do parents who were placed with families from the same social stratum was 119.6. But when such infants were adopted by poor families, their average I.Q. was 107.5 — 12 points lower. The same holds true for children born into impoverished families: youngsters adopted by parents of similarly modest means had average I.Q.’s of 92.4, while the I.Q.’s of those placed with well-off parents averaged 103.6. These studies confirm that environment matters — the only, and crucial, difference between these children is the lives they have led. A later study of French youngsters adopted between the ages of 4 and 6 shows the continuing interplay of nature and nurture. Those children had little going for them. Their I.Q.’s averaged 77, putting them near retardation. Most were abused or neglected as infants, then shunted from one foster home or institution to the next. Nine years later, they retook the I.Q. tests, and contrary to the conventional belief that I.Q. is essentially stable, all of them did better. The amount they improved was directly related to the adopting family’s status. Children adopted by farmers and laborers had average I.Q. scores of 85.5; those placed with middle-class families had average scores of 92. The average I.Q. scores of youngsters placed in well-to-do homes climbed more than 20 points, to 98 — a jump from borderline retardation to a whisker below average. That is a huge difference — a person with an I.Q. of 77 couldn’t explain the rules of baseball, while an individual with a 98 I.Q. could actually manage a baseball team — and it can only be explained by pointing to variations in family circumstances. Taken together, these studies show that the issue has changed: it is no longer a matter of whether the environment matters but when and how it matters. And poverty, quite clearly, is an important part of the answer. That is not to say that an affluent home is necessarily a good home. A family’s social standing is only a proxy for the time and energy needed to keep a youngster mentally engaged, as well as the social capital that helps steer a child to success. There are, of course, many affluent parents who do a bad job of raising their children, and many poor families who nurture their kids with care and intelligence. On average, though, well-off households have the resources needed to provide better settings for the fullest development of a child’s natural abilities. In “Meaningful Differences in the Everyday Experience of Young American Children,” the University of Kansas psychologists Betty Hart and Todd Risley find that by the time they are 4 years old, children growing up in poor families have typically heard a total of 32 million fewer spoken words than those whose parents are professionals. That language gap translates directly into stunted academic trajectories. Is there a way to reduce such gaps? In recent years, the case for investing in early-childhood education has become stronger and stronger. The federal Early Head Start program for infants and toddlers is effective when it is well implemented — in part because it succeeds in getting parents more involved with their children. Recent research also shows that one year of high-quality state prekindergarten can give children as much as a seven-month advantage in vocabulary; this, in turn, is a good predictor of how well they will read when they are in primary school. As you would expect, poor children benefit the most, especially when they are in classes with middle-class youngsters. The push for universal preschool is not a red-state-blue-state issue; the pioneers in the area are Oklahoma and Georgia, not generally known for social progressivism. And with the support of business groups and prominent philanthropists like Susan Buffett, the daughter of Warren Buffett, it may enter the national agenda. If it does, it will be a small step toward a society in which not only the most fortunate children will be able to “max out” their potential.

821-> Saying Farewell To a Supermarket
To the Editor: I read with regret of the projected closing of the Western Beef supermarket on 14th Street and Ninth Avenue ("Got Beef? Not Anymore," Dec. 25). While I consider myself a "grocery aficionado," I can't be the only one for whom the chain's "wonderfully odd" logo is irrelevant. What matters far more is that with the disappearance of the supermarket -- whose presence on the block is the last, somewhat raffish, down-at-the-heels bastion of an older kind of "normal" -- the neighborhood will have become all glitzed out and, for some of us, even less appealing.

822-> Researchers Yearn to Use AOL Logs, but They Hesitate
When AOL researchers released three months’ worth of users’ query logs to a publicly accessible Web site late last month, Jon Kleinberg, a professor of computer science at Cornell, downloaded the data right away. But when a firestorm over privacy breaches erupted, he decided against using it. “Now it’s sitting there, in cold storage,” said Professor Kleinberg, who works on algorithms for understanding the structure of the Web and searching it. “The number of things it reveals about individual people seems much too much. In general, you don’t want to do research on tainted data.” After the data was released for academic researchers like Professor Kleinberg to work with, many were torn, loath to conduct research with it as they balanced a chronic thirst for useful data against concerns over individual privacy. It is one of the frustrations of being an academic researcher in a world that has grown highly commercial. Data is everywhere, but there is precious little of it for university researchers to work with. Raw data about people’s online behavior — the grist for many an academic researcher’s mill — remains locked up inside large companies, accessible only to a subset of corporate researchers. The AOL incident has set off a flurry of divergent opinions in the academic community over the appropriateness of using the data for academic research. Some see the data as too valuable to withhold altogether. “One of the biggest problems is trying to get real data,” said Christopher Manning, an assistant professor of computer science and linguistics at Stanford University. Although the 650,000 AOL users were not personally identified in the data, the logs contained enough information to discern an individual’s identity in some cases. AOL quickly withdrew the data from its research Web site, but not before it had been downloaded, reposted and made searchable at a number of Web sites. And on Monday, the company dismissed Abdur Chowdhury, the researcher who posted the data, along with another employee. Maureen Govern, AOL’s chief technology officer, resigned. Academia has a longstanding disadvantage when it comes to raw data. While fresh data sets are routinely made available to researchers at large companies like Google, academia has largely made do with the same two sets of search data — one from Excite and one from Alta Vista — for nearly 10 years. Meanwhile, a virtual eternity has elapsed and those two data sets have long outlived their usefulness. “The way people use search engines now is totally different,” Professor Kleinberg said. “Partly because what you expected to get out of a search engine back then was much less, so people didn’t try anything too fancy.” While acknowledging “genuine privacy concerns,” Professor Manning said, “I think it’s fair to say that given researchers’ craving for data, having the AOL data available is a great boon for research.” Professor Manning, who has downloaded a copy of the AOL data set but has no immediate plans to work with it, added that the trove of raw research material represented by the AOL data “obviates the need for anyone to worry about getting data for a while.” William W. Cohen, an associate research professor in the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, said the AOL query logs could be invaluable for researchers working in the field of personalization. “Someone’s past search history can tell you a lot about what they’re interested in,” he said. Professor Cohen, who takes annual vacations near Charleston, S.C., used himself as an example. “By knowing what someone searched for in the past, you can do a lot better at answering a query,” he said. “If you look at my recent searches, they might have something to do with vacation homes, Folly Beach and car rentals. So if I search for seafood restaurants, it’s more likely I’ll be looking for one in the Charleston area, and if I say ‘Charleston,’ it’s much more likely to be South Carolina than West Virginia.” At the same time, Professor Cohen shares Professor Kleinberg’s view about the AOL query logs. “I would feel personally uncomfortable looking too closely at searches showing things like marriages breaking up,” he said. “I don’t want to do research in order to see if my algorithms are working correctly, while delving into the details of people’s lives.” Professor Cohen said that although he might eventually do research on the data set, “the privacy issues are something I’d have to think through very carefully.” Companies occasionally mete data out to academic researchers. Microsoft has done this, but in a controlled fashion. Yahoo shares some statistical data with researchers who are approved case by case through an internal vetting program, according to Joanna Stevens, a company spokeswoman, but query data, she said, has never been distributed. Asked about its policy, Google issued a statement that said, “Our current policy is not to release queries or personal data to researchers outside of the company.” Oren Etzioni, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said that shortly after the news of the privacy violations surfaced, he had lunch with Dr. Chowdhury and two of Dr. Chowdhury’s colleagues. Professor Etzioni said Dr. Chowdhury was horrified by what had happened. “He didn’t anticipate that this kind of data could be used to track down individuals.” Dr. Chowdhury declined to comment, at the advice of his lawyer. The release of the AOL query logs coincided with a global conference in Seattle of information retrieval researchers, and it prompted heated discussions among those in attendance. Among them was Jamie Callan, an associate professor in the school of computer science at Carnegie Mellon and chairman of the Association for Computing Machinery’s special-interest group on information retrieval, which organized the conference. Professor Callan said that although no one disagreed on the importance of protecting privacy, “there’s also a strong belief that it is very important for the scientific community to have access to data of this kind in some anonymized form.” The last similar case involved a set of hundreds of thousands of internal e-mail messages from Enron, posted in 2003 on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s Web site, in connection with the agency’s investigation into the company. Although some of the e-mail was relevant to the investigation, most of it was not. So hungry were researchers for a coherent body of e-mail messages to work with that they were able to set aside their concerns that the privacy of many people who had nothing to do with the Enron scandal was severely compromised. “Researchers glommed onto it,” Professor Manning said. “It was enormously good for academic research for all kinds of things you might want to do, like social network analysis.” Several research papers have emerged in the years since the Enron e-mail corpus was released, and it remains the only large body of actual e-mail in the public domain. “It seems this AOL data is creating more of a stir,” Professor Manning said. Where the release of the Enron e-mail was justified as shedding light on corporate wrongdoers, “the AOL data is more like a real violation.” Professor Etzioni and others say one partial solution to heightened privacy concerns could lie in more stringent “scrubbing” of data in a way that did not diminish its quality as a research tool. This could entail, for instance, replacing numbers that carry identifying information — like Social Security numbers and ZIP codes — with zeros, or replacing the word “New York” with “X17.” To a researcher, Professor Etzioni said, “it doesn’t matter so much that it’s New York as X17.” Professor Kleinberg said he hoped that over time, the AOL incident would lead to “a richer, more informed discussion about what it means to create data sets that are clean and anonymized.” Still, a freeze on all data distribution is likely to be in effect for the foreseeable future. Professor Etzioni said that over lunch with the AOL researchers, he had mentioned that for his own research, he was interested in a data set containing queries starting with “Wh,” to signify that a question was being asked. Such data need not be tied to an individual to be useful as a research tool. “We build technology that answers questions,” he said. “So we want to test it on actual questions people are asking.” The AOL researchers told Professor Etzioni they would get approval from the company and send him a compact disc containing the question set. But Professor Etzioni is not holding out much hope of receiving the data. “I don’t think that CD is in the mail,” he said, “and that’s too bad.”

824-> WTA Tour Signs On With Vitamin Supplier
The WTA Tour has entered into a three-year agreement with a Salt Lake City-based company, Usana Health Sciences, to provide athletes with nutritional supplements that are guaranteed to conform to the Tour’s antidoping policy. In light of high-profile doping violations in other sports, the WTA Tour said it sought to reassure its athletes that the products they used were safe. If a player tests positive for a banned substance while using Usana products, the company said, it would double her previous year’s prize money, up to $1 million, as well as offer indemnity to the Tour. “We had always advised players against taking nutritional supplements,” Larry Scott, the chief executive of the WTA Tour, said yesterday. “We were trying to be responsive to something our players wanted us to pursue for a long time, which is to be able to give them a guarantee and comfort from a vitamin company that they could take a vitamin without violating our stringent antidoping code.” After winning her opening-round match yesterday at the Pilot Pen tournament in New Haven, Lindsay Davenport said: “It will put my mind at ease. I am absolutely paranoid about anything I take. Besides Advil and Gatorade, I don’t take anything.” She added: “That would definitely make me feel better if they can tell me it’s true, for sure. It’s really hard, there is no question. Being under the scrutiny we are under, there is nothing you can take.” One WTA player is under suspension for a drug violation. Sesil Karatantcheva of Bulgaria was barred for two years in January after twice testing positive for the steroid nandrolone. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the suspension last month. Scott said he would discuss the new agreement with his players in a meeting before the United States Open next week. The WTA Tour is following the National Football League, which in 2004 began a program to certify supplement makers. Scott said the WTA Tour chose Usana, a company that has been manufacturing supplements for athletes since 1992, because it has worked with elite athletes and adheres to strict quality control. Alan Bergstrom, Usana’s vice president for customer service, said yesterday that the company had provided its products to 40 athletes at the Turin Olympics and that it worked with various sports operations, including the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.

826-> In 'Arabian Night,' the Elevator's Acting Odd. So Are the Tenants.
For about two minutes it looks as if Roland Schimmelpfennig's "Arabian Night" is about a minor apartment-building crisis (no water above the seventh floor and a balky elevator). But when the building super begins to investigate, things turn strange fast. For instance, the play's five characters rarely speak to one another. They talk to themselves instead, usually just describing the action and their thoughts. At one point Peter Karpati (Brandon Miller), a peeping-Tom neighbor, says: "What am I doing here? I'm standing in a strange apartment beside a sleeping woman who's got practically no clothes on." The sleeping woman is Franziska Dehke (Jicky Schnee), a pale, dazed and confused blonde. She has an energetic roommate, Fatima Mansur (Roxanna Hope), whose devoted boyfriend, Kalil (Piter Marek), comes over every night after Franziska has conked out on the sofa. On this particular night Hans Lomeier (Stelio Savante), the super, stops by too, and gets a kiss. Then, little by little, everything becomes clear, explaining the play's title in an unexpectedly literal way. There is a reason Franziska sleeps so much, has memory problems and makes Turkish coffee every morning. There is a reason Fatima, who will soon be chasing Kalil with a knife, carries so many keys. Hans takes a quick trip to the desert. Peter has an unfortunate experience with a brandy bottle. And we meet, secondhand, a European couple who are truly sorry they ever decided to vacation in Istanbul. This is a one-act German play, cleverly translated by David Tushingham, and described in promotional materials as "an erotic urban fantasy." Really, it's not that erotic (although Ms. Schnee's lingerie is awfully sheer, and Kalil does appear, at one point, to make love to a slinky dress). It's just a highly entertaining piece of silliness with an exotic undercurrent. The New York production, acted with delightfully subtle humor, is directed by Trip Cullman with a confident, playful stylishness.

827-> QUICK BITE/Goshen; Standing Room Only
If you've ever tasted the seductively smoked sausages, bacon, beef, pork, pheasant or other game birds from Nodine's Smokehouse, you'll understand why people stand three-deep in line for sandwiches and soup at the company's retail outlet, Nodine's Gourmet Store, on a country road in Goshen. The smoky products developed by Ronald and Johanne Nodine (pronounced NO-dine) and their son, Calvin, are now processed in Torrington, but many customers pick up their orders at the store to save shipping charges. Located in a converted dairy barn on the 10-acre Nodine farm, the rustic store has a large meat-and-cheese display counter and shelves lined with specialty jams, crackers and other select foods. The hearty soups ($4 a cup, $11 a quart) include French market (beans with ham hock, smoked chicken breast and Cajun sausage), harvest (sweet Italian sausage, corn, tomato and cabbage), and gumbo (andouille sausage, chicken breast, tasso ham, and rice). The lunchtime clientele is eclectic: construction workers from nearby Torrington, tourists on leaf-peeping excursions, Litchfield residents picking up smokehouse orders and lunching at the same time. They come in for the generously layered sandwiches ($5 to $7) of roast beef, pastrami or ham on hard rolls, and fancier combinations like smoked turkey on German rye with cranberry-orange relish; or Bayou bacon, with provolone cheese melt; or, my favorite, barbecue beef with peppers, onions and barbecue sauce on a sesame bun. The desserts, like oversize oatmeal-raisin or chocolate chip cookies or cinnamon walnut sticks, are baked from scratch daily on the premises. Ten-inch pies ($10) are also available. There are no tables inside, but outside are three picnic tables and benches where in clement weather you can enjoy the farm views while munching. The store is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday. Nodine's Gourmet Store, North Street (Route 63 North), Goshen; (860) 491-4009; www.nodinesmokehouse.com.

828-> ‘American Idols Live,’ at Continental Airlines Arena and Nassau Coliseum
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J., July 13 — Usually these “Idols Live” concerts are pretty predictable. You get one “American Idol” winner and a whole bunch of, um, nonwinners, singing well-known songs without, to say the least, improving upon them; you get preteenagers and their minders, screaming contentedly. But Thursday’s concert at Continental Airlines Arena, starring finalists from the 2006 season, was something else altogether. Two of the singers found effective ways to make an impression: one wasn’t, it seemed, all there; the other wasn’t there at all. Let’s start with Taylor Hicks, the 2006 winner. His partisans showed up in T-shirts that advertised his gang, the Soul Patrol. (You’ll be relieved to hear that despite the presence of these hooligans, there were no reports of violence.) But their fearless leader didn’t seem fit for command. Mr. Hicks, a 29-year-old white guy with graying hair, is dedicated to an oddly old-fashioned version of soul music; he often adds a few grunts and exclamations to prove he’s feeling it. But on Thursday, he offered almost nothing but grunts and exclamations. One chestnut after another — “Sweet Soul Music,” “Jailhouse Rock,” “Don’t Let Me Down” — met the same gruesome fate. He rephrased some songs, delivering the lyrics in gulps, and often made the words nearly unintelligible. The response from the Patrollers was, by the evening’s standards, muted. (That is, less than ear-splitting.) And, feeling doubly patriotic perhaps, he dedicated a wobbly “Do I Make You Proud” to “all our troops overseas, and abroad.” He seemed pretty loose, even compared to his TV appearances. Who knows? Maybe he’s been working too hard, or playing too hard. In any case, Mr. Hicks’s performance was memorable. That’s more than you can say about Elliott What’s-His-Name’s rendition of the Luther Vandross hit “Never Too Much.” At least Chris Daughtry, the clear fan favorite, sounded as if he were having fun as he howled an energetic “Whole Lotta Love.” He makes a more appealing rock Idol than Bo Bice. (Remember him?) And let’s pause, too, to salute Kellie Pickler, who chirpily reminded fans of her recent past as “a roller-skatin’ waitress at Sonic.” She has a small but loud voice, improved by a winsome twang, and her set filled the room with a faint but unmistakable whiff of sleaze. Between her tight corset (“Don’t let it fool you — I got a lot sucked up in here”) and her brief bump-and-grind routine, she threatened to nudge a G-rated concert into PG territory. Near the end, Mr. Hicks took a break as the other singers gathered for “We Are the Champions.” (What, didn’t they watch the show?) There were eight instead of the scheduled nine because Katharine McPhee, the runner-up, had called in sick. “She’s got laryngitis,” Mr. Daughtry explained, prompting a gruff rejoinder from a man in the crowd: “Like hell she does!” (Suffice it to say that among “Idol” devotees, there is some skepticism about the diagnosis.) No matter: Mr. Daughtry and three other guys sang the Guns N’ Roses ballad “Patience” for her. As they crooned, images of Ms. McPhee filled the screen: she didn’t even show up and she got a video tribute. Must be doing something right.

830-> Unfair Play
IN his provocative, passionate, important and disturbing book — part memoir, part history, part journalism — William C. Rhoden, a sports columnist for The New York Times, builds a historical framework that both accounts for the varieties of African-American athletic experience in the past and continues to explain them today. First, he wants to recast black sports history, transforming it from “the inspirational reel” featuring Jackie Robinson, Arthur Ashe and the later Muhammad Ali into “a more complicated tale of continuous struggle, a narrative of victory and defeat.” His alternative narrative focuses on the stories of successful African-American athletes who so wanted to be accepted by white society that they failed “to anticipate, plan and organize,” maintained their “wholesale dependence on a racist white power structure,” and showed “surprise and consternation when the money and support” were withdrawn. Even black athletic institutions like Negro league baseball in the 1940’s and historically black colleges in the 1960’s complacently, and fatally, assumed that segregation would assure them a steady supply of athletes. Second, Rhoden argues convincingly that integration posed relatively few problems for the white sports world, which quickly gained access to a huge pool of cheap talent, but that it precipitated a disaster for a “black industry, practically eliminating every black person involved in sports — coaches, owners, trainers, accountants, lawyers, secretaries and so on — except the precious on-the-field talent.” Consequently, most black athletes lost their connection to a “sense of mission . . . of being part of a larger cause.” Young athletes, in particular, “dropped the thread that joins them to that struggle” and became, instead, a “lost tribe,” adrift in the world of white coaches, boosters, agents, club officials, network executives — those profiting from black muscle and skill. Finally, Rhoden insists on the importance of black athletes and entrepreneurs gaining organizational and business power in college and professional sports: the path toward the “redemption” of his subtitle. His vision here is a little murky, but he knows too much history to feel sanguine about the one black-owned franchise in the N.B.A., Robert Johnson’s (and now also Michael Jordan’s) Charlotte Bobcats. (In the face of these powerful arguments, I wish I did not also have to point out errors, like getting wrong the date of Plessy v. Ferguson, which was decided in 1896, not 1890; and misstating the year baseball’s first professional league got under way — 1871, not 1876.) Rhoden identifies “the Jockey Syndrome, or changing the rules . . . to maintain control in the face of a perceived challenge to white supremacy.” Take the exemplary story of Isaac Murphy, the most prominent and wealthiest of the black jockeys who dominated late-19th-century racing (Murphy earned a mind-boggling $15,000-$20,000 per year, and employed a white valet in season): he won his third Kentucky Derby in 1891 but died five years later at 35, having been run out of the sport. The white counterattack consisted of physical interference with black riders on the track, owners refusing to hire black jockeys and the exclusionary practices of the newly formed Jockey Club. Professional baseball had already gotten rid of Moses Fleetwood Walker, the first black major leaguer, after the 1889 season, and the turn-of-the-century cycling sensation Major Taylor left the increasingly segregated, occasionally violent world of American racing for the freer air of Paris. The United States government pursued the heavyweight champion Jack Johnson, who had vanquished the great white hopes and broken racial and sexual taboos, until he lost his title and served jail time on a ridiculous Mann Act charge. The same government went after Muhammad Ali half a century later. Rhoden’s discussion of Rube Foster, founder of the Negro National League, succeeds in rescuing this “shrewd, determined businessman,” who “wanted a professional league of black baseball that was owned, organized, managed and played by African-Americans,” from “mere footnote” status. The hero, however fleeting, of “$40 Million Slaves,” Foster wanted entire black franchises to join the majors, not only individual players. His mental breakdown in 1926 — possibly precipitated by white baseball’s refusal to allow teams to play his Chicago American Giants — and his death just four years later “created a vacuum in vision and leadership within black baseball that would never be filled.” Not by Branch Rickey — for Rhoden “fair” and “a barracuda,” but “a barracuda first” — who “exploited the integrationist leanings of the black community to crush opposition” to his raids on black teams. Not even by Jackie Robinson, who at least spoke out on racial matters once his turn-the-other-cheek promise to Rickey had expired. We forget, perhaps, that he backed John Carlos and Tommie Smith in their Mexico City Olympics protest, and testified on behalf of Curt Flood’s courageous effort to overturn baseball’s reserve clause. The peerless Michael Jordan, by contrast, declined to be identified with black causes, but even His Airness got taken down when he finally retired from his last on-court hurrah with the Washington Wizards (which made about $30 million for the team), expecting to return to the front office, and found himself fired by the owner Abe Pollin. To Rhoden, this tale bursts with significance, illustrating, in turn: white people’s denial of black business ability while they continue to profit from black athletic skill; black athletes’ training in high school, college and the pros (what he calls the “Conveyor Belt”) to think only about individual success, never about a system that distributes power unequally; and how even today, professional basketball — controlled by whites, dependent on blacks (for the present) — resembles a plantation, albeit one on which the “slaves” earn millions, as long as they don’t notice who’s running the show. Read this book, and the next time you hear Barry Bonds booed or think about Commissioner Bud Selig’s steroids “investigation” or talk about the N.B.A.’s “image problem,” you may squirm more than a little. Good.

To the Editor: Sharon Waxman's article "Cyberface" [Oct. 15] argues that animated figures are becoming as expressive as SAG members. Your photograph of the actress Ilana Rogel emoting looks like the actual expressions of a real human being. The cyberface, however, looks exactly like that of an actress who is way too familiar with the Botox needle. Lines are magically erased and the expression looks about as much like a real person's as, well, as that of an over-Botoxed actress. If this technology heralds the end of flesh-and-blood actors, then perhaps the actors are as much to blame as the technology. After all, haven't they inured the public to expressionless expressions, thereby paving the way for cyberfaces? Roseanne Leto Broadwater Bronxville, N.Y.

836-> A Bad Bargain
Here is a way to measure how seriously President Bush was willing to compromise on the military tribunals bill: Less than an hour after an agreement was announced yesterday with three leading Republican senators, the White House was already laying a path to wiggle out of its one real concession. About the only thing that Senators John Warner, John McCain and Lindsey Graham had to show for their defiance was Mr. Bush’s agreement to drop his insistence on allowing prosecutors of suspected terrorists to introduce classified evidence kept secret from the defendant. The White House agreed to abide by the rules of courts-martial, which bar secret evidence. (Although the administration’s supporters continually claim this means giving classified information to terrorists, the rules actually provide for reviewing, editing and summarizing classified material. Evidence that cannot be safely declassified cannot be introduced.) This is a critical point. As Senator Graham keeps noting, the United States would never stand for any other country’s convicting an American citizen with undisclosed, secret evidence. So it seemed like a significant concession — until Stephen Hadley, the national security adviser, briefed reporters yesterday evening. He said that while the White House wants to honor this deal, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Duncan Hunter, still wants to permit secret evidence and should certainly have his say. To accept this spin requires believing that Mr. Hunter, who railroaded Mr. Bush’s original bill through his committee, is going to take any action not blessed by the White House. On other issues, the three rebel senators achieved only modest improvements on the White House’s original positions. They wanted to bar evidence obtained through coercion. Now, they have agreed to allow it if a judge finds it reliable (which coerced evidence hardly can be) and relevant to guilt or innocence. The way coercion is measured in the bill, even those protections would not apply to the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay. The deal does next to nothing to stop the president from reinterpreting the Geneva Conventions. While the White House agreed to a list of “grave breaches” of the conventions that could be prosecuted as war crimes, it stipulated that the president could decide on his own what actions might be a lesser breach of the Geneva Conventions and what interrogation techniques he considered permissible. It’s not clear how much the public will ultimately learn about those decisions. They will be contained in an executive order that is supposed to be made public, but Mr. Hadley reiterated that specific interrogation techniques will remain secret. Even before the compromises began to emerge, the overall bill prepared by the three senators had fatal flaws. It allows the president to declare any foreigner, anywhere, an “illegal enemy combatant” using a dangerously broad definition, and detain him without any trial. It not only fails to deal with the fact that many of the Guantánamo detainees are not terrorists and will never be charged, but it also chokes off any judicial review. The Democrats have largely stood silent and allowed the trio of Republicans to do the lifting. It’s time for them to either try to fix this bill or delay it until after the election. The American people expect their leaders to clean up this mess without endangering U.S. troops, eviscerating American standards of justice, or further harming the nation’s severely damaged reputation.

837-> Genome Diversity Project (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Your article about the Genographic Project (“DNA Gatherers Hit a Snag: The Tribes Don’t Trust Them,” front page, Dec. 10) referred in passing to the Human Genome Diversity Project and said it was controversial because “scientists may have profited from genetic data that could have been used to develop drugs.” To be clear, at no time did the project’s organizers expect or seek to profit from the project. Early in its development, the Human Genome Diversity Project stated that it would not profit from or patent anything derived from its research. It did not promise that no one else would patent a discovery related to genetic variations uncovered by the project because, legally, the project could not make such a promise, nor can anyone else. It did commit itself to work to ensure that anyone who did receive such a patent would share its proceeds fairly with the communities involved. Henry T. Greely Marcus W.

838-> Skateboarders' Wild
More than a decade after Larry Clark's "Kids" scandalized the movie world with its quasi-documentary portrait of New York skateboarders and the virgins they deflower, he is still pushing buttons with his lubricious insider's view of teenage life. A filmmaker, photographer and besotted observer of sex and death on the adolescent fringe, Mr. Clark pointedly photographs young flesh with the drooling concentration of a chicken hawk. Although he might say his purpose isn't to turn viewers on but to capture the intense physical reality of adolescent experience, there is more erotic energy floating through his films than in a hundred laboriously obtained orgasms from a pornographic loop. Watching his films can make anyone over 30 feel like a dirty old whatever. In "Wassup Rockers," his camera caresses the wet lips and smooth torsos of a pack of Hispanic skateboarders from South Central Los Angeles as they cruise the city looking for the perfect slope. Deliberately blurring the line between fiction and documentary, this handsomely photographed film leads off with an interview with its teenage star, Jonathan Velasquez, who mumbles about his life and early sexual experiences. Mr. Velasquez, who plays a character named Jonathan, is the prettiest and most prominently featured of the movie's untrained actors, all playing versions of themselves. As the group's seven members travel from their ravaged graffiti-scarred neighborhood of gangbangers and drive-by shootings to Beverly Hills, the story's romantic conceit is that they are only exchanging one hell for another. Because these lollipop angels with dirty faces are pointedly different from the adolescent nihilists Mr. Clark normally tracks, "Wassup Rockers" has an upbeat lilt; it might almost be called a comedy. As they dash down boulevards and leap over walls and fences, tossing their skateboards ahead of them, the movie recalls such antic frolics as "A Hard Day's Night;" no one stands still for long. For all the horrors they have seen in South Central, Mr. Clark's magnificent seven are holy innocents whose passion for skateboarding and group solidarity has kept them immune to the decay and corruption around them. With their mops of hippie-length hair and tight pants, they are outsiders in their own community, taunted and menaced by their gun-toting African-American peers who carry guns inside their baggy hip-hop uniforms. Jonathan, who idolizes the Ramones, sings lead in a punk-rock band. Kico (Francisco Pedrasa), the most endearing of the seven, when asked where he's from, guilelessly replies, "I'm from the ghetto." Their 24-hour journey from one jungle to another and back begins when they drive a borrowed car to Beverly Hills to skate the "nine steps," a famous local challenge that involves leaping over a concrete stairway and remaining vertical upon landing. But on the way, the boys, who have neither licenses nor registration, are stopped and intimidated by a stereotypically menacing and racist Los Angeles policeman, who arrests one of them. Undeterred, they take the bus to their destination, where they are lustfully ogled by two sleek, high-school-age babes, one of whom invites Jonathan to visit her mansion. Scary policemen, girls with dirty minds and their arrogant, hateful boyfriends are only the first in a series of increasingly grotesque monsters encountered by visitors whom the movie wants to portray as incorruptible. Chased from one fancy house to the next, they crash a party whose flamboyantly gay host, a physique photographer, follows Jonathan to the bathroom and peeks through the keyhole, then leeringly offers "career" advice. A gaunt, drunken housewife drags Kico into a hot tub for sudsy horseplay. As the boys retreat, a high-powered film director who suggests a Clint Eastwood-Charlton Heston hybrid pulls out a gun and casually shoots one of them. By now there are only five of the original seven. They are rescued from hell by a sympathetic group of Hispanic maids from the neighborhood who enlist a friend to spirit them back to South Central in his pickup truck. However you respond to "Wassup Rockers," it is completely alive, unlike any number of teenage Hollywood movies with their stale formulas and second-hand puerility. And that's mostly to the good. Written and directed by Larry Clark; based on a story by Mr. Clark and Matthew Frost; edited by Alex Blatt; produced by Mr. Clark, Kevin Turen and Henry Winterstern; released by First Look Studios. Running time: 105 minutes. WITH: Jonathan Velasquez (Jonathan), Francisco Pedrasa (Kico), Milton Velasquez (Milton/Spermball), Usvaldo Panameno (Porky), Eddie Velasquez (Eddie), Luis Rojas Salgado (Louie) and Carlos Ramirez (Carlos).

Joy Rolle, 30, of Brooklyn remembers when her contractions were coming stronger and closer together, before her water broke six years ago. It seemed like an eternity before she was wheeled into the delivery room. Her full-term pregnancy ended in an emergency Caesarean section because her son was in distress inside her womb. After recovery, she learned he had been born with a seizure disorder. Elsa Taveras, 26, of the Bronx was living in a Brooklyn shelter two years ago, when her doctor told her she was pregnant with triplets. Abandoned by her steady boyfriend and already caring for two girls — one with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — she was under stress. Little did she know her triplets would have the same disorder as their sister and be developmentally delayed. And Darlene Rice, 39, of Brooklyn has faced having all three of her children born physically weak. Her first boy in 1991 was premature. He weighed a little more than five pounds, which was considered a healthy weight, but there were other complications. He had a hole in his small intestine. The list of ailments later included a heart murmur, hearing loss and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. With each diagnosis, these women’s lives irrevocably changed. Constrained by low incomes, they have struggled to provide their families and ailing children proper, and often lifesaving, health care. They have sacrificed jobs, and have lost or nearly lost their homes. They are among 49 percent of families headed by single mothers in New York living below the poverty line, defined as $16,000 a year for a family of three. Mothers who are poor are 50 percent more likely to have a disabled child than those with higher incomes, according to census data. A single mother trying to carve time to tend to a sick child may start off expecting to lose only a few hours of pay. But missing one day too many can lead to losing a job. Unemployment usually means turning to public assistance. Getting off government rolls or earning above a menial wage requires training, but the conundrum is how a mother already financially strapped and with few options for child care can attend classes. “Particularly single mothers are falling further behind despite an improving economy,” said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society. In a study, the Unheard Third 2006, C.S.S. found that mothers with low incomes will already have cut back on school supplies and clothing before health care and housing. When lives are about compromise and tight budgets, poor New Yorkers have found assistance through The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. An emergency infusion of money from the fund can stave off a pending eviction, provide medication and medical equipment, send children to school in well-fitting clothes, or provide furniture for an empty home. It can also buy a moment’s reprieve — just a little time for a family to get back on solid ground. Today the Neediest Cases begins its 95th annual fund-raising campaign. Over the next three months, a series of articles will reveal how fraught lives were improved through assistance from the Neediest Cases. The drive continues in much the same tradition in which it began on a brisk Christmas evening in 1911, when a down-on-his luck man approached Adolph S. Ochs, the publisher of The New York Times. The encounter impressed upon Mr. Ochs that New Yorkers were suffering despite their efforts. The following Christmas season, The Times printed 100 brief profiles. These were tiny windows into disparate situations that evoked readers’ compassion, and provided them a way to improve people’s lives in their community. Contributions from individuals, corporations and trusts typically vary from a few dollars to $1 million and are pooled and divided among seven charities. (Contributions from trusts and estates of more than $50,000 are put into an endowment and the income, recently more than $1 million a year, goes into the following year’s campaign.) All donations go directly to those in need because The New York Times Company Foundation underwrites all administrative costs. Since 1912, nearly $160 million has been dispensed. In addition, $62.3 million was raised for the families affected by the attack on the World Trade Center on 9/11. This year’s drive begins with a balance of $2,057,647.78. The amount was donated to the Neediest Cases since the 94th appeal closed in February and includes interest gained from trusts and estates. Contributions have been declining over the past five years and last year, they dropped 8 percent, fund officials said. “The decline was disappointing but understandable considering how generously the public responded to victims of two exceptional disasters, the tsunami in Asia and Hurricane Katrina on the Gulf Coast,” said Jack Rosenthal, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation. “We fervently hope that this year, readers will recognize the enduring distress suffered by many poor families in New York. As Mayor Bloomberg’s Commission on Economic Opportunity recently reported, one in five New Yorkers — and one in three New York children — lives in poverty, much higher than is true nationally.” “This fund cannot answer the needs of them all,” he said, “but it can, true to its historic name, relieve the suffering of the neediest.” Joy Rolle first saw her 6-year-old son, Marquis, suffer a seizure when he was 11 months old. The next three days he spent in the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn were the beginning of four years’ worth of visits to doctors. While struggling to keep pace with his medical needs, Ms. Rolle was on the verge of homelessness. Three months’ rent was overdue on an apartment that she had taken over from her mother. While trying to find a compromise in housing court and contending with her son’s medical needs, she could not work enough hours as an operator at a car service. In six months she was out of a job and owed $7,000 in back rent. “I didn’t want a handout,” she said. “I just needed a little help.” She turned to public assistance, receiving $218 from welfare and $170 a month in food stamps. She also applied for a rent subsidy program, but was denied aid because she missed a mandatory welfare work training course, although she said she had received an exemption because of Marquis’s illness. The sanction was her breaking point. Marquis’s father was not in the picture at the time, she said, and her mother, her only family, was battling a drug addiction. Ms. Rolle said she started hearing voices that replayed the worst-case situations in her head. Through counseling at a Brooklyn psychotherapy center, she said she gained peace of mind, and by becoming a born-again Christian, she gained strength. During this time, she also sought advice from South Brooklyn Legal Services about how she could have the sanction lifted on the welfare rent subsidy. She was referred to Leslie Boutin from the Community Service Society. Ms. Boutin and her department, Public Benefits Resource Center, succeeded in removing the barrier and helped Ms. Rolle qualify for the rent subsidy program. The welfare program also covered the past due rent. “If I hadn’t met Leslie, I would be homeless and hungry,” Ms. Rolle said. Throughout the ordeal, she strove to develop Marquis’s potential. She learned from his therapists provided by Medicaid how to reinforce his skills in mathematics and the alphabet. On the weekends, she and Marquis escaped their poor, drug-infested neighborhood to attend free events — book readings, carnivals, street fairs and “Mommy and Me” classes — in Park Slope and Manhattan. In 2004, the subsidized housing she had applied for in 2000 opened in Crown Heights. Entering the apartment felt like home, but she had no money for furniture. So Ms. Boutin used $454 from the Neediest Cases to buy a bed and dresser. As Marquis’s health stabilized, Ms. Rolle returned to work and to school part time. She earns $10 an hour without benefits as an assistant to a director at Bridge Back to Life, a transitional recovery center Ms. Rolle pays $53 a month for rent that has been calculated on a sliding scale adjusted to her income. “Looking back, I can’t believe I went through all that,” she said. She added that Marquis has forced everyone in her life to be more responsible. Ms. Rolle has developed a stronger relationship with her mother, who is recovering from her addiction and has become a math teacher at Bridge Back to Life. On June 19, 2004, Ms. Rolle married her son’s father, Derek Bobian. Last year Marquis graduated from kindergarten with honors. With the help of the Neediest Cases, she said her home was “peaceful, full of love and strength.” Elsa Taveras’s home is full of love, but on most days she gets little peace. On a recent afternoon, the subway rattling past her second-floor subsidized apartment was barely audible over the shrieks of her 4-year-old triplets: Jeremy, Justin and Joshua, who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. “It’s like this every day,” said Ms. Taveras with exasperation. “If I was never referred to Children’s Aid, I would be in a psychiatric clinic,” she said, referring to the Children’s Aid Society’s Preventive Services in the Bronx and the help she received from Isa Andrejcisk, a worker there. “Isa finds me solutions to my problems,” she added. Just before their meeting two years ago, Ms. Taveras was scared and uncertain about the future. She was living in a shelter with her boys, then toddlers, and her two girls, Alondra Sanchez, now 9, and Aranza Diaz, now 8. One snowy evening, it was with trepidation that she violated a 9 p.m. curfew when she left her children sleeping to go buy milk. When she returned, an Administration for Children’s Services officer was waiting for her. The agency ruled out neglect, but required Ms. Taveras to go to the Children’s Aid Society, an A.C.S. partner agency and another of the seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases. Shortly after, with assistance from the shelter, she moved into an emergency Section 8 apartment. With $358 from public assistance, $675 a month in food stamps and $542 in Supplemental Security Income, she could cover her share of the $278 for housing and her bills. Ms. Taveras’s first mandatory meeting with Ms. Andrejcisk at the Children’s Aid Society was in June 2004. From the worn look on Ms. Taveras’s face, “I could see that she was overwhelmed,” Ms. Andrejcisk said in a phone interview. At the time, Aranza’s teachers had been complaining that she was distracted, terrorizing other children and destroying property. Her boys communicated with tantrums instead of words, making child care impossible. Without support, taking care of her children meant sacrificing her job as a manicurist at a beauty salon. “I really wanted to work, but it was too much for one person,” Ms. Taveras said. To address Ms. Taveras’s emotional strain, Ms. Andrejcisk found her counseling and put her children in the center’s day care. They also received medical checkups and were evaluated for mental disabilities. Alondra, who does not have learning problems, has excelled in school. But Aranza and the boys were diagnosed as having severe attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and were developmentally delayed. Aranza has since enrolled in Fordham-Tremont Community Mental Health Center and the boys are in early intervention at the Kennedy Center, receiving speech and occupational therapy in the morning before their afternoon instruction at Children’s Aid’s childhood center. Aranza’s medication, Methylin, is working. “It’s amazing the difference; she can focus,” said Ms. Taveras. When the boys are older, they will be evaluated to determine whether they can be prescribed similar medication. During a home visit, Ms. Andrejcisk saw that the children were sleeping in broken beds and eating on the floor. Ms. Andrejcisk drew from the Neediest Cases, $600 for clothing and $1,789 for bedroom furniture and a kitchen table set. Today, Ms. Taveras’s home is still far from calm, but sleeping on a proper bed keeps her blood pressure down and energy up, she said. “There are always difficulties, but now it’s getting a little better,” she said. The next step: going back to work. Darlene Rice also knows what it is to care for several children with disabilities. Her first son, Dashawn Mobley, had multiple medical complications when he was born in 1991, but did not show signs of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder until he was fitted for his first hearing aid when he was nearly 2. As soon as the device slid into his ear, he darted to the pediatric playroom and banged on a drum, then weaved in and out of hospital rooms. The sight brought tears to her eyes. “I was watching him discover sound for the first time,” Ms. Rice said. The moment of joy dimmed when his frantic behavior played out over and over at their home in Crown Heights. Simple outings became chaotic. Searching for answers, she changed his diet — no sugar — and tightened discipline. But the stricter the rules, the more defiant he became. At 5, he was diagnosed as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and later put on Ritalin and then Concerta. He also went into psychiatric counseling. The medication helped him focus. He learned sign language and he also progressed in speech therapy. After her daughter, Dominique, was born in 1998, she also exhibited signs of slow development. Ms. Rice was again juggling doctor and psychiatric visits. She was also interviewing for jobs to get off welfare and she was hired as a clerk at the home care agency, Americare Certified Services. She lasted three years making $9 an hour. “Anytime my children were sick, my boss understood,” she said of her supervisor. When the company changed owners, however, her schedule became less flexible and harder to keep. The days she missed work, she also missed pay, and she was fired in June 2003. She had also been falling behind paying her $500 portion of the $858 rent for a subsidized apartment in Flatbush. “I was literally killing myself,” she said. “It just became too much for me. If I paid the rent, where’s the food money coming from?” By the end of 2003, she owed $3,000 in back rent. She reapplied for public assistance, which she had received when Dashawn was born. “People really judge you,” she said. “But I do what I can for my children, and if I have to put my business on Front Street I will do it for them.” Back on welfare, she received $250, close to $200 in food stamps, and a little over $500 in supplemental Social Security Income a month. With the help of Legal Aid, she contested the back rent with papers documenting every doctor visit that kept her from working, and met requirements for public assistance to pay her arrears. But just as she thought she was one step ahead, she took one step back. She was again pregnant with complications despite having protected sex. Her second son, Jared, was born in December 2005 with jaundice and a swollen kidney caused by an enzyme disorder. With her tight schedule, she looked for ways to do more for her children. A month before Jared was born, she went to Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens to enroll Dashawn and Dominique in the Big Brothers and Big Sisters program. “He was a young man, he needed to get away to do boy things and guy things,” she said. Stacey Stringer, the director of the program, told Ms. Rice about a mentor for her two older children. Later they discussed the Model Secondary School for the Deaf in Washington for Dashawn. Through his hard work, Dashawn was enrolled in September. Within the first few weeks, he called her from school, upset. Students were teasing him about his ill-fitting clothes, and calling him poor. Caring for a sickly newborn, she did not have money for a high chair, much less her growing boy’s pants or shoes. And at 15, he is 6-foot-2 and 179 pounds. Ms. Rice confided in Ms. Stringer. “With all her responsibilities, I knew it was something she couldn’t do,” said Ms. Stringer, who was able to purchase a $500 gift certificate through the Neediest Cases. The assistance was an emotional boost at the right time. Dashawn had another medical setback — several fainting spells at school that might be related to seizures. With all her children’s ailments, her dreams of working again seem farther away. “I want to go to work, but my children are the first priority,” Ms. Rice said. “They need me to get them to doctors, get them their medication. When you have needs and you’re a single parent, you have to make choices, and if your child is sick, you don’t have much choice at all. If I don’t care for them, who will?”

841-> Metro Briefing | New York: Brooklyn: Students Charged With Planting Fake Bombs
Two students at the Pratt Institute in Fort Greene have been charged after the police said they planted false bombs in the subways. The students, Robert Barrett, 21, and Jamie Davis, 21, placed five packages in subway cars and stations on Sept. 28, the police said. The packages, stuffed with copies of The New York Post and Spider-Man comics, bore the slogan "If you see something, say something" and the phone number to report suspicious packages. Mr. Barrett told the police that the packages were part of a class project and that he had hoped to show the ineffectiveness of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's safety program, the police said. They said materials inside the packages led them to the students. EMILY VASQUEZ (NYT) Correction: October 16, 2006, Monday Because of an editing error, a report in the Metro Briefing column on Friday about the arrest of two students at the Pratt Institute on charges of planting fake bombs in the subways misidentified the neighborhood where Pratt's Brooklyn campus is located. It is Clinton Hill, not Fort Greene.

842-> Art to the People, and Vice Versa, in the Bronx
The way I see it, Arquitectonica has owed New York a decent building. That firm built its reputation with a series of projects in its hometown, Miami, that mixed bold forms and alluring surfaces at bargain prices. But in New York it has produced only clunkers. Its Westin Hotel tower on Eighth Avenue defines cheapness: a collage of gaudy colors with a long, illuminated arc scratched across its facade. And the muted plaid pattern that it used to decorate the first of a group of towers currently under construction in Long Island City, Queens, is not an improvement. But with the completion of the addition to the Bronx Museum of the Arts, all is forgiven. With its pleated aluminum facade and refreshingly unpretentious interiors, the addition is a reminder of how architecture can have a profound public impact when its values are in the right place. And it demonstrates how simple it can be to bridge the divide between art and its audience at a time when much bigger, more high-profile museums and their ultra-rich boards can seem baffled by their cultural roles. The addition is the centerpiece of a string of building projects that promise to shore up the Bronx’s dicey image as well as help reassert its former identity as a haven for the middle class. Bulldozers have already begun clearing the site for the new Yankee Stadium a few blocks away, a bold new criminal courts complex designed by Rafael Viñoly is nearing completion just down the street, and the Grand Concourse is in the midst of a multimillion-dollar face-lift. Of these sites the museum is the most steeped in the Bronx’s turbulent social history. Founded in 1971, when the Bronx was still substantially white and middle class, it first made its home in the streamlined Moderne rotunda of the 1930’s-era county building. Curators joke that its audience was mostly defendants being dragged to court, conjuring the image of an art therapy class rather than a serious museum. The story is only half true, but it hints at the museum’s struggle to form an identity in a borough that was undergoing dramatic social changes. In 1982 the museum moved to its current location, a former synagogue at the corner of Grand Concourse and 165th Street that had been abandoned by its congregation as the neighborhood became increasingly Latino. An awkward 1988 renovation by Castro-Blanco Piscioneri & Associates provided a more formal entry, but its corner lobby and cramped balconies had the feel of a suburban mall. Arquitectonica’s new addition slips into this messy context with surprising ease. In keeping with their populist agenda, the firm’s principals, Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, don’t try to hide the building’s low-budget construction. Instead, the main facade is conceived as an enormous folding screen, its glistening aluminum surface draped over the building’s crude concrete block structure. The facade gives the building a wonderful lightness. And it brings to mind an updated version of the streamlined Art Deco designs of 1920’s architects like the Los Angeles firm of Morgan, Walls & Clements, which created a populist architecture for the emerging car culture. As in those earlier designs, the glistening vertical folds of Arquitectonica’s facade act as a visual counterpoint both to the horizontal movement of the cars streaming by on the concourse and to the heavy brick buildings that flank the museum. But the playful exterior forms also reflect a wonderfully nuanced interplay between the inner life of the museum and the public world outside. The vertical bands of windows are set deep inside the facade’s creases, so that from directly across the street you barely notice them. As you approach the museum along the sidewalk, however, you catch diagonal views into the lobby, luring you inside. That bond — between art and public — continues right up through the building. A single column anchors the vertical lobby, accentuating its height, while a long ramp at the back of the space feeds into a new 2,500-square-foot gallery at the back of the building and the old galleries off to the right. The creased facade is even more effective from inside. The tall, angled windows offer picturesque views of pedestrians strolling up and down the boulevard. As you step deeper into the building those views disappear, which helps refocus your attention onto the art. A warning: Don’t expect anything fancy here. The main gallery is a simple white box with raw concrete floors. The standard steel railings and light fixtures have a straightforward institutional quality. And although the old galleries have been given a slick new paint job, they are just as utilitarian. But this only serves to make the museum feel more open and accessible. It reinforces the sense of public ownership that is so crucial to a museum’s success. It also seems to have liberated the curators, who appear to have eagerly responded to the building’s populist theme. The addition opens with “Tropicália,” a show about the period of experimental Brazilian art that began in the late 1960’s, and the artwork spills into every corner of the museum. A mural commissioned for the opening, by the collaborative group Assume Vivid Astro Focus, covers the back of the lobby in a swirl of Day-Glo. Sculptures by Rodrigo Araújo and Marepe are scattered across the lobby floor, where they will be visible from the street. The museum’s ambitions don’t end here. Fund-raising has yet to begin for a second phase of construction that would expand the museum to the south, replacing the old 1988 Castro-Blanco building with new galleries, a performing arts space and a residential tower. The proposal, also designed by Arquitectonica, would erase some of the nice historical tensions embodied in the current museum, but it would give the institution a much-needed coherence, something that it richly deserves. And revenue from the residential tower could provide some financial stability for one of the city’s most underappreciated art institutions. But for the time being, the new addition proves what can be accomplished with few resources and a lot of heart. It is a reminder that not all museum expansions are driven by media-savvy self-promoters, that the big, bad corporate machine has not yet penetrated every corner of the culture world. Increasingly in today’s New York, the most humble projects are the most moving.

843-> The Power and Progress of an Altarpiece by the Young Raphael
ALMOST in spite of itself, "Raphael at the Metropolitan: The Colonna Altarpiece" is a small show running on all cylinders. Reuniting for the first time since 1663 the panels of an altarpiece that the young Raphael completed in 1504, the exhibition can feel both stretched thin and a bit padded. It struggles to fill three relatively modest galleries at the Met, yet within its borders aesthetic interest and art historical insights abound, as do big personalities and world-shaking events, vivid aesthetic minutia and other serendipities. The museum had a head start in this show, since it owns three of the altarpiece's seven panels. The large central panel, which depicts the Madonna and Child enthroned, with the infant John the Baptist, St. Peter, St. Paul and two unidentified female saints, and the semicircular lunette of God blessing the world, were both gifts to the museum from the estate of J. P. Morgan in 1916. In 1932 the museum purchased its third and final portion: the small, soft-edged predella image of the Agony in the Garden. The seller was Clarence Mackay, a mining magnate, former trustee and the unwilling father-in-law of Irving Berlin who had suffered some reversals in the stock market crash. The show has moments of inadvertent oddness. One gallery is presided over by the Virgin and Child, with God on an adjacent wall. The next is ruled by Morgan, glowering Moses-like from Edward Steichen's large, dark photograph of 1903. Perhaps nothing less could be expected of a show that by following the art, traces the migration of wealth and power for more than two centuries from Italy to France, to England, to the United States. It may also seem strange that the reunited panels have not been physically reassembled, perhaps because of the galleries' relatively low ceilings. The upside here is that everything is at eye level, thrillingly available for close visual examination. This is especially true for the lunette and central panel, which have not been so near the ground in years. (The lunette is usually 10 feet overhead.) And nothing could be more fitting for Raphael, who always set out to deliver an eyeful. With Leonardo and Michelangelo he forms the Big Three of the High Renaissance. He was routinely called "the prince of painters" but was perhaps more like a Sun King: glowing, formidable yet benign. His pellucid light, majestic compositional sense, idealized figures and radiant palette imbued the new system of one-point perspective with clarity, repose and happiness. Few other Renaissance painters attained such gleaming, supple wholeness. His career was short and driven. The Colonna altarpiece, one of the last he painted, is a telling transitional work from an artist who was in a sense always in transition, always picking up ideas and making them his own. Commissioned by the Franciscan convent of St. Anthony of Padua in Perugia, Raphael's birthplace, it was completed when he was barely 21, already considered a master and in the process of relocating to Florence. He decamped four years later to Rome, the patronage of Pope Julius II and a stimulating rivalry with Michelangelo. In Rome, Raphael finally escaped both Christian themes and oil paint in his great frescoes for the Papal apartments. By 1520, at 37, he was dead; his tomb is in the Pantheon. This exhibition has been organized by Linda Wolk-Simon, associate curator in the museum's department of drawings and prints, in collaboration with Keith Christiansen, curator in its department of European paintings. It traces its evolution in the altarpiece through Raphael's drawings and preparatory studies and works of the artists he learned from, including Perugino, a formative influence, and Fra Bartolommeo, the dominant artist in Florence in the early 1500's. There is one brilliant drawing by the inescapable Leonardo that is arguably the most intense work, inch for inch, in the exhibition. Also on hand are two predella panels from an altarpiece that Raphael painted in 1501-2. Their crowded compositions accent the relative spare, spacious compositions of the Colonna predella images, and a predella panel of a Resurrection by Perugino from the 1490's indicates a source of that spaciousness. The altarpiece was both conservative and forward looking in ways that reflect the working conditions of the Renaissance, in particular the desires of the client. The clothing on the Christ Child and the infant John the Baptist was probably dictated by the convent, as was the Gothic gold on the base of the Madonna's throne, her black, stippled robe and the textile hanging behind her head. In the lunette God is surrounded by a flat, heavy blue; dark ribbons flutter vivaciously around him in the manner of Perugino. The sleeves of the angels flanking God are highlighted with contrasting colors to indicate shadow and volume, an effect also visible in Perugino's full-length life-size painting of St. John in the first gallery; the saint's brown habit is highlighted, beautifully, but startlingly, with lavender. And yet the central panel is another story: the sky is a white-to-blue fathomless space, and the thoughtful dignity, monumental stasis and sculptural yet solid-colored robes of Peter and Paul indicate an awareness of Michelangelo's latest innovations. In this panel especially, Raphael's light and space radiate with full force, and his colors dance. Saturated shades of red, yellow, blue and green rotate in changing pairs, among the robes and garments of the figures in the central panel and the small predella images. So how did the altarpiece end up in pieces? It stayed put in Perugia until 1663, when the convent, deeply in debt, sold the five small panels of the predella. Matters did not improve, and in 1677 the altarpiece's large central panel and lunette were also sold. And so this work became telling in another way. Divided, it moved through history like a series of barium tests through the body, accumulating a stupendous collective provenance and providing localized illuminations of the effects of war, revolution, greed, aesthetic passion and, of course, death. The owners came and went, but the panels kept moving. Rare catalogs of auctions and princely collections highlight the altarpiece's post-convent progress, as do engravings of various owners. The five predella panels stayed together until 1798, when they appeared in a famous London auction that introduced the English public to Italian Renaissance painting. (The sometime art critic William Hazlitt wrote ecstatically that the scales had fallen from his eyes.) By the early 1800's the small, full-length images of St. Francis and St. Anthony had entered the collection of the Dulwich Gallery near London. The central panel and lunette spent more than a century in the collection of the Colonna family in Rome — hence the name — and then nearly as long in the hands of the Spanish Bourbon kings of Naples and the two Sicilies. Between 1860 and 1896 they were famously and unsuccessfully for sale, sent on approval to the Louvre and the National Gallery in London and then stored ignominiously in the South Kensington Museum. Finally they were purchased by the British dealer Martin Colnaghi, whose descendants remain active in the art business, and soon sold to Jacques Sedelmeyer, a French dealer. Isabella Stewart Gardner considered buying the central panel and lunette, but Bernard Berenson advised against it. Morgan bought them in 1901, without benefit of a consultant, the first time he saw them. He paid two million francs, a record at the time. By then Mrs. Gardner had settled on a different part of the altarpiece (with Berenson's approval): the predella's Pietà. The predella's elongated Procession to Calvary entered the collection of the National Gallery in London in 1913. This exhibition illuminates the enduring proximity of art and money, which lately has been lamented as if invented last spring by young, opportunistic art-school graduates. And the strangest thing is that except for two small sins of omission committed nearly 350 years ago, none of it might have happened. Each time the Franciscan sisters wrote to the Vatican for permission, in contemporary lingo, to deaccession, they neglected to mention that the altarpiece was by Raphael. Had they been more forthcoming, permission might have been denied and the altarpiece still intact and peacefully on display in either the Vatican Museum in Rome or the National Gallery of Umbria in Perugia. It houses an altarpiece by Piero della Francesca once owned by the convent — still whole.

844-> Timeless Art, Frozen in Time (for Now)
EVEN before I got to the big wrought-iron gate, two myths had been shattered. The Barnes Foundation — the embattled art museum with one of the world's greatest collections — is often portrayed as both hard to get to and the bane of its neighbors in Merion, a wealthy old suburb of Philadelphia. In fact, from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, the train to Merion took precisely 11 minutes. From there, it was a short walk to the Barnes — and nearly every house I passed had the same sign on its lawn: "The Barnes Belongs in Merion." I had first been to the Barnes in January. It was one of the high points in a lifetime of museum-going. The collection, which contains hundreds of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings, is astonishing. Even more astonishing is the way Albert C. Barnes, a patent-medicine magnate and cultural iconoclast, hung the paintings. He arranged them not by period or style, but in idiosyncratic compositions that use American Indian pottery, African masks and everyday items like spoons and door hinges to establish aesthetic connections. Walking through the rooms, I felt that I was seeing great art through new eyes — which is precisely what Barnes intended. January was a fine time to visit the museum — the rooms were practically empty — but not to enjoy the Barnes's extraordinary gardens. That's one reason I returned in June. The other was the news this spring that the Barnes was moving forward with its plan to transfer the collection, within a few years, to a new building in central Philadelphia, the result of a court petition by Barnes trustees who maintain that the present location is inadequate. The new building, however carefully planned, will never be able to replicate the experience of seeing the paintings in Barnes's home — with his old hi-fi ready to play the music he selected to accompany the works on display, which include 59 Matisses, 180 Renoirs and 68 Cézannes. Then, too, the building, which includes reliefs by Jacques Lipschitz and ironwork in African-inspired patterns, is considered a work of art in itself. Visiting the Barnes requires a reservation, but getting one was easy, despite the current limit of 1,200 visitors a week. I called on May 8 and asked if any slots were available on Saturday, June 3. A very pleasant woman said, "Yes; 9:30, 12:30 or 1 o'clock." I chose 1 p.m. and gave her a credit card number (the charge is $10 a person). My plan was to take public transportation to the Barnes. From Amtrak's 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, there are at least three ways to get to the museum: by taxi (15 minutes and $20); bus (20 minutes, $2) or train (12 minutes, $3). I chose the train, which leaves from a terminal above the Amtrak platforms. On the way to Merion, other passengers gave me directions for the 10-minute walk from Merion station to the museum and, for good measure, told me which paintings I absolutely should not miss. During the walk, I met one of the supposedly angry neighbors, Steven Asher, who was out walking his dog. He said he lived across the street from the Barnes and would have no objection to its staying as it is. "You can't even tell when it's open or closed," he said. INSIDE, I found the collection no less thrilling than on my first visit. This time, I chose to focus on just a few of the 24 galleries — the rooms of Barnes's house, exactly as they were when he died in a car accident in 1951. My favorite is a small corner room, Gallery 22, which I estimated to be 14 by 16 feet, about the size of my bedroom but, unlike my bedroom, containing about 30 major works of art and dozens more that aren't even identified. One wall bears a symmetrical composition incorporating, among other works, two superb Picassos ("Head of a Man" and "Head of a Woman"), two astonishingly lively watercolors by Charles Demuth and two Modigliani portraits. A showcase added more than a dozen African carvings to the mix. Like every room in the Barnes, Gallery 22 has places where I could sit and contemplate the artworks. Even on a Saturday in June, I never counted more than 10 or 12 people in a room; at times I was alone. The only sounds in the building were the occasional words of a pleasant docent, Shirley Miller, who once studied art history at the Barnes. ("We climbed a ladder and counted the dots in the Seurat," she said.) Barnes saw himself as creating not a museum but an art school, where visitors (including, he insisted, inner-city children) would be exposed to his ideas of beauty. His favorite painters were Matisse, Renoir and Cézanne, and he was able to acquire hundreds of their works before World War II for prices that wouldn't even cover shipping today. He also bought works by painters he considered less important, for educational purposes. Luckily, one of those artists was Van Gogh, who is represented in the collection by a mere seven paintings. One of my favorites, a psychedelic portrait of the postman Joseph-Etienne Roulin, hangs in a corner, exactly where Barnes placed it. Taking a break from the art, I wandered through the arboretum, which includes a superb lilac garden and a pond tucked in the woods. I also surveyed the Barnes's concessions to the public (new restrooms and a vending machine offering water and soft drinks). Then, in the gift shop, I made a happy discovery: The Barnes sells a CD-ROM ($35) cataloguing much of the collection. Now, on my home computer, I can learn more about the paintings, listening to the same commentary available on the museum's audio guide. But even more important, the CD-ROM contains a photograph of every wall of every gallery at the Barnes. That means I can see not just the paintings, but the furniture, the pottery, the odd ephemera that round out the Barnes's wall-sized tableaux. I don't know when — or pretend to understand why — the Barnes is moving. I'm just glad my hard drive is imprinted with the memory of how Barnes wanted the collection to be seen. And I don't mean my computer. The Barnes Foundation (300 North Latch's Lane, Merion, Pa.; 610-667-0290; www.barnesfoundation.org) is open from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Friday in July and August and Friday through Sunday September through June. Admission is $10; reservations are required. An audio guide is $7. Buses and trains for Merion leave from 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. From the station, walk across the street for the No. 44 bus or walk upstairs to the Septa (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority; www.septa.org) station and board any local train on the R5 line, terminating in Paoli. From the bus, get off at the corner of Old Lancaster Road and North Latch's Lane and walk about three-tenths of a mile to the Barnes. From the Septa Merion rail station the walk is six-tenths of a mile: make a right at the stop sign onto Merion Road, walk alongside the town park and then make a left onto North Latch's Lane. The Barnes is past Episcopal Academy on the right. By car, the Barnes is accessible from the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-76) northwest of Philadelphia. Take Exit 339 to Route 1 South/City Avenue. Drive 1.7 miles on Route 1 and turn right onto Old Lancaster Road (called 54th Street on the other side of the intersection). Drive two-tenths of a mile and turn left onto North Latch's Lane. Parking is $10; spaces can be reserved in advance.

845-> World Briefing | Asia: Kazakhstan: Health Minister Fired In H.I.V. Scandal
Responding to a rising national fury, the government fired the health minister, Yerbolat Dosayev, along with the governor of South Kazakhstan Province, where 55 children, including infants, contracted H.I.V. through blood transfusions and injections at a hospital in the city of Shymkent. The dismissals were for "poor performance of their duties," an official with Kazakhstan's Security Council said. Tests have been completed on just half of the nearly 9,800 children under 3 who were patients at the children's hospital and are thought to have been exposed to contaminated blood and needles. Health care workers were frequently critical of Mr. Dosayev, whose background is in finance and banking. ILAN GREENBERG (NYT)

847-> Art in Review; Adam McEwen
Nicole Klagsbrun 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea Through Oct. 14 Most of the more interesting artists these days work in several mediums, tend to approach ideas at a slant and are difficult to talk about. The British-born Adam McEwen qualifies on all three counts. At first his show seems to be made up chiefly of abstract paintings of random dots on open fields, sort of Larry Poons minus symmetry and optical buzz. But a photograph near the gallery entrance gives a source for the dot patterns in one of the works. It's an aerial view of the Allied fire-bombing of Dresden, Germany, in World War II. The attack devastated the city, but in the photo it looks softly festive, like a distant fireworks display or a stellar nebula. The other paintings, it turns out, are also named for German cities -- Hamburg, Darmstadt, Berlin -- bombed in the war, with the strike patterns of each attack plotted as dots. The dots are not painted. They're all made from flattened wads of chewing gum, the kind you find spit out and stuck on city sidwalks, here stuck to canvas. Along with the paintings there are photographs of another sort of city, the Queens housing complex called Lefrak City. Architecturally lackluster, designed as a self-contained embodiment of the middle-class "good life," it was built in the early 1960's at a time when old working-class immigrant neighborhoods were being leveled. Mr. McEwen took the nine Lefrak pictures himself, from the same spot and just seconds apart so that, while passing traffic patterns change, nothing else does. A modernist monument sustains an illusion of constancy. The illusion of constancy is what this show seems be about. Cities come and go, are built up and taken out. Ideologies are mutable; values adaptable and reversible. A bomb is beautiful. High art is low, very low, underfoot. In the end, Mr. McEwen sidesteps sweeping conclusions, moral or otherwise. Closure isn't where he's at. This is what makes his art hard to describe but rewarding to think about. HOLLAND COTTER

848-> Art in Review; Wallpaper LAB
Lennon, Weinberg 514 West 25th Street, Chelsea Through Oct. 14 Proving that we have come a long way since Jackson Pollock's drip paintings were derisively likened to apocalyptic wallpaper, this lively exhibition features 15 artists trying their hands at designing real wallpaper. It unveils the first collection of Wallpaper LAB, a company founded last year by Ron Keyson, a former art dealer. The results are mixed, and the digital nature of the printing doesn't suit everyone. Still, it is interesting to see artists transfer their ideas to another medium, especially one with a decorative function. Phoebe Washburn has opted for a large close-up that suggests one of her jerry-built installation pieces: a shingled expanse of small, irregular squares of plywood that could be slightly oppressive to live with. Douglas Gordon makes the gigantic tiny by enlarging stills from his famous video of an elephant alone in a room into a grid of small images, all different. Christopher Daniels settles on a mural-like view of a populous cartoon landscape divided by a bright blue river. The design by a young artist named A. J. Bocchino is especially striking. Working from microfilm, Mr. Bocchino chose one headline from the front page of The New York Times every day from Jan. 1, 1990, to Dec. 31, 2005. He then color-coded the headlines by subject (red for Iraq, purple for poverty, for example) and arranged them chronologically in strips. Now, quite a bit of the news recently fit to print can also be fit to your walls, should you so desire. The fonts are almost actual size. ROBERTA SMITH

849-> Heading to the Shore
Who among us hasnt fantasized about owning a home on the beach waking up and having coffee on a deck overlooking the ocean, strolling along the shoreline at sunset, falling asleep to the sound of the waves? Well, no doubt some people shudder at the thought of bare feet leaving a trail of sand on the hardwood floor, or prefer a placid pool to the unpredictable surf. But for those who find inner peace just gazing out at the vast horizon, nothing says yes, youve gotten away from it all quite like a home on the beach. Or rather, near the beach. The fact is, most popular coastal destinations have a limited supply of housing that would keep your cordless phone in range from the confines of your beach towel. Such beachfront properties generally require multimillion-dollar mortgages to go along with the million-dollar view. If that level of investment isnt in your budget, you may have to settle for a short walk to the ocean. But you should still be able to hear the surf and smell the sea. Here are some factors to think about if you are shopping for a place along the coast, as well as some destinations to consider if you dont already have your heart set on a particular stretch of sand. Location, Location, Location: What Can You Afford? Beach communities tend to attract loyal followings: Northeasterners who make the pilgrimage to Nantucket every summer; Midwesterners who flock to Florida when the snow falls; New Yorkers who head east to Long Island. To some degree, people want to stake a claim wherever they first built a sandcastle or caught a wave. Still, with home prices along the coast experiencing double-digit growth in recent years, less familiar destinations are gaining in allure. For instance, Chris Kangas and his partner, who live in Brooklyn, first started looking in Ocean Grove, N.J., six years ago, but a real estate agent sent them to nearby Asbury Park, a town that had its heyday in the early 1900s, started a long decline in the 1960s and has only recently experienced a rebirth. Mr. Kangas and his partner took a gamble in 2000 when they and another friend bought a two-family house. They renovated and later sold that to buy another fixer-upper, which they still own. We bought our first house for $155,000 and a year and a half later we sold it for $275,000, and now its worth over half a million, so the market just zoomed straight up, Mr. Kangas said. But that did mean riding out a transitional period: at first, almost all of the buildings on the main street were boarded; eventually a commercial district was born, with the coffee shops, stores and restaurants that city dwellers like to frequent even when they are at the beach. If you are not willing to take a risk on a destination poised for a turnaround, options do exist in the better-established areas. Lance Berman of Manhattan first looked along the Jersey shore but shifted his focus to the Hamptons when he realized that, cost notwithstanding, it was where he really wanted to be. He is in the process of buying a three-bedroom cottage in the Northwest Woods neighborhood of East Hampton, after looking at about 10 houses over three weekends. I was very surprised; theres a lot of entry-level stuff you can get in the Hamptons, Mr. Berman said, referring to homes in the $550,000-to-$700,000 range, which are typically a bit farther from town and the beach. According to Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group in East Hampton, homes on the lower end of that price range generally need a fair amount of work, on elements like floors, baths and kitchens. She said the median price for a house in the Hamptons (including Montauk) was around $800,000. She also said that prices in the region had increased about 10 percent annually over the past 15 years, bolstered by increasing demand and not enough inventory, but that the trend had recently started to change. This year it seems as if we have an increase in inventory that is outpacing the increase in price and demand, she said, ascribing the new listings to concerns about rising interest rates and a general sense of instability in the world. As for what it would take to buy a home thats literally on the ocean, she pointed out that only 6 percent of the residential properties in the area are on the water, and that oceanfront homes can command anywhere from $6 million to $40 million. But she also said, Once you get away from being right on the water and you have to travel to the beach, it shouldnt really matter that much if youre getting in the car for five minutes or nine minutes. Your Motivation: Relax, Rent or Retire? Mr. Berman said one of the main reasons he decided to go with the Hamptons was the security of knowing he would be able to rent the house out, regardless of the real estate market or the economy. If youre going to buy in a beachfront community, he said, its important that its in a good rental market, especially if youre stretching yourself. And the Hamptons is year-round as well. Rick Drumm (outerbanker.com), an agent with Re/Max Ocean Realty in Nags Head, N.C., said that was an important consideration for many buyers in the Outer Banks, which has few hotels and a robust rental market. But with home prices appreciating more than 20 percent annually in recent years, he said rental rates have not been keeping pace, so buyers rent out their houses more to offset their expenses rather than generate income. According to Mr. Drumm, prices in the region have started to level off this year, appreciating about 12 percent so far in 2006, with an average selling price of $518,000. Homes are also staying on the market longer: about 147 days. He specializes in the upper part of the Outer Banks, from the northern towns of Duck and Corolla, quieter communities with newer housing, to Nags Head in the central more developed part of the Outer Banks. (Farther south is Cape Hatteras, a top surfing spot on the East Coast, and Ocracoke Island, known for its remote beaches.) In general, Mr. Drumm said, the Outer Banks attracts a younger, more active population than Florida, partly because the closest airport (in Norfolk, Va.) is an hour and a half away and getting to the hospital can also involve a long drive. Another factor is that there are fewer condominiums in the region; the real estate market in the Outer Banks is dominated by single-family homes. The House Itself: Mansion, Shack, Cottage or Condo The kind of housing you want is another factor in the decision. That means really thinking about how much upkeep you want to be responsible for, especially if you are buying a second home far from the place you spend most of your time. Kelly Eaton and her husband, both professors in Lincoln, Neb., decided to buy a condo when they were looking for a second home in southern California. They wanted a place where they could spend school vacations near Los Angeles for a dose of urban culture, close proximity to the beach and short drives to visit family. I looked for about five years to find the right place, Ms. Eaton said. I considered everything from a condo in West Hollywood up to Pismo Beach. Ultimately, they bought a condominium in a 200-unit building in Port Hueneme, which she described as probably the cheapest little enclave on the West Coast, about 50 miles north of Santa Monica and 40 miles south of Santa Barbara. (Its the only deep-water port between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay, so the shipping industry and a nearby naval base give the area a more working-class flavor than most beach towns.) One advantage of buying a condominium in a big building: We wanted to be literally right on the ocean, which we are, Ms. Eaton said. But another motivation was avoiding some of the headaches than can crop up with a house, which can be difficult to deal with when you are several states away. Such issues can spoil the reason most people buy a second home: to enjoy a vacation. When we get out here, Ms. Eaton said, we just want to think and read and relax. We dont want to do maintenance. Christine Cook is just the opposite. She bought a one-acre property in the Ditch Plains neighborhood of Montauk, N.Y. (known for its surfing beach), with plans to gut the interior of the tiny one-bedroom cottage nestled among the bramble at the back of the lot. She and her husband had so much fun ripping out kitchen cabinets and installing hardwood flooring (with some help from a contractor) that they next turned their attention to the three-bedroom ranch house on the front of the property, where they put in a new kitchen, bathroom and floor. The renovations allowed them to charge more for the bigger house, which they rent out in the summer. They were all set to enjoy the secluded back cottage when someone bought the vacant lot adjacent to theirs which they had been told was protected wetlands and built a large house with a swimming pool. When you buy and they tell you no one can ever build next door, you have to take that with a grain of salt, Ms. Cook advised, pointing out that anyone who buys in a community of smaller cottages should be prepared to see it change, as McMansions replace the quaint, if somewhat dilapidated, shacks that used to dominate many coastal towns. No one really builds a cottage anymore, she said. People are building suburban-style homes. The Local Community: Your Neighbors and the Town Speaking of neighbors, they are another factor you should take into account. Each beach community is known for attracting a certain crowd: families flock to places like Ocean City, N.J., or Myrtle Beach, S.C.; surfers head to the north shore of Oahu, or to Malibu and Montauk; the stylish set looks to South Beach; retirees winter in posh destinations like Palm Beach or Naples, Fla. But these stereotypes do not necessarily capture the variations you may find within a community (not all the celebrities who retreat to Malibu take a surfboard). For instance, Fire Island has a reputation as a gay summer resort, but although some parts of the island like the Pines very much live up to this billing, others are much more diverse. Moreover, the entire personality of Fire Island (and many other beach destinations) changes after Labor Day, when the summer renters go home. For that reason, James Schwartz, executive editor of Coastal Living magazine (coastalliving.com), recommends visiting sites under consideration at different times of the year. For people who dont like dramatic rises and falls in population, some coastal communities can be very challenging, he said, adding that renting a house will immerse you in the local lifestyle more than staying in a hotel or resort. Youre not going to know what its like living someplace you cant buy baking soda until youve tried it, he pointed out. George and Shirley Spaniel, retirees from Michigan, didnt follow that advice when they bought a house on Amelia Island, Fla., in 1989, but they did research the community to make sure it offered the activities and lifestyle they were looking for. They liked Amelia Islands proximity to cultural activities in Jacksonville, where Ms. Spaniel said they had season tickets to everything that has a season, but the island also has its own historic business district, with good shopping and restaurants and even a hospital. (And it is just an hours drive to the Mayo Clinic and other health care facilities in Jacksonville.) Another factor was being in a community that attracted a mixed age range, and was not dominated by spring break revelers or retirees. Especially if youre retiring young, you want to be around people of all ages, not just the silver foxes, Ms. Spaniel noted. But one change they did not foresee was the opening of a Ritz-Carlton Hotel, which has brought more tourists and more development. I have mixed feelings about the growth, she said. But thats probably happening everywhere, especially with the real estate housing boom that were just now coming down off of. The Beach: Crowds, Sand and Sports Of course, if you are buying a house to be near the beach, it is important to investigate just where youll be able to stake your umbrella, not to mention how tough it is to park your car nearby, what stretches of beach might not be suitable for swimming and how many people youll be fighting for towel space in peak season. Stephen Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at Florida International University (ihrc.fiu.edu), studies issues like water quality and erosion and has issued an annual list of the top beaches in the nation since 1991. Nicknamed Dr. Beach (drbeach.org), he has also written a book called Americas Best Beaches, which gives a great overview of various coastal communities (Midwesterners might take issue with the exclusion of beaches along the Great Lakes). One of his main areas of research is the health of the beaches from year to year. Almost 9 percent of our sandy beaches are eroding, Dr. Leatherman said, advising home buyers to check with local and state coastal management authorities and environmental groups to find out whether erosion is an issue, and what types of beach replenishment programs might be in the works. This is especially important if you are lucky enough to afford a home that truly is on the beach. If youre talking about beachfront houses, he said, the view can be too good. He recalled an ad for a house in South Bethany Beach, Del., that said fishing was possible right from the deck. I guess if theyre advertising it that way, Dr. Leatherman mused, theyre trying to turn a problem into a feature. But if you know erosion is a problem in the area, he offers this tip: Buy the second row and someday youll have beachfront property. Other issues he suggested looking into: any recent problems with water pollution, the location of public access points, whether rip currents are frequent along the part of the coast where you plan to swim and, of course, whether storm surges are a possibility. The Weather: Highs, Lows and Stormy Woes Anyone who has been stuck indoors playing Scrabble while the beach towels got soaked on the clothesline knows that rain falls at the beach, too, and wool sweaters arent unusual some nights in July. So before you make a down payment on the basis of a glorious week of clear skies, do some research into Mother Natures relationship with your beloved beach town. With Weather.coms Vacation Planner tool, you can enter a destination to see the average (and record) high and low temperatures each month of the year, as well as the average monthly rainfall. Travel guidebooks are another good source of historical weather data. For instance, in Marthas Vineyard, the record low for June was just 38 degrees (in 1958), but a year later the record high for October was a balmy 88 degrees. And for anyone who hasnt discovered firsthand that Hawaii gets a lot of rain during the winter, heres a heads up: Kauai typically receives more rain than Maui or Oahu, but throughout Hawaii, winter can be wet, so its not necessarily a sunny refuge for West coast residents hoping to escape the rainy months at home. In general, the weather in coastal areas tends to be more variable than it is farther inland, and the past couple of years have put hurricane season on everyones radar. But just because Florida and the Gulf Coast have borne the brunt of recent hurricanes does not mean residents of the Eastern Seaboard can let their hurricane shutters get buried in the garage. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (noaa.gov), over a typical three-year period, five hurricanes hit the nations coast somewhere between Texas and Maine, although there have certainly been some atypical years lately, and some areas are more at risk than others. Hurricanes hit Cape Hatteras because its sticking out, but they dont really hit the upper part of the Outer Banks, Dr. Leatherman said. Virginias never had a hurricane hit it directly, and in Maryland and New Jersey its very rare. If you are buying a house along the coast, you will probably have to buy flood insurance, which is offered through the federal governments National Flood Insurance Program (floodsmart.gov), not private companies (which cover wind damage from storms). You can find out more about hurricane coverage and flood insurance through the Insurance Information Institute (iii.org), which offers a homebuyers checklist as well as hurricane preparedness advice. If youre thinking of buying a second home, we would highly suggest that you look at insurance costs before you make any decisions, said Jeanne Salvatore, a spokeswoman for the organization. You also want to find out if theres going to be a specific deductible for hurricanes, which could be anywhere from 2 to 5 percent. A final piece of advice: once you move into the beach house you have worked so hard to buy, make sure you actually spend time by the ocean. Ms. Cook admitted that her ongoing renovation projects have kept her and her husband away from the beach for weeks at a time, and Ms. Spaniel acknowledged a similar challenge. If youre not living right on the beach, you dont use it as often as you think you might, she said. We have to kind of schedule it, say, This morning were going down to the beach with our chairs.

851-> The Iraq Plot Thickens (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re "The Captors Become the Captives" (column, May 3): Maureen Dowd's comparing the invasion of Iraq to a classic plotline in which the "inept captors have become the captives" is very insightful. There is a seemingly innocuous but diabolical twist in this plot that is worth highlighting. In unseating Saddam Hussein, President Bush ironically accomplished a longstanding goal of the Iranians: the collapse of Iraqi's military and infrastructure. Next, the conflict in the region jacked up the price of oil, which further enriches Iran's coffers, enabling it to purchase offensive weapons and finance terrorists. In short, with enemies like us, Iran needs no friends; we finish off its enemies and indirectly finance its wars. It would appear that instead of two opposing sides in this global conflict there is only one — that of a diverse group of warmongers. Now that's a twisted plot that will keep us all up guessing till the end. Gyan Chandra Atlanta, May 3, 2006

860-> Scorched Earth
College Park, Md. - NASA has quietly terminated the Deep Space Climate Observatory, citing "competing priorities." The news media took little notice. Few Americans, after all, had even heard of the program. But the entire world may come to mourn its passing. Earth is growing warmer. Even the most strident global-warming deniers have taken to saying that a little warming is a good thing. If the trend continues, however, it will have catastrophic consequences for life on this planet. Correctly identifying the cause could be the most important problem facing humanity. Most scientists link global warming to unrestrained burning of fossil fuels, which shrouds Earth in a blanket of carbon dioxide, trapping the Sun's energy. Others, backed by industries that spew pollutants into the atmosphere, insist that greenhouse emissions are not the problem. They prefer to attribute warming to natural variations in solar output. Scientists are skeptical, but they don't deny the possibility. The issue cries out to be resolved. Even in a world wracked by wars, battles are not fought over scientific disagreements. In science, nature is the sole arbiter. Disputes are resolved only by better experiments. The better experiment when it comes to global warming was to be the climate observatory, situated in space at the neutral-gravity point between the Sun and Earth. Called Lagrange 1, or L1, this point is about one million miles from Earth. At L1, with a view of the full disk of the Sun in one direction, and a full sunlit Earth in the opposite, the observatory could continuously monitor Earth's energy balance. It was given a poetic name, Triana, after Rodrigo de Triana, the sailor aboard Christopher Columbus's ship who first sighted the New World. Development began in November 1998 and it was ready for launching three years later. The cost was only about $100 million. For comparison, that is only one-thousandth the cost of the International Space Station, which serves no useful purpose. Before Triana could be launched, however, there was a presidential election. Many of the industries favored by the new Bush White House were not anxious to have the cause of global warming pinned down. The launching was put on hold. The disdain of the Bush White House for Triana goes much deeper than just a desire to avoid the truth about global warming. Triana began life in early 1998 as a brainchild of Al Gore, who was then the vice president. Mr. Gore, the story goes, woke up one morning wondering if it would be possible to beam a continuous image of the full Earth back from space to inspire people with the need to care for our planet. The 1972 portrait of the full Earth, taken from the Moon, had inspired millions with the fragile beauty of our blue planet. Why not beam the image live into classrooms, allowing students to view weather systems marching around the globe? Scientists had dreamed of such an observatory for years. They hoped Mr. Gore's influence would make it happen. Mr. Gore's support would end up destroying it. Those who hated him, hated Triana. His dream of inspiring environmentalists and schoolchildren served only to trivialize the project. It was ridiculed as "Gore's screen saver." Triana is terminated, but global warming is not. Someday, there will have to be an observatory at L1. Perhaps the most important lesson from our exploration of the solar system is that the most terrible place on Earth is a Garden of Eden compared to the best place anywhere else. We must find out how to keep it that way. Op-Ed Contributor Robert L. Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland, is the author of "Voodoo Science: The Road From Foolishness to Fraud."

861-> Beyond Belief
Richard Dawkins, who holds the interesting title of “Charles Simonyi professor of the public understanding of science” at Oxford University, is a master of scientific exposition and synthesis. When it comes to his own specialty, evolutionary biology, there is none better. But the purpose of this book, his latest of many, is not to explain science. It is rather, as he tells us, “to raise consciousness,” which is quite another thing. The nub of Dawkins’s consciousness-raising message is that to be an atheist is a “brave and splendid” aspiration. Belief in God is not only a delusion, he argues, but a “pernicious” one. On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is certitude that God exists and 7 is certitude that God does not exist, Dawkins rates himself a 6: “I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.” Dawkins’s case against religion follows an outline that goes back to Bertrand Russell’s classic 1927 essay “Why I Am Not a Christian.” First, discredit the traditional reasons for supposing that God exists. (“God” is here taken to denote the Judeo-Christian deity, presumed to be eternal, all-powerful, all-good and the creator of the world.) Second, produce an argument or two supporting the contrary hypothesis, that God does not exist. Third, cast doubt on the transcendent origins of religion by showing that it has a purely natural explanation. Finally, show that we can have happy and meaningful lives without worshiping a deity, and that religion, far from being a necessary prop for morality, actually produces more evil than good. The first three steps are meant to undermine the truth of religion; the last goes to its pragmatic value. What Dawkins brings to this approach is a couple of fresh arguments — no mean achievement, considering how thoroughly these issues have been debated over the centuries — and a great deal of passion. The book fairly crackles with brio. Yet reading it can feel a little like watching a Michael Moore movie. There is lots of good, hard-hitting stuff about the imbecilities of religious fanatics and frauds of all stripes, but the tone is smug and the logic occasionally sloppy. Dawkins fans accustomed to his elegant prose might be surprised to come across such vulgarisms as “sucking up to God” and “Nur Nurny Nur Nur” (here the author, in a dubious polemical ploy, is imagining his theological adversary as a snotty playground brat). It’s all in good fun when Dawkins mocks a buffoon like Pat Robertson and fundamentalist pastors like the one who created “Hell Houses” to frighten sin-prone children at Halloween. But it is less edifying when he questions the sincerity of serious thinkers who disagree with him, like the late Stephen Jay Gould, or insinuates that recipients of the million-dollar-plus Templeton Prize, awarded for work reconciling science and spirituality, are intellectually dishonest (and presumably venal to boot). In a particularly low blow, he accuses Richard Swinburne, a philosopher of religion and science at Oxford, of attempting to “justify the Holocaust,” when Swinburne was struggling to square such monumental evils with the existence of a loving God. Perhaps all is fair in consciousness-raising. But Dawkins’s avowed hostility can make for scattershot reasoning as well as for rhetorical excess. Moreover, in training his Darwinian guns on religion, he risks destroying a larger target than he intends. The least satisfying part of this book is Dawkins’s treatment of the traditional arguments for the existence of God. The “ontological argument” says that God must exist by his very nature, since he possesses all perfections, and it is more perfect to exist than not to exist. The “cosmological argument” says that the world must have an ultimate cause, and this cause could only be an eternal, God-like entity. The “design argument” appeals to special features of the universe (such as its suitability for the emergence of intelligent life), submitting that such features make it more probable than not that the universe had a purposive cosmic designer. These, in a nutshell, are the Big Three arguments. To Dawkins, they are simply ridiculous. He dismisses the ontological argument as “infantile” and “dialectical prestidigitation” without quite identifying the defect in its logic, and he is baffled that a philosopher like Russell — “no fool” — could take it seriously. He seems unaware that this argument, though medieval in origin, comes in sophisticated modern versions that are not at all easy to refute. Shirking the intellectual hard work, Dawkins prefers to move on to parodic “proofs” that he has found on the Internet, like the “Argument From Emotional Blackmail: God loves you. How could you be so heartless as not to believe in him? Therefore God exists.” (For those who want to understand the weaknesses in the standard arguments for God’s existence, the best source I know remains the atheist philosopher J. L. Mackie’s 1982 book “The Miracle of Theism.”) It is doubtful that many people come to believe in God because of logical arguments, as opposed to their upbringing or having “heard a call.” But such arguments, even when they fail to be conclusive, can at least give religious belief an aura of reasonableness, especially when combined with certain scientific findings. We now know that our universe burst into being some 13 billion years ago (the theory of the Big Bang, as it happens, was worked out by a Belgian priest), and that its initial conditions seem to have been “fine tuned” so that life would eventually arise. If you are not religiously inclined, you might take these as brute facts and be done with the matter. But if you think that there must be some ultimate explanation for the improbable leaping-into-existence of the harmonious, biofriendly cosmos we find ourselves in, then the God hypothesis is at least rational to adhere to, isn’t it? No, it’s not, says Dawkins, whereupon he brings out what he views as “the central argument of my book.” At heart, this argument is an elaboration of the child’s question “But Mommy, who made God?” To posit God as the ground of all being is a nonstarter, Dawkins submits, for “any God capable of designing a universe, carefully and foresightfully tuned to lead to our evolution, must be a supremely complex and improbable entity who needs an even bigger explanation than the one he is supposed to provide.” Thus the God hypothesis is “very close to being ruled out by the laws of probability.” Dawkins relies here on two premises: first, that a creator is bound to be more complex, and hence improbable, than his creation (you never, for instance, see a horseshoe making a blacksmith); and second, that to explain the improbable in terms of the more improbable is no explanation at all. Neither of these is among the “laws of probability,” as he suggests. The first is hotly disputed by theologians, who insist, in a rather woolly metaphysical way, that God is the essence of simplicity. He is, after all, infinite in every respect, and therefore much easier to define than a finite thing. Dawkins, however, points out that God can’t be all that simple if he is capable of, among other feats, simultaneously monitoring the thoughts of all his creatures and answering their prayers. (“Such bandwidth!” the author exclaims.) If God is indeed more complex and improbable than his creation, does that rule him out as a valid explanation for the universe? The beauty of Darwinian evolution, as Dawkins never tires of observing, is that it shows how the simple can give rise to the complex. But not all scientific explanation follows this model. In physics, for example, the law of entropy implies that, for the universe as a whole, order always gives way to disorder; thus, if you want to explain the present state of the universe in terms of the past, you are pretty much stuck with explaining the probable (messy) in terms of the improbable (neat). It is far from clear which explanatory model makes sense for the deepest question, the one that, Dawkins complains, his theologian friends keep harping on: why does the universe exist at all? Darwinian processes can take you from simple to complex, but they can’t take you from Nothing to Something. If there is an ultimate explanation for our contingent and perishable world, it would seemingly have to appeal to something that is both necessary and imperishable, which one might label “God.” Of course, it can’t be known for sure that there is such an explanation. Perhaps, as Russell thought, “the universe is just there, and that’s all.” This sort of coolly speculative thinking could not be more remote from the rococo rituals of religion as it is actually practiced across the world. Why is it that all human cultures have religion if, as Dawkins believes he has proved, it rests on a delusion? Many thinkers — Marx, Freud, Durkheim — have produced natural histories of religion, arguing that it arose to serve some social or psychological function, such as, in Freud’s account, the fulfillment of repressed wishes toward a father-figure. Dawkins’s own attempt at a natural history is Darwinian, but not in the way you might expect. He is skeptical that religion has any survival value, contending that its cost in blood and guilt outweighs any conceivable benefits. Instead, he attributes religion to a “misfiring” of something else that is adaptively useful; namely, a child’s evolved tendency to believe its parents. Religious ideas, he thinks, are viruslike “memes” that multiply by infecting the gullible brains of children. (Dawkins coined the term “meme” three decades ago to refer to bits of culture that, he holds, reproduce and compete the way genes do.) Each religion, as he sees it, is a complex of mutually compatible memes that has managed to survive a process of natural selection. (“Perhaps,” he writes in his usual provocative vein, “Islam is analogous to a carnivorous gene complex, Buddhism to a herbivorous one.”) Religious beliefs, on this view, benefit neither us nor our genes; they benefit themselves. Dawkins’s gullible-child proposal is, as he concedes, just one of many Darwinian hypotheses that have been speculatively put forward to account for religion. (Another is that religion is a byproduct of our genetically programmed tendency to fall in love.) Perhaps one of these hypotheses is true. If so, what would that say about the truth of religious beliefs themselves? The story Dawkins tells about religion might also be told about science or ethics. All ideas can be viewed as memes that replicate by jumping from brain to brain. Some of these ideas, Dawkins observes, spread because they are good for us, in the sense that they raise the likelihood of our genes getting into the next generation; others — like, he claims, religion — spread because normally useful parts of our minds “misfire.” Ethical values, he suggests, fall into the first category. Altruism, for example, benefits our selfish genes when it is lavished on close kin who share copies of those genes, or on non-kin who are in a position to return the favor. But what about pure “Good Samaritan” acts of kindness? These, Dawkins says, could be “misfirings,” although, he hastens to add, misfirings of a “blessed, precious” sort, unlike the nasty religious ones. But the objectivity of ethics is undermined by Dawkins’s logic just as surely as religion is. The evolutionary biologist E. O. Wilson, in a 1985 paper written with the philosopher Michael Ruse, put the point starkly: ethics “is an illusion fobbed off on us by our genes to get us to cooperate,” and “the way our biology enforces its ends is by making us think that there is an objective higher code to which we are all subject.” In reducing ideas to “memes” that propagate by various kinds of “misfiring,” Dawkins is, willy-nilly, courting what some have called Darwinian nihilism. He is also hasty in dismissing the practical benefits of religion. Surveys have shown that religious people live longer (probably because they have healthier lifestyles) and feel happier (perhaps owing to the social support they get from church). Judging from birthrate patterns in the United States and Europe, they also seem to be outbreeding secular types, a definite Darwinian advantage. On the other hand, Dawkins is probably right when he says that believers are no better than atheists when it comes to behaving ethically. One classic study showed that “Jesus people” were just as likely to cheat on tests as atheists and no more likely to do altruistic volunteer work. Oddly, Dawkins does not bother to cite such empirical evidence; instead, he relies, rather unscientifically, on his intuition. “I’m inclined to suspect,” he writes, “that there are very few atheists in prison.” (Even fewer Unitarians, I’d wager.) It is, however, instructive when he observes that the biblical Yahweh is an “appalling role model,” sanctioning gang-rape and genocide. Dawkins also deals at length with the objection, which he is evidently tired of hearing, that the arch evildoers of the last century, Hitler and Stalin, were both atheists. Hitler, he observes, “never formally renounced his Catholism”; and in the case of Stalin, a onetime Orthodox seminarian, “there is no evidence that his atheism motivated his brutality.” The equally murderous Mao goes unmentioned, but perhaps it could be argued that he was a religion unto himself. Despite the many flashes of brilliance in this book, Dawkins’s failure to appreciate just how hard philosophical questions about religion can be makes reading it an intellectually frustrating experience. As long as there are no decisive arguments for or against the existence of God, a certain number of smart people will go on believing in him, just as smart people reflexively believe in other things for which they have no knock-down philosophical arguments, like free will, or objective values, or the existence of other minds. Dawkins asserts that “the presence or absence of a creative super-intelligence is unequivocally a scientific question.” But what possible evidence could verify or falsify the God hypothesis? The doctrine that we are presided over by a loving deity has become so rounded and elastic that no earthly evil or natural disaster, it seems, can come into collision with it. Nor is it obvious what sort of event might unsettle an atheist’s conviction to the contrary. Russell, when asked about this by a Look magazine interviewer in 1953, said he might be convinced there was a God “if I heard a voice from the sky predicting all that was going to happen to me during the next 24 hours.” Short of such a miraculous occurrence, the only thing that might resolve the matter is an experience beyond the grave — what theologians used to call, rather pompously, “eschatological verification.” If the after-death options are either a beatific vision (God) or oblivion (no God), then it is poignant to think that believers will never discover that they are wrong, whereas Dawkins and fellow atheists will never discover that they are right. As for those in between — ranging from agnostics to “spiritual” types for whom religion is not so much a metaphysical proposition as it is a way of life, illustrated by stories and enhanced by rituals — they might take consolation in the wise words of the Rev. Andrew Mackerel, the hero of Peter De Vries’s 1958 comic novel “The Mackerel Plaza”: “It is the final proof of God’s omnipotence that he need not exist in order to save us.”

869-> Stock-Car Racing: A Last Blast of Speed in the Fall
LONG before most stock-car drivers hit the big time — now known as the Nascar Nextel Cup series — they race on Saturday nights on short local racetracks with small grandstands, barely enough lighting, and friends and family serving as their mechanics. These tracks, which are often less than a mile around, are proving grounds for a sport that is booming in popularity. Most of the short tracks that sprinkle this country close when summer ends, but the tradition at a few is to stage one final blowout every autumn. “You come to these races, and you see nothing but people smiling from ear to ear,” said Jim Morton, the operations manager at Wall Township Speedway in Wall Township, N.J., which holds its season-ending event, the Turkey Derby, near Thanksgiving. “I’ve been out here when it’s been 60 degrees and when it’s been 6 degrees,” Mr. Morton said, “and the cold weather doesn’t seem to bother people.” These race weekends are not to be confused with the spectacles that are Nextel Cup races. Here, the owner and a driver of a car are often the same person — who has a full-time job — and the crowds are small. The LaCrosse Fairgrounds Speedway’s Oktoberfest in West Salem, Wis., for example, draws about 18,000. Hubert Schulenberg, a 60-year-old salvage dealer from Cross Plains, Wis., retired as a driver five years ago but still plans to attend Oktoberfest for the 30th time with his wife, Paulette. They will sleep in a camper on the fairgrounds. “They have just about every class of racing you can possibly think of,” he said. The fields at these events are enormous, and the racing is nonstop, with one heat usually following another. There is a lot of racing to squeeze into a weekend. At Thompson International Speedway in Thompson, Conn., in mid-October, between 550 and 600 cars are expected to compete in 14 divisions. Cars that do not meet the track’s rules are grouped in what is called an “outlaws” division, with weight added to some to ensure closer racing. “It’s a huge party for race fans,” said Russ Dowd, the director of operations at Thompson. Low admission fees are another lure: a single-day ticket at Oktoberfest, for example, is $15 to $25 for adults and $4 to $5 a child. Racing in several different classifications, including the late-model stock cars and sleek, angular modified racers, is the focal point, but the events have also become gathering places for those who hate to see winter coming. “I think it’s a mixture of a county fair, a family reunion and a picnic,” said Chuck Deery, the general manager at LaCrosse Speedway. Mr. Morton at Wall Township Speedway said that for racers, these celebrations are steppingstones for the next year. The racing is fierce, with cars side by side on the tracks and constant lead changes. There is often much more action on a short track than in a Nextel Cup race. Lee USA Speedway in Lee, N.H., is about 30 miles from New Hampshire International Speedway, a one-mile track in Loudon, N.H., that plays host to two Nextel Cup races every year. More than 100,000 attended the Nextel Cup races, but the races at Lee USA have their own appeal. “It’s etched in stone,’’ said Judy MacDonald, the sales manager at Lee USA. “It’s just part of what you do.’’ Because the Turkey Derby at Wall Speedway is held after the Nextel Cup season, a few stock-car big boys, who never seem to get enough speed, will join in; Ken Schrader, a Nextel Cup veteran, plans to race in two divisions this year. For young drivers, there’s an opportunity to gain recognition. An 18-year-old local hotshot named Martin Truex Jr. won a modified-class event at the Turkey Derby in 1998. Mr. Truex is now Dale Earnhardt Jr.’s teammate in the Nextel Cup series. Mostly, the fields are filled with cars driven by racers from nearby who just want to take a few final hot laps before stashing their cars in garages for the winter. The purses usually offer only enough to defray costs. But that, apparently, is enough. “If you go for the money, you’re not going to make anything out of it,” Mr. Schulenberg said. “You go for the sport.” LaCrosse Fairgrounds Speedway, Highway 16; 608-786-1525; www.lacrossespeedway.com.

870-> Inside the List
Since writing the 1987 hit (which she adapted for the 1991 movie “Fried Green Tomatoes”), Fannie Flagg has perfected her recipe for down-home Southern middlebrow fiction — crisp on the outside, mushy in the middle. In “Can’t Wait to Get to Heaven,” which makes its debut at No. 3 on the hardcover list this week, the octogenarian Elner Shimfissle falls out of her fig tree and winds up in, yes, heaven Like Flagg’s best-selling (2002), the book is set in the fictional Elmwood Springs, Mo. But Flagg, who divides her time between California and her native Alabama, said it was actually modeled on her home state. “I set it in Elmwood Springs to make it universal, but it’s really about Alabama,” she told The Birmingham News last month. The lessons of “Can’t Wait to Get to Heaven” are “simple but effective,” The Miami Herald wrote. “Enjoy your time on earth. Be nice. Eat cake. Remember you don’t have to be rich or famous to touch other lives in a profound way. And take care that you don’t meet your Maker in a ratty old bathrobe, because wouldn’t you just die of embarrassment if you weren’t already dead?” The afterlife isn’t quite so cozy in Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins’s latest book, “The Rapture,” the third prequel in their “Left Behind” series of evangelical novels about people stranded on earth after the Second Coming. The books have sold more than 60 million copies since 1995. Now at No. 26 on the extended list, “The Rapture” was released early last month with the teaser “06.06.06. Will You Be Ready?” It reunites Rayford Steele, an airline pilot, with Cameron “Buck” Williams, a journalist — who this time around is in Israel when the Russians attack and Buck “experiences for himself the miraculous deliverance of the Holy Land.” (In the series, Jews are tolerated pretty much only if they convert to Christianity.) LaHaye, a graduate of Bob Jones University and co-founder of the Moral Majority, lives on a golf course in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He makes no secret of his far-right politics. Previous books have depicted the secretary general of the United Nations as the Antichrist, while the pope only ranked as an assistant to the Antichrist. Tyndale House, which publishes the series, has said the majority of “Left Behind” readers are from the South and the Midwest, with the Northeast trailing. At least for now. In “Left Behind: Eternal Forces,” a video game slated for release later this year, players can comb postapocalyptic Manhattan fighting the forces of the Antichrist and looking for non-Christians to convert. How they’ll be distinguishable from the usual subway evangelists remains to be seen.

874-> Cover Up the Diagram; Enjoy North’s Perplexity
During a 10-day tournament, several unusual deals will arise. This one, from the final session of the Nail Life Master Pairs at the North American Bridge Championships in Hawaii on Nov. 18, produced some interesting results. You are sitting North. Both sides are vulnerable, and your opponents retain a respectful silence. Your partner deals and passes, you open one no-trump, promising only 12-14 points, and partner raises immediately to six no-trump! What would you be thinking? I am a big fan of the weak no-trump. In particular, it is comforting to know that when partner opens one club he has either club length or at least 15 high-card points. But it takes some nerve to use the bid in the third position vulnerable. The brave jouster was Marshall Miles, an octogenarian from Redlands, Calif., who has won several national titles. When the jester, Leo Bell of Long Beach, Calif., suddenly raised to six no-trump when he did not open the bidding, Miles must have wondered exactly what was going to appear in the dummy. But when he saw nine solid diamonds, he claimed 12 tricks for plus 1,440 and a top. There was another sly South who passed. West opened a light one spade, North passed, and East responded two no-trump, a game-forcing spade raise. (If you wish to do more than raise straight to four spades, using a splinter bid to show the diamond shortage looks preferable.) Now South bid a quiet three diamonds. There were two passes, and East doubled, thinking that she was showing a diamond shortage. But her partner, believing it was for penalty, passed. South took 12 tricks for plus 1,270, but he received only 21 match points out of 64. Many pairs reached a slam, including John Armstrong and Paul Hackett from England, who finished second behind Steve Garner and Howard Weinstein of Sarasota, Fla. Armstrong opened with an unimaginative five diamonds. Hackett, expecting his three aces to be useful, raised to six. There seemed to be only 12 tricks, but in a pair event one must fight for every overtrick. Declarer ruffed the opening spade-king lead in his hand, cashed the diamond ace, played a trump to the board, discarded a heart on the spade ace, then ran his trumps to give this end position:  NORTH 9 A 6 3  A  WEST Q K J  9 6 EAST  Q 10 9  Q J  SOUTH  7 9 7 7 5  On the penultimate trump, West erred by discarding a club instead of a heart. South threw the spade nine from the board, and East was caught in a trump squeeze. If he pitched a club, declarer would play a club to the dummy’s ace, take the heart ace, ruff a heart in his hand and cash the established club seven. And if East shed a heart, South would play a heart to dummy’s ace and ruff a heart, setting up dummy’s remaining heart as the 13th trick. Plus 1,390 scored 55 match points; plus 1,370 would have been worth only 37 match points.

876-> Sisters Feud, and a Mansion Crumbles
SAG HARBOR THE snug streets of this two-square-mile former whaling port on Gardiners Bay are lined with homes that reflect more than 200 years of architectural trends: clean-lined Federal two-stories from the 1700s; columned Greek Revival colonials; and 19th-century clapboard sailors’ cottages. What most of the homes have in common is their condition: they have been restored inside and out. Homes within walking distance of the shops and restaurants on Main Street in this New England-style village where land is scarce would fetch more than $1 million on the market, real estate brokers say. Yet within the village, the best-known house may be one that has not been restored: a crumbling, a possibly two-century-old property on a prime site. Fifty or more onlookers, steaming cups of coffee in hand, turned out for an auction of this house, held outside Village Hall on a chilly late-October morning. There were no bids. It was the second time in two years that the old house on Union Street was up for auction by court order, stemming from a 2003 lawsuit. Last year, the minimum opening bid was set at $1.5 million; this year it was reduced to $1.1 million. When the auction ended after about six minutes of bemused silence, Annselm Morpurgo, 72, whose name is on the title of the house, stood up and announced her own auction. “I have to buy my sister out,” Ms. Morpurgo said, holding up a piece of paper outlining a business proposal that offered a share of the house for $800,000. Many people turned and walked away as reporters approached Ms. Morpurgo and her sister, Helga, 71, sitting nearby. The Morpurgo sisters, who inherited the house from their mother in the 1970s, have been at odds for years over its fate. Helga Morpurgo said she gave up her half of the house to her sister in exchange for a $34,500 mortgage, which her sister never paid back. At some point, the sisters agreed that both should share in the proceeds if the house was sold. Annselm Morpurgo lives in the house and says it is worth $4.5 million. That is the current asking price for the house, which she has had listed through Century 21 Agawam Realty for about three years. Ted Seiter, the Agawam broker handling the listing, said a buyer offered $1.2 million three weeks before the auction, but Ms. Morpurgo turned it down, saying the house was worth more. Ms. Morpurgo has also said that a nonprofit “futurist organization,” the Savant Garde Institute, is based in the home and has a 99-year lease on the property. Helga Morpurgo, who lives in a subsidized senior housing complex in East Hampton, filed the 2003 lawsuit seeking the sale of the house. She said her sister’s claim about the institute’s lease foiled last year’s auction. “It had absolutely no standing,” she said. “But it was enough of a threat for people not to bid.” Since last year’s auction, Justice Thomas Whalen of the State Supreme Court has issued a ruling that the Savant Garde Institute is not recognized by the court and ordered the second auction. The sisters are in a common situation, said Helga’s lawyer, Andrew Towner of East Hampton. “Whenever you have multiple ownership and one party wants to cash out and go and the other doesn’t, this is the only way out,” Mr. Towner said of the auction. He said that each sister had a 37.5 percent interest in the house and that the sisters had once agreed that the institute would be due the remaining 25 percent. How that percentage will be divided now is another matter for the courts, he said. The auction did bring a few unofficial offers for the house afterward, Mr. Towner said, and he is researching whether the courts could force Annselm Morpurgo, who represents herself in court, to sell at a price near the minimum bid. Ms. Morpurgo said she thought the house, an Italianate three-story, could be older and more valuable than the sisters first believed. Last year, the sisters said the house was built in 1812 for a whaler named Captain Vail. Now, Annselm Morpurgo says she thinks the house may have been built even earlier; she says she has found indications that it may have been the home of Lt. Col. John Hulbert, a militia leader in the Revolutionary War. But brokers say the value of the house is not its history, but rather its location and its permit for eight apartments. “What people like about Sag Harbor is, it’s a walking village,” said Robert Evjen, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman and a Sag Harbor resident. “You don’t need to drive around in a car.” According to the village, the house has a certificate of occupancy for eight apartments, dating to an earlier use as an apartment house, which means that a builder may try to convert it to co-ops or renovate it for rental apartments, Mr. Evjen said. Helga Morpurgo and others who have been in the house say there is no plumbing or central heating. The wraparound porch is collapsing and strewn with debris. “It’s bombed out, no argument there,” Annselm Morpurgo told visitors after the auction. “But I just don’t have the money to fix it.” The Morpurgo house is directly behind the John Jermain Memorial Library, a stately brick building facing Main Street. The library considered buying the house in recent years as part of an expansion plan. But Annselm Morpurgo’s price was too high, about $2.5 million at the time. In 2004, voters rejected an $8.5 million bond proposal to build a second library building nearby. Despite that rejection, Eric Cohen, who is on a library committee drawing up a new proposal for voters, said, “Morpurgo is completely off the table.” No matter for Annselm Morpurgo, who said the ideal buyer would be a multimillionaire who could give the Savant Garde Institute a $100 million grant to buy out her sister, fix up the house, pay off Ms. Morpurgo’s debts and finance future research. Many shake their heads at Annselm Morpurgo’s actions: among them, offering the house for $19 million on eBay (“purely for publicity,” she said), devising business proposals and rejecting offers. But the reason for these actions is that she does not plan to leave her house. “Where else am I going to go?” she said. “I’m comfortable here, and my sister’s comfortable where she is.” Helga Morpurgo wants just as much to sell the house, or just her share, and move to an arts community in Truth or Consequences, N.M., she said. “My sister is not crazy; she’s brilliant and very creative,” Helga Morpurgo said. “She just doesn’t want to deal with the reality of the house.”

878-> HOCKEY; Shootouts in Florida Don't Favor Rangers
TAMPA, Fla., March 25 - By the time the puck was dropped here Saturday night, the scoreboard showed that the Flyers had already taken a 4-0 lead over the Ottawa Senators in Philadelphia. That meant the Rangers, who entered the day a single point ahead of the Flyers in the Atlantic Division standings, would probably need a victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning to retain sole possession of first place. Jaromir Jagr did everything in his power to make that happen, assisting on the Rangers' second goal and scoring their third. After the Rangers let leads of 2-0 and 3-1 slip away in regulation, Jagr nearly scored the winner in the final seconds of overtime. But for the second consecutive evening, Jagr could not score in a shootout. Neither could any of his teammates on Saturday, when the Lightning came away with a 4-3 victory on Brad Richards's shootout goal. The Rangers have lost three in a row, but they gained a point in the standings because of the shootout loss. The Rangers (39-20-12) have 90 points, the same as the Flyers (40-21-10), who defeated Ottawa, 6-3. "It's going to come down to our games head to head," Jagr said after the game, referring to the Rangers' two games left with the Flyers. The Rangers have lost 9 of their last 12, after a season-best seven-game winning streak. If they are going to come out of it, Jagr is going to need some help. Jagr increased his league-leading goal total to 51. "It's my job to score goals," said Jagr, who has recorded at least a point in eight consecutive games. "Sometimes, of course, it would help if maybe the second, the third and the fourth lines scored. But it doesn't have to be necessary. That's the way our team is structured. I've got no problem with that." His 107 points this season lead the league, and on Saturday, the 34-year-old Jagr pulled into a tie with Mark Messier (1991-92) for the second-most points in Rangers history. Only Jean Ratelle, who had 109 points in 1971-72, has more. On Friday night, Jagr became only the third Ranger to have 50 goals in a season. The others were Adam Graves, who had 52 goals in 1993-94, and Vic Hadfield, who had 50 in 1971-72. "I'm not a scoring machine," Jagr said after his unsuccessful attempt in Friday night's shootout against the Florida Panthers. The Rangers lost that game, 3-2. Not in shootouts, perhaps. But in regulation, Jagr has certainly qualified. SLAP SHOTS Rangers left wing Martin Rucinsky left the team to have an examination on his broken left index finger in New York on Saturday. Coach Tom Renney said Rucinsky would miss a month. "He's going to have surgery on it, we hope, tomorrow morning," Renney said. "And beyond that, I'm not sure." Rucinsky's finger was broken in multiple places when Florida defenseman Jay Bouwmeester swung his stick. Renney was asked if there was a chance that Rucinsky could be back for the playoffs. "That's the way we're looking at it," Renney said. "Let's just make sure we get there, so he's got some hockey to play." Defenseman Darius Kasparaitis missed his third consecutive game Saturday with a sore groin muscle. "Maybe Monday," he said. "But it still hurts, so I don't think it's going to get better."

881-> Rhode Island: Students Sue Over Sign Removal
A women’s group at Rhode Island College has filed a federal lawsuit against the college, claiming that their right to free speech was violated after the campus police took down signs reading “Keep your rosaries off our ovaries.” The suit says that the women’s group received permission to hang the signs at the college entrance for two days last December, and that the president of the college, John Nazarian, ordered them removed after a priest saying Mass at Mr. Nazarian’s home complained. In September, the college, which is public, adopted a policy forbidding students to hang signs near its entrance, a ban the women’s group claims is selectively enforced.

884-> The Manhattanville Project
One evening in the spring of 2004, the Rev. Earl Kooperkamp attended a presentation at a community board meeting by the celebrated architect Renzo Piano. Unveiling preliminary sketches, Piano laid out his vision for the campus he's designing for Columbia University's president, Lee Bollinger. In contrast to the gated, stone Beaux-Arts-Renaissance campus built more than a century ago in Morningside Heights, the new West Harlem campus would tell a more contemporary story: filling almost 18 acres parallel to the waterfront, it would open Columbia to the surrounding community. Some buildings could reach 25 stories, and the streets would remain publicly accessible. A walkway would extend from 125th to 133rd Streets, cutting through the length of the campus. And in the center of a square of buildings there would be a large, open space. "It is a piazza," Piano said, in his lilting Italian accent. "The people will come, there will be discourse." Kooperkamp, the Kentucky-born minister of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in West Harlem, was skeptical. "You're talking about being a 21st-century university," he recalls telling Piano. "And this looks like 12th-century Christ Church Oxford. It's a quad. That's not a piazza. That's not open space for a community. If it were, it would be a big lawn on 125th Street or Broadway." The dispute over Piano's piazza encapsulates a larger conflict Columbia is now having with its neighbors to the north. When Columbia announced its plans to build a much-needed new campus in a corner of Harlem called Manhattanville, it saw a gritty neighborhood of auto-repair shops, tenements and small manufacturers that would probably pose little obstacle to its ambitions. Columbia says that the project will advance a vital public interest and help revitalize parts of Upper Manhattan. Yet the university has met remarkable resistance. One man's urban improvement, it seems, is another man's urban debacle. The divergent views of the project may arise from the very different situations of its beholders. Since becoming Columbia's president in 2002, Bollinger has committed himself to restoring the international stature the university held half a century ago, when Columbia boasted such luminaries as Daniel Bell and Lionel Trilling and almost half the faculty of its physics department either had won or would win a Nobel Prize. To do that, Bollinger's administration has been recruiting hard, hiring, among others, some 10 star economists and 18 science and engineering professors. "As knowledge grows and fields grow, we need more faculty, you need a certain scale," Bollinger says. "And we need places to put them. Now, a number of young faculty share offices. Our science departments have lab conditions that don't compare to what other top universities have." As Bollinger often points out, Columbia has 194 square feet per student; Harvard boasts 368. Certainly Columbia's plans are ambitious: across a large swath of Upper Manhattan, the university wants to create an academic enclave that will both nurture intellectual progress and revitalize an urban area. Piano's design aims to accomplish both. The campus will have wide, open streets that offer a broad view of the waterfront. Along the main thoroughfares, the lower floors of the academic buildings will be mostly glass — "they will be floating," as Piano puts it — filled with shops, restaurants and arts spaces serving the broader public of Harlem and the Upper West Side. The designs are still preliminary, and plans for specific buildings have yet to be developed. But Piano, who also designed The New York Times's new headquarters, now under construction, and a well-received addition to the Morgan Library, is committed to designing the space to promote these integrationist aims. "You will feel part of the community," Piano told me when we met at Columbia's Prentis Hall, a white-tiled former milk-bottling plant on Manhattanville's southern edge. Indeed, Piano's drawings, on display in the sunny ground-floor workshop, depict transparent skyscrapers lining ample boulevards with ethereal-looking pedestrians ambling along them. But in the eyes of many local residents, Piano's optimistic rendering obscures the fact that to fulfill its vision, the university will have to bulldoze almost everything that's already there. About 1,600 people are currently employed in this part of Manhattanville, and some 400 live there. Many residents are disturbed by the placement of the campus between a park being built at the West Harlem Pier and the community that fought for years to have that park created. Meanwhile, most everyone expects that the university's arrival will accelerate the gentrification that is already transforming the historically black neighborhood of Harlem — to the benefit of some residents and the harm of others. That places Columbia in an awkward position. "If Columbia were like another private developer, most would say it has no responsibility," says Peter Marcuse, a professor of urban planning at Columbia. "Developers are private-sector entities whose purpose is to make money. But Columbia is a nonprofit institution. It gets substantial public benefits and thus has substantial public obligations as a property owner." Of course, those public obligations are hard to define. If a development creates thousands of worthwhile new jobs, mostly for outsiders, while eliminating hundreds of local jobs, has it served the public good? ollinger came to Columbia with the respect of many in Harlem who had long regarded the university with suspicion. As president of the University of Michigan, he won renown for defending a challenge to its affirmative-action program all the way to the Supreme Court. And from the start, he presented Columbia's plan as promoting the integration of a public-service-oriented university with its diverse surroundings. "There was a time when Columbia really turned its back on where it was located," Bollinger says. "I wanted to take exactly the opposite approach." That presented Columbia with a complex architectural challenge. "A university is a place where young people take a step back from the world so that when they re-enter, they do so with great intensity, care and responsibility," says Mark Wigley, dean of Columbia's graduate school of architecture. "So the university must be a defined space. The fascinating challenge is how to make that a space of withdrawal and reflection and at the same time integrate that space in the richest way possible in the very heart of vibrant New York City." In Bollinger's view, that sort of space benefits not only the university but also its neighbors. A hallmark of the new campus will be a center featuring Columbia's impressive array of neuroscientists. Bollinger also wants to bring the School of the Arts to Manhattanville, linking the arts with the physical and the social sciences. "We're looking for a new kind of intellectual paradigm," Bollinger told me, seated in his spacious office in Low Memorial Library, an imposing domed edifice in the center of the Morningside Heights campus. "Now we don't have the facilities to really achieve this intellectual ambition." Columbia has promised to relocate residents directly displaced by its $7 billion plan, which it expects will create nearly 7,000 new jobs over 25 to 30 years — including academic, technical, maintenance and support positions, plus those at any new restaurants and shops. It has reserved space on the campus for a public school specializing in math, science and engineering. And Bollinger says he's willing to negotiate other benefits, like local hiring preferences. But to Bollinger, who describes his approach to development as "somewhere between the Jane Jacobs and Robert Moses views of the world," the interests of Harlem residents are only one concern among many. "We are not a profit-making institution looking out for our own advantage," he said. "We are trying to do things that help the world more broadly. The community is not everything." Above all, he seems unwilling to compromise on one thing: he wants the entire space. Indeed, Piano's design requires it. Much of the campus is to be built into a sort of bathtub that could reach seven stories underground. "The factory," as Piano calls it, would hide the facility's more noxious needs — like parking, loading docks and energy equipment — allowing the campus itself to be serene. Columbia has already purchased more than half the property it would need. But some owners have refused to sell, and Columbia says that eminent domain remains an option if negotiations fail. It's a dicey option, however. Throughout the country, public opposition to eminent domain has mounted since last summer, when the Supreme Court ruled that private property can be seized by local governments for private development. Virtually every state has considered changing its eminent-domain laws; at least 13 different bills on the subject have been introduced in Congress. As Justice Clarence Thomas noted in his dissent in the recent Kelo case, concerning New London, Conn., an expansive definition of "public use" in the 50's and 60's permitted local governments to eliminate entire minority neighborhoods through eminent domain in the name of "urban renewal" — soon known as "Negro removal" among blacks. Not surprisingly, Columbia's talk of seizing property does not go over well in Harlem. Still, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has come out in strong support of eminent domain — which also figures in the developer Bruce Ratner's controversial efforts to construct a basketball stadium and condos in the Atlantic Yards area of Brooklyn. Without it, "every big city would have all construction come to a screeching halt," Bloomberg said recently. It doesn't help Columbia's reputation in Harlem that it wants to use part of the space for a lab with a security clearance that would allow research on highly dangerous substances like anthrax. (Columbia says that it has no plans to actually do such research on the new campus.) Since Sept. 11, many people have warned that such labs could become terrorist targets. And given that Harlem has long been a depository for the city's unwanted environmental hazards — including a sewage-treatment plant and three-quarters of Manhattan's bus depots — many residents are immediately suspicious of large government-supported projects. "You never know when an accident can happen," says Sarah Martin, president of the residents' association at a housing development in Manhattanville. "Where do a lot of deadly viruses come from? They're airborne sometimes. I heard something about the AIDS virus being made in a dish. So that's a possibility." Indeed, many are quick to mention an outbreak last year of Legionnaire's disease at the Columbia-affiliated NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital or that Columbia has been fined for mishandling hazardous waste. Local residents also repeatedly reminded me that Columbia scientists participated in the original Manhattan Project — leading some to dub Columbia's campus plan "the Manhattanville Project." Columbia hopes that the benevolent aims of the institution, and its modern campus featuring open spaces that local residents can enjoy, will eventually assuage local concerns. "This is creating a neighborhood," says Bernard Tschumi, a former dean of Columbia's school of architecture. "Students bring street life, they bring safety. Maybe not when universities built themselves as fortresses, like Columbia did a century ago. But the attitude today is very different. Renzo and Lee have exactly the right idea." Still, other architecture critics are skeptical. "If it's driving out existing businesses and driving up real estate prices, then the specific character of the architecture has very little impact," says Michael Sorkin, director of the Graduate Urban Design Program at City College. "I don't think that glassy facades have much to do with the loss of low-cost housing." In Sorkin's view, Columbia will have to offer the community more than a pleasing design to address that: "What they do to mitigate that disruption is a measure of the conscience and intelligence of the university." The greatest fear of West Harlem residents is that they'll eventually be driven out. "The central thing to understand is that Harlem is terrified of gentrification, and rightly so," says Herbert Gans, a Columbia sociologist. Columbia's arrival is only intensifying those fears. "Columbia is an important cog in the wheel that is driving gentrification in Harlem," says Nellie Bailey, executive director of the Harlem Tenants' Council. "This is not just a neighborhood struggle. What will happen to the city's mosaic if the working and middle class can no longer afford to live here?" But many, including Gans, think that if the university handles the project well, Columbia could bring much-needed jobs, affordable housing and other improvements to Manhattanville — an area Gans calls "an industrial slum." t a packed forum last fall at the Municipal Art Society in Midtown Manhattan, it was clear that Columbia's efforts to win over its neighbors were faring poorly. "We welcome Columbia to our neighborhood, but not to bulldoze us," announced Anne Whitman, owner of a moving and storage business situated in the proposed construction site. It was not possible to know how representative those in attendance were of the Manhattanville community. That said, business owners, planning experts and West Harlem residents alternately described Columbia's plan as "abysmal," "criminal," "greedy" and "heartless." At a city hearing a month later, 70 speakers stood up over a period of six and a half hours to denounce "Hurricane Columbia" for a plan many claimed would force out longtime residents, eliminate skilled manufacturing jobs, drive up Harlem housing costs and segregate the racially diverse neighborhood. Columbia has presented its new campus designs to a range of West Harlem community organizations. So far, though, the plans don't seem to have calmed their concerns. "Columbia is going to be between the community and the park," says Peggy Shepard, executive director of We Act for Environmental Justice. "Will people feel comfortable going over there, or will it be only for Columbia students?" In part, the problem may be that the general public — and particularly the immediately surrounding neighborhood — doesn't always view architectural designs the way architects do. "In theory, a brilliant design can overcome social reservations on the part of the community," says Alex Krieger, professor of urban planning and design at Harvard. "But such conflicts are as much emotional as they are rational. A neighborhood that feels itself disempowered by comparison to the power of a university is always going to have its guard up." Given Columbia's history, that guard is particularly high here. In 1968, when much of the world was in turmoil, Columbia University had its own reckoning. Although campus protests were common for the day, the uprising at Columbia was striking for its scale and brutality. And the spark had much to do with a university expansion plan: to construct a gymnasium in Morningside Park in Harlem. In a concession to the community, the university agreed to provide gym facilities for local residents — with a separate entrance on the Harlem side. The so-called Gym Crow didn't sit well with Harlem neighbors, or with many students on campus. And it fueled tensions over other expansion efforts, as throughout the 60's Columbia had been purchasing apartment buildings all over Morningside Heights, displacing thousands of poor, mostly black and Puerto Rican residents. In April 1968, students took over five major campus buildings in protest. A week later, the standoff ended in bloodshed: police stormed the buildings, beating and arresting students. Nearly 200 were injured. "It was a war, and it had devastating consequences," Bollinger told me recently. "Many faculty left because they were bitter that the university had allowed an anti-intellectual group to take down the university; others left because the response was so brutal." Community Board 9, composed of about 50 people appointed by the borough president who represent a broad cross-section of West Harlem residents, activists and business owners, does not oppose Columbia's expansion to West Harlem per se. But it wants Columbia to conform to a very different West Harlem plan that the board has developed — after community meetings and consultations with urban-planning experts — over the last decade. In Manhattanville, the board's plan would retain some manufacturing, preserve more historic architecture and allow current property owners to remain. The university would have to build around them. The city, now reviewing both proposals, has asked Columbia and the community board to try to reconcile their differences. That may be difficult. Although Bollinger acknowledges that Columbia has an obligation to its surrounding community, he says he believes that Columbia's nonprofit status also works the other way around: "We're not here to make money, we're here to discover knowledge. So there's a larger public interest here that's extremely important to keep one's eye on." Columbia has agreed to negotiate with a development corporation and the community board over providing a broad range of benefits. Across the country, such agreements are increasingly encouraging private designs to encompass the concerns of public planning. If successful, the Manhattanville project could become a model for responsible urban development — balancing the university's global ambitions with some of its neighbors' more immediate concerns. Back when he was championing affirmative action, Bollinger described diversity as "trying to understand what it is like to be in the mind of another person who has a different life experience." The success of his latest endeavor may depend on whether he can generate that kind of empathy now.

885-> An Artist and a Designer Who Found Their Niche
THE massive black walnut tree rising majestically behind the house was a very good sign, for it meant that one of Warren Muller's three requirements for a country place had been met. And it was even before Mr. Muller, an artist, and his partner, RJ Thornburg, an interior designer, had walked through the front door of the 19th-century farmhouse they were checking out in the Pocono Mountains, in Brodheadsville, Pa. "I told RJ that there were only three things I really needed to be happy," Mr. Muller, 60, explained recently. "A fireplace, a bath and a good tree to hang my hammock." Mr. Thornburg, 50, who once created rooms by the thousands for Disney and other corporate clients and who today is one of Philadelphia's most sought-after residential interior designers, could easily add a fireplace and a luxurious bathtub to the house if they ended up buying it. But a tree like the walnut, with its large branches strong enough to hold both ends of a hammock, could not be manufactured. It had to be found. Found objects play a large role in Mr. Muller's life, though the tree was somewhat unusual in that he had an idea of what he was looking for before he found it. His art, which is not simple to describe, is mostly electrified installations that range from playful chandelierlike fixtures built of teapots and samovars to large conglomerations of rusty farm implements, bright orange broom brushes and glass busts of dead presidents. Most of his pieces are commissioned for specific spaces, but many of those that are not are for sale in Mr. Muller and Mr. Thornburg's gallery, bahdeebahdu, at 309 Cherry Street in Philadelphia. Mr. Muller's works are constructed almost entirely from everyday objects that he collects on regular pilgrimages to flea markets, junk stores, Home Depots and the like. And though he often knows generally what he needs — "I'm looking for something that could make an elegant pair of sconces," he said, holding up as possibilities two wood-and-steel mole traps that looked disturbingly like some kind of medieval chastity device — more often than not, his collecting is done without a finished product in mind. Occasionally material even shows up unbidden, like the collection of vintage pedal cars that arrived in a crate sent by friends on vacation in Asia, with a note saying, "We thought you might like these." Mr. Muller thinks they might be useful in a piece he's creating for a Mini-Cooper dealership. In a way, the house on the wooded lane in the rolling, bucolic hills of Brodheadsville fits into the unbidden-treasures category. About three years ago, Mr. Muller and Mr. Thornburg began a typically relaxed search for a place outside the city. Their first thought was Bucks County, Pa., where they had visited and had friends. But after a few excursions with real estate agents, they realized that the prices in Bucks County and other similarly popular Philadelphia retreats were more than they were looking to spend, at least for the kind of place they were hoping to find. "All we could afford were these little houses with no land, really, and no outbuildings," Mr. Muller said. So when a friend came into the gallery talking about her place in the Poconos, a part of the world neither Mr. Muller nor Mr. Thornburg had ever seen, they were intrigued enough to say, "Well, if you hear of something that sounds like us, let us know." The word came the next day. She had in fact seen a place that seemed to fit the bill — a three-bedroom, about 1,800-square-foot house on a hilly three acres in Brodheadsville, about 25 miles north of Allentown, and roughly the same distance from the New Jersey border. Best of all, perhaps, the sellers were motivated to make a quick sale. Mr. Muller and Mr. Thornburg decided to make a stop there on their way up to a summer rental in Provincetown on Cape Cod. "We were trying not to seem too excited as we walked around," Mr. Muller recalled. "We didn't want the sellers to know how much we liked it. But we pretty much knew it was great the moment we got out of the car. And then they said, 'Oh, and do you want to see the barn and garage across the road?' and we said, 'You mean those are part of the property, too?' We didn't even know until then." By the time Mr. Muller and Mr. Thornburg got to Provincetown, they had decided to make an offer, and by the time they got back from their vacation, they had a deal (they wouldn't disclose the price). "We were saying to ourselves, 'Oh my God, what are we doing, are we out of our minds?' " To see the house today is to know that they were in full possession of their senses, as well as the energy and taste to transform a place with a lot of potential but not much else into a home with a clean, modern style and a generous supply of creature comfort. The kitchen, with its limestone floor and lava-stone counters, and which is hung with art made by friends, is now entirely elegant without having lost any of the coziness of a traditional farmhouse kitchen. Mr. Muller's required bathtub was added, of course — a deep, free-standing affair with a second-floor view out to their garden-in-the-making. A new fireplace for the living room completed the primary wish list. After that, removing the old ceilings to expose the beams and wide floorboards above, the addition of a second-floor deck, and the conversion of what had once been a mudroom into a sunroom were just gravy. In certain choice locations throughout the house Mr. Muller's own work appears. Over the table in the dining room, for instance, hang three chandeliers of iron, wood and glass. The central one consists primarily of a sharp and gracefully curving set of industrial calipers that look hungry themselves. Over the mantel in the living room the effect is softer: a row of 15 hooks, each with a teardrop bulb suspended from it. It reads like an inverted candelabra, or a friendly jack-o'-lantern grin. LIKE most authentic farmhouses, this one was built in stages. The result is not unlike Mr. Muller's own creations, in which old, new, borrowed and incandescent pieces are fused into elegant new wholes that seem both to tell stories and to refuse to give up their secrets. "I love the history that hides in everyday objects," Mr. Muller said. "A history that you know is there but that you can never really learn." It's as if to him objects — houses, rusty pitchforks, bent bugles and the like — have personalities and lives of their own that bring them periodically into personal interaction with people who are patient and open to what Mr. Muller calls the "interesting things that come our way when we aren't really looking for them." Even the hand-carved columns by the house's entryway arrived in the usual unusual fashion. "I was standing here on the porch one day not long after we bought the house, and a friend called out of the blue all the way from India and said, 'I'm in this amazing market that's full of columns — do you need any columns?' And I looked at the post I was standing next to and said, 'Well, now that you mention it, let me get my tape measure.' " Two years in, the work is by no means done. In addition to the house, the property has a barn that will eventually become Mr. Muller's studio; a large garage with an attached workroom that will become Mr. Thornburg's studio; a smokehouse that may become a sauna; a springhouse that still houses the pump for the spring water down by a spring that looks for all the world like Monet's garden; a chicken coop that may again become a chicken coop; and a two-seater outhouse whose future is still undetermined. But there seems to be no hurry: the outhouse will surely let them know in good time what it intends to be.

886-> Queens: Court Upholds Judge's Removal
New York State's highest court yesterday upheld the removal of a controversial State Supreme Court justice who prevented a detective from arresting a robbery suspect in her courtroom two years ago by allowing him to exit through a back entrance. The justice, Laura D. Blackburne, of State Supreme Court in Queens, had argued that she should not be removed for a single error of judgment, but a majority of the State Court of Appeals disagreed. The court's 5-2 decision upholds a ruling last November by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, which found that Justice Blackburne had "transcended the boundaries of acceptable judicial behavior."

887-> Neuter Your Bunny Day
OK, I’ve heard of some strange cooperative marketing campaigns—but this one takes the cake. Today, it turns out, is Neuter Your Bunny Day, sponsored by Panasonic Oxyride batteries. Stay with me here. Apparently, Panasonic is treating selected rabbit owners to free neutering in Manhattan, in “an educational effort to build awareness for the health benefits of neutering bunnies and the performance benefits of using Oxyride batteries. Panasonic is also donating $10,000 to the House Rabbit Society to support the cause. (This is the time of year, the HRS points out, when thousands of bunnies given as pets on Easter wind up abandoned.) So what’s the connection between Panasonic and rabbit neutering? Hint: Panasonic is NOT the company whose battery mascot is a rabbit that keeps going...and going...and going...

888-> When a Legal Superstar Changes Sides
Prosecutors on television are almost invariably stern and self-righteous — prissy counterpoints to flamboyant, slippery defense attorneys. “Shark,” a new drama on CBS, has it the other way around: the lead prosecutor in Los Angeles’s high-profile crime unit earned his predatory nickname by being ruthless, glib and sleazy. Naturally he is played by James Woods. There aren’t that many living actors who can tap into the joys of villainy. Kevin Spacey is one, and certainly James Spader has had great moments. Mr. Woods, however, has been doing it longer, in a career that spans “The Onion Field” and the voice of Hades in the animated movie “Hercules.” He is fearless, as demonstrated by his recent self-parodying cameo on “Entourage.” As Sebastian Stark, a high-priced trial lawyer who switches sides, Mr. Woods has found a television role that suits his gift and runs away with it. And that could be one reason Spike Lee chose to direct the pilot episode. Television provides actors and directors a chance to think small and dig deep, the opposite of what Hollywood movies demand. Jerry Bruckheimer moves nimbly from movie to television series, and increasingly so does Brian Grazer, a producer of “The Da Vinci Code,” who is also an executive producer of “Shark.” Another reason is that HBO blurred the line between movies and television with “The Sopranos” and “Oz,” forcing networks to follow suit with more ambitious dramas like “Lost,” “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” and “Kidnapped.” “Shark” is not nearly as showily innovative as many new series. It’s a conventional courtroom drama, more in the line of “Matlock” than “Boston Legal” or “Justice,” the Fox series about defense lawyers who work over the news media as much as the jury. (In that show both the prosecutors and the trial lawyers are grim and straitlaced.) “Shark” flips the legal drama formula, but stays loyal to its traditional form. And that, paradoxically, distinguishes it from the many shows that rely on serialized narratives, time-lapse photography and grainy flashbacks to stand out. The first episode opens with Stark delivering his closing argument on behalf of a celebrity, Gordie Brock (Tony Daly), charged with attempting to kill his wife. Stark sways the jury with eloquence, charm and the passionate sincerity that only a true cynic can muster. And he is insufferably smug after the verdict, taunting the district attorney, Jessica Devlin (Jeri Ryan), with her office’s latest defeat. His complacency — and he sings along to Bobby Darin’s “Mack the Knife” while driving — is shattered six days later when Gordie kills his wife for real. At the crime scene Stark finds his client in the kitchen, splattered with blood and unrepentant. “It’s my lawyer, boys, “ Gordie says to the police. “So why not save everybody some time and money and let me go right now.” Stark falls into a funk, refusing calls and new cases, and communicates only with his 16-year-old daughter, Julie (Danielle Panabaker), who lives with her mother but is worried about her depressed dad. The mayor offers him a spot in the district attorney’s office. “I eat prosecutors for breakfast,” Stark replies. “They’re my main source of fiber.” But seeking expiation, he takes the job and promptly applies all his tricks, arrogance and brio to serving the state. Jessica assigns him a dusty basement office and a handful of inexperienced young assistant D.A.’s., who view their new boss with alarmed disdain. Stark, in turn, treats them with the kind of contempt and ridicule Dr. Gregory House bestows on his young protégés on “House.” And of course Stark’s students have a lot to learn. “A prosecutor must conform his case to the demands of the legal system,” he says. “A defense attorney conforms the legal system to the demands of his case.” The No. 1 rule in what he calls his cutthroat manifesto is even simpler: “Trial is war, second place is death.” In full harangue Mr. Woods is a pleasure to watch: he wheedles, bullies and whiplashes his words better than almost anyone. But Stark’s egotism and passion for winning are undercut by fatherhood: he is a loving, self-absorbed dad who can’t remember birthdays or grades and is pained by his failures. In those rare family moments when Stark is still, silent and at a loss for words, he is even more eloquent. Created by Ian Biederman; Spike Lee, director; Brian Grazer, David Nevins and Mr. Biederman, executive producers; Robert Del Valle, producer; written by Mr. Biederman. Produced by Imagine Television, in association with 20th Century Fox Television. WITH: James Woods (Sebastian Stark), Danielle Panabaker (Julie Stark), Sophina Brown (Raina Troy), Sarah Carter (Madeleine Poe), Alexis Cruz (Martin Allende), Sam Page (Casey Woodland), Romy Rosemont (Margaret Pool) , Jeri Ryan (Jessica Devlin) and Tony Daly (Gordie Brock).

890-> Up Front
This issue of the Book Review is devoted entirely to fiction, beginning with the cover. The 22 books pictured there are the finest works of American fiction published in the last quarter-century, as determined by an we conducted over the past several months. The winning book and the four runners-up are featured , along with every title that received multiple votes. A complete list of the 124 authors, critics and editors who participated in the survey is . Each was asked to name the single best work published since 1980 — no second or third choices, no Top 10 lists; just one book. It was not an easy task, and we thank all of the judges. There is, of course, nothing official or definitive about the results, although A. O. Scott's thoughtful , "In Search of the Best," draws some intriguing conclusions — about what exactly constitutes a major literary work, about the current state of fiction and about generational differences among today's best writers. One fact worth noting is that the 22 finalists approach both ends of the 25-year spectrum: the oldest books were published in 1980, the most recent in 2004. This is another way of saying that over the past quarter-century serious fiction has been steadily written and read in this country. And there's no sign that will change any time soon, even if, as Rachel Donadio reports in her , publishers must adjust to a market geared increasingly to books that can be consumed in a quick gulp or slotted into the "news cycle." The issue is rounded out by 15 reviews of a range of books — some by established masters, others by newer authors. Together they form a snapshot of fiction as it is being written at this moment. Who knows? Twenty-five years from now, one or more may appear on a list like the one we present this week.

891-> Are Night Creams’ Benefits Just a Dream?
CATHERINE ROBERTO-KARAS is not sure if the cream she dabs onto her face every evening — Clarins Gentle Night Cream for sensitive skin — erases wrinkles or leaves her skin looking any younger. She just knows that she doesn’t want to go to sleep without it. “It’s totally psychological,” said Ms. Roberto-Karas, 39, who works in information technology in Manhattan. “I don’t see any direct effect the next day, but I still feel that maybe it does something. I use it because I was told by my older sister, who is a fanatic about trying to keep as youthful as possible, that I should.” Ms. Roberto-Karas is among the many women who choose to invert their wallets, and pay from a few up to hundreds of dollars to slather on night creams, rather than sleep naked-faced. Their enthusiasm for smoothing and softening skin, bleaching sun spots and minimizing wrinkles has helped drive the sales of some $437 million in facial anti-aging skin care products last year — a 45.7 percent jump from 2003 — and an additional $268 million on facial moisturizers, two categories that include night creams, according to the market research firm Mintel International Group. Among the deluge of new night creams are Nivea Visage Q10 Advanced Wrinkle Reducer Night Creme ($10.99) and Vichy LiftActiv Night Intensive Detoxifying Firming Care ($30), which are sold in drugstores; Avon Ageless Results Overnight Renewing Cream ($14.50), which can be ordered online; Kinerase Pro PlusTherapy Ultra Rich Night Repair ($149), sold by doctors; and Chanel Sublimage Essential Regenerating Cream ($350) and Lancôme Absolue Night Premium Bx Absolute Night Recovery Cream ($132), available in department stores. TESS, a new skin care line made specifically for teens that is sold at Sephora, even produces two vanilla-scented nighttime moisturizers ($20). Considering the benefits that many night creams claim to offer, it’s easy to see their appeal. They promise not only to moisturize skin during sleep, but to neutralize damaging free radicals, improve skin tone and texture, firm up sagginess, minimize wrinkles and lines, or wipe out mottling and sun spots. But dermatologists say that many night creams do not offer much value, especially given the substantial investment required for so many of them. Is glopping something onto your face really any better than allowing your skin to breathe while you rest? And how do you sift through the many products, when so little sound and unbiased information is available? Some women feel so overwhelmed by the myriad choices of ingredients and formulations that they abandon night creams altogether, choosing instead to sleep bare-faced. “I think it’s all a little bit too confusing,” said Kelly Ginsberg, 35, of Rye, N.Y., who doesn’t bother with a night cream. “I mean, there’s a million of them. I don’t have enough time to pay attention to what they all do, what they clear up.” Nighttime treatments may represent more of a marketing triumph than a skin care essential, though some products may be helpful, “You have a lot of very high-priced night creams that really don’t have any bang for a buck,” said Dr. Patricia K. Farris, a New Orleans dermatologist. “They’re basically just expensive, nicely packaged moisturizer.” For the most part, there’s no magic in the night that warrants using a special cream, according to Dr. Leslie Baumann, professor of dermatology at the University of Miami and author of “The Skin Type Solution” (Bantam, 2006). “You’ll hear companies say that your skin rejuvenates itself at night, or it does these special processes that it doesn’t do in the day, and there’s no proof of that at all,” she said. Yet some anti-aging ingredients, like retinol, are inactivated by the sun, so it makes good sense to wear them while you sleep, said Dr. Baumann, who has served on the advisory boards or been a paid consultant to many companies, including Avon, Aveeno and Neutrogena. Conversely, there’s little point in applying a sunscreen-laden product in the evening, when a visit from Mr. Sandman is the closest you’ll get to a beach. But according to dermatologists, there can still be benefits to moisturizing and treating the skin at night. Many night creams contain compounds known to improve the skin’s appearance in measurable ways. Peptides — found in Rodan and Fields Anti-Age P.M. Cream ($90) — are known to rev up the production of collagen, boosting firmness and smoothing wrinkles. Vitamin C — contained in Neutrogena Healthy Skin Visibly Even Night Concentrate ($11.75) — has been identified as an essential factor needed by the skin to make collagen. By halting damage caused by the sun, antioxidants like idebenone, vitamin E, coenzyme Q and green tea may help prevent new wrinkles from forming, Dr. Baumann said. Ingredients like ceramides, fatty acids and cholesterol help trap in moisture and repair the skin’s protective barrier, while salicylic acid, feverfew, chamomile and aloe vera can help soothe an irritated or inflamed complexion, she said. Hydroquinone (which the Food and Drug Administration has said may not be safe in over-the-counter products), kojic acid and the extracts of cucumber, licorice or mulberry alleviate blotching and spotting, as does a new glucosamine compound in Olay Definity Intense Hydrating Cream ($27.99), a formula many women use at night because it is creamy. Retinol, found in L’Oréal’s Advanced RevitaLift Night Cream ($16.59) and several other products, is perhaps the most highly regarded ingredient available without a prescription. “It’s the only thing that treats wrinkles you already have,” Dr. Baumann said. To work, a cream must contain active ingredients in a sufficient concentration. Ingredients must also penetrate the skin and stay there long enough to have an effect. “It’s sort of like if you need a blood transfusion and I’m just going to lay the blood across the top of your skin and say, ‘Good luck, let’s hope it gets where it needs to go,’ ” said Dr. Sandra Read, a Washington dermatologist. “It’s not going to do any good.” Inexpensive brands backed by large companies, like Neutrogena, L’Oréal, Revlon, Olay, Dove, Pond’s and Aveeno, often have the resources to perform scientific studies to identify an effective formula and prove that it works, Dr. Baumann said. “The cheaper products are better than the expensive ones when it comes down to it, because they have better research and better ingredients,” she said. But devotees like Staci Alfano, 35, of Jersey City, say that a night cream’s price tag is part of its appeal. “It almost feels like the more money you pay for it, the more you feel like it’s working,” she said. Indeed, smothering one’s face in Chanel’s softly-scented Sublimage cream is not unlike the luxury of slipping one’s toes into a new pair of Manolo Blahniks — and the $350 cost can be hundreds less than the shoe price. Wearing any night cream requires patience —“Eight weeks is not an unreasonable amount of time to expect to see an improvement,” Dr. Read said — but women tend to lose interest quickly. “I find that I switch on and off a lot, because there’s always something new or better,” Ms. Alfano said. For many women, sleeping bare-faced is perfectly acceptable, Dr. Baumann said. “A lot of patients say, ‘I just feel terrible, because all I’ve done my whole life is use Dove soap and sunscreen,’ ” she said. “I smile because they’ve actually done a lot more for their skin than somebody buying a $300 night cream and not wearing sunscreen every day.”

A federal judge sentenced a former city clerk in Chicago to two years in prison for taking thousands of dollars in bribes over six years. The former clerk, James J. Laski, 52, was the highest-ranking official to be charged in a federal investigation into corruption in the city's disbanded truck contracting program. Mr. Laski pleaded guilty in March and admitted to taking $48,000 in bribes from two friends in exchange for city trucking work. A total of 44 people have been charged and 37 convicted in the investigation.

893-> The Violinist Arabella Steinbacher Makes Her Debut at Town Hall
Young musicians making their New York debuts have the problem of drawing an audience, often against heavy competition, before they have established a reputation, let alone marketability. One solution is to present their concerts in the late spring, when the formal season has wound down, and summer festivals haven't started. Another is to get on a series that has a following of its own. Arabella Steinbacher, a 25-year-old German violinist, did both on Sunday afternoon when she performed in the Free for All series of free concerts at Town Hall. It was the perfect symbiotic fit. Having won the Joachim International Violin Competition in 2000 and toured Europe and Japan, Ms. Steinbacher was a safe bet for Free for All, which doesn't typically present debuts. And since a free concert will invariably draw listeners, the series filled Ms. Steinbacher's need to play for people. It worked out for the audience too. Ms. Steinbacher played a program sufficiently varied to show what she could do in several styles, old and new, and among her assets are a finely polished technique and a beautifully varied palette of timbres. She began with Grieg's Sonata No. 3 in C minor (Op. 45), playing its opening movement with a dark, viola-like tone and drama in her phrasing. In the final two movements she demonstrated both the brighter side of her tone and a livelier technique, returning to the textured, throaty sound of the first movement only in the final pages. Her reading of the Schnittke Sonata No. 1 showed that the deeper side of her tone in the Grieg was by no means as deep as she goes. The sonata, composed in 1963, is desolate, tense and often painfully introspective, couched in an angular language that captures and magnifies its emotional sweep. In his later years Schnittke would undercut his angularity with a quirky humor, but here he presents it straight, and Ms. Steinbacher captured its passions perfectly. After the intermission Ms. Steinbacher turned to works that showed another side of her interpretive personality. She and her pianist, Robert Kulek, balanced lyricism and fire in an inventively phrased account of Brahms's D minor Sonata (Op. 108). And those same elements, rebalanced to emphasize the fire, drove the reading of Ravel's "Tzigane," with which they closed the concert.

David Weeks, a designer who opened his Brooklyn studio in 1996, said his new Bound Rocker, below, is the final incarnation of an evolving project: it began as a modular couch with woven seats, and later he reworked it as a taller freestanding chair. He eventually arrived at the current version, he said, which works better because it is more comfortable and has a slightly more familiar shape. The rocker is composed of nickel-plated steel rod and leather belting, with a low profile resembling that of a beach chair, allowing the user to stretch out his legs while seated. It can be ordered for $3,300 from davidweeksstudio.com or (718) 596-7945. STEPHEN TREFFINGER

899-> Back Into the Fray
BROADWAY thrives on revivals, and many of them truly do come to life again, while some others flail about briefly and then slide back into the past. It’s always a risky business. This year, the restaurant scene — an even riskier business — is turning to revivals, too. Chefs who have been on the sidelines for months or even years, are trying to return to the limelight. At the same time, high-profile locations are being dusted off and recycled, but with new chefs and fresh ideas. Along with its revivals, the restaurant world will try some surprising twists, as established names branch out into unfamiliar roles. Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, suddenly becomes a restaurateur. Keith McNally, known mostly for his evocative French brasseries like Balthazar and Pastis, goes Italian. Pastry chefs, including Sam Mason, Pichet Ong and Jehangir Mehta, will be doing savories as well as sweets. And, as on Broadway, there will be British imports. Returning to the New York spotlight will be Michael Lomonaco, who was getting his eyeglasses repaired instead of preparing his kitchen for the day’s business on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. So the executive chef of Windows on the World, atop the World Trade Center, was not there when it was destroyed. Since then he has been biding his time, working as a consultant, cooking at Guastavino’s, and appearing on television. He’ll be running Porter House New York, the American grill and steakhouse that will open by the end of the month on the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. And this will be his big break: for the first time in his career, the 51-year-old will be a partner, not simply a chef. The restaurant replaces Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s V Steakhouse in a setting by Jeffrey Beers that will be far less fanciful than the previous one — more steakhouse-corporate, with lots of polished wood and no red velvet or gilded trees. Mr. Lomonaco has even hired a few of the cooks who worked with him at Windows on the World. Also at Time Warner will be an uptown version of Marc Murphy’s Landmarc in TriBeCa. It’s going to be on the third floor, in the space that Charlie Trotter, the influential Chicago restaurateur, was supposed to take over but rejected. Akhtar Nawab, promoted by Tom Colicchio at Craftbar — only to change his mind when the food became too ambitious — will also return to the stove. His place, Allen & Delancey (the name refers to its downtown location), will showcase Mr. Nawab’s specialty, Mediterranean cooking, a cuisine that shows no sign of fading. Josh DeChellis, who made a fast exit from Jovia earlier this year, will be the chef at Kobe Club, Jeffrey Chodorow’s reprise for the location that had been Mix in New York. Another chef coming in from the cold is Chris Russell, who hobnobbed with boldface names at Moomba, and then went on to open TanDa and Sage, before dropping out of sight. Now he’ll be flipping burgers — but that’s not a put-down because Brgr, his new place in Chelsea, is meant to be all about first-rate ingredients backed up by an open kitchen design from David Rockwell. “I was involved with celebrity-driven fine dining for 10 to 15 years, and realized I needed a break,” Mr. Russell said. “Hamburgers are the ultimate pleasure food. I hope to take them in a new direction.” That glorification of the burger was echoed by Jonathan Morr, who gave New York bowls of Asian noodles at communal tables at Republic in Union Square, and is now developing an inventive burger spot a few blocks from there. The inspiration for Republic was Alan Yau, the creator of England’s Wagamama noodle chain. This season, amid considerable fanfare, Mr. Yau is coming to New York from London. But not with mere noodle bowls. He is now best known in London for his grandly chic Chinese places, Hakkasan and Yauatcha, each of which has a Michelin star. Though he is keeping mum about the details of Park Chinois in the redone Gramercy Park Hotel, expect dazzling design and creative food. Perhaps the hottest ticket from London will be Gordon Ramsay, who will introduce New York to his brand of high-end, richly French-accented cooking in a small, elegant, expensive restaurant in the London NYC hotel, formerly the Rihga Royal. The cheap seats will be in his adjacent cafe, the London Bar. Now that hotel dining has left its reputation for mediocrity far behind, even Kokachin in the Omni Berkshire Place hotel in Midtown is being given another chance with Fireside. Sam DeMarco, formerly of First in the East Village, is the chef. As for Keith McNally, he’ll be opening Morandi, an Italian spot in Greenwich Village with Jody Williams in the kitchen. His former wife, Lynn Wagenknecht, will be nearby, opening Cafe Cluny. Graydon Carter, the Vanity Fair editor, is recycling Ye Waverly Inn as the Waverly Inn, with Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode. Fortunately for celebrity watchers, these places are within walking distance of each other, and they are likely to give Greenwich Village a newfound panache. Instead of another onslaught of gigantic Asian restaurants this year, look for a more delicate parade: fanciful Asian-style dessert places. Kyotofu, a Japanese dessert chain, will open a cafe and bakery serving fusion desserts like green tea soybean cookies dipped in chocolate on Ninth Avenue in Midtown. And chefs like Pichet Ong, who created the tapioca-enriched and yuzu-seasoned finales at Spice Market; Jehangir Mehta, who dotes on cardamom to season his sweets and blends of tea; and Sam Mason, who did not shy away from using miso and rice vinegar in his desserts at WD-50, are all opening dessert cafes where they will also try to tempt the public with something savory to nibble beforehand — with a drink. And it’s a good thing, too. If all these ambitious plans turn into long-running successes, in a city that some have been warning for years is oversaturated with places to eat, they’ll certainly deserve that toast.

900-> Onion Domes and Cellphones in Uzhgorod
TUCKED against the rolling foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, Uzhgorod is Ukraine's gateway to the rest of Europe. The city's western edge abuts the frontier with Slovakia, while the border with Hungary lies just 12 miles to the south. It is a place where modern and old, pastoral and cosmopolitan overlap with little chafing. Svelte young women in miniskirts, with cellphones, strut down tree-lined cobblestone streets past pastel-plastered houses from Hapsburg times. Elderly men and women sit in their courtyards cleaning vegetables picked from their gardens as chickens bob around their feet. BMW's race past horses pulling families on wooden carts. At the central marketplace, farmers sell produce and meats alongside vendors offering fresh breads, wild mushrooms and household miscellany. Some ring up customers on calculators, others still use abacuses. Thanks to its location, travelers have long trickled through Uzhgorod, a town of 130,000. But since new regulations for entry into Ukraine were enacted this past summer -- permitting American, Canadian, Japanese and European Union citizens, among others, to visit for 90 days without a visa -- Uzhgorod has experienced an influx of foreigners. Uzhgorod's tour agencies, such as Sodis Karpathi, (38-031) 261 2323, www.sodis.com.ua, which provides English-speaking guides for 40 hryvnia an hour, or about $8, at 5.20 Ukraine hryvnia to $1, are already "busier than ever," according to Natalia Kolyavitska, Sodis Karpathi's director. Cafes are springing up all around the city's Old Quarter -- a charming pedestrian-only zone of boutiques and churches. The best views of the vibrant street life are from the patio of Tortilla Cafe, on the corner of Corzo and Voloshina Streets (no phone), where espressos cost 2 hryvnia. Restaurant Delfin, 3 Kyivskaya Naberezhnaya, (38-031) 261 4963, offers a broad selection of regional specialties including borscht, grilled pork and more esoteric dishes like "herring under fur coat" for 15 to 50 hryvnia. From its roof, diners can watch residents fish and swim in the placid Uzh River, which flows through the heart of town. A new generation of tourist accommodations is opening its doors around central Uzhgorod. At the friendly, clean Hotel Izumrud, 10 Malokamyana Boulevard, (38-031) 261 3858, doubles cost 185 to 225 hryvnia. At the small four-star Old Continent Hotel, 4 Shandor Petefa Square, (38-031) 266 9366, doubles with handmade furniture and minibars are 450 to 580 hryvnia a night. Among the city's main attractions is the open-air Museum of Folk Architecture and Life, 33A Kapitulna Street, (38-031) 223-6352, a 10-minute walk from the center of town; 3 hryvnia. It features more than 30 traditional structures plucked from villages across Transcarpathia -- the Ukranian province of which Uzhgorod is the capital. The museum's centerpiece is 16th-century St. Michael's Church, with a roof and onion-domed steeple covered in wooden shingles. Next door is Uzhgorod Castle, an imposing fortress that housed the regents of the Hapsburgs. Much of it now contains exhibits about Uzhgorod's history and Carpathian wildlife. Closed Tuesday; 4 hryvnia. Uzhgorod's real draw, however, isn't its museums, but the warmth of its citizens. Easily approachable, they happily engage in spontaneous conversation with visitors. "We want to meet new people and share ideas," said Marija Vovk, a 24-year-old who works for the People's Union -- the political party behind Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution. "We're ready for the world to come to Uzhgorod."

901-> OPENERS: SUITS; REAL COOL
It isn't often that business leaders are called "cool" by a rock star. But Bono gave that assessment to two local figures in Grand Rapids, Mich., earlier this month. One was David Van Andel, the son of Amway's co-founder, Jay Van Andel. During his speech at the Economic Club of Grand Rapids, Bono mentioned meeting "David -- is it Van Andel? That's a great name; what a really cool thing," the U2 front man said. Bono laid the same label on Ralph W. Hauenstein, 94, former chairman of the Werner Lehara Corporation, and, like Mr. Van Andel, a well-known philanthropist. Mr. Hauenstein, who was honored by the Economic Club, served in Army intelligence under Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and was one of the first Americans to visit both liberated Paris and Nazi concentration camps. Speaking of Mr. Hauenstein's exploits, Bono declared, "What a cool cat!" Mr. Hauenstein, for his part, said, "I'm probably here because the Economic Club was looking for a connection between U2, the band, and U2, the plane, back in my intelligence days." MICHELINE MAYNARD

902-> Rent-Stabilized or Not?
 “Probably not,” said David Ng, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer. “Just because a form lease says the apartment is rent-stabilized doesn’t make it rent-stabilized.” He explained that whether an apartment is rent-stabilized is a matter of law, not one of agreement — intentional or unintentional — between the parties. “The courts have consistently held that when the regulated status of the tenancy is based upon an agreement by the parties, the agreement is unenforceable,” he said. “And they have said the same thing whether the agreement says the tenancy is stabilized as well as when it says it’s nonstabilized.” Mr. Ng said there are two possibilities for what happened here. One is that the landlord simply made a mistake by sending out a stabilized lease form. But a mistake won’t make a nonstabilized apartment stabilized. The other possibility is that the landlord discovered that the letter writer’s apartment is indeed rent-stabilized — perhaps because of rulings by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal in cases brought by other tenants. “The letter writer should send a Freedom of Information Act request to D.H.C.R. to get the rent history for the apartment to determine whether it is officially considered stabilized or not,” Mr. Ng said. The request can be made online at www.dhcr.state.ny.us/index.htm or by calling the Rent InfoLine at (718) 739-6400.

903-> OPENERS: SUITS; BIT OF BRODY
The American Society of Magazine Editors dubbed its National Magazine Awards presentation last week, held at the Rose Theater at Lincoln Center in Manhattan, "Oscar night" for its industry. Some participants got into the Hollywood spirit of things, inspired, no doubt, by the presence of the actress Meg Ryan, one of four "guest emcees." Jonathan Dorn, editor in chief of Backpacker, planted one on the cheek of Mark Whitaker, the Newsweek editor, who presented him an award. Referring to Adrien Brody's embrace of Halle Berry at the 2003 Academy Awards, Mr. Dorn said: "People tell me if you look at the right profile, I've got a little Adrien Brody going on. I have to say I wish it was Meg Ryan." Presenting the most prestigious award of the evening -- general excellence for a magazine with a circulation of more than two million -- to his arch-rival, Time magazine's managing editor, Jim Kelly, Mr. Whitaker said, "You don't have to kiss me, but I'll gladly shake your hand." The two did neither, hugging instead. JANE L. LEVERE

904-> Lyrics Celebrating Bank Merger Impress Only Copyright Lawyer
A video of two Bank of America employees singing a version of U2’s “One” to commemorate their company’s acquisition of MBNA recently made the rounds of the blogs, prompting amusement and some ridicule from online viewers. But the intended comic effect of their performance and the retooled lyrics (“One spirit, we get to share it/Leading us all to higher standards”) seemed lost on lawyers on the lookout for copyright violations. On Tuesday, a lawyer for the Universal Music Publishing Group, a catalog owner and administrator, posted the text of a cease-and-desist letter in the comments section of Stereogum.com, a Web site carrying the video. It contended that Bank of America had violated Universal’s copyright of the U2 song. The two employees featured in the video were the guitarist, Jim Debois, a consumer market executive for Manhattan, and the singer, Ethan Chandler, a Manhattan banking center manager, who provoked much of the ridicule with his earnest interpretation and also for straying a bit far from U2’s lyrics with lines like “Integration has never had us feeling so good/and we’ll make lots of money.” Mr. Chandler, who has independently released an album and is working on another, said he was asked to write and perform the song for an August meeting of credit card division executives at MBNA headquarters in Wilmington, Del. He said he was surprised to learn about the cease-and-desist letter, stressing that his performance was meant for an internal audience. “There was an approved list of songs to use,” he said, “and as far I knew, that was an approved song.” Universal said on Stereogum that it had sent the letter by fax and registered mail to Bank of America last Monday. On Friday, a bank spokeswoman, Betsy Weinberger, said the legal department had not yet received it. The letter was signed by Raul R. Gonzalez, a lawyer for Universal Music. Reached at his office, Mr. Gonzalez said, “No comment” and hung up. Online commentators accustomed to viral marketing said they suspected that the video was the latest corporate attempt to co-opt Internet video for promotional purposes. But Ms. Weinberger said it was “absolutely not” leaked by Bank of America as a marketing ploy. Mr. Chandler also denied any involvement in leaking the video, although he admitted that, despite the cutting online criticism, the incident had an upside. “A lot of people thought it was fake, but I really do sing,” he said. “I’ve been doing this a long time.” MARIA ASPAN

905-> The Kid With All the News About the TV News
TOWSON, Md. — When people in the television news business want to find out what’s going on in their industry, they turn to a blog called TVNewser. But while the executives obsessively checking TVNewser are mostly high powered and highly paid, the person who creates it is not: he is Brian Stelter, a baby-faced 21-year-old at Towson University here, a few miles north of Baltimore. “I’ve heard people joke that when TVNewser is dormant, the kid had a final or a big family dinner that he couldn’t get out of,” said Brian Williams, the NBC news anchor and a TVNewser devotee. “People from entry level to high and mighty check in on it.” When his postings dropped off last month after his girlfriend dumped him, Mr. Stelter found himself fielding complaints from powerful network executives about when he was going to get over his romantic travails and get back on track. “I was dealing with drama,” he said. Mr. Stelter’s blog (tvnewser.com), a seven-day-a-week, almost 24-hour-a-day newsfeed of gossip, anonymous tips, newspaper article links and program ratings, has become a virtual bulletin board for the industry. It is read religiously by network presidents, media executives, producers and publicists, not for any stinging commentary from Mr. Stelter, whose style is usually described as earnest, but because it provides a quick snapshot of the industry on any given day. Habitués include Mr. Williams and Jonathan Klein, the president of CNN’s domestic operations, who long ago offered up his cellphone number to Mr. Stelter. “The whole industry pays attention to his blog,” said Jeffrey W. Schneider, a senior vice president of ABC News. “It would not surprise me if I refreshed my browser 30 to 40 times a day.” In April Mr. Stelter attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner as a guest of MSNBC. “He was quite a celebrity,” said Jeremy Gaines, a spokesman for MSNBC. “Literally two tables over was George Clooney, and at our table was TVNewser, and people were waiting in line to see him.” Perhaps this is what the techno-geeks had in mind when they invented the Internet — a device to squash not only time and space, but also social class and professional hierarchies, putting an unprepossessing Maryland college student with several term papers due in a position to command the attention and grudging respect of some of society’s most famous and powerful personalities. Or maybe it just worked out that way. Mr. Stelter chronicles the gossipy New York-Hollywood television industry from the tiny, leafy campus at Towson, where he is a senior majoring in mass communication (he has a 3.5 grade-point average) and the editor of the student newspaper. He started the blog in 2004 on a whim during winter break, and not long after he was hired by a journalism Web site to keep it going. These days, by 9 a.m. he is awake and blogging, sometimes in class, courtesy of a campuswide Wi-Fi connection, as well as from his apartment, the student union and his cluttered desk in a corner of the newspaper office. Mr. Stelter has earned the grudging trust of many of his readers, who e-mail him hundreds of tips a day that often translate into scoops, like the early warning that Peter Jennings, the former ABC News anchor, was near death or, more recently, the discovery of a Photoshopped publicity shot of Katie Couric, the “CBS Evening News” anchor, that made her appear a dress size or two smaller. How much does television care about Mr. Stelter’s little blog? “The biggest TV executives, the men and women who run the top networks, look at this kid’s Web site all the time,” said Joe Scarborough, the host of the talk show “Scarborough Country” on MSNBC. “And the genius of it is that everybody thinks they own him. Everybody says: ‘Oh, I’ve got a great relationship with Brian. Let me leak it to him.’ ” Mr. Klein, certainly one of the most powerful figures in the business, telephoned Mr. Stelter one Sunday during Hurricane Dennis in the summer of 2005 to make sure he was tuned in to a report by Rick Sanchez. “He was saying: ‘Are you watching this? Isn’t this great?’ ” Mr. Stelter said. (He promptly blogged about it, writing, “CNN correspondent Rick Sanchez may become the star of this storm.”) One evening in March 2005 Mr. Klein interrupted a bedtime-story session with his children to give a quote to Mr. Stelter. But the two have also had the occasional clash. After Mr. Klein admonished employees during an editorial meeting last year for leaking stories — presumably to Mr. Stelter — notes of the meeting were promptly leaked to TVNewser. The network publicists generally know his class schedule — afternoons on Tuesdays and Thursdays — and barrage him with material, which they often expect him to post within minutes. While recording a radio segment for one of his classes — Mass Communication 381 — he turned his cellphone off for 15 minutes, then turned it back on to find one nagging voice mail message from an ABC publicist and another from CNN. Mr. Stelter originally started the blog under the name Cablenewser. He concealed his identity so that his growing audience would take him seriously. “People thought I was a bald, disgruntled 40-something executive,” he said. “I think I’m balding, but that’s it.” In July 2004 he was hired by Mediabistro.com, a journalism Web site that runs a number of popular blogs. (Mr. Stelter declined to disclose his salary, but he has said before that it is more than enough to cover his college expenses.) Since then his audience has expanded substantially — the site had 821,000 page views in October 2006, up from 150,000 in July 2004. In September, thanks to Ms. Couric’s premiere at CBS, TVNewser had record traffic of 1.2 million page views. Growing up in Damascus, Md., Mr. Stelter watched the news addictively. He recalls watching Mr. Williams, who was then at MSNBC, reporting on the crash of T.W.A. Flight 800, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the revelation that President Bill Clinton was entangled with Monica Lewinsky. Meanwhile, Mr. Stelter practiced his “newscaster voice” and harbored anchor-size ambitions of his own. “I always thought I would be the person who sat in the chair for 12 hours,” Mr. Stelter said. “Then I realized there are only three people who do that job.” He finally got to meet Mr. Williams last year when he came to New York to attend a memorial service for Mr. Jennings. Mr. Williams invited him to sit in on his broadcast’s 2:30 p.m. editorial meeting, and the two talked privately for a half-hour. “I’ve always regarded him as the De Niro character in ‘The King of Comedy,’ ” Mr. Williams said, invoking the 1983 film whose lead character, Rupert Pupkin, is a talentless comic who stalks his talk-show idol. “He has kind of a Rupert Pupkinesque double life.” In the industry Mr. Stelter is generally thought of as a reliable reporter, despite his youth and inexperience. “He seems to be a trustworthy guy, a trustworthy source of information,” said Jeff Greenfield, a CNN commentator. “And the fact that he can barely vote and drink shouldn’t really bother anybody.” Mr. Stelter’s relationship with the reporters who cover the industry is more strained. The Television Critics Association, an industry group, will not accept him as a member because he is a blogger. And there are some who feel his influence is out of proportion. “He kind of dominates the conversation in this business, just because he posts everything,” said Michael Learmonth, a reporter for Variety, a trade publication. But before long Mr. Stelter may shed his label as boy blogger. Next spring he graduates from Towson, and his contract with Mediabistro, where he is considered a full-time employee, ends in May. While he said he hasn’t received any firm job offers in the industry, several television executives have urged him to call when he starts job hunting. In the meantime, Mr. Stelter’s blogging schedule may hit some snags in the coming months. For one thing, he has a new girlfriend. And a planned trip to China in January is causing some distress. “I’m really worried about how I’m going to find an Internet connection,” he said. But taking time off is unthinkable. “My audience won’t put up with that,” Mr. Stelter said. “TV news is always on.”

906-> Creating a Self-Contained World
Bedford Village, N.Y. WITH Dennis Wedlick as architect — a man known for his high-peaked roofs, columns and shingled walls — it seemed a slam-dunk makeover: the rundown red ranch house on an exquisite 4.6-acre plot here, would become history, one of this well-to-do Westchester hamlet’s many tear-downs. But Mr. Wedlick, as he jumped out of his sedan, clearly had surprises in mind — and the first surprise was that he had almost no interest in changing the ranch house. Instead, he and his team were far more intrigued by the outbuildings, and by the land. The property, for sale at $949,000, is next to a horse farm and runs all the way back to the Mianus River, with a pond in between. It would be transformed, at least on a sketch pad, into an energy-producing compound, with only one new building, and that one ... but the plans were to come later. For now, Mr. Wedlick and two other architects from his Manhattan firm just wanted to walk the land. With Mr. Wedlick in the lead, they spread out around the pond, photographing the two existing outbuildings: one, a large open-air pavilion with a stone fireplace on the north side of the house; the other, a little guest cottage on the far side of the pond, with what looked like the pipes for a bathroom. They had already printed out a large aerial map of the house and its trapezoid-shaped acreage from Google Earth, and Mr. Wedlick occasionally referred to it as he paced the land. Like a movie director looking for the perfect shot, he cupped his hand over his eye, checking sightlines and views. Standing there with the map, the three discussed walkways and landscaping: a woodland path snaking its way along the western border, a glade full of verdant ferns and overhanging maples; perhaps a bridge over the marshes leading to the riverbank. “In a way, it could be like an English landscape,” Mr. Wedlick said, “in a line from the center of the house, bisecting the pool and the meadow behind it, heading over the marshes and to the river. Like a true English landscape, it needs a focal point — would that be the river?” Nine days later, when the team met again at Mr. Wedlick’s downtown office, the conference table was covered with green, blue and brown renderings: various close-ups from the Google map superimposed with fluid sketches of the transformed outbuildings — plus a new one envisioned directly across from the pavilion. The site had become a state-of-the-art landscape. Some of the proposed changes, like the geothermal heater in the pond, were not obvious, but some were, like the solar panels on the roof of the existing guesthouse, with wind turbines next to it. If built, the complex could be self-supporting. “Driving away just reinforced everything we said on our walk-around,” said Mr. Wedlick, who was chosen to design a Life magazine dream house in 1995 and is the author, with Philip Langdon, of “Good House Hunting,” published last year by Collins Design. “The potential of the land — there was no doubt it had all the right elements — the goal was to make it exciting. Just decorating these pieces, dolling them up, was not enough.” He paused. “We shifted our focus to create a place,’’ he added, “not just any place but a sustainable place, so the owner could be self-sufficient. You grow your own food, you produce your own energy, you stroll from building to building. It should be a true compound — as one team member said, ‘We’re putting the ranch back in the ranch house.’ ” Looking at the compound as a whole, the team decided to do away with the existing swimming pool next to the house and surrounded by a big wooden deck. Roughly across from the pavilion, they decided to create “another midcentury structure,” Mr. Wedlick said, “a greenhouse.” The new greenhouse would finish off what would become a geometric four-pointed landscape — the house, the new greenhouse, the pavilion and the pond. “The four points make a green courtyard, the hub of the property, which is carefully maintained,” Mr. Wedlick said. Two underwater cisterns were designed to irrigate the lawn. “The rest of the land is left wild, although we have added a simple dock to the pond, which would become the near focal point,” Mr. Wedlick said. “We have taken the trapezoidal shape and as we said we would do, created a forced perspective, an English perspective — not too modern, but it would make the property seem even bigger than it is.” And the ranch house — surely they would want to do something? “The only thing we imagine for the main house is to put on a wood-shingled roof, to quickly dress it up and to give it a classic look,” Mr. Wedlick said. On the back of the house — the side toward the pond and away from the busy road — they would put down a broad fieldstone terrace. There would be an organic garden in front of the greenhouse and a compost field behind it. A new boardwalk would be built through the ferns — not only inexpensive but gentle on the fragile woodland. “Light on the land,” as Mr. Wedlick phrased it. The pavilion would become the summer quarters. “You could abandon the house in the summer and live there — it will have a bathroom,” Mr. Wedlick said. “There’s already a fireplace there, and we could install screens and shutters.” In their plans, the team put a small saltwater swimming pool in front. A saltwater pool? “Yes, there’s less need for chemicals,” said George Jaramillo, the architect who prepared the renderings. “It’s far better for your health than chlorine.” The compound would be “a miniature energy farm,” Mr. Wedlick said. If the scheme were carried out, the team estimated that energy use would be cut in half. And if the owners lived in the summer pavilion three months of the year, they might even be able to sell some excess power. “And there’s all kind of tax credits,” said Patrick Fitzgerald, another member of the architectural team. “The solar panels alone get you 25 percent credit on their installation cost.” Two wind turbines, on top of 60-foot towers west of the wetland walkway, would not be intrusive, the team said in chorus. “From a distance, they will be charming and romantic,” Mr. Wedlick said, responding to the reporter’s raised eyebrow. “After all, they won’t be too close to you.”

907-> No More Cheap Shrimp Cocktail
LAS VEGAS — They are coming to blow up a lonely outpost of low-cost Las Vegas. Before daybreak on May 9, an explosives team plans to demolish the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, a recently closed budget oasis on the Strip with a giant clown face on its facade and signs advertising $1.99 shrimp cocktails. It is giving way to this city's latest incarnation: luxury. The Strip has become a considerably more expensive place to spend the night — roughly $125 on average last year, a 23 percent increase in just two years — and it is expected to get more so. At least four new luxury hotel projects are under way that will replace old standbys, like the Boardwalk, and add more than 10,000 rooms. The hotels are catering to an influx of convention-going business travelers and deeper-pocketed visitors patronizing high-end restaurants, shops and shows. The hotels here are heralding flat-panel televisions and fancy shower soaps as they once did a cheap place to sleep off a night in the casino — whose tables and slots subsidized the rooms. Loud imposing smoke-filled casinos still anchor this town, and $50 rates are still typical at hotels downtown, away from the action. But the Strip, the boulevard of Las Vegas dreams, is no longer home to the low-cost weekend getaway. Las Vegas "was known as the capital of cheap rooms and cheap food," said Alan Feldman, a spokesman for MGM Mirage, the giant hotel and casino company developing the Boardwalk site. "It was known as the capital of the cheap vacation — and you got what you paid for. We used to give coupon books for free drinks and two-for-one buffet. Now we have 300-thread-count sheets and turn-down service." The trends conform to Las Vegas's effort to redefine itself as a more diversified destination, offering superb but costly restaurants ($88 for the 12-ounce grilled Kobe rib-eye steak at Tao at the Venetian) and shows like Cirque du Soleil's "O" ($93.50 to $150 a seat). The new features have helped keep Las Vegas growing even as many new casinos — from small card houses to Indian casinos — are springing up around the country and providing local outlets for gamblers. Not everyone is happy about the face-lift. "It'll probably price us out of the market," said Dr. Bill Waugh, 61, an eye surgeon from Olympia, Wash., visiting Las Vegas with his wife, Patti. They were staying at the Flamingo, an older hotel on the Strip, for $91, the lowest nightly rate he could find. Two years ago, he said, he found a room at the Stardust for $35. "When the cheapest room is $250," he said, "it's time to do something else." Mr. Feldman and others said budget travelers were still coming to Las Vegas, but they might be coming less frequently and represented a smaller share of a steadily growing tourist base. In 2005, 38.6 million people visited, up from 37.4 million the year before and 29 million in 1995, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Many of the new visitors were business travelers, who drive up hotel prices by attending weekday conventions and who can put their room charges on their expense account. In 2005, 6.2 million visitors identified themselves as convention delegates, up from 5.7 million in 2004, the visitors authority said. Here, they give credit for the change to the opening in 1990 of the Sands Expo and Convention Center, which drew business travelers, and to the 1989 opening of the Mirage, the first modern luxury hotel here and the brainchild of the developer Stephen A. Wynn. On April 28, Mr. Wynn and his wife, Elaine, broke ground on their latest project, the Wynn Encore, a 2,000-room hotel that will have, among other amenities, a retractable glass roof on the pool. It is meant as the sister to the Wynn Las Vegas, where room rates are typically $300 or more. Ms. Wynn says she is sympathetic to the tourist with a limited budget. "Nobody is intending for this to be exclusive," she said of the Wynn Encore. People "are free to come in and enjoy the environment" at the Encore, she said. "They can visit the gardens, and shop. They can buy a T-shirt for $28 that is a wonderful souvenir." But actually staying the night, well, that may be another matter. "The budget customer is eventually going to get squeezed out" of the Strip, said Jane Pedreira, a casino industry analyst with Lehman Brothers. The rooms have to keep up with demand from wealthier visitors, international guests and business travelers, she said. Everywhere, there are signs of the transition and of a collision between upscale and underbelly, between luxury and the lewd. Airport visitors are greeted upon arrival with neon billboards boasting of Wolfgang Puck and the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art while others depict half-naked male exotic dancers from Chippendales and Thunder From Down Under. Developments include Project CityCenter, a $7 billion hotel, casino and condo complex that is to replace the Boardwalk; Echelon Place, a $4 billion hotel, casino and convention center on the land now occupied by the Stardust; and the Palazzo, an upscale hotel and retail center (including a Barneys New York) under construction where the Tam O'Shanter, a budget motel, once sat. The cost of staying on the Strip is still less than a night's lodging in some big cities, and considerably cheaper rooms are available for tourists willing to travel 10 minutes to the less dazzling downtown. But the Strip is a different matter. In 2005, the average cost of a night's stay at one of the Strip's hotel-casinos was $125.38, up from $113.02 in 2004 and $96.92 in 2000, according to the state of Nevada. The prices are rising throughout the area, too, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. In 2005, the average nightly rate was $103 for 294 hotels and motels throughout Las Vegas, up from $90 in 2004. "We're not losing track of the middle market," said Rob Stillwell, spokesman for Boyd Gaming, a conglomerate that owns the Stardust. But budget travelers "may not stay on the Strip," he said. "They may have to stay a little bit north, or a little bit south." The Stardust is scheduled to close at year's end and be razed in the spring of 2007. In its place will be Echelon Place, including a 3,300-room hotel, and three boutique hotels: the 400-room Shangri-La, the 600-room Delano and the 1,000-room Mondrian — meaningful names to seekers of four-star accommodations. There will also be a million square feet of meeting and exhibition space, 350,000 square feet of shopping, and, yes, a casino. The Stardust was built in 1958, but its west tower, with 1,360 rooms, was built in 1991 and its accommodations seem clean, if nondescript. But renovation would not be enough, Mr. Stillwell said, noting that the infrastructure must be rebuilt to meet a new definition of luxury that includes a short distance from the valet to check-in, and from elevator to rooms. In luxury Las Vegas, excessive walking is old school and low class. "I don't understand why they can't make the Stardust go," said Chris Lorbiecki, 53, a Milwaukee resident who says she remains a regular visitor to Las Vegas, despite prices for food and lodging she finds increasingly prohibitive. She was eating a soft-serve ice cream cone and lamenting the upscale changes in the city, while standing outside the Stardust as her husband gambled inside. The new places they're building "are for high rollers," she said. "They're not for people like us. You can get deals if you stay off the Strip, but we want to stay on the Strip." But the hotel developers here are high rollers, too, and betting big on a luxury future. Land on the Strip has been going for $20 million to $24 million an acre, said Mr. Feldman of MGM Mirage, prices not supported by budget hotels. Some visitors like the idea of more amenities. "I like swankier, smaller and more intimate hotels," said Lisa I. Roberts, who owns a hair salon in Bellevue, Wash., and was visiting Las Vegas on business. She stayed at the MGM Grand, paying $180 a night during the week, and though it is the current version of luxury, she found the environment too big and corporate. Dan and Jacqueline Aynseworth, both 64, and retirees from Torrance, Calif., said they too liked and could afford the nicer hotels, with their big bathrooms and relative comfort. But they are not sure how less fortunate people can continue to afford to stay here. "They're pushing out the more moderate-income person," Ms. Aynseworth said. "Aren't they the people who helped build Las Vegas?"

910-> Postwar Pogrom
Sometime in the late 1950’s, a pair of Jewish newlyweds walked arm-in-arm down the streets of Lodz. Like all surviving Polish Jews of their generation, the two had lived through the Holocaust against enormous odds, making the joy of that moment all the more poignant. “Look at them,” a well-dressed passer-by suddenly sneered, loud enough for them to hear. “It’s like they’re in Tel Aviv.” To them, his message was clear: Jews had no business living in Poland, let alone being happy there. I thought of these two people, who later became friends of mine, as I read Jan T. Gross’s new book, “Fear: Anti-Semitism in Poland After Auschwitz.” The Polish-born Gross, a professor of history at Princeton University, does not recount their story; even had he known it, there’d have been no room, or time. He has too many greater indignities to relate. He has to tell how surviving Polish Jews, having escaped the fate of 90 percent of their community — three million people — returned to their homeland to be vilified, terrorized and, in some 1,500 instances, murdered, sometimes in ways as bestial as anything the Nazis had devised. One might have thought that if anything could have cured Poland of its anti-Semitism, it was World War II. Polish Jews and Christians were bonded, as never before, by unimaginable suffering at the hands of a common foe. One might also have thought there’d have been pity for the Jewish survivors, most of whom had lost nearly everything: their homes, their youth, their hope, their entire families. Besides, there were so few of them left to hate: only 200,000 or so in a population of 20 million. Instead, returning Polish Jews encountered an anti-Semitism of terrible fury and brutality. Small wonder, then, that nearly as soon as they set foot on Polish soil, most fled all over again. Many went westward, to a place that, oddly enough, had suddenly become an oasis of tranquillity and safety by comparison: Germany. Far from being celebrated, those Poles who had sheltered Jews during the war — and there were many — begged them to say nothing, lest their neighbors deride them as “Jew lovers,” or beat them, or break into their homes (searching for the money the Jews had surely left behind) or kill them. Polish attitudes toward the Germans remain understandably bitter. During his trip to Poland this May, when he visited Auschwitz, the German-born Pope Benedict XVI took care to speak mostly in Italian. But as Gross reminds us, in at least one respect many Poles applauded Hitler: just as he offered a final solution to Germany’s Jewish problem, he was taking care of Poland’s, too. Nazi policies toward the Jews, the legendary underground Polish diplomat Jan Karski reported to his government-in-exile in London in 1940, formed “a sort of narrow bridge where the Germans and a large part of Polish society meet in harmony.” It wasn’t only Karski saying so. Eyewitnesses in the Warsaw ghetto saw Poles watching approvingly or even helping out, acting as spotters as German soldiers shot Jews. Polish girls were overheard joking, “Come, look, how cutlets from Jews are frying,” as the ghetto burned. Nazi accounts of Judenjagd, or “Jew hunts,” detailed how Poles pitched in to find any stray Jews the Germans somehow managed to miss. As the deportations proceeded, and practically before the trains had left for Chelmno or Belzec or Treblinka, Poles gathered on the outskirts of towns, waiting to plunder Jewish property or move into Jewish homes. And while the Nazis killed millions of Jews, Poles killed thousands — most famously, as Gross related in (2001), a book that caused an uproar in Poland, 1,600 of them in the town of Jebwabne in July 1941 — crimes little noted at the time nor since remembered in Polish history books. With the war over, and to tumultuous applause, a thousand delegates of the Polish Peasants Party actually passed a resolution thanking Hitler for annihilating Polish Jewry and urging that those he’d missed be expelled. Indeed, the mopping up soon began. Returning to their villages and towns, Jews were routinely greeted with remarks like “So, ____? You are still alive.” Their efforts to retrieve property were futile — and, sometimes, fatal. Some Jews met their end on trains — not cattle cars this time, but passenger trains, from which they were thrown off. If the trains weren’t moving fast enough, they were beaten to death. This is a book filled with arresting, appalling images. There’s Treblinka, September 1945: a lunar landscape pockmarked with craters, where Poles had dug thousands of holes searching for gold fillings amid the bones and ashes. Or Polish synagogues disassembled for construction projects, and Jewish cemeteries used for landfill. Or Jewish schoolchildren being harassed and Jewish artisans and professionals denied work. With the police and courts looking the other way, Jews were murdered randomly, or in pogroms. Behind these massacres, invariably, was the old canard of Jews killing Christian children for their blood, but with a new twist: Jews now craved gentile blood not just to make matzos, supposedly, but to fortify their own emaciated selves. In the most notorious episode, 60 years ago this month, residents of Kielce, among them policemen, soldiers and boy scouts, murdered 80 Jews. “The immense courtyard was still littered with blood-stained iron pipes, stones and clubs, which had been used to crush the skulls of Jewish men and women,” the Polish-Jewish journalist Saul Shneiderman wrote the following day. It was the largest peacetime pogrom in 20th-century Europe, Gross says. But he maintains that Kielce was nothing special: during this era, it could have taken place anywhere in Poland. Polish intellectuals, Gross notes, were mortified by what was happening in their country. Only a psychopath, one wrote, could have imagined such cruelty. Days before the pogrom, the Polish primate, Cardinal August Hlold, had spurned Jewish entreaties to condemn Roman Catholic anti-Semitism. Afterward, he charged that by leading the effort to impose Communism on Poland — Jews were in fact prominent in the party, though hardly in control — the Jews had only themselves to blame. The point was seconded by the bishop of Kielce, who suggested that Jews had actually orchestrated the unrest to persuade Britain to hand over Palestine. It was a neat trick: being Communists and Zionists simultaneously. Only the bishop of Czestochowa condemned the killings, and was promptly reprimanded by his colleagues. One wonders how Karol Wojtyla, then a young seminarian, later Pope John Paul II, viewed this cesspool of ignorance and intolerance. If the Church gave the Jews short shrift, the same was true of the Communists, even the Jewish ones. For them, ignoring the Jewish plight, as well as Polish complicity in wartime atrocities, offered a way to ingratiate themselves with a wary nation. Besides, what was to be done? When Polish Jewish leaders called for the Communists to do something to stop the hatred, one official had a ready rejoinder. “Do you want me to send 18 million Poles to Siberia?” he asked. How can one explain this madness? Gross conjures up the famous remark of the former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Shamir — that Poles suck in anti-Semitism with their mothers’ milk — only to dismiss it. “Untenable in the light of common sense or empirical evidence,” he says. So, too, Gross writes, are spurious claims of ritual murder or Jewish-Communist complicity. Instead, he argues that Poles were feeling guilty: so implicated were they in the Jewish tragedy, aiding and abetting and expropriating, that the mere sight of those wraiths returning from the camps or exile or hiding, people who knew the Poles’ dirty secrets and held title to their property, was too much to bear. So they murdered Jews or chased them away. But Gross’s evidence, right down to an anti-Semitic revue that was staged in January 1947 near the largest Jewish cemetery on the planet, Auschwitz (a local policeman had the starring role), overwhelms his theory. Such an enormous and varied inventory of inhumanity, one that included the cruelty of children too young to have felt guilt or remorse for anything, transcends any set of historical conditions. A more likely, if less politically palatable explanation, is that through their own state-of-the-art anti-Semitism, the Germans emboldened many Poles to act upon what they had always felt. The comment from Shamir, a Polish Jew himself, may strike us as deeply offensive, simplistic, racist. But whatever Gross may believe, he buttresses Shamir more than he discredits him. Ultimately, what’s far more important than the “why” of this story is the “that”: that a civilized nation could have descended so low, and that such behavior must be documented, remembered, discussed. This Gross does, intelligently and exhaustively. That he digresses from time to time, that his chronology can be confusing, that he repeats himself and occasionally lets his indignation get the better of him, doesn’t really matter. Two additional waves of government-inspired anti-Semitism, in 1956-7 and 1968-9, drove out most of those Polish Jews who, despite everything, had held on. (Among them were those newlyweds; the husband later told me that on his first day in New York he felt more at home than he ever had in Poland.) Now, despite occasional anti-Jewish episodes — in May, for instance, the country’s chief rabbi was punched on a Warsaw street by someone shouting “Poland for Poles” — and widespread suspicions that Jews still run things there, Poland has become a place of necro-nostalgia. Klezmer music wafts out of Krakow’s old Jewish quarter. There’s matzo in every Polish supermarket. And in liquor stores, the faces of happy Hasidim — more than you’ll now see in a lifetime in Lublin or Bialystok — stare out from bottles of Polish kosher vodka, prized for its supposed purity. Meantime, young people with even the most tangential Jewish ties now lay proud claim to their heritage. But as Gross reminds us in this depressing, devastating and infuriating book, the luckiest Polish Jews, not just before Hitler but after, were the ones who got away.

913-> In the Holy Caves of India
HE must have been amazed. It would have been hot, as it always seems to be in this eastern part of the Indian state of Maharashtra. The land ahead of him would have been much as it is today — fairly flat, dusty, yellow, featureless, tricked out with thick scrub and forests of mimosa and tamarind trees. He was a soldier, and his fellow officers would have been behind him, keeping as quiet as they could and well downwind of their prey, a thus far unseen tiger. Then there was a gap in the scrub, the land fell away, and down, down, well below the eyeline, there lay, unexpected, a winding and noisily rushing river. Beyond it, filling his view, rose a cliff that was marked indelibly and incredibly with a horizontal tidemark of large and oddly shaped apertures, caves, perhaps, carved by water or winds. Or on second sight maybe not, since the openings seemed more like doorways, doorways carved and fretworked into the cliff-face stone. He must have been amazed. He was named John Smith, he was a captain in the Madras Army, and he would have remained an almost forgotten British imperial figure but for a single scratched graffito that he left high on a basalt pillar in one of these caves, with, in perfectly legibly incised copperplate, his name and the date, April 1819. This small moment of recorded vandalism marks this otherwise unsung soldier as the first European discoverer of an ancient construction that still, nearly 200 years on, has the power to utterly astound and astonish those who see it for the first time. The monument comprises a series of 29 caves that have been carved deep into this sheer face of a horseshoe-shaped cliff a few miles from the old walled town of Ajanta, hidden away in the deep gorge gouged in the high Deccan plains by the Waghora River about 300 miles inland from Mumbai. It is a Unesco World Heritage Site, designated as such back in 1983 as one of India’s first, along with the Taj Mahal. And though Shah Jahan’s famous memorial in Agra is far better known, the Ajanta Caves are hugely popular, particularly with Indians, who see them as eloquent testimony to their country’s immense and unbroken history. The caves can in consequence become insufferably crowded. But I went in March, the lowest of the low seasons — the schools hadn’t closed for spring break and the weather, though warm, wasn’t as hot as most Indian travelers prefer. There were so few people around that it sometimes seemed as though the tourists were outnumbered by the monkeys, who gathered in troops up in the neem trees, gazing down at the scattering of humans who wandered, in rapt attention, in and out of great gaping holes in the high walls of the cliff. And while it is what is inside the caves that these days attracts most interest — and controversy, since, within, there are memorably beautiful mural paintings and images fully 2,000 years old and more — the simple, most astonishing fact remains that these caves are, in the very truest sense, and just as the captain suspected, entirely human constructions. They are not merely occupied or used by humans. They were not the consequence of any geological accident. They were carved, and everything within them was carved as well. Each one of these enormous caverns was hollowed from the flint-hard rock by hand. Every single pillar, statue, elephant, Buddha and griffon inside is the original rock, previously undisturbed deep within the cliff: the three-dimensionality of each object was fashioned by ancient stonemasons working their way painstakingly around and beside and beneath each imagined sculpture-to-be, creating space from rock, and leaving these magnificent subterranean monuments behind as they chipped the caves away. Inside, today’s visitors find guides with flashlights, essential in the gloom of the deeper caves to help them understand the complexity of the story. While in some seasons the guides must attend to a crush of visitors, it was seldom that I encountered more than three other people in any one cave, and in Cave 10, one of the oldest and largest, there was no one other than the guide, a Mr. Malhotra. He darted about energetically, pointing his slow-dimming light up to the most exquisite of the images and tut-tutting at the graffiti of midcentury Indian visitors who had incised their names and dates and trysting notes to absent lovers on some of the walls. We do not know for sure if Captain Smith fully realized, on that spring day in 1819 when he and his hunting party first chanced upon the site, how the caves had been constructed. Legend has it that they were out hunting tigers in the Sahyadri Hills when they came to the Waghora, at a place where it rounded a tight and tortured semicircle, its waters roaring down to a seven-tiered waterfall at the canyon end. But we do know that he and his men forded the river and clambered, very dangerously, up the sheer and slippery lava cliffs and up to the mouths of some of the caverns. They peered cautiously inside, using torches they had crudely fashioned from fascicles of wild grasses. And then they were able to see, just as Howard Carter was to see, when he peered into his newly opened cave in Egypt a century later, just “wonderful things ... wonderful things.” There were statues of animals, ornate pillars, Buddha figures, soaring roofs of what seemed like stone cathedrals — and on all the walls and some of the ceilings, paintings, brilliantly colored mural paintings of dazzling complexity and loveliness. Today’s tourists see all of this from a walkway that winds around the cliff at the caves’ floor level, preserving visitors from the vertiginous drop into the river. Once back in Madras, Captain Smith reported his find to his superior officers, and eventually the news reached the Royal Asiatic Society in London, whereupon a buzz of excitement broke out among the soldiers and administrators who were able to find their way to such a remote part of India. In short order it became the fashion to try to find the Waghora Valley and its extraordinary secret gorge. There are in the archives accounts from the small number of men who succeeded, men like Lt. James Alexander of the 16th Lancers, who visited in 1824 and — well aware of the dangers posed locally by the very fierce Bhil tribesmen, the “stony-hearted robbers” who, he was warned “will destroy you” — dressed himself up as a local, strapping on sabers, pistols and hunting spears as protection. He clambered up the cliff and into the first cave: he found “a foetid smell arising from numerous bats ... the remains of a recent fire ... the entire skeleton of a man ... prints of the feet of tigers, jackals, bears, monkeys, peacocks etc., impressed into the dust formed by the plaster of the fresco paintings which had fallen from the ceiling.” He reached a safe spot to sit in the sun, and there, gazing out over the river, he smoked a bidi and found himself moved — for seemingly he was an educated man — to quote Horace, the ode that begins “quae non imber edax non aquilo impotens ...” — “cannot be destroyed by gnawing rain or wild north wind, by the procession of unnumbered years or by the flight of time.” Before long, scholars were flocking to the caves, hauling themselves up on ropes, inching along tiny ledges fit for mountain goats, the river roaring far below. Though decades later five Buddha heads stolen from Ajanta made their way to a sale at Sotheby’s — and are now at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston — the caves remained largely intact as these early-19th-century visitors puzzled over what they had found. The Bhils, when they could be persuaded to set aside their bows and poison-tipped arrows, insisted that the caves were Hindu and that some of them still provided homes to their own living gods. But the academics thought otherwise. By the middle of the 19th century it was agreed that these were Buddhist caves, fashioned for two basic purposes. Some were monasteries, the so-called viharas, where monks could go to live in quiet and solitude (and escape from the foul weather of the monsoon). Others were chaityas, cathedral-like halls of worship, where the Buddha or a symbol of his spirituality (for in very early times any representation of him was banned) could be revered in public and with ceremony. The artwork in some of the caves suggested they originated in the second century B.C. Gradually, the story of the making of the Ajanta Caves became clear. Though interpretations of the details have been many and controversial (not least thanks to the outspoken and contrary scholarship of a University of Michigan art history professor, Walter Spink, who has devoted most of his long life to the Buddhist art of northern India), the basic story now seems to be agreed upon. In ancient days the village of Ajanta stood athwart a trade route — the main Delhi-Mumbai railway passes close by today, essentially following the same path. (A few visitors to the caves disembark from trains at Jalgaon station, 40 miles away; most, however, fly into Aurangabad, 60 miles away, but with better hotels.) About 2,200 years ago, when a dynasty of aristocrats known as the Satavahanas was in power in this corner of India, and when the doctrines of the Buddha were enthusiastically accepted, a group of wealthy merchants decided to sponsor the carving of a small number of cave monasteries and cave temples for the use of priests and mendicants who used the route. (The tradition extended in time through much of the Buddhist world: vast numbers of caves have been carved, for instance, into the side of a cliff in Dunhuang, on the Chinese Silk Road, where scholars are fascinated to note that the earliest Buddhas have Indian facial features). Stone carvers set out to work. They first made themselves secure by belaying themselves from ropes anchored high up on the cliffs, lowered themselves perhaps a hundred feet down from the lip, and started chipping away into the rock face, beginning high up, fashioning what would in time become the cave’s roof. Once they had incised a narrow letter-box-like opening a hundred or so feet into the cliff, they began to carve downward. But they didn’t simply cut downward to make an enormous void. They had planned something far more complex, and so in their descending journey they deliberately left uncarved parts of the rock that would in time become shaped into pillars, elephants, camels and other creatures. The rock was very hard: the process of carving the bare stubs of the cave-inhabitants and cave-menageries and cave-furniture would take many years to complete. But eventually the carving was done, whereupon the painters moved in. These were artists who were ordered either to paint the statues, or parts of them or, more importantly, to create painting on the roofs and walls of the caves. This they did with great flamboyance and bravura, while using a palette of only six colors, all of them natural — red and yellow ochre, black and white, malachite green and a blue of crushed lapis lazuli, found in abundance nearby. They poured pools of water into shallow depressions they had made in the floors to act as mirrors, to help reflect outside sunlight up onto the dark ceilings on which they painted. They produced murals, not frescoes, the plaster on which they applied their paint having to be dry, not wet, with the consequence that the paintings have an extraordinary fragility. Today’s visitors are warned ceaselessly not to touch them; some are protected with layers of shellac; others have glass or plastic shields in place; a distressing number remain ruined, damaged by careless visitors of the last century. The pictures that are intact are breathtakingly lovely — the artists painted with extraordinary delicacy and dexterity beautiful, full-breasted young women, peacocks, horses, flowers, deer — everything except the Buddha, which in those days was proscribed in imagery. As has happened so often to rulers in Indian history, the Satavahanas eventually went into a decline. Hinduism became locally dominant, and for three centuries there was no further activity at the site. Chinese travelers who had already noted the splendor of the caves in the gorges now reported back home to their Emperor that the local people “do not know the ... Law of the Buddha.” But by the fifth century A.D., all had changed once again. The Vakataka dynasty was in power, and the great emperor Harisena — “probably the most illustrious ruler in the world in his own day,” in Mr. Spink’s words — supported the creation of yet more monasteries and places of worship, adding in his time a further 23 caves to the 6 already made. Cave by cave by cave, important donors and sponsors were co-opted by Harisena to produce decorations and statuary — with, this time, the Buddha being fully amenable to representation, and so there are many images of him and his bodhisattvas — that would in time come to represent the fullest flowering of Indian classical art during one of its most energetic periods of creativity. And then Harisena died, there was turbulence and small wars, and by A.D. 480 the period of carving and painting and creation was over. The trade routes moved elsewhere; the cave makers moved east to Ellora and began a new set of monuments of equivalent majesty; the Buddhist monks — who in any case were to be compelled to leave India eventually, when Buddhism was proscribed in the seventh century — abandoned their clifftop refuges. The neem trees and the mimosas took over, the jungle reclaimed the cliffsides, and the caves became home to animals and parrots, and to occasional wandering saddhus. The Ajanta Caves languished, silent and forgotten and essentially unvisited, for almost a millennium and a half, until Captain Smith and his tiger hunters of the Madras Army fetched up there in the spring of 1819. Thanks in large measure to their Unesco World Heritage designation, and given the very evident pride displayed both by the Indian government and the state of Maharashtra, there is a forceful attempt to preserve and protect the caves. Cars and buses are kept a mile away, there are no hawkers’ stalls allowed. A keen vigilance is maintained to make as certain as possible that visitors are respectful and careful, and that no one loots the monument of its priceless treasures; the guides with their flashlights act as sentries as well. Visitors pad quietly about in bare feet, asked to leave their shoes outside to protect the cave floors. Mr. Malhotra, my guide in Cave 10, close to the middle of the horseshoe-shaped array, addressed me with hushed awe about the age and scale of the immense columns — and then of the great central stupa, with its enormous and genially serene Buddha. The cave itself was 2,000 years old; the Buddha had been added maybe 600 years later. It was an awe-inspiring thought: for 1,400 years — while mankind beyond had been cursed by the Black Death, had been engaging in the Crusades, had been creating vast empires, had founded the New World, had fought Napoleon in endless wars — the caves had gone undisturbed, unfound, unknown. I mentioned this to Mr. Malhotra. Amazing, didn’t he think? Quite so, he replied and then he beckoned me to come deeper into the cave. He took me to the very back, to a wall far behind the stupa. Here the sunlight from the doorway had little perceptible effect, and it was difficult to make out much, so he directed the yellow and flickering beam of his torch to a point high up on the rock wall. And there, incised in Victorian copperplate, was more graffiti: “John Smith,” it said, and then in a more florid hand, a flourish of typographical exuberance, “April 1819.” He was the first one to see it, chuckled Mr. Malhotra. Nearly two centuries ago. Can you imagine? He was out hunting tigers and then he came across this. He must have been amazed.

916-> A Choir at Christmas, Medieval to Spirituals
The San Francisco men’s choir Chanticleer turned 29 this year, but to judge by the fresh faces among the dozen singers who appeared at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Sunday, several current members might not have been born when the group was founded. The performance, held in the museum’s Medieval Sculpture Hall, was the first of the group’s popular annual Christmas concerts. Beyond the inherent attractions of each selection, the program offered an effective showcase for this extraordinary ensemble’s broad stylistic range. The plainspoken “Natus est rex,” a medieval French chant by an unknown composer, allowed listeners to drink in the heady blend of voices, which swelled and lingered in the reverberant space. Its opposite number was the silken “Nesciens mater,” a dazzling canonic motet by the 16th-century Franco-Flemish composer Jean Mouton. The singers divided into two groups for Andrea Gabrieli’s “Quem vidistis pastores?” and gleefully exchanged buoyant lines set to bouncy rhythms. “Altissima luce,” a medieval Italian sacred song, offered breathtakingly hushed singing from the sopranos and altos. In another of these, “Venite a laudare,” words of penitence resounded with a manly swagger. A pair of German cradle songs underscored Chanticleer’s tonal richness. The singers seamlessly moved through styles and keys in a patchwork arrangement of “In dulci jubilo” compiled from four different settings, including a densely polyphonic verse by Hieronymous Praetorius and an elegantly adorned conclusion by Bach. “O Morgenstern,” a brief antiphon (liturgical chant) by Arvo Pärt, was filled with otherworldly harmonies and aching, unresolved melodies. A lush Magnificat by César Cui elicited strong performances from the choir’s highest voices. With eyes closed, it was nearly impossible to believe that you were hearing an all-male ensemble. The traditional carols that followed included some of those currently blasting from loudspeakers in elevators and department stores; here, they were reinvigorated by the elegant arrangements of Joseph Jennings, the group’s music director. Mr. Jennings joined the choir for its finale, a rousing medley of spirituals in arrangements that sometimes hinted at doo-wop. The adoring throng demanded an encore, and got one: a ravishing “Ave Maria” by Franz Biebl.

917-> Remembering a Small but Important Contribution to the Greatest Generation
Those whose tolerance of Greatest Generation war stories isn’t exhausted, not to mention those who still thrive on them, will find the group of men who called themselves the Ritchie Boys good company. This documentary, named for a military boot camp in Maryland, tells of a group of Jewish immigrants who fled Germany for the United States in the years of the Nazi buildup. When the war broke out, they realized that, with their language skills and knowledge of the enemy, they could help the American military. They were given intelligence and psychological warfare training in Maryland, then sent back to the continent they had fled to support the D-Day invasion by interrogating captured Germans soldiers and civilians for information useful to the Allies. Mr. Bauer tracked down an engaging assortment of Ritchie Boys and, pacing his film beautifully, builds their testimony into an affecting group portrait. Unlike many films about World War II, this one offers no dramatic or melodramatic arc of the sort that culminates in the taking of a vital bridge or completion of a decisive bombing run. Instead the viewer spends an hour and a half in the company of some old guys remembering their small but important contributions to the war. Their anecdotes are sometimes harrowing, sometimes humorous, sometimes both, as when a Ritchie Boy named Si Lewen tells of driving around the war zone blaring messages to the locals over a loudspeaker. “We had a lot of casualties,” he deadpans. “All the Germans had to do was shoot toward the sound.” Written (in English, with some subtitled German) and directed by Christian Bauer; director of photography, Dietrich Mangold; edited by David Kazala; music by Aaron Davis and John Lang; narrated by Michael Hanrahan; produced by Dagmar Biller and Donna Zuckerbrot; released by Menemsha Films. At the Quad Cinema, 34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 92 minutes. This film is not rated.

To the Sports Editor: Re "Top Grades and No Class Time for Auburn Players," (July 14): Does Auburn emphasize athletics at any cost? Yes. It did when I studied there in the 1970's and it does today. James Gundlach, the sociology professor who revealed the latest football scandal, is a brave man, and he has done Auburn a great service. James Patterson Washington To the Sports Editor: Many highly recruited athletes at universities with major football programs are brought to campus to generate revenue for the athletic department for no pay. They shouldn't be expected to do serious academic work. Indeed, many are completely unequipped for real college courses. Professors like Auburn's Thomas Petee are dealing with these students' plight realistically. It is the exploitative, sanctimonious charade of big-money university sports that deserves castigation, not those who take it for what it really is. Philip Siller New York

919-> Arts, Briefly; A Countdown For Eakins Painting
The Philadelphia Museum of Art has 26 more days to raise $68 million if it wants to prevent Thomas Eakins's 1875 masterpiece, "The Gross Clinic," from going to the National Gallery of Art in Washington and the new Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark. With the clock ticking, Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum, announced yesterday that $23 million of that amount had been raised locally, but refused to say from where. "It's a community effort," Ms. d'Harnoncourt said. "We've had hundreds of gifts large and small, from $10 to millions." The painting is owned by Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, where Dr. Samuel D. Gross taught surgery in the 1800s. In agreeing to sell the painting this month to the National Gallery and Crystal Bridges, the university gave local institutions 45 days to match the $68 million price. Philadelphia was Eakins's lifelong home. " 'The Gross Clinic' is "an icon for this city, a masterpiece that sums up all of Philadelphia's strengths then and now," Ms. d'Harnoncourt said yesterday.

920-> Manhattan: Construction Worker Is Hurt in Fall
A construction worker was seriously injured yesterday after he fell from atop scaffolding into a 40-foot-deep trench on the Upper East Side, fire officials said. Firefighters were lowered into the trench at the site, on 53rd Street near Second Avenue, and helped lift him to street level using a body-length metal rescue basket, the officials said. The worker, whom the police and fire officials would not identify, was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with serious injuries, the officials said, but was in stable condition last evening.

921-> One Scoop or Two, Homemade in the East Village
When the lease for Sundaes & Cones, Royce Chan's store in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, expired after 15 years, he packed up and moved to 95 East 10th Street in the East Village. An array of homemade ice creams in flavors as diverse as green tea, strawberry, tiramisù and chocolate sorbet are served in this industrial-looking shop. I loved the chunks of ginger in the ginger ice cream, but the litchi flavor, while properly creamy and perfumed, proved to me that this fruit does better as sorbet. Cones and sundaes are the stock in trade, of course, but soon frozen yogurt and other ice cream specialties will be available: (212) 979-9398. The finest chocolate, as we know it, dates from 1879. That was when Rudolph Lindt, a Swiss chocolatier, invented the conching machine, which made it easier to knead a mass of warm chocolate to a satin-smooth texture. The longer the chocolate is conched, the finer the texture. Chocolate that is worked by hand will never achieve that finesse. But a bite of a bar of Don Puglisi chocolate proves that there is merit in old-fashioned chocolate that is dull, not shiny, and has a pleasingly crunchy texture. This artisanal chocolate from Modica, a baroque hill town in southeast Sicily, is made from the finest criollo beans and is worked without heating, on a machine that is similar to a metate, a Mexican-style mortar, so that the sugar crystals retain their integrity. The chocolate comes in 3.5-ounce bars, plain dark or vanilla, chili, ginger, cinnamon, bergamot and coffee. The bars are sold at Bedford Cheese Shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for $5, and at Fairway for $3.99. Wayne Harley Brachman knows what it's like to pack two children off to school with filled lunchboxes, so his advice in "See Dad Cook" (Clarkson Potter, $16.95 paper) rings true. Mr. Brachman is an experienced chef, but his friendly book, which might be just right for a Father's Day gift, assumes little familiarity with the kitchen. It covers tools, shopping, shortcuts and, perhaps best of all, how kids can be enlisted to help out at mealtime. The recipes are basic: pasta primavera, for example, pot roast, even popcorn. The blueberry muffin recipe is excellent. The esthetics of Japanese food, so evident on the plate, start with often hand-crafted kitchen implements. Cooks everywhere have discovered the santoku knife, but in "Cool Tools: Cooking Utensils from the Japanese Kitchen" (Kodansha International, $28), Kate Klippensteen discusses many more utensils, like slender chopsticks used in cooking, ceramic pots, special graters and graceful bamboo colanders. A list of sources is given. "Off Duty: The World's Greatest Chefs Cook at Home" (William Morrow, 2006, $39.95) is a collection of menus and recipes that David Nicholls, an English chef, assembled from contributions by 47 well-known chefs and one food writer, some of them American, after his 19-year-old son, Daniel, was paralyzed in an accident. Proceeds from the beautifully photographed cookbook raise money for a spinal injury foundation that Mr. Nicholls started in his son's name. Among the selections: Charlie Trotter's Yukon Gold potato soup with poached oysters, Wolfgang Puck's zesty lemon bars and Alain Ducasse's brioche French toast.

924-> Voluntary C-Sections Result in More Baby Deaths
A recent study of nearly six million births has found that the risk of death to newborns delivered by voluntary Caesarean section is much higher than previously believed. Researchers have found that the neonatal mortality rate for Caesarean delivery among low-risk women is 1.77 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the rate for vaginal delivery is 0.62 deaths per 1,000. Their were published in this month’s issue of Birth: Issues in Perinatal Care. The percentage of Caesarean births in the United States increased to 29.1 percent in 2004 from 20.7 percent in 1996, according to background information in the report. Mortality in Caesarean deliveries has consistently been about 1½ times that of vaginal delivery, but it had been assumed that the difference was due to the higher risk profile of mothers who undergo the operation. This study, according to the authors, is the first to examine the risk of Caesarean delivery among low-risk mothers who have no known medical reason for the operation. Congenital malformations were the leading cause of neonatal death regardless of the type of delivery. But the risk in first Caesarean deliveries persisted even when deaths from congenital malformation were excluded from the calculation. Intrauterine hypoxia — lack of oxygen — can be both a reason for performing a Caesarean section and a cause of death, but even eliminating those deaths left a neonatal mortality rate for Caesarean deliveries in the cases studied at more than twice that for vaginal births. “Neonatal deaths are rare for low-risk women — on the order of about one death per 1,000 live births — but even after we adjusted for socioeconomic and medical risk factors, the difference persisted,” said Marian F. MacDorman, a statistician with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the lead author of the study. “This is nothing to get people really alarmed, but it is of concern given that we’re seeing a rapid increase in Caesarean births to women with no risks,” Dr. MacDorman said. Part of the reason for the increased mortality may be that labor, unpleasant as it sometimes is for the mother, is beneficial to the baby in releasing hormones that promote healthy lung function. The physical compression of the baby during labor is also useful in removing fluid from the lungs and helping the baby prepare to breathe air. The researchers suggest that other risks of Caesarean delivery, like possible cuts to the baby during the operation or delayed establishment of breast-feeding, may also contribute to the increased death rate. The study included 5,762,037 live births and 11,897 infant deaths in the United States from 1998 through 2001, a sample large enough to draw statistically significant conclusions even though neonatal death is a rare event. There were 311,927 Caesarean deliveries among low-risk women in the analysis. The authors acknowledge that the study has certain limitations, including concerns about the accuracy of medical information reported on birth certificates. That data is highly reliable for information like method of delivery and birth weight, but may underreport individual medical risk factors. It is possible, though unlikely, that the Caesarean birth group was inherently at higher risk, the authors said. Dr. Michael H. Malloy, a co-author of the article and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, said that doctors might want to consider these findings in advising their patients. “Despite attempts to control for a number of factors that might have accounted for a greater risk in mortality associated with C-sections, we continued to observe enough risk to prompt concern,” he said. “When obstetricians review this information, perhaps it will promote greater discussion within the obstetrical community about the pros and cons of offering C-sections for convenience and promote more research into understanding why this increased risk persists.”

925-> Football Wives, Bridging 2 Views of Race
To talk about “The Game,” a new sitcom about football wives that starts tomorrow on CW, we must be blunt about race — or rather, about sitcoms and race. Because on sitcoms, unlike dramas like “Six Degrees” or “Nip/Tuck,” race as an issue must be faced and cannot be handled in that quasi-liberal television way, meaning with outward decorousness, a deep sense of duty and high anxiety. Put another way, sitcoms are supposed to be funny. They can’t require that all street criminals be white and all judges black; they must occasionally be real, or at least more relaxed about inverting biases. They can also target specific audiences more openly than dramas do — “The Game” is positioned as an African-American sitcom — just as, in their storylines, they aim to relieve ideological tensions instead of creating or ignoring them. Thus the central clique on “The Game” is composed of white women who read Ebony and black women with silky hair like Jennifer Connelly’s. The idea is that the pro football players’ wives, who lead lives of luxury and philanthropy in San Diego, are one of those groups of stereotype-defying superfriends, much like the Tyra-Miss Jay-Mr. Jay trio of biracial-seeming androgynous personas who preside over Tyra Banks’s “America’s Next Top Model.” And the race-bending women of “The Game” have been written that way for a reason. The somewhat banal reason is this: The new sitcom comes on after “Girlfriends,” with its largely black cast, and before “America’s Next Top Model.” On CW, which incorporates UPN with its history of black programming, “The Game” is intended to serve as a bridge from one way of depicting race to another. The first way is represented by “Girlfriends,” which follows the lives and loves of four strong black women and has been nominated for 14 N.A.A.C.P. Image awards. The second way is “America’s Next Top Model,” which has won little N.A.A.C.P. attention, with its men in makeup and constant talk of “Miss Thing” and hair weaves. It’s a tall order for a sitcom to bridge this sensibility gap. But CW, which may be short on time, cash and confidence, is not dumb, and for “The Game” it has shrewdly built strong, straight black female characters (à la “Girlfriends”) who are nonetheless divas and therefore somewhat “above” race (à la “America’s Next Top Model”). Tasha (Wendy Raquel Robinson) is the mother of a rising-star player, Malik (Hosea Chanchez); she’s all attitude and fierceness, and she takes a dim view of white women who marry black men. Melanie (Tia Mowry), by contrast, is an ingénue dating a rookie, Derwin (Pooch Hall); she’s wholesome and a good student, a kind of “Cosby Show” figure, who on the first episode tries to resist getting drawn into the meddling henhouse of football wives who are threatened by “away-game hoochies” who might sleep with their husbands. Finally, Kelly (Brittany Daniel) is a white woman married to a black man, Jason (Coby Bell); she’s extremely suspicious of him and monitors him for infidelity at every turn. When Melanie asks Kelly why she can’t trust her husband, Kelly reminds her that their men are not ordinary mortals. Instead, they get things like text messages from Miss Universe. “Not Miss America, not Miss World,” says Kelly. “The prettiest woman in the .” The suggestion that fame and money on this scale (Malik, we’re told, makes $40 million annually) require the suspension of ordinary norms underscores the hypothesis behind the whole show. “The Game” is about black characters, like “Girlfriends,” but more important, it’s about stardom, like “America’s Next Top Model.” And stardom has an interesting effect on race: it removes an individual from the binary black-white trap, as Ms. Banks — who explores both black and white styles of glamour on her show — well understands. This powerful notion has had authority in pop culture at least since Madonna’s “Vogue” in 1990. “It makes no difference if you’re black or white,” Madonna explained. “You’re a superstar, yes, that’s what you are.” Created by Mara Brock Akil; Kelsey Grammer, Ms. Akil and Steve Stark, executive producers. Produced by Happy Camper Productions and Grammnet Productions in association with CBS Paramount Network Television.

926-> World Business Briefing | Europe: Russia: Ban on Moldovan Imports Lifted
Russia is lifting its ban on Moldovan wine and meat products, President Vladimir V. Putin said after talks in Belarus with Moldova's president, Vladimir Voronin, left. The move appeared to be aimed at easing Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization, which Moscow hopes to join next year. Russia banned imports of Moldovan wine earlier this year, citing quality concerns. A Moldovan official said then that the small, poor country would support Russia's entry to the trade organization only if the wine ban were reversed and other imports of agricultural produce were allowed.

927-> Saving Helpless Hostages but Not Their Own Affair
On “Bones” the sexual tension between the crime solvers is unconsummated and unspoken. Now Fox is experimenting with postcoital tension: the F.B.I. partners on “Standoff” have already slept together but really should stop to continue working together as hostage negotiators. “I’m wondering if the last time we had sex is going to be the last time we had sex,” Matt Flannery (Ron Livingston) says to Emily Lehman (Rosemarie DeWitt) after their secret is exposed. Hostages had better hope that mystery doesn’t distract him from his day job. In the past, plenty of successful crime shows have relied on the love-hate chemistry of the leads. “Moonlighting,” with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis was one. Another was “Remington Steele,” with Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist. Couples who keep their relationships lighthearted have also held their own, from the “Thin Man” movies to Stefanie Powers and Robert Wagner on “Hart to Hart,” or Rock Hudson and Susan St. James on “McMillan and Wife.” Stifled operating room romances are the lifeblood of medical shows, from “ER” to “Grey’s Anatomy,” and even, up to a misanthropic point, on “House,” another Fox show that has its season premiere tonight. And while “Standoff,” is not exactly a playful romp, it tries not to take itself too seriously. It serves almost as a comic version of “The Nine,” ABC’s new drama about nine people taken hostage in a bank. The negotiators’ passion for nonviolent resolution is scoffed at by Frank Rogers (Michael Cudlitz), the tough-as-nails leader of the F.B.I.’s hostage-rescue team, who prefers sniper resolution. And it is hard not to side with Frank in most of these crises. When Emily demands to know why he wants to shoot a demented television star who is holding his two sons hostage at gunpoint in his S.U.V., Frank replies, “Have you seen him act?” Even the funky 70’s music — whackita-whackita — that swells at tense moments harks back to the days of “S.W.A.T.” and “T. J. Hooker.” But chemistry is supposed to be the binding element of “Standoff,” and the two leads, while appealing in their own right, seem neither well matched nor sufficiently mismatched. Mr. Livingston, who played one of Carrie Bradshaw’s lovers in “Sex and the City,” has a boyish smirk that he cannot quite suppress even in life-and-death situations. (When the television actor whines on about his problems over the cellphone, Matt rolls his eyes.) When Ms. DeWitt is onscreen, she seems to be acting in a different show: a tense psychological thriller or a production of “Medea.” This actress, who has an elegant nose that seems to have been spared the plastic surgeon’s knife, is an arresting beauty, but more by foreign-film standards than prime-time television’s. In love scenes the two look as if they were reaching out for their real mates, accidentally stumbled and wound up in the wrong arms. If there is any chemistry at all, it is between the F.B.I. negotiators and the deranged hostage takers they must verbally seduce to disarm. Off the job the real romance is elsewhere: if there is a spark, it is most easily detected in the enmity between Emily and Frank, who makes fun of her to her face but has hidden admiration for her skill. In one scene, while observing her through his rifle scope, he nods appreciatively at the way she talks down the crazed son of a congressman. One problem with choosing hostage takers as a dramatic pivot is that they are all by definition disturbed, so from episode to episode, variety is mostly found in the hostage takers’ choice of location, and those tend to be fairly predictable: banks, schools and coffee shops. And maybe post offices. But it is nice to know that even men who are trained in the art of communication have trouble expressing their feelings when girlfriends are involved. In the premiere Emily is understandably enraged when Matt, in the course of trying to connect with a disturbed hostage taker, reveals their clandestine affair to everyone listening, including their boss. The next day she confronts him. “You can share your deepest hopes and fears with a heavily armed psychopath for hours on end, “ she says, complaining angrily that he nevertheless won’t open up to her. He has a better idea. “Let’s talk about this later,” he says. Craig Silverstein, creator and executive producer; The Angel, composer. WITH: Ron Livingston (Matt Flannery), Rosemarie DeWitt (Emily Lehman), Gina Torres (Cheryl Carrera), Michael Cudlitz (Frank Rogers), Raquel Alessi (Lia Mathers), Jose Pablo Cantillo (Duff).

928-> Campaigning for Others, Giuliani Plays to Strengths
CONCORD, N.H., Oct. 12 — He struck conservative themes on taxes, Iraq and terrorism, impressing his Republican audience. But on his first trip to New Hampshire in two years, Rudolph W. Giuliani on Thursday stayed away from the social issues on which his positions put him at odds with much of his party. Trailed by a large contingent of reporters and television cameras, Mr. Giuliani said he was here only to raise money and to campaign for other Republicans, and he did not raise the subject of any presidential ambitions on his own. But, as always, the reporters did. “I’ll make the decision sometime next year,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Could be sometime in the first half of the year; I’m not even sure of that.” Asked whether his support of abortion rights, gay rights and gun control could pose problems in the primaries, he said: “I have no idea what the issues are going to be a year or two years from now, what people are going to focus on, what they’re going to think is most important, what they’re going to think is less important. That will probably determine who they choose.” Speaking at a fund-raising lunch for Republican state legislators, he praised their continued opposition to creating state income or sales taxes. He said that limiting taxes and the size of government was an essential Republican value, and while the message is sure to resonate in this tax-averse state, it is one his party has not always heeded nationally. “Once a tax gets established, it almost never goes away, and it almost never goes down,” he said. Later, Mr. Giuliani was noncommittal about how the Bush administration had pursued the war in Iraq, but not about the core mission, which he described as the establishment of a stable, accountable government. “I think the current goal is the correct goal, and I think the administration has to keep assessing how they are getting to that goal,” he said. Democratic calls to withdraw from Iraq in the face of mounting violence are wrong, he said. “On that standard we would have pulled out of the Civil War in about 1863.” Mr. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, had not visited New Hampshire since 2004, while all the others who are seen as serious Republican candidates have been here repeatedly. (Among Democrats, the only prominent contender who has not made a New Hampshire trip since the last election is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.) Yet at three of Mr. Giuliani’s campaign stops on Thursday, Republican elected officials and party leaders said he was so well known and well liked that a late start would be no obstacle. In addition to speaking at the fund-raiser, Mr. Giuliani addressed a rally for Republicans in an auditorium in Concord and campaigned with Representative Jeb Bradley in Brentwood, appearing with several local law enforcement officials. They toured a regional police dispatch center that officials said was built partly in response to the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina. There the former mayor avidly grilled them on the number of local agencies involved and their technical capabilities. New Hampshire voters pride themselves on having ample, up-close access to presidential candidates and on being hard to impress, which could explain why Mr. Giuliani received a less effusive reception here than he has in some other parts of the country. Even people steeped in politics said they knew little about Mr. Giuliani’s record beyond the drop in crime in New York City and his handling of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. State Representative Mary E. Griffin said she liked him but then raised her eyebrows when told of some of his views. “I would hesitate about the gay rights, and I am strongly pro-life myself,” she said. “But around here we don’t make any judgments until we can sit down and really talk with them.” Mr. Giuliani’s appeal has much less to do with his stances on issues than with his reputation as the man who took charge after the nation’s worst terrorist attack. He plays on that widely held image of a leader who understands security, talking at length about terrorism and the differences between the parties in a way that appeals strongly to Republican audiences. “We believe that you should be on offense against terrorists,” he said. As for Democrats, “What they really believe in is playing defense, which is what we used to do.”

929-> Getting There Is Half the Fun
CLIMBERS have long worn tight-fitting shoes with sticky soles to help them scale vertical rock. But even a short walk in a pair can be uncomfortable. When a long steep hike to the base of the rock is needed and the climb itself is easy, climbers prefer approach shoes. Today’s models combine the cushioning and construction of hiking footwear with the light weight, low cut and adhesiveness of climbing shoes. In the last few years approach shoes have won over hikers who wear them because of their superior traction on slippery rocks. What used to be a niche product now “seems to be catching on to a wider audience,” said Colin Lantz, the president of La Sportiva North America, a performance footwear company. “Approach shoes have that kind of extreme look, where you can identify as being a climber, but people are also attracted to the functionality.” To test for traction and comfort, Mark Bowling, the director of the Joshua Tree Rock Climbing School in California, wore these shoes while hiking and climbing.

Trooper Gillespie said Mr. Torn, 75, refused to take a sobriety test and would be arraigned on a charge of driving while intoxicated. Mr. Torn, who won an Emmy Award in 1996 for playing the hard-drinking producer on “The Larry Sanders Show,” was acquitted of drunken-driving charges in Manhattan in 2004. His publicist, Dick Guttman, said by telephone from Los Angeles yesterday that he had not heard from Mr. Torn and could not comment.

932-> Buying as a Team
After enjoying many vacations together, it was only natural for the Liebermans and the Notricas to consider buying a second home as a team. Hidden Meadow Ranch, a luxury ranch resort in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona was selling one-sixth fractions of 3,600-square-foot, four-bedroom cabins. Weekend retreats had taken the couples there several times, but even a single share, which entitled owners to eight weeks of use a year, was more than any one family could use on their own. They decided to split the cost. “It was practical when we started to look at how much time we would be using it,” Becky Lieberman said, “and that we would also be using it together anyway.” The two families set up a limited liability company to buy the property, allocated four weeks per couple and detailed who would get which master bedroom (one is larger) when they did travel together. Then they hammered out thorny issues like what would happen if someone died or got divorced. “When my husband and I pass away,” Michelle Notrica said, “we put in a clause that the other family can buy us out.” Splitting a property among multiple owners may not only makes financial sense but may not even affect the amount of time spent at the property, since the typical vacation home owner only uses their second home just 39 nights a year, according to the National Association of Realtors. But beyond the financial lure, mixing friends and real estate also has its share of risk, though that may be avoided with proper planning and implementing an ownership agreement. Decisions about how to allocate time spent at the property and even determining how the property will be handled if someone dies, should be addressed before the purchase. An ownership agreement may also detail how expenses for maintaining the property and paying property taxes should be handled, as well as who will actually pay the monthly utility bills. Owners often choose to set up a separate bank account and require monthly or quarterly deposits. The agreement will also address whether disputes will be handled with a vote, an outside arbiter or end up in court. Not only do partnered owners need to make decisions on the use and upkeep of the property, but they also need to address the future of the property. “The property will be sold eventually. Someone will die or have a change financial status,” said Karen J. Radakovich, a lawyer with Frascona, Joiner, Goodman and Greenstein in Boulder, Colo., who structures three to four co-ownership agreements each month, noting that the agreement will lay out how a share will be passed along if someone dies. “Does the property pass on to their children? What if you don’t like their children?” Often owners give a right of first refusal, meaning that they have first dibs to buy the others out. Another issue that needs to be addressed is who will order, and pay for, property appraisals when it comes time to sell. Like the Liebermans and the Notricas, vacation home buyers may also consider setting up a limited liability company to buy their property. This serves to protect each individual owner’s personal liability. For example, if one owner faces a tax lien, it would not affect the house. The downside to a limited liability company is that mortgage lenders often do not want to lend to that type of ownership structure, so buyers setting up such a company are more likely to buy the home with cash. Needless to say, there is also the inclination among friends to keep the arrangement casual. “A common misconception is that the fewer owners the less likely there is to be a dispute, but the opposite tends to be true,” said Andy Sirkin, a lawyer with Sirkin Paul Associates, a San Francisco law firm that specializes in co-ownership arrangements. “They want to keep thing as light as possible, but I always say, ‘Look, you can ignore this agreement, but it is here as a back up in case the informal system doesn’t work.’ ” But hammering out the details in a written agreement is only half the battle. Whether it will be a successful partnership probably comes down to old-fashioned compatibility. Both the Liebermans and the Notricas insist that their arrangement works because they traveled together extensively and know each others habits. “Without naming names,” Ms. Lieberman said, “we have one planner in the group and the rest of us are happy with that.”

934-> When the Label Says Lagerfeld
THERE is no bigger star in fashion today than Karl Lagerfeld. When Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman learned he would be creating a new line with his name on it, they ordered it sight unseen for spring. His first runway show for the collection, on Feb. 10 in New York, has created such anticipation that Apple Computer, which has never before approached a fashion designer to provide content, plans to make a video podcast available that night as a free download on iTunes. Oprah Winfrey even arranged for Mr. Lagerfeld to squeeze in a trip to Chicago to tape an episode on Wednesday, with 10 models wearing the line. "All you need to do is put the Lagerfeld name on anything, and people line up at the door," said Sara Albrecht, the owner of Ultimo in Chicago, a pillar of designer fashion in the Midwest. "Normally when I hear about a designer doing a lower-price line, I cringe. But he has such a perception of the consumer and how they wear clothes in reality that it could really work." Therein lies the intrigue. The protean Mr. Lagerfeld, who already creates eight collections a year for Chanel and Fendi, in addition to pursuing flourishing side careers in photography and book publishing, has relied on others to complete this latest line. How will the emperor's new clothes measure up when Mr. Lagerfeld's involvement, like that of Jennifer Lopez and Sean Combs in their lines, is more creative inspiration than hands-on designer? The clothes, to be shown on the final day of New York Fashion Week, which begins tomorrow, are a collaboration between Mr. Lagerfeld and the sportswear colossus Tommy Hilfiger, who bought Mr. Lagerfeld's brand in December 2004. The clothes  two lines actually, known as Karl Lagerfeld and Lagerfeld Collection, distinguished by their price  are being designed simultaneously by Mr. Lagerfeld in Paris, his home, and by a team in New York, Mr. Hilfiger's headquarters. Mr. Lagerfeld, who is expected to arrive from Paris on Tuesday, has not yet seen many of the designs that have been made in New York. The designers there, headed by the stylist Melanie Ward, have not seen the clothes Mr. Lagerfeld has designed in Paris. The results, judging by recent visits to both studios, had the appearance of a first-born child of two parents who look nothing alike; you weren't exactly sure what traits you were getting from whom, except for the last name. Last Friday, three days after his spring haute couture show, Mr. Lagerfeld was in his studio in Paris for fittings. That day he had done a radio program on music with Hélène Arnault, had lunch with Mr. Hilfiger and company executives at his house on the Rue de l'Université and visited with his friend Princess Caroline of Monaco for two hours. That evening he was to be a guest on a French TV show. The night before he had photographed couture from different houses for Numéro magazine until 4 a.m., and the night before that he did another couture shoot for Chinese Vogue with his assistant and muse, Amanda Harlech, also until 4. Organized chaos is routine chez Lagerfeld, something of a clash with Mr. Hilfiger's more disciplined approach to time management. The clothes designed in New York will bear the label Karl Lagerfeld and are priced at $475 for a dress, $275 for jeans and $155 for a T-shirt. The Paris clothes are called Lagerfeld Collection, and prices are roughly double: $1,100 for a dress, $634 for pants and $235 for a T-shirt. "It's a bit early to say how it will work out," Mr. Lagerfeld said of how he will show the two collections. "Perhaps we'll keep the lines more separate if we don't like the mix." The long-held industry belief that lower-price collections ultimately dilute a brand's value does not seem to apply to Mr. Lagerfeld. His inexpensive designs for the fast-fashion chain H&M, offered as a one-time collection in 2004, were a litmus test. The skinny jeans and T-shirts sold furiously, and the surprise was that Mr. Lagerfeld, rather than damaging his name, managed to enhance his status as fashion's biggest star. Jim Gold, the chief executive of Bergdorf Goodman, described Mr. Lagerfeld as a visionary, "and there aren't many designers with rock star power," he said. "When the best of the best designers informs you they are going to delve into a new venture, often you're going to get behind it." The store had wanted Mr. Lagerfeld to make an appearance on March 17, when his Karl Lagerfeld line for spring, exclusive to Bergdorf's and Neiman's, goes on sale. "He's so crazed between all his collections, he couldn't commit," Mr. Gold said. On Monday, as boxes containing the first samples of the Karl Lagerfeld line began arriving in a 17th-floor photography studio in Chelsea, Ms. Ward, the creative director of the line, tried on a knit dress that had been finished in a factory in Europe. "He's such a modernist, and that's definitely my aesthetic," she said. Ms. Ward, whose fair features and pulled-back hair, framed by a wardrobe of only black, recall the luminous subjects of Vermeer paintings, had worked with Helmut Lang for 13 years, partly in a design capacity, until he left his company last year. She shares Mr. Lagerfeld's passion for art, photography and furniture design and multiple professional pursuits. The exchange of books and photographs, and long trans-Atlantic conversations, became the points of reference in design, fleshed out as concepts by Ms. Ward and a team of about 20 designers over the summer in New York and shown in pieces to Mr. Lagerfeld during visits to the city in October and December. The direction from Mr. Lagerfeld could be encapsulated as simply as this: cool, urban, modern, effortless. "He is supportive and trusting," Ms. Ward said. "He is not somebody who would instill fear in the design department. For us, Karl is fashion." In Paris the Lagerfeld Collection clothes are predominantly black, with long skinny coats with high collars and strips of black leather sewn on tulle on the cuffs and on the waists of slim black suits. The silhouettes were more linear than the past two seasons, a direction that is paralleled at least in the few pieces of Karl Lagerfeld that could be seen this week in New York. The men's collection was nearly complete in a muddy gray palette, with charcoal wool pinhead suitings, dark wool flannel madras shirts, striped sweaters, shrunken sweatshirts and jeans made of deeply dyed selvage denim from Japan in cuts simultaneously baggy in the crotch and skinny with scrunched legs. (For those who are anxious for details, the denim is coated with resin to appear slightly damp, an effect that will improve with wear.) With a strong dark edge, the comparisons to Ms. Ward's association with Helmut Lang will be inevitable; many of his devotees are expecting the Karl Lagerfeld line will serve as a replacement for Mr. Lang's basic, functional  but well-designed  clothes. Mr. Lagerfeld smiled at the suggestion. "I have a tendency toward severe clothes, but I can play," he said. "I have a large range." Mr. Lagerfeld said he wanted to have one show in Paris, where he shows Chanel ready-to-wear and couture, one in Milan for Fendi and one in New York for his own label. As with Chanel and Fendi, Mr. Lagerfeld does not venture widely beyond his role in design, and this can be maddening for corporate types. He is fond of saying he can design an Empire-waisted dress, but not an empire, though that may come across as feigned ignorance or as a shield, as Mr. Lagerfeld is well aware of the commercial side of the business. "Listen, I'm a very basic, down-to-earth person," he said. "But if I showed that publicly, people would say, 'What a bore.' " Mr. Hilfiger and Mr. Lagerfeld met for the first time in July 2004, when Mr. Lagerfeld was photographing Mr. Hilfiger for Harper's Bazaar. Mr. Hilfiger realized an opportunity to acquire Mr. Lagerfeld's small signature label, then known as Lagerfeld Gallery, and he did so for $27.5 million, according to a company filing last month. From afar Mr. Lagerfeld "seems unreachable and untouchable," said Ann Acierno, the president of Hilfiger's Lagerfeld division. "But from the moment I met him he was very open and very opinionated. He's probably the most open-minded person you'll ever meet." The company hopes to expand the Lagerfeld name to accessories like watches, handbags and shoes, and has continued negotiations with other companies while the sale of Tommy Hilfiger to a private equity group, Apax Partners, proceeds. The deal is expected to close this spring. One reason Mr. Lagerfeld was interested in selling to the Hilfiger company was the promise of better manufacturing and distribution of his clothing. It was also an opportunity to give credibility to his small signature brand, long considered by American department stores to be an afterthought. But so far this spring, the transition to Hilfiger's corporate control has been difficult as the company becomes accustomed to producing collections far more detailed and expensive than Tommy Hilfiger sportswear. Several stores that ordered the signature collection said deliveries of spring merchandise are exceptionally late. Missy Hebson, an owner of Neopolitan, a two-year-old designer store in Winnetka, Ill., said that after a trunk show last July the company could not complete many of its orders. "We kept calling them, and they said there was no more fabric," she said. "We ended up turning off a lot of customers." Spring deliveries are also late at Ultimo in Chicago and Capitol in Charlotte, N.C., and partly complete at Mix in Houston. This is a common problem after a designer company changes ownership, executives at those stores said, and the merchandise will probably sell well when it arrives. "The appeal is Karl Lagerfeld," said Evelyn Gorman, the owner of Mix. "He is one of those figures in fashion who is like what Madonna is to music. They just seem larger than life because they continue to reinvent themselves."

936-> Hiding in Plain Sight, Google Seeks More Power
THE DALLES, Ore., June 8 — On the banks of the windswept Columbia River, Google is working on a secret weapon in its quest to dominate the next generation of Internet computing. But it is hard to keep a secret when it is a computing center as big as two football fields, with twin cooling plants protruding four stories into the sky. The complex, sprawling like an information-age factory, heralds a substantial expansion of a worldwide computing network handling billions of search queries a day and a growing repertory of other Internet services. And odd as it may seem, the barren desert land surrounding the Columbia along the Oregon-Washington border — at the intersection of cheap electricity and readily accessible data networking — is the backdrop for a multibillion-dollar face-off among Google, Microsoft and Yahoo that will determine dominance in the online world in the years ahead. Microsoft and Yahoo have announced that they are building big data centers upstream in Wenatchee and Quincy, Wash., 130 miles to the north. But it is a race in which they are playing catch-up. Google remains far ahead in the global data-center race, and the scale of its complex here is evidence of its extraordinary ambition. Even before the Oregon center comes online, Google has lashed together a global network of computers — known in the industry as the Googleplex — that is a singular achievement. "Google has constructed the biggest computer in the world, and it's a hidden asset," said Danny Hillis, a supercomputing pioneer and a founder of Applied Minds, a technology consulting firm, referring to the Googleplex. The design and even the nature of the Google center in this industrial and agricultural outpost 80 miles east of Portland has been a closely guarded corporate secret. "Companies are historically sensitive about where their operational infrastructure is," acknowledged Urs Holzle, Google's senior vice president for operations. Behind the curtain of secrecy, the two buildings here — and a third that Google has a permit to build — will probably house tens of thousands of inexpensive processors and disks, held together with Velcro tape in a Google practice that makes for easy swapping of components. The cooling plants are essential because of the searing heat produced by so much computing power. The complex will tap into the region's large surplus of fiber optic networking, a legacy of the dot-com boom. The fact that Google is behind the data center, referred to locally as Project 02, has been reported in the local press. But many officials in The Dalles, including the city attorney and the city manager, said they could not comment on the project because they signed confidentiality agreements with Google last year. "No one says the 'G' word," said Diane Sherwood, executive director of the Port of Klickitat, Wash., directly across the river from The Dalles, who is not bound by such agreements. "It's a little bit like He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named in Harry Potter." Local residents are at once enthusiastic and puzzled about their affluent but secretive new neighbor, a successor to the aluminum manufacturers that once came seeking the cheap power that flows from the dams holding back the powerful Columbia. The project has created hundreds of construction jobs, caused local real estate prices to jump 40 percent and is expected to create 60 to 200 permanent jobs in a town of 12,000 people when the center opens later this year. "We're trying to organize our chamber ambassadors to have a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and they're trying to keep us all away," said Susan Huntington, executive director of The Dalles Area Chamber of Commerce. "Our two cultures aren't matching very well." Culture clashes may be an inevitable byproduct of the urgency with which the search engine war is being waged. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo are spending vast sums of capital to build out their computing capabilities to run both search engines and a variety of Web services that encompass e-mail, video and music downloads and online commerce. Microsoft stunned analysts last quarter when it announced that it would spend an unanticipated $2 billion next year, much of it in an effort to catch up with Google. Google said its own capital expenditures would run to at least $1.5 billion. Its center here, whose cost is undisclosed, shows what that money is meant to buy. Google is known to the world as a search engine, but in many ways it is foremost an effort to build a network of supercomputers, using the latest academic research, that can process more data — faster and cheaper — than its rivals. "Google wants to raise the barriers to entry by competitors by making the baseline service very expensive," said Brian Reid, a former Google executive who is now director of engineering at the Internet Systems Consortium in Redwood City, Calif. The rate at which the Google computing system has grown is as remarkable as its size. In March 2001, when the company was serving about 70 million Web pages daily, it had 8,000 computers, according to a Microsoft researcher granted anonymity to talk about a detailed tour he was given at one of Google's Silicon Valley computing centers. By 2003 the number had grown to 100,000. Today even the closest Google watchers have lost precise count of how big the system is. The best guess is that Google now has more than 450,000 servers spread over at least 25 locations around the world. The company has major operations in Ireland, and a big computing center has recently been completed in Atlanta. Connecting these centers is a high-capacity fiber optic network that the company has assembled over the last few years. Google has found that for search engines, every millisecond longer it takes to give users their results leads to lower satisfaction. So the speed of light ends up being a constraint, and the company wants to put significant processing power close to all of its users. Microsoft's Internet computing effort is currently based on 200,000 servers, and the company expects that number to grow to 800,000 by 2011 under its most aggressive forecast, according to a company document. Computer scientists and computer networking experts caution that it is impossible to compare the two companies' efforts directly. Yet it is the way in which Google has built its globally distributed network that illustrates the daunting task of its competitors in catching up. "Google is like the Borg," said Milo Medin, a computer networking expert who was a founder of the 1990's online service @Home, referring to the robotic species on "Star Trek" that was forcibly assembled from millions of species and computer components. "I know of no other carrier or enterprise that distributes applications on top of their computing resource as effectively as Google." Google's inclination to secrecy began in its days as a private company in an effort to keep its rivals from determining the profits it was making from Web search advertising. But its culture of secrecy has grown to pervade virtually all of its dealings with the news media and even its business partners. In the end, of course, corporate secrets have a short shelf life in a search engine age. Entering "Dalles Google" as a Google query turns up plenty of revealing results. But Google Earth, the satellite mapping service, like its rivals, so far shows the 30-acre parcel here quite undeveloped.

940-> A Winter of Discontent, Then Along Comes Baby
WILLIAM was born just before midnight on a Sunday in winter, and I'm not trying to be clever when I say the sky was pregnant with snow. It was. The clouds hung full and gray and heavy — ready, like me, to burst. We lived in Chicago, and that afternoon, before I realized that my water had broken and had been seeping out of me all day, I drove to the lake. My husband and I had had a huge fight about what our lives would be once we had this baby — where we'd live, whether I'd work — and I had fled in a rage. I sat in my car by the lake, staring out at the gray sky and the gray water and howled at what my life had become: seemingly subsumed by my husband's academic career, living in a city I felt no connection to, isolated and adrift without a job or clear purpose. I have sat staring out a lot of windows in my lifetime. In high school I would drive with my friend Kristin to a parking lot by the river and stay for hours, smoking and talking. In college I'd sit in my windowsill late at night, listening to Pink Floyd and wondering about people I missed. In my 20's, I discovered that my favorite part of going to parties was always coming home, where I could hide out on the fire escape, or the back-porch steps of wherever I was living, and think. ALL told I've probably spent several years of time perched in those off-stage haunts, always fumbling for some understanding of what felt like my life's inertia, always imagining that other people were out living their lives while I was just contemplating mine. What I'm embarrassed to say, because I have so much to be thankful for, is that often I would sit and think about why I had to live at all. There's my own part in all this — and then there's the history. Depression runs in my family and it's made of sturdy stock, manifesting itself in subtle and overt ways through generations. My older brother is the most obvious example. The doctor had diagnosed bipolar disorder long before the current crop of antidepressants was developed. He struggled to stay on lithium for years and eventually killed himself when he was 26 by stepping in front of an oncoming train near his apartment. So I guess you could say I come by it honestly, although that doesn't make it any easier. I've had to reconcile myself to the fact that I have within me the grain of something very dark and sad. Usually it's just annoying, like a piece of food caught in your teeth. But every so often, like that day at the lake, it grows so large I can barely contain it. That day, I had the urge to drown myself. There was the lake, marred by shards of white ice poking up as if a giant piece of china had fallen out of the sky. I was tantalized by the idea of that freezing water enveloping my warm, gravid body — a shock to a system that, nine months pregnant, had grown sluggish and worn. I hadn't contemplated drowning before. In the past I had considered pills, a gunshot to the head, jumping from a tall building. When I was in high school, I even fantasized about a carbon monoxide poisoning involving a tennis ball in the tailpipe of a Mazda Miata, a car I didn't have and had no prospect of obtaining. Fortunately, I always had enough sense not to act on my self-destructive impulses. My suicidal fantasies were always just that, and they served mainly to calm me. To know that I could die if I really wanted to was always enough to keep me from doing it. And so that day, like every other, I wiped my face and drove home. Several hours later, after it dawned on my husband and me that my water had broken, after we had driven to the hospital and the nurses had attached an IV line to my hand and placed a heart monitor through me and onto the crown of our baby's head, after the anesthesiologist failed to insert the epidural needle correctly and I felt for several hours the most wrenching physical pain of my life, William washed out of me on a tide of something I couldn't stop. When I saw him, white and glistening as he arched in the nurse's arms, relief washed over me so suddenly that I screamed, "My baby! My beautiful baby!" over and over. As everyone else in the room commenced with the business of new birth — washing and measuring and writing things on clipboards — I must have seemed possessed. But alien and animal as I'm sure I appeared as I lay there naked and screaming, I felt deeply connected to something inside myself. A life had moved through me and into the world, and for a moment I felt how I imagined I would have if I had jumped in the ice-cold lake — awake and alive. Later in our hospital room, my husband and I curled up in our beds and dimmed the lights. William was swaddled and capped and couched in a plastic bin beside us. He reminded me of the baker from the Three Men in a Tub toy I had as a kid, all soft and round and still. And then, just as we were beginning to doze off, he started to wail. I tried to breast-feed him, but he kept crying frantically. It was a long night and only the first of many, but together my husband and I got through it. The next morning the snow began to fall, slowly at first and then in fast, heavy flakes. William was asleep in his bin, but I knew the quiet wouldn't last long. He was only the size of a loaf of bread, yet my husband and I had begun to feel utterly terrorized by him. My only source of solace was what was happening outside. There was something soothing about the way the building across the courtyard and the trees in between were gradually being obliterated, disappearing in pieces as they were reckoned pure white by the season's first snow. It's been more than three years since William was born, and that day at the lake was the last time I contemplated my suicide. The urge left me instantly, without putting up much of a fight. It was as if the part of me that wanted to die simply crawled off into the woods and never came back. I sometimes wonder if it's still there and will return unannounced one day, like the crazy uncle no one wants at their wedding. But for now the deadening lull of depression has been replaced by something more like tiny pinpricks, a constant barrage of joy and pain. It's late January and we're living in Berkeley, Calif., while my husband takes a sabbatical from his job at M.I.T. There's no snow in sight. For a week I hear the DJ describe the temperature — 45 degrees — as chilly, and I want to call in to complain. I miss the seclusion of winter, that feeling of being sheltered or hidden that I've always been drawn to. Sitting with William at breakfast in front of our picture window, which opens out onto a view of San Francisco Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and a brilliant blue sky, I feel naked, like a butterfly pinned to a board. I want to slip into the pocket of my bedroom back home in Boston as a blizzard quiets the world outside. But William seems perfectly happy to forego winter, and I worry that he doesn't even remember snow. I would like to remind him of our first days together — how those hours were like a salve on the wounds from the days before, how they marked the reconciliation between his father and me as we found ourselves leaning toward each other, not away. And how they were as much the beginning of life for me as they were for the baby he was then. But I'll have to wait years, if not decades, for such conversations. And yet. Last night after his bath, William placed two brightly colored plastic cups on his feet and proclaimed them his "boots." Then he asked me to wrap him in his hooded blue towel — his "coat" — and pretend to snap it up. I DRAPED the towel over him, made dramatic snapping motions up the center of his chest, and looked at his soft, shining face. Patting him dry, I began to recite to myself all the steps between that moment and bedtime: put lotion on him, find his T-Rex pajamas, brush his little teeth, read him several books (preferably not "Thomas the Tank Engine"), tuck him into bed with kisses and hugs and expressions of much love and devotion, play "Sesame Street" CD. The list seemed endless, but before I could heave a sigh of exhaustion, he leaned into me and rested his head in the crook of my neck. My stomach tightened. I held my breath. I placed my hands on his small, perfect back. Never grow up, I wanted to say. But he spoke first. "Keep me warm, Mama," he said. "It's snowing."

943-> TODAY IN BUSINESS; BLACK'S SPENDING LIMIT IS LIFTED
Conrad M. Black's court-ordered spending limit of 50,000 Canadian dollars ($44,770) a month was replaced by a new order after he reached a pretrial agreement with Hollinger Inc., the company suing him over asset sales. Lord Black, 62, and Hollinger reached a confidential agreement allowing the judge's action, his lawyer, Earl Cherniak, said at a Toronto hearing. Judge Colin Campbell replaced the freeze order with one leaving any spending limits up to the agreement, which is not part of the court record. Lord Black led Hollinger International, the holding company, from 1991 to 2004 as chairman and chief executive. Hollinger Inc. sued Lord Black in Toronto in March 2005, claiming he diverted management and noncompetition fees to his holding companies to enrich himself and at the expense of Hollinger shareholders. The company is seeking 636 million Canadian dollars in damages. Lord Black denies any wrongdoing.

945-> AOL and ‘Survivor’ Producer Introduce Online Game
America Online and Mark Burnett, the best-known producer of reality television, have kicked off an ambitious online game called Gold Rush, which they hope will become a national sensation somewhat on a par with the one Mr. Burnett created six years ago with the “Survivor” series. The game, which started yesterday, promises to give away $100,000 in gold twice a week for seven weeks, and will culminate in a $1 million contest. Mr. Burnett said the initial online traffic “surpassed expectations,” though he did not give figures. In the game, online contestants answer pop-culture questions until they reach a 13th level. Then the first three who answer correctly receive plane tickets to a series of cities where Mr. Burnett will produce an online game show to determine the winner. Even as he introduces Gold Rush, Mr. Burnett continues to deal with criticism of his decision to divide the teams by race in the new season of “Survivor.” The first show is tonight on CBS. Mr. Burnett defended his race-based teams, which have been criticized by ethnic and community groups as a ratings stunt, as a way to increase the diversity among reality series. “I hope the people who are criticizing what we’ve done without even seeing it will be applauding us in the end,” he said in a telephone interview. This season, “Survivor” will have four teams: one black, one white, one Hispanic and one Asian-American. Mr. Burnett said the show would never go back to its former makeup, which consisted of “one or two token people of color” in a cast of 16. “I think we now need to have completely diverse casts,” he said, adding that he is comfortable with how the show, which has finished production, turned out as it unfolded over 14 episodes. While the continuing success of “Survivor” remains critical to his company, Mark Burnett Productions, Mr. Burnett said Gold Rush represented a new outlet for what is increasingly a multimedia company rather than one focused on television. Michael Wolfson, chief creative director for AOL, said Gold Rush has several additional wrinkles, including allowing players to compete against friends (using their AOL instant-message buddy lists). “The game vivifies the entire value of the Web,” Mr. Wolfson said. “The pop culture orientation ties in two of the biggest behaviors that drive the Web: gaming and interest in celebrities.” AOL, which is making the game universally available on the Web at www.goldrush.aol.com, also expects to benefit. “It’s a free service,” Mr. Burnett said, “so AOL will reach many more people who will get to sample its services. And AOL also gets exposed to different advertisers.” Indeed, Mr. Wolfson said AOL was also attracted to Mr. Burnett’s ability to strike creative deals with advertisers. Gold Rush has five main advertisers — Coca-Cola, Best Buy, Washington Mutual, Chevrolet and T-Mobile — and many of the locations for the game show parts of the contest have been chosen to tie in with those advertisers, Mr. Wolfson said, including trips to Coca-Cola’s headquarters in Atlanta and Chevrolet’s Detroit headquarters. One other partner, CBS, may also see some special benefits. Some clues for the quiz questions will be embedded in CBS shows, including “Survivor,” and that is expected to bolster viewership. In addition, if the game takes off, the finale will pit the winners of each week’s contests in a final contest that CBS has the right to televise. Mr. Burnett emphasized that the project does not represent a reduction of his company’s commitment to television productions. “There is still no better way of reaching eyeballs than network TV,” he said. But Gold Rush will join a roster from Burnett Productions that now includes other reality series, music recording and touring, boxing promotion, television syndication and a film production division. In prime-time television, Mr. Burnett produces “The Apprentice” for NBC and expects a new edition of the show, which features Donald Trump, to appear after the new year. His “Rock Star” series concluded a second summer run on CBS last night, repeating much of the success of the original with viewers much younger than CBS usually attracts. It also is the source for the music division’s album releases, which will soon be up to four, and the touring bookings, including a Las Vegas date for the winner of the latest contest. “The Contender,” a boxing reality series for ESPN, is also wrapping up a second season in the next two weeks; Mr. Burnett expects a third and will also be making more matches for the fighters in the series. And he is the early production stages of “On the Lot,” a reality series based on moviemaking (produced with Steven Spielberg). It is set to air on the Fox network this winter. Mr. Burnett also entered the syndication business last year with “The Martha Stewart Show” in daytime, and plans to offer a second show for next fall, starring the British self-help author Peter McKenna. Mr. Burnett has a second online game ready, timed to be played in conjunction with the Dreamworks film “Flushed Away,” starting in November. Recently, he bought the film rights to a coming series of children’s novels by the Irish writer Michael Scott, called “The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel.” Random House will publish the first of the series, “The Alchemyst,” in May. Mr. Burnett described the series, which centers on two teenagers in contemporary San Francisco and a 600-year-old man with dark enemies, as “The Lord of the Rings meets Harry Potter.”

946-> Faux Snow and Sexy Santas in Las Vegas
IN this season of merrymaking, the snow falls thick and fast in Las Vegas. It flurries over leaping pecan reindeer at the Bellagio, blankets “booty-shaking” holiday disco dancers downtown in Glitter Gulch. It bursts from permanent blue-sky ceilings at the Venetian, forms realistic slush in the twinkling white “Wynnter Wonderland” at the Wynn. Made of soap flakes or SnoWonder — a plastic the texture of Jell-O (just add water) — it is snow as illusion, snow as Las Vegas would have it: Not virgin. When the specter of E. coli and polonium 210 becomes too much, the time is right to consider Christmas in Las Vegas. Here, holiday revelers skate at Hard Rockafella Center (the flooded parking lot of the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino), and pirouette on a “Rockefeller-sized rink” surrealistically floating on pontoons in Lake Las Vegas in the shadow of a faux Ponte Vecchio. The spiritual heart of a Vegas Christmas is the perfectly cone-shaped, 60-foot synthetic tree in front of Caesars Palace, bedizened with 216,510 lights, “more than twice as many as Rockefeller Center” (it’s actually more than seven times). It was ceremoniously lit earlier this month by Wayne Newton, a k a Mr. Las Vegas, whose special holiday show at Harrah’s joins Donny Osmond’s Holiday Celebration and the Susan Anton Christmas Show. “There was a time you couldn’t do a holiday show, because people would come to Vegas to get away from the holidays,” Mr. Newton said, sitting beside a yuletide fire in his living room at Casa de Shenandoah, his 52-acre ranch, the flames illuminating beribboned statuary atop a gilded mantelpiece. “But the town has grown, and people bring traditions with them,” he said. The idea of Christmas lights on the Strip may seem redundant. But America’s arguably most secular city is beginning to evolve a hybrid holiday persona all its own, reflecting the contradictory nature of a metropolitan area more naughty than nice that is nevertheless the sprawling home to more than a million people. For years, hotels “practically shut down under the pretense of cleaning the carpets,” Mr. Newton said. But that was then. Now the Strip’s weatherless miles of malls are Fifth Avenue without the frostbite. “Las Vegas was always a cure for Christmas,” Dave Hickey, the city’s well-known art and cultural critic, said of the marketing juggernaut the holidays are becoming. “Now we think about what would Jesus buy?” At night, the city is bathed in an ethereal shaft of light emanating not from a star above Bethlehem but from the Luxor pyramid. Christmas in Las Vegas is largely an indoor affair in which it is possible, as this reporter did while enveloped in a nicotine cloud, to win a beaded necklace by shimmying with a clown to “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus” at the Rio. The ageless Mr. Newton begins his show at Harrah’s with “Jingle Bell Rock,” holding his audience in the palm of his bejeweled hand, his pompadour as black as night. “It’s the holidays,” he tells them, reciting the credo of Las Vegas. “So you might as well live it up, right?” At the Bellagio’s famed conservatory, thousands flock to see Las Vegas’s answer to Fifth Avenue’s windows: larger-than-life frolicking polar bears made out of some 30,000 white carnations (that’s a lot of boutonnieres). The elves are the hotel’s horticulturalists, 29 in all, who spend the year dreaming up pecan reindeers with seed hooves that leap across a pond of real ice covered by acrylic snow. Their mastery of subliminal design may be unsurpassed, even in Vegas, the Renaissance Florence of the art. The sound of sleigh bells emanates from hidden speakers, while whiffs of cinnamon and nutmeg are subtly pumped in “to evoke the nose as well as ear and eye,” said Richard Hanzo, the project manager for horticulture. The creeping one-upmanship of Las Vegas Christmas décor is widely thought to have been born here in 1998, when the then-owner Stephen A. Wynn brought in the yet-to-be-imprisoned Martha Stewart to do up a tree with antique tinsel, eliciting a warm seasonal blaze of media. The Bellagio has since been sold to MGM Grand, of course, and Mr. Wynn has moved on to the Wynn, where a tasteful sea of tiny white lights floats on silver-leafed birch trees. It is a prime specimen of a phenomenon that has gripped the nation, in which white lights are meant to convey the sort of upscale snowbound tranquillity to be found in Litchfield, Conn. But this is Las Vegas, so the effect is diffused somewhat by the distant glimmer of Judith Leiber handbags and, in the front of the hotel, a Ferrari/Maserati dealership in which $350,000 sports cars come wrapped in bows. “Christmas can get a little lost here,” said Diane Kenyon of Grand Island, Neb., who had married her husband, Jerry, at the Little Chapel of the Flowers the night before. “Too much money-mongering.” The décor is meant to draw locals and tourists, including a seasonal influx of Asian visitors. “Not everyone goes over the river and through the woods to Grandmother’s house,” said Roger Thomas, the über-guru of Wynn Design and Development. “Christmas is after all a retail celebration.” The themed Christmas attractions reflect the bipolar nature of Las Vegas, in which the risqué Strip is often at odds with families raising children in suburban subdivisions. But to visit the Fifth Annual Fantasy Teddy Bear Suite at the Four Seasons Hotel, where more than 1,000 stuffed bears are posed in child-friendly tableaus, is to know that Las Vegas can be as cloying as the rest of the country. Here, writ large, is the warm, fuzzy Vegas, the Las Vegas in which strollers triumph over high rollers (albeit in a 3,400-square-foot hotel suite that rents for $3,000 a night). At the Ethel M Chocolate Factory in nearby Henderson, three acres of cactuses are swaddled in colorful lights, the towering saguaros looking like lighted pickles. Nighttime rambles through forests of magenta yuccas invariably elicit a lust for M&M chocolate poker chips, for sale on site. As elsewhere, the motivation for this “Chocolate Wonderland” is not “Miracle on 34th Street.” “When people are happy and smiling, they buy chocolate,” said John Haugh, president of the Mars Retail Group. The quest for normalcy reaches an apotheosis in a gingerbread house competition on display in the mock Ponte Vecchio in Lake Las Vegas. Whipped up by chefs and local residents, the houses lean heavily toward the Victorian, when more realistic Vegas imagery would involve peppermint gated communities patrolled by marzipan security guards. For visitors seeking an Only-in-Fabulous-Las-Vegas kind of Christmas, however, the most dazzling and uplifting spectacles are two free Christmas shows — the Rio’s third annual “Show in the Sky Holiday Spectacular” and “Holiday Fever” on Fremont Street, in which Santas have navel jewelry and serious cleavage, and N-O-E-L is spelled S-E-X. Forget Donner. Think Vixen. Here is the Christmas carol as double entendre, in which “the ring-ting-tingling” of a “sleigh ride together with you” becomes deliciously salacious. Afterward at the Rio, a bare-chested Chippendales Santa appears on the stage, bouncing an old lady from the audience on his knee. This is Vegas, baby: there is no doubt she knows exactly what she wants for Christmas.

948-> Setback for Merrill in a Hiring Dispute
James P. Gorman, head of Morgan Stanley's retail brokerage unit, won a reversal yesterday of a court order that had barred him from trying to hire people away from his former employer, Merrill Lynch. A New York State Supreme Court judge, Emily Jane Goodman, lifted a temporary restraining order, imposed March 21, that prohibited Mr. Gorman from approaching Merrill employees. He has hired at least three senior Merrill employees since joining Morgan Stanley last month, prompting Merrill to argue that he had violated a noncompete agreement. "I find there is a lack of evidence, direct or indirect, of solicitation," Judge Goodman said at a hearing in Manhattan. "There is no evidence of breach of contract or of trade secrets." Mr. Gorman left Merrill after he was replaced as head of the brokerage unit in June. He agreed to join Morgan Stanley in August and did not start until last month as part of his separation agreement. He announced on March 16 that he had hired Richard A. Skae and Jerry Miller from Merrill for senior positions within Morgan Stanley's brokerage division. He has also hired Andrew Saperstein, according to Merrill court filings. Andrea Slattery, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement: "Merrill Lynch had no basis for filing this case and was unable to show that Mr. Gorman violated any of his obligations." At yesterday's hearing, Merrill asked the judge to extend the restraining order to April 5, when the case is scheduled to go to arbitration.

949-> Seton Hall Sees Itself in Wichita State's Climb
GREENSBORO, N.C., March 15 - Of all the unlikely meetings in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament, few would have predicted last November that Seton Hall and Wichita State would find themselves here. Each has overcome a bit of adversity on separate roads to Greensboro Coliseum. Each has that unmistakable happy-to-be-here attitude as they prepare for their first-round matchup. While Duke, seeded No. 1, uses Greensboro as its launching point for an expected run through the Atlanta Regional, this site is as much a happy ending as a beginning for No. 10-seeded Seton Hall and No. 7 Wichita State. "It's not a hump, it's a mountain to get here," Wichita Coach Mark Turgeon said after arriving Wednesday. Make that two mountains. For Seton Hall (18-11), North Carolina is perhaps an appropriate landing. The Pirates' season has been defined by visits here. On Nov. 16 in Durham, N.C., Seton Hall went to Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium and left humiliated after a 93-40 defeat in the second game of the season. "We got back to campus and our fans were laughing, making smart remarks," Pirates center Grant Billmeier said. "I think that brought us together, knowing that we had to do it together. From that day on, we took it real personal, everything we did to get here." Another visit to North Carolina turned Seton Hall's season around amid questions about Coach Louis Orr's status and the direction of the program. This time, on Jan. 25, the Pirates went to Raleigh to play North Carolina State, which was ranked No. 15 and was undefeated at home. Seton Hall left with an 83-65 victory that propelled the team on a midseason run that included victories over Syracuse and West Virginia, both ranked at the time. "We came in with a bit of confidence believing that we could beat them," guard Donald Copeland said about the game against North Carolina State. "By the way we played, it not only showed ourselves, but we showed everybody else how good we really were. We were able to hold onto that and finish off the season pretty strongly." And then there is Wichita State. The Shockers (24-8), the regular-season champion of the Missouri Valley Conference, have not played in the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1988. "It's been a tremendous climb to get where we are," Turgeon said. "We accomplished something this year that we haven't done in 23 years: we won a league championship. And I don't know what's going to happen in this tournament, but I wouldn't trade that day for anything, because our city was so excited. This is a great time to be a Wichita State fan. This is just icing on the cake being here, and hopefully we can perform well." Turgeon, who played under Larry Brown at Kansas and was an assistant coach when the Jayhawks won the N.C.A.A. title in 1988, arrived in Wichita in 2000 to preside over the resurrection of the program. The glory years of the 1980's, when Antoine Carr and Xavier McDaniel played there, were long gone by the 1990's, when the program produced just two winning records and failed to make the N.C.A.A. tournament or even the National Invitation Tournament. Under Turgeon, Wichita State has gone to the N.I.T. the last three seasons. Turgeon said he believed the Missouri Valley Conference should apologize to no one for receiving four spots in the tournament field, including Northern Iowa, Southern Illinois and Bradley. That is the same number as the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big 12. "The reason we have four teams in is because the Big 12 is down a little bit this year," Turgeon said. "Will it be down next year? Probably not. They'll be back to six, seven teams. The timing was right for us. "I do think 28 of the 34 at large went to the 'B.C.S.' schools. What we don't want to happen is, we don't want to have a B.C.S. national championship and then the rest of us. And the way that everybody was talking is that that's what they want," Turgeon said, noting the heated debate among commentators and disgruntled followers of Bowl Championship Series colleges that did not make the N.C.A.A. field. "And that's what happened in football," Turgeon said. "We don't want that. We want the Winthrops and the Wichita States and teams like that to be a part of it because that's what America loves and that's what they enjoy."

950-> Q & A; When a Building Goes Condo
Does a Rent-Regulated Tenant Have the Right to Remain? Q. I think my building in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan is going condo. I am rent-stabilized, and have been for more than 10 years. What is the process for a tenant to keep a rent-stabilized apartment when a building goes condo? Also, does a rent-stabilized tenant have any right to buy his or her property at a reduced price? Can tenants come together and negotiate for lower prices? Robert Silvera, Manhattan. A. Lucas A. Ferrara, a Manhattan lawyer and editor of Landlord-Tenant Monthly, a publication for lawyers, said that in a noneviction plan conversion, the most common type of conversion in New York, rent-regulated tenants do not have to do anything to retain the right to remain in their apartments. In eviction-plan conversions, Mr. Ferrara said, tenants generally can be evicted three years after the plan is declared effective. But, he said, rent-regulated tenants 62 and older, as well as disabled tenants, have a right to remain in their apartments, provided they notify the sponsor of their status on a form included in the offering plan. And while tenants generally do not have a right to buy their apartments at a reduced price, Mr. Ferrara said, tenants in New York City have the exclusive right to buy their apartments for 90 days after the plan has been accepted for filing by the state attorney general. "During this time period, it is quite common for tenants to join together for the purpose of negotiating more favorable terms and conditions," he said, "such as lower prices for their respective apartments."

951-> Russia and Ukraine Reach Compromise on Natural Gas
KIEV, Ukraine, Jan. 4 - Ukraine and Russia settled their dispute over the price of natural gas Wednesday with a deal that allowed both countries to save face, although Ukraine walked away with cheaper prices than most of Russia's other gas customers. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia paid a stiff political price as his country's natural gas company, Gazprom, backpedaled on ultimatums of a gas embargo against Ukraine under pressure from European leaders who questioned the Kremlin's reliability as an energy provider. But Mr. Putin, speaking at his dacha outside Moscow, sought to calm those fears, calling the settlement a guarantee of energy supplies to Europe. "I think undoubtedly this success will have a positive effect on the whole sphere of Russian-Ukrainian relations," Mr. Putin said. "We can work not just with each other but also together in the market of third countries." Ukraine's gas bill will about double next year, and the solution entangles Kiev in a complicated deal that surrenders control over its natural gas imports to an offshore company with a shady history even by post-Soviet standards. "I have nothing consolatory to say," Ukraine's prime minister, Yury I. Yekhanurov, said at a news conference here. "Ukraine will have to pay more." The countries settled the argument by naming RosUkrEnergo, a company now owned 50 percent by Gazprom and 50 percent by an Austrian-based shell company with unknown beneficiaries, as the exclusive supplier of natural gas to Ukraine. Under the deal, Russia will sell natural gas to this intermediary at the price it had demanded from Ukraine, $230 per 1,000 cubic meters, while Ukraine will buy gas from that company for $95. Ukraine has been paying $50 per 1,000 cubic meters. The company will balance out the price at $95 by selling Ukraine less of the expensive Russian natural gas and a greater volume of lower priced gas from Central Asia. At the center of the deal is an energy trading company that for a decade, under various names, has shipped natural gas to Ukraine from Central Asia, exploiting the price differentials in former Soviet markets and making billions of dollars in profits for its unnamed owners. Exactly who will benefit financially from the new arrangement is obscured by the mysterious nature of RosUkrEnergo, despite vague promises by Ukrainian officials that the company will be reformed in the months ahead to fulfill its new role. 'We have reached an agreement that is mutually beneficial and therefore mutually acceptable," Oleksiy Ivchenko, the director of Ukraine's natural gas company, Naftogaz, said in Moscow after signing the agreement. The deal, Mr. Ivchenko said, will guarantee Ukraine's domestic supply as well as the transshipment of Russian gas to other European countries, which along with world energy markets were jittery when their supply was put in doubt by the Russian-Ukrainian dispute. Crude oil prices dipped slightly on the latest news. The companies also agreed on a 47 percent increase, to $1.60 per 1,000 cubic meters, in the price Ukraine charges Russia for shipping gas across its territory to Europe. Whatever extra revenue Gazprom might earn through the deal may be offset in the long term by a huge dose of skepticism over its expansion plans in Western Europe created by the failed Russian gas embargo. Western European countries, Moscow's primary natural gas customers, hailed the settlement but said Wednesday that they would seek to diversify their sources of energy. The disruption in the flow of natural gas from fields in the Siberia and Central Asia was the first in the four decades since the Soviet Union began exporting natural gas to Western Europe, according to Martin Bartenstein, the economy minister of Austria, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union. Russian gas will remain "the backbone of European energy supplies, but certainly we will have to learn the lesson of what has happened in the last few days," Mr. Bartenstein was quoted by Reuters as saying. Mr. Yekhanurov, the Ukrainian prime minister, said the higher prices would impel industry in his country to become more energy efficient, perhaps heightening the pace of modernization at Soviet-era factories. But he added that the immediate consequence of the price rise could be bankruptcies at some chemical and metallurgical plants. Those two energy-intensive industries form the core of Ukraine's exports. "I will not say who won or who lost," Mr. Yekhanurov said. "The people of Ukraine and Russia won. Europe won because it will calmly receive gas. Common sense won." Yet critics have darkly commented on the murky past of the company at the center of the deal. In the 1990's it snatched the most lucrative bits of Ukraine's gas market for itself and won exclusive, and profitable, rights to transship gas over Gazprom's domestic pipeline system. Operating under various names, it was one of many subsidiaries, daughter companies and joint ventures that tapped into the then poorly audited revenue flows of Gazprom, analysts who follow the company say. When Mr. Putin brought new management to Gazprom, many of the schemes dried up. But the Ukrainian middlemen stayed in business. Ukraine's national security service investigated RosUkrEnergo last summer for allegations of ties to organized crime. The security agency's former director, Oleksandr Turchinov, has told the Ukrainian news media that he pressed President Viktor A. Yushchenko to prosecute but instead was removed from his job. Former executives at Gazprom and Naftogaz have held interests in RosUkrEnergo, according to Jérôme Guillet, a Paris-based banker and authority on Gazprom's business practices. "The names change every year, but it's always been the same mechanism," he said in a telephone interview. "You have a huge trade with hundreds of millions of dollars being captured by a small number of people." Ukraine's national security adviser, Anatoly K. Kinakh, said in an interview that Naftogaz would assume a 50 percent ownership of RosUkrEnergo as part of the agreement. Some Ukrainian officials appeared almost giddy after staring down Russia in the dispute, but Grigory Nemyrya, an adviser to former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko, said the deal failed to address widespread corruption in the natural gas business in the former Soviet republics.

953-> Art in Review; Helen Mirra
Break Camp Peter Freeman Inc. 560 Broadway, at Prince Street Through Jan. 13 Helen Mirra's second solo show at this gallery (and fourth in New York) has a lovely serenity, but it emanates from a brand of Post-Minimalism that is entirely too twee. The low-lying sculptures here were made by cutting up and assembling parts of wood pallets. They are not as interesting as an uncut pallet, its structure strikingly accented with paint, that Ms. Mirra exhibited with Mr. Freeman at Art Basel Miami Beach two weeks ago. Cut and downsized and often holding clusters of pine cones, the works in the gallery show seem precious and also familiar. They might have been made by Carl Andre, Richard Tuttle, Richard Nonas or Joel Shapiro in the early 1970s, and even then might have looked fussy. Two delicate, ribbonlike wall pieces, on which Ms. Mirra has typed entries from the index of a book on deer hunting, provide the exhibition with intimations of mortality, the handling of guns and the butchering of dead animals. That adds a certain gritty realism to the proceedings that seems in keeping with the pallets' original workaday function and their often hutlike structures, but it doesn't entirely eliminate the suspicion that while Ms. Mirra has a very engaging sensibility, she could aim much higher.

954-> Bleah Hawaii
In sunshine or moonlight, on fragrant mountain or sandy beach, Hawaii wages a gentle assault on the senses that few visitors can resist or adequately describe. When songwriters try, it is usually with a flood of adjectives, summoning heavenly flowers, lovely hula hands and sweet, sweet, sweet lullabies. Words like putrid, disgusting and deadly are hard to find in the Hawaiian songbook. But recent developments threaten to change that, most notably the diversion of 48 million gallons of raw sewage last month from a broken sewer line into the Ala Wai Canal in Waikiki. That's nearly five times the amount of oil spilled by the Exxon Valdez. The contamination spread to a boat harbor and to Waikiki Beach, which was closed for days. Swimmers were told not even to dip their toes in until sunshine and flushing tides lowered the bacteria count. The catastrophe was sickening, and not only for hotel managers, travel agents and dejected honeymooners. Not long after the pipe burst on March 24, a healthy 34-year-old man fell into the harbor. Six days later he was dead of septic shock. The proximate cause of the crisis was a rainy spell of biblical proportions -- more than 40 days and 40 nights -- that overwhelmed the state. But there has been little sympathy to spare for government officials, who are reaping the results of years of infrastructure neglect. Old warnings about Honolulu's sewer system have surfaced, like a consultant's report in 2004 that said the corroded main in Waikiki was in "extremely critical" need of repairs and a backup system, which was never built. Hawaii is now frantically doing cleanup, repairs and post-crisis analysis. It is also learning the hard way that preventive maintenance is better than an emergency ad campaign to keep tourists coming, and that a clean, healthy environment is the bedrock on which the state's biggest industry rests. "With all this loveliness," say the words to "Blue Hawaii," "there should be love." There should be accountability, too. And adequate attention to infrastructure.

955-> Art in Review; Cheyney Thompson
Quelques Aspects de l'Art Bourgeois: La Non-Intervention Andrew Kreps 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea Through Jan. 6 Cheyney Thompson's second New York gallery show is not as dazzling as his debut at this gallery two years ago, when he created a sense of multiple, detonated perspectives by covering the walls with small trompe l'oeil paintings of cobbled-together brick and wood. It was something like what they said of Duchamp's "Nude Descending a Staircase": an explosion in a shingle factory. Plunked into the center of this was a barricade/bunker made of sandbags and sheets of faux, cast-plastic wood. It was not clear if we were set for revolution, target practice or street repair. This show, whose title translates as "Certain Aspects of Bourgeois Art: Nonintervention," is drier, but it explores further and perhaps more clearly the tensions between street and studio, skill and skepticism, painting and nonpainting, and touches on mixed feelings about display and the market. It has a similar elegance. This exhibition acknowledges the gallery's base-line functions as a place to show, sell and store art. It centers on four large, pale representational paintings of pretty much nothing; they are based on smudged and wrinkled paper that was put through a photocopier numerous times, then blown up and carefully rendered in shades of gray and cream. Sometimes they suggest a close-up of surf or rumpled fabrics. They bring to mind Warhol's Shadow Paintings or something by Rudolf Stingel, until you get close enough to see the paint-by-fractions care with which they were executed. Meanwhile, "Tables Displaying Properties of an Image" spells out the paintings' condition: the light to dark palette and availability for purchase. The eight tables are of the lightweight folding variety favored by street vendors; they extend from the front of the gallery to the storage space in back, evoking a train of flatbed railroad cars and a path from light to dark. The 16 panels of their bisected tops are literally photographs of nothing that progress from white to nearly black, paralleling the tones of the paintings. On view in different parts of the gallery are five constellations of five framed photographic offset lithographs, each showing the storage shelves visible in the back space. Each image is a slightly different tone of gray (blue, green, mauve) and shows the contents of the shelves in slightly different arrangements, as they might change during a workday -- along with the daylight itself. Mr. Thompson is an artist with radical intent who can't help but make beautiful objects; this gives his work a clarity and restraint that softens, and even conventionalizes, the harshness of his thought. His dedication to painting combined with his refusal to follow it blindly is very compelling, but his distrust of it needs to become as explicit in his canvases as it is in the contexts he creates for them.

956-> Russia Gas Line Explosions Scare Europe
MOSCOW, Jan. 25 - Saboteurs who bombed two natural gas pipelines high in the Caucasus Mountains this week, by one estimate sending a gas fireball nearly 600 feet into the sky, paralyzed Georgia and sent a message straight to Western Europe, which depends on Russian natural gas. The Russian authorities are calling the strike a terrorist attack, suggesting that groups in or near the rebellious Chechnya region are aiming attacks at the country's energy distribution system. That would be bad news for Western Europe, which gets a quarter of its natural gas from Russia. European leaders were already jittery after supplies were disrupted twice this month, once during a Russian dispute with Ukraine -- ostensibly over prices -- and later when extremely low temperatures caused demand in Russia to surge. Georgian officials, upset over what they contended were unexplained delays in fixing the sabotaged pipeline, cautioned that Europe should look at their unheated capital, Tbilisi, before becoming more reliant on Russia. "The lesson that all of Europe should draw is the importance of alternative corridors of energy and of not being dependent on one source of energy, especially from a country such as Russia," George Arveladze, presidential chief of staff in Georgia, said Tuesday in an interview. Georgia and another former Soviet republic, Armenia, draw gas from the damaged pipelines. All this is proving an embarrassment for the Kremlin, because the problems have coincided with Russia's turn in the presidency of the Group of 8 industrial countries and Russia's pushing a theme of energy security. Still, Russia's Gazprom natural gas monopoly has yet to sign a detailed supply contract with the Ukrainian national gas company as foreseen in the Jan. 4 settlement of the price dispute, and talks seem to be adrift. A signing ceremony first scheduled for Saturday was delayed again Wednesday. The entire agreement seemed to be adrift this week in a growing din of criticism of the deal. Gazprom officials have repeatedly insisted that supplies are reliable at current levels and can easily be increased from vast Arctic reserves to meet growing demand in Western Europe, where the company expects to increase its market share to 38 percent by 2020 from 26 percent today. Chechen separatists and Islamist terrorist groups have articulated a policy of hitting objects important to Russia's economy, and the country's energy infrastructure has been sabotaged before, though without causing big disruptions. Last summer the Federal Security Service, a successor agency of the Soviet-era K.G.B., said it had arrested 11 suspects in what it called a terrorist attack on a gas pipeline in Tatarstan, a Muslim region of Russia east of Moscow. A spokesman linked that attack to separatist movements in the North Caucasus, the area of southern Russia that includes Chechnya as well as North Ossetia, where the bombing on Sunday took place. Last year, saboteurs struck gas pipelines in Dagestan, also in the North Caucasus. Two years ago a bombing shut operations for several days along the same mountain route to Georgia that was hit Sunday. Other separatist conflicts have been simmering nearby. South Ossetia, a pro-Russian and Orthodox Christian enclave in Georgia, has carried out a low-level insurgency against Georgian authorities for a decade. The attacks occurred not far from the South Ossetian border. The latest strike hit a main and a reserve pipeline, running on opposite banks of the headwaters of the Terek River, Vladimir A. Ivanov, a spokesman for a regional branch of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, said in a telephone interview. The explosions, before dawn, set fire to residual gas in a reserve pipeline and punctured but did not ignite the active pipeline, he said. Whoever placed the bombs probably waded in the dark across the shallow river from a nearby military highway, he said. Alerted by falling pressures, pipeline workers shut valves about two miles from the blast site, Mr. Ivanov said. Repairs were delayed Tuesday by what Gazprom said was residual gas in a pipeline that prevented welding for fear of another explosion. The work was also slowed by strong winds and subzero temperatures, Gazprom said. On Wednesday, Gazprom said the residual gas was gone, but repairs had not yet been completed. Georgian officials, who have darkly hinted that Russia was behind the bombing, with the intention of undermining the economy of a pro-Western former Soviet state, dismissed Gazprom's explanation.

957-> Art in Review; November
Harris Lieberman 89 Vandam Street, between Greenwich and Hudson Through Jan. 6 Jeffrey Uslip, a curator at LAXart in Los Angeles, put together this obliquely topical group exhibition, which includes several young artists based on the West Coast. In a Babelish moment in art, language, scrambled and obscured, is one of the themes here. Shana Lutker creates thick books from what look like Rorschach blots; Kara Tanaka, in a listening-booth sculpture, transmutes historical conversations into a melancholic music. Jason Dungan's collages splice together newspaper accounts of ritual suicides with photographs of landscapes that, in the context, suggest crime scenes. Landscape-as-poisoned-terrain is implied in Robert Zungu's installation of taxidermied seagulls scattered under a cutout of a smiling Nancy Reagan, in an explosive assemblage painting by Kianja Strobert and -- more benignly -- in Yasue Maetake's balletic video "Sea of Fertility," which documents a series of pollen-and-spoor-dispensing performances. Performance is also the central, though static, element in a sculpture-and-photograph piece by Marco Rios, and in Jason Keller's surreal images of a parachutist in distress. Surrealism is, of course, art's 21st-century Esperanto. It is here, in Matt Lucero's biomorphic ceramics, in a found-object folk crucifix by Einar and Jamex De La Torre, in Julio Cesar Morales's silhouette of pushcart vendors in Tijuana and in Saul Alvarez's photograph, which is less flippant and more interesting than its title, unprintable here, might suggest. Of course, it's impossible to draw hard conclusions from one-piece-per-artist group shows like this one. But I'm thinking that Mr. Alvarez and more than a few of his young colleagues have a lot more to say to us. HOLLAND COTTER

958-> Evicted, Newark’s Mayor Finds Another Blighted Street
NEWARK, Nov. 19 — The magenta “praise the Lord” throw pillows: trash. The Black Santa holiday tie: a keeper. The lime-green dress shirt: “It’s not mayoral,” said an aide with unconcealed disdain. Into the charity pile it went. On Mayor Cory A. Booker’s final night at his bachelor-pad apartment in Brick Towers last Monday, there were important sartorial decisions to be made before the movers arrived. After living in one of the city’s most notoriously troubled buildings — where heat, hot water and elevator service were often in short supply — since 1998, Mr. Booker and two dozen other holdouts were being evicted to make way for the bulldozers. It was a bittersweet moment for Mr. Booker, who earned himself a national reputation, cemented in an Oscar-nominated documentary, as a crusading would-be mayor who took on a negligent landlord and a vindictive City Hall by living alongside some of Newark’s most embattled tenants. In the end, Mr. Booker and his fellow renters agreed to decamp after Newark’s Housing Authority promised to build a gentler, kinder Brick Towers to replace the forbidding twin slabs that had become magnets for drugs, violence and despair. The holdouts were also given first dibs in the new quarters. “I like to tell people I got my undergrad degree from Stanford, but I got my Ph.D. in Newark, and some of my best professors were here in Brick Towers,” Mayor Booker said, as he rode down the blackness of an unlighted elevator for the last time. “When I walked in here, I was so innocent. I had no idea where life would take me.” Life took him July 1 to a walnut-paneled office in City Hall overseeing a municipal work force of 4,000, but neither a fancy title nor a security detail nor his $130,721 salary has persuaded Mr. Booker to give up his self-sacrificial — some would say self-aggrandizing — ways. Last week, after a search of some of the most menacing corners of this down-and-out city, Mayor Booker began unpacking his Hugo Boss and Custom House suits in his new apartment on Hawthorne Avenue. It is a $1,200-a-month three-bedroom apartment in a building on a browbeaten stretch of Newark’s South Ward, where boarded-up homes outnumber inhabited ones and crack dealers hawk their product outside an elementary school. There goes the neighborhood. Again. A decade ago, when Mr. Booker, fresh from Yale Law School, was a headstrong council member, he bedded down beside a drug-drenched housing complex. Excrement and trash rained on his tent, hundreds of supporters joined his cause and the news cameras were quick to follow. An embarrassed mayor beefed up the police presence, the dealers moved shop and Councilman Booker had himself a nationally televised victory. The next summer, Mr. Booker lived in an R.V. that traveled from one crime hot spot to the next. “It’s all a romantic fantasy,” said Amiri Baraka, the poet and longtime Newark resident who has been critical of Mr. Booker, seeing him as a patronizing outsider. “It’s politician’s hooey, part of the myth-making.” Like some other doubters, Mr. Baraka — who lives six blocks from the mayor’s new home on Hawthorne — questioned whether Mr. Booker had truly been living in Brick Towers or just keeping his things there: “All I can say is, it’s a good story, but I don’t believe it.” Mr. Booker acknowledges that in the past he has slept — and showered — at friends’ places from time to time, but he and many of the former Brick residents say that the mayor, indeed, spent more nights there than not. Asked about those who view his choice of residence these past eight years as a politically minded stunt, the mayor rolled his eyes. “Stunts are usually short-term,” he said. “They usually don’t last three winters without heat and hot water.” Indeed, back in 1981, Mayor Jane M. Byrne of Chicago moved into the notorious Cabrini Green housing project to make a statement about crime; she left after three weeks when the violence quickly dropped, but said she would return sporadically. Mr. Booker, on the other hand, had been living for years in a roomy two-bedroom apartment on the 16th floor of Brick Towers with glittery Manhattan views in the distance and glimpses of deprivation in the foreground. Once a model of middle-class stability, Brick was by then well on its way to wretchedness. The privately owned complex, which housed many residents who received federal housing aid, was taken over by the Department of Housing and Urban Development twice in the 1990s and then sold to the city’s Housing Authority for a dollar in 2002. By the time Mr. Booker, who paid $575 a month in rent, moved in, many of the 300 units were empty. “The squatters and the kids just started tearing up the building, and the landlord didn’t do anything about it,” said Elizabeth Brown, a 24-year resident and one of the last to leave. “In the winter, when the heat and hot water went out, it was pure hell.” These days, Mr. Booker’s speeches are flecked with references to people he encountered during his tenure at Brick Towers: T-Bone, the drug dealer who threatened his life but later sobbed as he asked Mr. Booker for help going straight; Wassan Miller, the teenager felled by gunfire who died in his arms; and the 12-year-old girl who was excelling in math until her belly started showing signs of motherhood. Then there is Virginia Jones, 78 years old, who has been the tenants’ association president for nearly all of the 36 years she has lived in Brick Towers. Miss Jones, as Mr. Booker calls her, is frequently quoted by the mayor, who credits her salty, no-nonsense bits of wisdom with helping him weather the rough days of his first, unsuccessful mayoral campaign and the nights he had to climb 16 flights. For Miss Jones, a former correction officer who now works as a clerk in the Essex County prosecutor’s office, her life at Brick was particularly nightmarish: In 1980, her 37-year-old son, Charles, just back from a stint in the Air Force, was shot and killed by robbers in the building’s lobby while she was working as a security guard in another part of the complex. Stubborn and self-assured, Miss Jones could have relocated to a safer area but said she stayed at Brick Towers as a matter of principle, even after people she claims were city workers disabled the boilers and vandalized the community rooms that once provided computer instruction and other wholesome distractions to local children. “I didn’t want them to think they were going to get away with it,” she said, sitting in the three-bedroom town house that will be her home until the Housing Authority opens the new Brick Towers. Miss Jones, Mr. Booker and the other tenants agreed to leave only after several lawsuits and a federal investigation — which earned the owner prison time for tax evasion — led to a plan to replace the complex with a collection of richly appointed buildings that, on paper at least, would look at home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. This transformation is part of the larger move by Newark’s Housing Authority, which manages 8,800 units, to trade nearly all the city’s high-rise projects for town house-style developments, following a national trend in public housing. Modia Butler, the Housing Authority chairman, said the new Brick Towers would have grand public spaces, a farmer’s market and a mix of 250 condominiums and rental apartments. When it is completed in 2008, tenants who stayed until the end will have the right to move back in; some of the units will be rented at market rates, and others will be subsidized. Mr. Booker has no plans to return. Convinced that his very presence can have catalytic effects on a neighborhood, he said he would spend a year or so on Hawthorne Avenue. His new home, on the top floor of a three-unit building, looks out onto an elementary school. Eventually, he said, he would like to build his own house, ideally in another trouble spot. “I want to live in a place where I can leverage myself in the best possible way, where I can be part of the struggle for deeper justice in an urban community,” he said. For his security staff, Mr. Booker’s living arrangements are especially unnerving. The mayor, who has received death threats in the past, has a round-the-clock retinue of bodyguards who vetoed several prospective homes, saying they would have exposed him to unacceptable levels of danger. Mr. Booker’s parents find his housing choices a bit harrowing, too. “I always tell Cory he keeps me humble because he keeps me on my knees praying,” his mother, Carolyn, said in a telephone interview from her home in North Carolina. “If I had my druthers I would see him living in a place that complements him being mayor of the city.” Down on Hawthorne Avenue, Elario Rodriguez, who owns New 8 Brothers Supermarket with his small army of siblings, was ecstatic to learn the mayor was moving in two doors down. He looked heavenward and said, “Now I finally have some protection.” Craig C. Browne, the principal of Hawthorne Avenue Elementary School, whose office looks out on Mr. Booker’s apartment, said he had already noticed a difference since the mayor’s moving truck arrived on Wednesday with a police escort: the young men who usually clot the corners up and down the avenue had suddenly vanished. By Friday, the news had yet to reach Manuela Carvalho, whose company, All Jersey Realty, is desperately trying to sell seven houses within a few blocks of Mr. Booker’s building, and who said many frustrated owners had boarded up new homes rather than risk their sitting empty and vulnerable to squatters. “We had an open house three weeks ago for a beautiful year-old house, and no one even came,” she said glumly. “It’s really become a no-go area for home buyers.” When she was told the mayor had arrived in the neighborhood, Ms. Carvalho’s mood changed to one that might be described as giddy. She said she could imagine advertising her unsold homes with tag lines like “Live near the mayor” or “If it’s good enough for the mayor ...” Then she had another idea: Maybe she would just buy one or more of the properties on her own as an investment.

960-> Birth, Controlled
I have abundant sympathy for women who find elective induction tempting (Tina Cassidy, March 26). I have four children, all of them born at least six days after their due dates. On my most recent due date, I cried off and on all day. In that time-warped state, I have changed my answering machine announcement to a snarling, "No, I haven't had the baby yet." I have contemplated slugging my mother as she intoned, "When the apple is ripe, it falls from the tree." And yet I cannot favor elective induction. Certainly late pregnancy can be difficult and uncomfortable. But as I reminded myself hourly in the days before my youngest child's arrival, it is a good metaphor for motherhood and indeed for life. You prepare the best you can, yet ultimately, you're not in control. Get used to it. Jamie Mahurin Smith Normal, Ill.

962-> Focusing on Opinions, Slipping on Some Facts
Politics often calls upon more opinion and generalization than factual claims that can be disproved. So it went for the first 25 minutes of last night’s debate between Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Republican challenger, John Spencer. In fact, on the question hanging over the race, and the first to arise in the debate  will Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, run for president in 2008?  there is no provable answer, though it would be hard to find a politically minded American without an opinion. But as the debate in Rochester wore on, Mr. Spencer  the more heated, less rehearsed of the two  made questionable statements on a number of issues, including the fruits of the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping, North Korea’s nuclear program and Mrs. Clinton’s voting record on security matters. At one point, he said that he opposes a proposed 2,000-mile fence along the Mexican border, contradicting his campaign Web site, and added, “I haven’t looked at my Web site in about six months.” Mrs. Clinton had her own slips, notably in insisting that her failed 1993 health care plan would not have been government-run. But with a lead of about 30 points in voter surveys, she has the luxury of sticking to her script, and she is adept at that. More often it was Mr. Spencer making the doubtful claims. He derided a deal made in 1994 by the Clinton administration to halt North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. Under that pact, he said, Kim Jong Il, the North Korean dictator, “was taking care of his military, starving his people and making plutonium.” But intelligence officials say that for the eight years that the deal stood, North Korea did not process plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. It violated the agreement by enriching uranium  another element that can make the core of an atomic bomb  though without much success. The atomic bomb North Korea detonated on Oct. 8 used plutonium, United States government officials say, that was processed either before the 1994 agreement, or since the agreement collapsed. Mr. Spencer defended the Bush administration’s program of wiretapping some communications of people within the United States without first obtaining warrants, and said Mrs. Clinton had voted against it. In fact, there has been no vote, in part because the administration says it does not need Congressional authority. Mrs. Clinton has said that she would vote to give the president limited authority for warrantless wiretaps. The wiretapping program, Mr. Spencer said, helped catch terrorists “out in Lackawanna,” near Buffalo. He was apparently referring to a group of Arab-American men who were convicted of training at a Qaeda camp in Afghanistan before the Sept. 11 attacks. But there has been no suggestion from the government that domestic eavesdropping without warrants played a role in that case. Mr. Spencer said Mrs. Clinton had voted against the USA Patriot Act, which gave the government new law enforcement powers. She was among the Democrats who blocked a vote last December, when Republicans wanted a stronger version of the law, but she did not actually vote against it. In fact, Mrs. Clinton voted for the original law in 2001, and voted for its renewal this year, after a compromise was reached. Mr. Spencer also said Mrs. Clinton had voted against relief from the alternative minimum tax for middle-class families. Like nearly all Senate Democrats, she did vote this year against a two-year extension of tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy, and that bill also postponed for one year the application of the alternative minimum tax to millions of people. But she and other Democrats have fought to roll back the alternative minimum tax, which was originally meant to affect only the wealthy but is increasingly affecting the middle class. Republican leaders want to do so only as part of a deal to make permanent the broader 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Late in the debate, Mrs. Clinton was asked if she still favored the kind of government-run health care she proposed in 1993. She countered that that plan “is not government-run.” But under the 1993 proposal, the federal government would have required employers to buy health insurance, the government would have established health care cooperatives for buying insurance, and the government would have regulated premiums. As for Mrs. Clinton’s presidential aims, Mr. Spencer said that of the two candidates, only he intended to serve a full six-year term. Mrs. Clinton replied, “I don’t know what the future holds and I have no decision ready to be made or even waiting in the wings.” People may believe or disbelieve her, but only one person knows for certain whether she is telling the truth.

966-> At a Chelsea Museum, New Music Gets a Setting to Match
There is something about hearing new music amid new paintings in a bright, airy and spacious contemporary-art museum that fosters receptivity to both music and art. This is one of the attractions of Second Helpings, the contemporary-music series presented by the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble at the Chelsea Museum of Art on West 22nd Street. A small but eager audience attended the final program in this season's series, a program on Saturday afternoon offering four chamber works, including two premieres. With three of the four composers on hand to introduce their pieces and with Joan Tower, the ensemble's composer in residence, serving as an enthusiastic host, the atmosphere could not have been more conducive to hearing new music. The composer Gabriela Lena Frank was ill, so the cellist Myron Lutzke introduced "Four Pre-Inca Sketches," a 10-minute duo for cello and flute, in its premiere. Ms. Frank, based in San Francisco, has long been fascinated with pre-Columbian art. In one captivating section of this ruminative yet organic work, murky modal oscillating cello riffs and spiraling melodic flights on the flute evoke an image the composer saw on an ancient textile in a museum in Peru, showing birdlike human figures suspended weightlessly. Mr. Lutzke and the flutist Elizabeth Mann gave an engrossing performance. The other premiere was "The Instant Gathers," a piano trio by the composer and pianist Joan Panetti, who has been on the Yale faculty for 30 years. Ms. Panetti said that the title was taken from a Theodore Roethke poem in which the poet warns us that time, the instant, is passing so we had best make the most of it. She has put the poet's advice to good use in this eventful, intense yet impressively economical 13-minute, three-movement work. Its harmonic language deftly blends tonally grounded and atonal elements. If you detect dashes of Impressionism or, in the surging toccatalike finale, flourishes that have the brooding sensibility of modern-day Janacek, the notes are so acutely chosen that Ms. Panetti's language seems fresh, personal and full of surprises. The composer played the elaborate piano part, joined by Daire FitzGerald and Mayuki Fukuhara. Though Barbara White's "Five Elements" for piano quintet (2003) was inspired by her study of Chinese philosophy, what grabs you is her alert ear for colors and her inventive writing for the instruments, notably her use of a rectangular wood block to depress clusters of piano keys, releasing the dampers and allowing the strings to resonate when other notes are struck. I even enjoyed "The High and the Mighty" (2000), a duo for piccolo and piano (played by Ms. Mann and the pianist Margaret Kampmeier), Michael Daugherty's gimmicky impish homage to the glamor days of airplane travel. Wistfully melodic passages that could be music for a soothing fly-the-skies commercial segue into bursts of bossa nova. That the piece has been performed extensively makes sense: it was jointly commissioned by 25 piccolo players.

967-> Executive Loses Case on Trading
Another telecom titan has tumbled. In one of the last of the major conflict-of-interest cases that rocked Wall Street nearly four years ago, a New York State judge has found that the former chief executive of McLeodUSA, a once highflying telecommunications company that has filed for bankruptcy twice since 2002, is liable for improper trading of hot new stock offerings during the technology stock boom. Eliot Spitzer, the New York attorney general, sued the executive, Clark E. McLeod, and four other high-profile telecommunications executives in 2002, contending that they had steered investment banking business to Salomon Smith Barney in exchange for inflated ratings on their companies' stocks and hot new shares of other companies. Mr. McLeod netted $9.96 million in profits on 34 stock allocations from 1997 to 2000, the court filings said. Salomon Smith Barney received more than $77 million in underwriting fees from McLeodUSA. In a decision issued Thursday, Justice Richard B. Lowe III of New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan wrote that Mr. McLeod's acceptance of initial public offering shares from the same brokerage firm that his company used as an investment banker, a practice known as spinning, was "a sophisticated form of bribery." He also found that because Mr. McLeod did not disclose his hot-stock grants and the profits generated by them, he misled both the investing public and his own company's board. "We are gratified that New York courts have recognized that undisclosed stock spinning is illegal and deceives the public," Mr. Spitzer said in a statement. "This decision sends a message that executives who put their own interests ahead of their shareholders' will be held accountable." Mr. McLeod, who lives in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, challenged Mr. Spitzer's assertions that his receipt of undisclosed hot stock offerings was illegal. His lawyer continued that challenge yesterday, calling the case against Mr. McLeod another example of overreaching by Mr. Spitzer. "Clark McLeod is not Bernie Ebbers or anybody else of that ilk," said Harold K. Gordon, a partner at Jones Day in New York. "There is no evidence that there was any connection between Mr. McLeod's receipt of these I.P.O. shares and Salomon Smith Barney acting as the company's investment banker." Stating that Justice Lowe erred in his decision, Mr. Gordon said Mr. McLeod would probably appeal. The civil case against Mr. McLeod recalls the heady days of 1999 and 2000, when telecommunications companies like WorldCom and Qwest were stock market darlings and the men who ran them rock stars. A central figure in the case was Jack B. Grubman, the powerful Salomon Smith Barney telecommunications analyst who recommended McLeod-USA stock repeatedly to the public, even as it plummeted. Indeed, Mr. Spitzer contended that Mr. McLeod sold 2.2 million shares of his company's stock after Mr. Grubman began recommending it, realizing a profit of almost $100 million from the sales. Mr. Grubman was barred from the securities industry in 2002. Mr. McLeod appears to have pursued the initial public offering shares aggressively. For example, Mr. McLeod testified that he personally asked for initial offering allocations from chief executives of several companies McLeodUSA did business with and that Salomon Smith Barney was going to offer to the public. The court must schedule a hearing to set the amount of damages and restitution to be paid by Mr. McLeod. The other executives sued by Mr. Spitzer for their initial public offering profits were Philip F. Anschutz, former chairman of Qwest Communications; Bernard J. Ebbers, former WorldCom chief executive; Joseph P. Nacchio, former chief executive of Qwest who will be tried this year on insider trading charges in Denver; and Stephen Garofalo, chief executive of Metromedia Fiber Networks. All four have settled with the attorney general. Mr. Anschutz paid $4.4 million to settle; Mr. Nacchio paid $400,000; and Mr. Garofalo paid $1.5 million. The settlement with Mr. Ebbers, which has not yet been completed, will be a part of his global resolution involving the holders of stock and bonds who lost money when WorldCom collapsed. Andrew J. Lorin, an assistant New York attorney general and enforcement section chief, argued the case before Justice Lowe. "McLeod reached out to Salomon Smith Barney to get these hot I.P.O. shares, which were like cash, while at the same time McLeod's company was sending tens of millions of dollars in banking business to S.S.B.," he said. "It's simply wrong that an executive should receive these types of payments from a company vendor and that none of it was disclosed to the board or the shareholders."

969-> ART REVIEW; Rocky Trip Through the 20th Century
IF photography was the catalyst for a crisis in realist painting at the turn of last century, then abstraction was its temporary panacea. Absolved of the need to imitate appearances, artists experimented with form and color. This led to the first non-objective paintings in the early 20th century. But artists found -- quickly in some cases, over decades in others -- that pure abstraction was a trap, restricting rather than opening up further possibilities for painting. By the century's end, painting had returned to realism, although it was a realism deeply inflected by the brief experiment with abstraction. "Facing Abstraction: Refiguring the Body in the 20th Century" at the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, N.Y., charts the troubled relationship between realism and abstraction in 20th-century art. The show tells this story through changing imagery of the body in artworks selected by the curator Tracy Fitzpatrick chiefly from the Neuberger's permanent collection. The show begins and ends with the work of two Dutch artists: Kees van Dongen (1877-1968) and de Kooning (1904-97). Painted a half-century apart, both works are figurative portraits of women. But in tone, manner and style, they might as well have been painted on different planets. Something radical -- abstraction -- happened in the interim. The other 35-odd paintings and sculptures here point up some of the myriad pathways down which art traveled from realism to abstraction and back again. Picasso and Braque have a prominent place, as is to be expected, with several works on display here by each. Most curious, perhaps, is a little known -- and I guess little shown -- engraved plaster object by Braque. Titled "Uranie" (1947), a word of no definite meaning as far as I can tell, it uneasily combines figurative and abstract imagery on painted plaster in the shape of a map of Australia. It is an intriguingly exotic little object. The symbiotic relationship between figurative and abstract imagery in 20th-century art is more obviously apparent in two early sculptures by Alexander Archipenko, a Russian Constructivist. The Russians invented non-objective art, and Archipenko was at the forefront of these activities in the early decades of the last century. "It is not exactly the presence of a thing but rather the absence of it that becomes the cause and impulse for creative motivation," a wall text quotes from the artist's writings. This is a telling observation, capturing the shift in focus from the representational image to the idea. From then on, art did not have to represent anything at all. The story from here on is limited in some instances by a lack of key works by major artists, or any works at all. Another curator might, for instance, have been tempted to include paintings by Frank Auerbach, Francis Bacon or Matisse, and sculptures by Brancusi and Boccioni. Here I suspect we confront the limits of the Neuberger's collection. The show's closing room is devoted mostly to 1950's American figurative painting, produced at a time when abstraction was king. It is an awkward group of pictures, stocked with blurry, elemental figures often battling their way forward through a welter of abstraction. This room is a collection of pictures by artists under siege, most struggling to find ways of making figurative painting relevant at a time when, it might have seemed, abstraction threatened to do away altogether with the realist painting tradition in Western art. The best works here, by de Kooning, Larry Rivers, Joan Brown and Richard Diebenkorn, seem to reconcile non-literal representation with a sort of sensory, almost tactile awareness of the human form. This rough compromise helped set realist painting on a new path. Figurative painting did not just survive; it reasserted itself with vengeance in the form of hyperrealism and the Pop Art explosion. This pleasantly patchy exhibition reminds us that far from being at odds with realism, the brief episode of abstraction in art first signaled by Cubism in the first decade of the 20th century helped to save it. "Facing Abstraction: Refiguring the Body in the 20th Century" is at the Neuberger Museum of Art, Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., through July 16.

970-> Roe v. Wade Above All Else?
To the Editor: Re "Three Decades After Roe, a War We Can All Support," by William Saletan (Op-Ed, Jan. 22): It is vital that the endless debate over abortion end quickly. The damage done to the United States in the last 33 years is far worse than people seem to realize. In the United States, this one question dominates elections and Supreme Court nominations. You elect people with the power to start wars, interpret the Constitution, use nuclear weapons and change Social Security based on their views on abortion. Corrupt is O.K., not very bright is O.K., willing to destroy the environment is O.K., but no way will you vote for someone who disagrees with you on abortion! Which brings two problems: First, by putting so much focus on this one issue, you let politicians get away with murder on everything else. Second, you necessarily elect people whose intellectual capacity enables them to look at a very complex issue like abortion and see it in simplistic black-and-white terms. The results are there for all to see. Denis O'Sullivan Brussels, Jan. 23, 2006

973-> Brooklyn on the Hudson
When I gave myself a big birthday party last year, I included with the invitation a packet of all the inns and hotels within a reasonable radius of my house in Dutchess County, in upstate New York. But even with two months' notice, I had to field irate phone calls from my city friends complaining that all the decent places were already booked. That's because the competition for lodging up here is brutal. Classic-car buffs go toe-to-toe with the parents of students from Bard for space at a cozy B&B, and those autumn-leaf stalkers are a cutthroat bunch who block out rooms years in advance. But there was a silver lining to all this. To escape their dreary rooms at the Motel 8, many of my guests took car trips across the river, stumbling upon and falling in love with a little Victorian timepiece of a hamlet called Tivoli. Though it slopes gently to the banks of the Hudson River, Tivoli lacks an Eastern preciousness and would never generate the sappy yearnings those ghouls had for Grover's Corners. You can still feel an early-American spirit here, but it's somehow more akin to Jack London's America than Thornton Wilder's, as if the sermons from this once-rowdy waterfront town were delivered by a saloon preacher rather than by some quaint Protestant minister. In the early 20th century, Tivoli was an important stop on the Albany rail line, and passengers could take in a cockfight or a boxing match while their locomotive took on wood and water. The village's wide main street, aptly called Broadway, is now lined with a few restaurants, art galleries and a melancholy Laundromat, but it still seems perfectly suited for a gunfight over a poorly dealt hand of cards. What's more, come this month, Tivoli will even have its own hotel, the Madalin. The original Madalin Hotel burned to the ground in 1909 and was cautiously rebuilt from exquisite masonry. It was then sold to the Morey family, who tried to maintain the hotel until the 1950's, when it was boarded up and shuttered. The new owners, Joseph and Anthony Cicileo and Domenic Scarpulla, massively renovated both the inside and the outside of the hotel, restoring its luxury. The set designer Ben Shecter and the television producer George Barimo, who are currently redecorating the Chelsea Hotel, styled each of the Madalin's 11 rooms with turn-of-the-century antiques in the Eastlake fashion. They also come furnished with flat-screen televisions, wireless Internet and telephones of the early-Jetsons period. A bed-and-breakfast this is not. Though it will serve breakfast. And dinner. The hotel restaurant and bar, called Madalin's Table, will specialize in classic American food, expanding the town's formerly limited repertory of Southwestern fare at Santa Fe or sushi at Osaka. The Madalin's original 19-foot bar has been sanded, stained and buffed, and makes you thirsty just looking at it. In its heyday, when it was known as Morey's, the Madalin was the epicenter of Tivoli's social scene, and its huge wraparound terrace was the place to be seen among hungry young barrel makers and blacksmiths. Before hooking up with Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor was rumored to have stopped by after a few rousing sets of tennis at the Edgewood Club of Tivoli. It is Joe's hope that the Madalin will recreate that kind of social fabric between locals and guests and once again be the anchor of the village. The local crowd in Tivoli has an effortlessly hip and creative edge about it, as if it fled Brooklyn before the rest of us ruined it. The women all look like Dylan's girlfriends from his early album covers. The type of sad-eyed ladies who roll their own cigarettes, have pottery clay under their fingernails and listen to Cat Power bootlegs while driving around in their rickety pickup trucks. Their rescue dogs wear bandannas, have names like Tito and Beckett, and loyally wait for them on the porch of Santa Fe while they wash down fish tacos with Pacificos. If someone made a "Girls of Tivoli" calendar, or a "Girls Gone Winsome" video, I would buy it. I think they are really going to like the bar at the Madalin.  Tivoli, N.Y., is about 90 miles north of New York City, off Route 9G. The Madalin Hotel (53 Broadway) will be happy to direct you, starting with kayaking on the Hudson. You can hang out at the Black Swan, an Irish pub up the street; take the kids to see the Sopwith Camels dogfight the Fokkers at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (go to www.oldrhinebeck.org); or spend more than a drunk in Vegas at the Dutchess County Fair (in August, www.dutchessfair.com). For antiques, visit the town of Hudson, just north of Tivoli, where each shop looks like Edith Wharton's yard sale. The summer music festival at the Richard B. Fisher Center for Performing Arts at Bard begins on June 29 with a dance. Book a table at Restaurant, a few miles up the road in Germantown (2 Church Avenue; 518-537-2161), for handmade pasta, wild salmon and wood-oven pizza, shockingly good for such a one-horse town.

974-> Can Religion Help the Democrats?
To the Editor: Encouraging religious progressives to speak out is a matter of fighting fire with fire. So if the prophet Isaiah encourages certain Americans to remember the importance of responsible community and caring for the neediest, that's a nice counter to the right wing's personal-property agenda. And it's superb tit-for-tat that the theologian Stanley Hauerwas reminds us that there will be dire moral consequences for this administration's arrogance. After all, Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, James Dobson, Ralph Reed and Tom DeLay seem to have convinced some Americans that George W. Bush's incompetence and recklessness are just part of his mission from God. Pam Walton Mountain View, Calif., Jan. 2, 2006

975-> Caviar Dreams
It's 1:30 in the morning, and reality is really starting to blur. Inside the sprawling 19th-century mansion that was once the home of a Russian trade mogul and now houses the club XIII, scantily clad women in razor heels and would-be oil oligarchs in fancy suits groove to house music in shattered rainbow light. Tomorrow is so far away from this glitzed-out place. Garey Tchagleysean, the club's American owner, raises a Champagne glass to his lips, loving what he sees. Standing at the edge of the convulsing dance floor, he sports a blue suit with knife-sharp creases in the pants, to go with the sinister smile permanently plastered on his very round face. It's Saturday. Supermodel look-alikes in black sell $500 bottles of vodka, while outside a babushka in a kiosk peddles shots for a buck and change. "People come to get lost," Tchagleysean hollers over a thumping bass, as two model types in bikinis gyrate on pedestals above us. When Tchagleysean opened XIII in 1998, its outrageousness and glamour immediately drew comparisons to Studio 54. Since then, Tchagleysean has been behind some of the most extravagant and talked-about parties in Moscow, a city that, after almost half a century behind the Iron Curtain, is still new to hedonism. Tchagleysean, who speaks in a sort of lazy California surfer drawl, describes the XIII crowd as "royals," by which he means hip and moneyed Muscovites. Moscow may boast the second highest billionaire count in the world (New York ranks first), but much of the city subsists on about $480 a month. "We don't just let anyone in," he says. "You're either part of this party or you're not." Models, mobsters, diplomats, tennis starlets, aspiring oligarchs, leggy molls — they all make their way here at some point. And it's this combustible convergence that, even after closing for two years of renovations and reopening last spring, makes the place feel less like New York in the 1970's than like Chicago in the 20's: glitz, guns and truckloads of green. "We have to watch out for the guns," Tchagleysean admits. "It's necessary. Because of what's going on in this country." David Morales, a New York-based D.J., has played XIII several times. "Garey's the man — the man," he enthuses. "What he has is not some lounge place happening for five minutes. People go there dressed to the nines — and dance. It's dangerous!" Tonight, the club is celebrating Tchagleysean's 39th birthday — which is actually not for another month, but who's counting? "I felt like having a birthday party," he says. Tchagleysean is making the rounds, kissing cheeks, bear-hugging. "When people are around me, they're feeling cool," he boasts. Outside, late-model luxury cars and S.U.V.'s, most with private drivers, are double-parked. A sleek crowd is waiting on the front steps for the linebacker-size security guys in polar jackets to let them through the social divide of the velvet rope. Plebeian or cool? Tonight's theme is the Scorpion, for Tchagleysean's assumed astrological sign. And everything is draped in shimmering gold, like a movie set for "Dune." Women in shiny scorpion masks roam the mansion's two floors. On the winding marble stairwell, fey-looking actors in gold gowns and headdresses pray over burning candles and incense while a woman in translucent wings and stiletto heels swings overhead. XIII is all about theater. One night, it might be "The Nutcracker"; another, Mikhail Bulgakov's novel "The Master and Margarita"; and another, the orgy scene from Stanley Kubrick's movie "Eyes Wide Shut," complete with some actors dressed in black cloaks and others naked but for their feather masks. For gangster night, Tchagleysean hauled in vintage cars from the 30's and dressed actors in period costumes with toy machine guns. "People are always asking me, 'What are you going to do next?"' he says. Tchagleysean is short and stocky, and when he moves, his thick shoulders roll like a wrestler setting up for a match. Born in Armenia, he is an American citizen and got his start after high school in Southern California, promoting parties in the 1980's at the Roxy and Vertigo in Los Angeles. When the L.A. scene dimmed, he headed to Moscow, first as a tourist and then as an itinerant lunch-truck owner who served up hamburgers and hot dogs. He set up the promotion company Organized Kaos and then opened Papa John's (now known simply as Papa's), a restaurant at the city's center with a music space downstairs. Minutes before the Russian economy tanked in 1998, he bought the decrepit yellow two-story mansion across the street, built sometime in the 19th century by one of Russia's richest merchant families. XIII was named for its address, 13 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa. "I also liked the idea of the number 13, a kind of secret society," he says. When he opened the club, he charged entry fees upward of $40, which were then unheard of. And unlike in the egalitarian days of Communism, there was a highly selective door policy, which persists today. Tchagleysean offered weekly masquerades and sometimes brought in real circus performers. Props were borrowed from the national opera house or local movie studios. Major D.J. acts like Fatboy Slim, Paul Oakenfold and Sasha & Digweed came to XIII before they played any other spot in Russia, he says. The dance floor, half the size of a basketball court, is lighted by a cascading crystal chandelier. At each end are swishy V.I.P. rooms with leather banquettes. After long nights in the summer, the party usually spills out onto the balconies. When Tchagleysean decided that it was time to close the place down in 2003, people were stunned. But after extensive renovations, he reopened last May, and unveiled his new idea: burlesque nights. Almost every month, Tchagleysean brings in burlesque and cabaret stars, mainly from Britain, with names like Lucifire, Empress Stah and Kittie Klaw. Shows feature whips, chains, leather and fire. Tchagleysean describes it as a sexual revolution, where anything goes. "I'm teaching the city about new things," he says with a laugh. It's close to 4 a.m. now. In a V.I.P. banquette, a guy is laid out on his girlfriend's lap, completely intoxicated. A new D.J. is just coming on, the third of the night. "What we do here is illegal," one reveler with a girl on his arm says to me. "What?" He nods toward the crowded dance floor, the nearly naked girls in cages, the pretty ballerinas twirling on the pedestals. He laughs. "You can't do this in America," he says, getting up real close to my ear, as if he's about to tell a secret. "You understand? We're having fun."

978-> Paperback Row
EAT THE DOCUMENT, by Dana Spiotta. (Scribner, $15.) Spiotta's stunning second novel, about the dissolution of 1970s radicalism, looks at the psychological and practical fallout from two people's attempts to reinvent themselves. (The title comes from a documentary about Bob Dylan's 1966 tour.) Mary Whittaker and Bobby DeSoto are antiwar radicals who become fugitives after a bombing plot goes awry. On the lam and separated for years, they disappear into anonymity: Mary as a suburban wife and mother, and Bobby as the manager of a progressive Seattle bookstore. Spiotta cuts back and forth between Mary and Bobby -- and past and present -- capturing the Vietnam-era idealism of the 1970s and the more cynical culture of the '90s. "Eat the Document" was a National Book Award finalist; in the Book Review Julia Scheeres said Spiotta's writing "brims with energy and intelligence." A SHORT HISTORY OF MYTH, by Karen Armstrong. (Canongate, $12.) Myths have always served as a "counternarrative," a way of coming to terms with mortality, Armstrong writes in this lucid introduction to Canongate's "Myths" series, a collection of works retelling the world's classic tales. Armstrong takes readers through the ages, from the hunting mythology of the Paleolithic period to the "death of mythology" in the "Great Western Transformation" (1500-2000). The other inaugural titles in the series are THE PENELOPIAD ($12), Margaret Atwood's story of Penelope, the faithful wife of Odysseus, told in her own words; and WEIGHT ($12), Jeanette Winterson's rendering of the story of Heracles and Atlas. "Canongate's series is an ambitious, risky project, potentially profound," Caroline Alexander wrote here. SELF-MADE MAN: One Woman's Year Disguised as a Man, by Norah Vincent. (Penguin, $15.) Vincent, a former columnist for The Los Angeles Times and a self-proclaimed "dyke," chronicles how the other half lives in this diligent and entertaining piece of investigative journalism. With the help of a voice coach and some accessories -- a pair of rectangular glasses, some false facial stubble, a prosthetic penis -- Norah transforms herself into Ned, whose whistle-stop tour of modern manhood takes him to a Roman Catholic monastery, a strip club, a men's consciousness-raising group and on a series of awkward dates with women. Our reviewer, David Kamp, called "Self-Made Man" a "fascinating, fly-on-the-wall look at various unglamorous male milieus that are well off the radar of most journalists and book authors." THE TIME IN BETWEEN, by David Bergen. (Random House, $13.95.) Bergen's tightly controlled novel explores the emotional detachment of a veteran, who disappears on his return to Vietnam 25 years after the war, and the anguish of his children, who search for him. In 2005 "The Time in Between" won the Giller Prize, Canada's most prestigious literary award. AFTER THE VICTORIANS: The Decline of Britain in the World, by A. N. Wilson. (Picador, $18.) Wilson, the English journalist and author of "The Victorians," returns with a second popular history, tackling a half-century of steady geopolitical decline between Victoria's death in 1901 and the coronation of Elizabeth II in 1953. CELL, by Stephen King. (Pocket Star, $9.99.) King is no fan of cellphones -- in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, he called them "21st-century slave bracelets" -- and in this work of sadistic wish fulfillment, a mysterious pulse turns Boston's cellphone users into flesh-eating freaks. Banding together with what remains of humanity, King's hero, a comic-book artist named Clay Riddell, must fight his way out of town and reunite with his missing son. "There's still no other writer who takes as much delight as King does in rendering the sight of a soccer field's worth of zombies being charbroiled out of existence," Dave Itzkoff wrote here. FOREVER FREE: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction, by Eric Foner. Illustrations edited and with commentary by Joshua Brown. (Vintage, $15.) This is a concise, highly readable history of the years between the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 and the withdrawal of the last federal troops from the South in 1877. Foner, a professor of history at Columbia, opens with a short account of slavery and emancipation, and traces the lines of race and politics that run from Reconstruction to the age of segregation to the civil rights movement to our own time. JOHN BROWN, ABOLITIONIST: The Man Who Killed Slavery, Sparked the Civil War, and Seeded Civil Rights, by David S. Reynolds. (Vintage, $16.95.) Reynolds's sympathetic biography sees John Brown, who led the botched and bloody antislavery raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, as a visionary prophet of American equality, whose fanaticism must be situated in the context of the run-up to the war.

979-> Can Religion Help the Democrats?
To the Editor: Joseph Loconte is on target when he says "democracy needs the moral ballast of religion." But he doesn't explain exactly how religion should inform public policy. He rightly insists that democratic virtues like prudence, reason and compromise provide critical filters for religion in the public square. But these filters serve us only if they transcend the self-interested, partisan impulses that unfortunately rule today's politics. Both the left and the right are guilty of not scrutinizing how their faith-based ideas serve the common good. I hope that Mr. Loconte's article leads to a larger discussion about identifying the criteria by which religious claims are mediated as they move from an individual's perspective to the greater good. Unless we can get past these self-serving assertions, religion's moral ballast is hollow at best. James A. Donahue Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 4, 2006 The writer is president and a professor of ethics, Graduate Theological Union.

981-> When a Country Cracks: History Lessons
IRAQ teetered on the brink of civil war last week. Then, Friday, it seemed, for the moment anyway, to have taken a step back. An unprecedented all-day curfew kept people from potentially volatile Friday prayers -- both Shiite and Sunni -- ending a 48-hour orgy of fury and violence touched off by a skillfully placed bomb that tore the golden dome off a shrine at the very heart of Shiite Islam. The sequence of events evoked past crises involving conflict between entrenched ethnic or religious groups -- the fodder for civil war. They have a rhythm of their own. Often tensions seem to build to an unbearable level, then suddenly ease. Sometimes something so awful happens that it is a turning point. That was the case during the Serbian siege of Sarajevo. At the beginning of February 1994, a mortar fell on an outdoor market where Bosnians bought used goods from one another. It exploded on a table full of secondhand hardware, turning bolts, hammers and screwdrivers into shrapnel, creating a bloody tableau in which 68 people died and a severed head rested among old shoes. International attention was suddenly focused on the struggle in the former Yugoslavia. A take-charge British general, Sir Michael Rose, was sent to lead the lackluster United Nations force. Despite hundreds of years of warlike mountain traditions intensified by religion and nationalism, he hammered out a cease-fire that eventually led to peace accords. But at other times, it seems, tension builds, ebbs, then builds again, each time starting at a higher point. Events -- bombings, gunfights, even massacres -- that once were almost unthinkable become mundane. This was the case during the 15-year Lebanese civil war. Foreign journalists in Lebanon had a T-shirt made up that said "Beirut Cease-Fire" followed by row after row of crossed-out tally marks. Experience shows that once these conflicts begin, people tend to identify only with their own group -- largely for protection. It is difficult, if not impossible, to be cosmopolitan. This identification is even more intense when the group is also defined by religion, particularly if it is accompanied by righteous certainty and rejection of the other. Thus, in the former Yugoslavia, Serb identity was reinforced not only by Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but by a hatred of Islam -- the prevalent religion in Bosnia -- dating back to the Ottoman Empire. In Lebanon, of course, politics was rigidly defined by religion: Christian (mostly Maronite) or Sunni, Shiite and Druze. Iraq is less a nation than an artificial entity drawn created by the British. In recent years, only the brutality of Saddam Hussein held its parts together. The religious antagonism is particularly strong in Iraq: the schism between Sunni and Shiite Islam was sealed there. With the death of the Prophet Muhammad, some in the religion he founded believed that Ali, his son-in-law, should be named caliph, but were at first rebuffed. When Ali's son Hussein tried to claim the post, he was betrayed, surrounded and slain in Karbala, his head sent to Damascus, seat of the (Sunni) Umayyad Caliphate. The martyrdom of Hussein is one pole of Shiite faith, leaving it with a legacy of put-upon suffering. The other pole is the belief in the Hidden Imam, , or 12th Imam, who disappeared in the 10th century and will return as a redeemer. This accounts for the fury unleashed last week by the bombing of the shrine in Samarra, for it is there that Muhammad al-Mahdi became that imam as a child and hid in a cave after his father was poisoned by the Sunnis. The motivation for the suspects in the bombing, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and his Salafist followers in Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, is no less unyielding. Certainly, civil war would aid their goal of derailing the Americans in Iraq. But even more, Salafists, extremist Sunnis who claim to seek the pure roots of Islam, believe that Shiites are heretics, more to be despised than infidels. Mr. Zarqawi has described Shiites as "far more dangerous than Americans." Significantly, the religious leadership helped restore calm. The firebrand Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr met with the Association of Muslim Scholars, a militant Sunni group, although his black-clad militia took over the streets of Sadr City in defiance of the curfew. The country's most powerful figure, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, even went on television to condemn the violence. Will calm last? In Lebanon, journalists had a grim maxim about how to start a news story: "Never lead on a cease-fire."

982-> Tumble in the Jungle
A quarter of an inch to the left, and my Achilles' tendon would have been severed. But first, how I got to this precarious spot. I had been invited to join an expedition down the remote Lucie River, deep in the South American rain forest. Our team of ornithologists and photographers planned to meet in Suriname and then fly south to the Lucie's source, buried in the jungle's interior. Once there, we would paddle its length — a journey that would take us eight days and 145 miles and that had been done only twice in the past century — allowing the birders to study the exotic specimens and the rest of us to concentrate on the rapids. After numerous trips to the Arctic, I looked forward to trading my ice ax and skis for a collapsible canoe. But first I needed to do two things: practice my paddling skills and find out where on earth Suriname was. I paid a visit to the Royal Geographical Society in London, home to almost every explorer's journal from the past two centuries. Rummaging through the card catalog, I came across 267 entries for the remote island Vanuatu, 329 for the partly unmapped jungles of Irian Jaya, but only 18 for Suriname, 10 of which predated 1901. "Is that it?" I asked the librarian loitering nearby. He came over and then nodded somewhat apologetically. Suriname is a wedge crammed between French Guiana and Guyana and nestled on the shoulder of Brazil in the oldest part of the mighty Amazon rain forest. Back in 1667, with little more than a handshake, the British swapped the entire country, 63,037 pristine square miles, for the colony of New Amsterdam (now known to all and sundry as New York City). The minor outpost would remain under Dutch rule for most of the next 300 years. Suriname might have gone the way of nearby Barbados and St. Lucia and their multimillion-dollar resorts if not for one thing: a lack of sand. The Amazon River flushes out millions of tons of silt each year, clogging up Suriname's shores; its endless mud flats and mangrove swamps aren't a big draw for beach tourists. So, not knowing much more than I knew before, I dragged my new collapsible canoe down to the banks of the Thames and began bolting it together, James Bond style. To the small gathering of nosy dog walkers, I tried to look as if I knew what I was doing, but my haphazard launch and dangerous wobbling were enough to dispel any illusions. Once adrift, the unnaturally brown water made it clear that capsizing would be disastrous, if not infectious. After a shaky start, I seemed to get the hang of it. In fact, I was actually quite enjoying myself. Training for polar expeditions involves dragging enormous car tires through thick sand for hours and hours on end. This was better. However, after five pleasant jaunts down such a lazy river, I didn't exactly feel prepared for whatever the Amazon might throw at us. In fact, at this stage, I had no idea who "us" actually was. In polar circles, there is a saying: "On expedition choose your companions carefully. ... You may have to eat them." In Antarctica, the bitter cold and long marches mean that it's absolutely vital to get on well with the people on your team. Would the jungle be any different? A few weeks — and a nine-hour flight from Amsterdam — later, I touched down in Paramaribo, Suriname's capital. From the vantage of my taxi, the city looked unmistakably African, with parts lifted directly out of Maputo, Mozambique, or Kinshasa, Congo, but well ordered and affluent and seemingly lacking any of the pockmarks of African poverty or war. Indian women stood at their market stalls idly bartering with groups of Javanese. Across the street, a bus station half filled with blacks was decked out with Bollywood posters and a statue of Gandhi. Farther along, a mosque stood next door to a synagogue, the faithful from both chatting casually in the street outside. It felt like some weird sociological experiment — how many disparate cultures could be crammed together in one small city? Where was the good old-fashioned tension, the acrimony and the clash of cultures? "It's the mystery of Suriname," the sociologist Jack Menke, whom I met there, told me with a smile. "The people are proud of their individual cultures, but think it's perfectly normal to respect their differences." Supposedly, when the Miss World beauty contest asked Suriname for a contestant, various leaders got together and decided to put forward no fewer than 12 official entrants — each from a different ethnic group. "No, I am afraid you have to choose just one," came the official's response. And so Suriname didn't send any. But as a pimped-out Porsche 4x4 roared down the street past me, I began to suspect that there was more to the mystery in Paramaribo than could be explained by racial harmony. What of the fact that I counted no fewer than 10 casinos for a population of only 250,000 people? I've never been to Las Vegas, but it seemed a little like overkill to me. Suriname, I later learned, is one of the many stopover points for cocaine traffic from Colombia to the rest of the world. Casinos are ideal money-laundering facilities. As a whole, its presence wasn't all that obvious, but as my taxi passed a string of half-finished mansions on the outskirts of town, my driver casually explained that their owners had recently been thrown in jail. Pulling up to my hotel, I met Tony Henneberg, the man who had put together the expedition. An amateur ornithologist and painter, Tony had been mildly obsessed with Suriname and was desperate to get into the jungle to sketch some of the extraordinary bird life on offer. Roald Amundsen, the first man to the South Pole, once quipped, "Adventure is just bad planning." It is a principle that Tony evidently adhered to every step of the way. Swigging back a beer in the hotel bar, he told me not to worry so many times that I began to worry. But I couldn't help but like him, and so did everyone else, as the entire hotel, staff and guests, already knew him by name. As I sorted through my gear, I met Lee Van Alen Manigault, another member of our team. Originally from New York and six feet tall, she greeted me with a warm smile. She was packing up her own medical kit, which, I noticed, included sewing needles. "To darn your socks," I said flippantly. Little did I know she would be using them on me. A day later, the three of us flew to the tiny Kayser airstrip near the source of the Lucie River. There we would await the three remaining expedition members. As our little Cessna bounced and rattled its way over the jungle canopy, we looked out over the Amazon's infinite expanse. Below, the trees merged, vine and root endlessly crisscrossed and twisted around each other, vying for position and stretching off into the horizon. Just a few minutes after we had landed, a second plane touched down and dropped off the rest of our team. With perfunctory handshakes, we moved all of our gear to the banks of the river and began to assemble our boats. Bobby Fisher, our photographer, was teamed with his assistant, Christian MacDonald, in one canoe; Lee and Tony were in the kayak; and Pieter Sonneveld, our Surinamese guide, came with me: three boats, six people and 145 miles of river. As we started, I wondered how easy a rescue might be. Motorized canoes would not be able to make it up through the rapids we were going to face, and Suriname's only two helicopters were said to be owned by the same kind of guys who drove the pimped-out Porsches. At the very least, any evacuation would require some form of international intervention. It was at this point that Bobby decided to tell us that he and Christian had never canoed down rapids before. We started paddling. The boats, top-heavy from all our equipment, ran through the water like bathtubs. Bobby and Christian took the first in a long line of rapids backward. We had to do nearly 18 miles a day to stay on schedule, but even from the start, it was obvious that our progress would be entirely dictated by the current. The first few hours slipped by unawares, all of us engrossed in the scenery. Pieter and I watched as giant otters languidly slipped into the water. Behind us, Tony and Lee cataloged the profusion of exotic birds — rufescent tiger-herons, harpy eagles and iridescent macaws. Tony spent most of the time with binoculars clamped to his face, pointing out shapes concealed deep within the jungle. The only things I could discern with any clarity were the vultures circling overhead, hungry and patient. At one point, Tony waved a microphone in the air trying to catch some particularly rare birdsong, which was suddenly drowned out by a cacophony of demonic screeching somewhere high in the canopy. It was terrifyingly loud, like King Kong murdering something. The culprit turned out to be a shin-high and pathetically innocuous red howler monkey. I guess in the jungle it's all about bravado. Unlike polar trips, where every scrap of food has to be towed in a sled, here we were trying to live off the land and save weight in our overloaded boats. We budgeted for one meal a day for each of the eight days we planned to be on the river. Anything beyond that we had to kill or catch. After eight hours' paddling, we were happy to eat almost anything. The waters were thick with piranhas, but the real king of the river was the anjoemara, a charcoal-gray muscular fish resembling a pike on steroids. The anjoemara were absolutely fearless and spent their time randomly terrorizing anything slightly smaller than themselves. Doing his wash next to the river one evening, Pieter saw a few circling close by. He banged a huge stick on the surface to scare them off. Undaunted, the fish bit the end of his branch. But their aggression was their downfall, as they would almost always have a go at one of our lures. And what a fight! To save our rods from being snapped, we resorted to very unsportsmanlike tactics. As soon as a fish came near the shallows, I would wade in and hit it repeatedly with a wooden club. I could have brained Mike Tyson — these fish were unbelievably resilient. They were also delicious. We smoked the fish over a campfire, the jungle's ubiquitous night sounds playing on our imaginations. It was hard not to wonder what other, equally aggressive wildlife might be lurking out there. As the protective flames slowly withered and we walked back to our hammocks and tents each night, I would sweep my head torch around in an arc through the bushes, crisscrossing the beam like a guard in a prison watchtower. As soon as night fell, the jungle became so dark, the undergrowth so impenetrable, that I could have easily missed an elephant, let alone a stealthy jaguar hiding behind the nearest tree. With the howler monkeys in mind, I would crash about, making as much noise as I could. The night jungle is undoubtedly a scary place, but strangely, once I'd made it inside the hammock, I was somehow reassured by the paper-thin mosquito net. Human nature is weird that way. On our third day on the river, a low hum broke the morning quiet. Pieter swiveled around from the front of the canoe. "Is that a plane?" he asked, his forehead furrowed in concentration. Seconds later we were backpaddling furiously, trying to avoid being sucked into a monster rapid. As Pieter and I prepared to go down, the others tied up their boats and climbed over the rocks to wait at the bottom. Over the first drop, our collapsible boat flexed unnervingly and filled with water. Pieter pushed off the rocks, just managing to prevent us from being dashed against them, but by the third drop, we were almost completely submerged. Tony grabbed the front of the boat as we swept passed him, penduluming us round, so that now the water surged over the sides. Pieter and I jumped out to lighten the boat. Just as my head disappeared into the foaming torrent, I heard Tony say, "Oh, look, a capped heron." There are times when ornithology is just plain dangerous. Standing in the shallows, happy to be in one piece, Pieter suddenly went bright red. He tried to say something, but as English isn't his first language, it took a moment to find the right word. He finally blurted out "electric eel" and jumped headlong onto the nearby rocks. Lee had also taken a hit and joined Pieter, furiously rubbing a leg. These eels, which can produce shocks of up to 600 volts, can injure or even kill human beings. The following five days passed with quiet, contemplative stretches followed by similar jolts of excitement. The early morning was undoubtedly the best time to see the wildlife, when, out of the morning mist, animals would approach the riverside to drink. All was still, the long night of hunting or being hunted finally over. Our paddles cut through the water, each of us tired from the night of half sleep in our makeshift beds. Then suddenly, up ahead, a tapir splashed into the water, swimming with surprising agility up onto the bank. Farther along, a capybara, the world's largest rodent, stared at us with a look of surprise that was mutual. Then, on the right bank, under an overhanging branch, something sandy in color moved with perfect feline grace. The jaguar turned and hopped back into the jungle, perfectly blending into the foliage. I just stared, too amazed to even point it out to the others. Without Pieter and Tony, so much of the forest would have gone unnoticed. Trivia poured out of them — anacondas allegedly smell terrible, tapirs are related to rhinos, a certain type of vine is pounded and used to stun fish. They say there are thousands of plants still undiscovered, mammals and birds yet to name, and paddling through such a place makes it easy to believe. For a few hours on the fifth day, I lay on the top of the canoe, letting Pieter do all the work. I was recovering from one of those jolts of excitement, trying to keep my blood pressure down and stop the piranha bite on my ankle from bleeding. We were behind schedule, and everyone but me was working hard to make up some mileage. I felt a little guilty. The next few days were to be long and exhausting. On the sixth, we got up early, preparing for much of the same, but that morning the river had other ideas. As Bobby and Christian attempted to dodge a fallen tree, their boat wedged itself squarely between two rocks. They both jumped out, desperate to save the camera film, and watched as the canoe's aluminum frame gave up the ghost and crumpled with a pitiful death rattle. Pieter and Tony braved the strong current to fish out the flotsam, while Bobby and Christian heroically dragged what was left of the canoe onto the riverbank like a scene out of "Baywatch." I stood on a rock, of no particular use to anyone and not overly keen to go back into the water. By the looks of the pathetic heap of twisted metal and plastic, hopes weren't high. I'd fixed broken tent poles and improvised ski bindings, but this job was definitely beyond me. The boat was shot. Lee lay back in the sun and warmed up the satellite phone for the impending evacuation, but Pieter and Tony had other ideas, and with an ingenuity to put the A-Team to shame, they raced into the jungle to whittle branches. Five hours later, a fusion of wood, plastic and metal sat awkwardly on the rocks. A lowbred hodgepodge with the hydrodynamics of a potato, the makeshift vessel looked as if it would buckle on the first rapid. However, looks, apparently, are not everything, and by this stage, it was only another 45 miles to the pickup point. The remaining distance passed with mild rapids, and the lowbred coped surprisingly well. As midday approached and the full heat of the sun was upon us, we suddenly saw the nose of a 40-foot motorized canoe tucked under a thicket on the far bank. Pieter had timed the pickup perfectly and, despite all that had happened, had gotten us there at our designated hour. Farther downstream, at the more civilized Arapahu Island Resort, we watched the water tumble over the magnificent Frederik Willem IV waterfalls and life was good once again. Luxuries like beer and dry clothing were soon taken for granted, and we fed ourselves back up to our natural weight. The mauled boats lay forlorn on the sandbanks — the only real casualties of our little expedition. I have seen deserts, mountains and infinite quantities of ice, but the jungle is the only place where I seemed to stay in a constant state of amazement. Such a rare profusion of life, diverse as it is and interacting on every level. It could take a lifetime just to make the slightest sense of it all. Such a life would be time well spent.

984-> Questions Over Van Operator and How It Vetted Its Driver
Officials at the medical transportation company whose van slammed into a tree in Queens on Wednesday, killing five residents of an adult group home and injuring four others, never checked the driver’s record before hiring him, a state-certified driving examiner said yesterday. They also failed to verify that he had the proper license, he said. As a result, officials at the company, Altima Transportation, had no idea that the driver, Guy Thelemaque, had a suspended license, and that he was not certified to drive the 15-passenger van that crashed and burst into flames on Cross Bay Boulevard, said the examiner, who was granted anonymity to speak because he did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Altima, a client. “They figured they could cut costs, but look at what happens when you cut costs,” said the examiner, speaking outside Altima’s office in Inwood on Long Island after being called in by Altima after the accident. His company and others like it charge fees to conduct road tests for drivers and teach them basic maintenance. The State Department of Transportation listed Eliyahu Rubin and Elizabeth Davidowitz, both residents of Brooklyn, as the owners of the company. Neither answered the door at their homes or responded to several phone messages left for them yesterday. A man who answered the phone at Altima’s office declined to comment. Meanwhile, Mr. Thelemaque, 55, described to relatives yesterday his version of what happened just before the crash. “He remembers things,” said Mr. Thelemaque’s wife, Myrtha, 38, in a telephone interview from her husband’s hospital room. “There was another car coming to him, so he made a turn, to not hit the other car, and that’s when he got into the tree. “He was looking for the brakes, and he couldn’t find them,” she said. But a woman driving next to the van seconds before the accident has told investigators that Mr. Thelemaque’s vehicle began drifting into her lane, suddenly sped up and then veered into the tree, a law enforcement official said. No criminal charges have been filed in the case, but the police said the investigation was continuing. The National Transportation Safety Board said yesterday that it had sent a team to look into the accident. A spokeswoman for NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan said that Mr. Thelemaque, of Brooklyn, was in stable condition last night. Two other survivors, Jean Hastik, 60, and Carl Harkins, 44, were in critical condition, the spokeswoman said. A third survivor, Jose Prieto, 56, transferred to Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn with a spinal injury, was in stable condition, a spokesman said. Sheldon Wilson, 41, the fourth injured resident of the group home, the Brooklyn Manor Home for Adults, was released from Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens and returned to the group home. The van had been returning from Peninsula Hospital Center in Far Rockaway, where the residents had attended a day treatment program, to Brooklyn Manor, which has been called one of the state’s most troubled group homes. Much attention after the accident centered on the home, which the State Department of Health has tried repeatedly to shut down or take over because of abuses there. But it is becoming increasingly apparent that Altima Transportation, which does business under the name Instant Ambulette, failed to meet guidelines set up by the state to ensure that the drivers of ambulettes are qualified to operate them, state officials say. Peninsula Hospital officials hired the van service six years ago to transport patients to and from Brooklyn Manor, said Liz Sulick, a spokeswoman for the hospital. Ken Brown, a spokesman for the State Department of Motor Vehicles, confirmed yesterday that Mr. Thelemaque’s license had been suspended and that even if it had been valid, he was certified to drive only a seven-passenger van. Mr. Thelemaque’s license was suspended on June 26 for failure to appear in court to answer a summons, according to motor vehicle records. The company would have been notified of his suspension immediately if it had filed the proper paperwork for him, Mr. Brown said. All drivers for medical transportation companies are subject to a provision of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law known in the industry as Article 19-A. Companies must file paperwork that includes a summary of the employee’s driving history and proof that the driver has undergone a medical exam and has the correct licenses for the vehicles he will be driving, Mr. Brown said. But Mr. Thelemaque’s name did not appear on a list of drivers the company submitted late last month, Mr. Brown said. His relatives said that Mr. Thelemaque began working for Altima a few months ago. The company has about 20 vehicles and had $2.3 million in Medicaid billings last year. After the accident, Altima officials called 19-A Certified Examiners Transportation Safety and Vocational Institute, in Brooklyn, to ask someone to help them get their paperwork in order, the examiner from the school said yesterday. The examiner, who normally helps companies by conducting driving and written evaluations of their drivers as required by law every two years, arrived, expecting a large file with all of Mr. Thelemaque’s information. He said he found only a copy of the employee’s medical checkup and none of the other required forms. On a computer, he checked Mr. Thelemaque’s driving history, which showed his recent license suspension, as well as 22 other suspensions or citations over the past three years and an accident involving an injury last year, the examiner said. Company officials were shocked, he added. The examiner said he advised the company’s owners to call a lawyer. “I would have never recommended that this person be driving,” he said. “Would you want someone like that driving your grandparent or loved one around?” In March, the State Department of Transportation cited the company for failing to maintain its vehicles and establish an effective maintenance program, said Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the department. The department inspects medical transport vans twice a year, checking things like brakes and seat belts, and requires companies to maintain a passing rate for its vehicles of at least 75 percent. But Altima’s passing rate for the period from April 1, 2004, to March 31, 2005, was just 51.4 percent, Ms. Post said. The state had ordered the company to appear for an administrative hearing that was scheduled for next week, she said. The company faced a potential fine of $2,500. The van involved in the accident passed its inspection in May, Ms. Post said. Residents of Brooklyn Manor said yesterday they had observed problems with the van service and complained about it to administrators. Mary Lagrasta, 44, a resident, said she often felt unsafe in the vans. Drivers would often speed and seat belts were often broken, she said. Ms. Sulick, the spokeswoman for Peninsula Hospital, said it had worked with the van company for six years and had had “no documented incidents or formal complaints.” She said the hospital would re-examine its contract with the company. Stephen N. Solarsh, executive director of the New York Ambulette Coalition, an industry group, defended the van services yesterday. “We transport as an industry tens of thousands of people every day with little or no problems,” he said. Multiple state agencies regulate the industry, which can be problematic, said Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the commissioner of the state department of health, one of the entities that has oversight over it. “Somewhere along the way, we need to connect the dots among all of us,” she said. “This case brings it to the forefront.”

986-> Naughty and Nice: Bettie Page Beyond the Va-Voom
FOR a few blissfully underdressed years in the 1950's, Bettie Page was the pinup queen of the universe, or at least of lockers, garage walls and private stashes across the country. Blessed with a killer body and the perkiest smile this side of Sandra Dee, Ms. Page (she turns 83 this month) looked equally at ease wearing a homemade bikini or a fine mist of ocean spray. And while few people looked as happy naked as she did -- the young actress Gretchen Mol, who plays her in Mary Harron's exuberant biographical film "The Notorious Bettie Page," comes charmingly close -- in 1957 she buttoned her sweater for good, leaving the neon world of titillation and tease without a trace. For years, Bettie Page was a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside a web of expertly tied rope. Although she did her share of cheesecake, even gracing Playboy in nothing but a Santa hat and a rosy blush, she achieved her initial infamy as a bondage model. (Later, it was her disappearing act that fueled her notoriety.) In the early 1950's, she began working with the brother-and-sister team Irving and Paula Klaw (played by Chris Bauer and Lili Taylor), posing for untold numbers of photographs and 8- and 16-millimeter film loops with such self-evident titles as "Betty's Exotic Dance in High Heels." (Her first name was usually misspelled.) To satisfy the specialty market, the Klaws on occasion tied up their most popular model and stuck a ball gag in her mouth. In all likelihood it was these more outré images of Bettie crawling along a carpet in fetish heels or daintily spanking another seminude cutie that caught the government's censorious attention. (Now these fantasies seem almost quaint.) In 1955, Senator Estes Kefauver, a Tennessee Democrat and presidential hopeful who five years earlier had chased crime bosses like Frank Costello, turned his attention to pornography. (Around the same time, this same atomic-age Comstock helped put a muzzle on the comic-book industry in the name of preventing juvenile delinquency.) Ms. Harron and her screenwriting partner, Guinevere Turner, open their story with Bettie waiting to testify before Kefauver's subcommittee, shut out of the courtroom where a succession of men are lecturing one another on the evils of scantily clad women. Perhaps because Ms. Harron wrote about punk music in the 1970's (hers is one of the contributing voices in Legs McNeil's oral history of the scene, "Please Kill Me"), she comes across as the kind of enlightened chick who knows how to have a good time. Both of her previous features, "I Shot Andy Warhol," about the Pop artist's would-be assassin, Valerie Solanas, and "American Psycho," her excellent appropriation (and evisceration) of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, exhibit a shrewd, at times bitingly funny intelligence when it comes to what women want and why. In her work with Ms. Turner, in particular, who was also her screenwriting partner on "American Psycho" (Ms. Turner also helped write the lipstick-lesbian romance "Go Fish"), Ms. Harron manages to have her pleasure, visual and otherwise, and her politics, too. In this regard she receives terrific support from her obviously enthusiastic star. Until now, Ms. Mol has been best known for her premature designation several years ago as Hollywood's newest It Girl. The label seemed to plague her, and she all but faded from view despite promising turns in little-seen films. Maybe because she felt protected by her female director and female producers (six out of seven), or emboldened by the material, or maybe because she knows how beautiful her gently padded silhouette looks in the raw, Ms. Mol takes to this tricky role with the carefree expressivity you tend to see only in young children who have learned the joys of nudity, usually when their parents are throwing a dinner party. When she strips, Bettie soars. That's to the good of the film because while the pinup was mildly notorious, the fully dressed woman wasn't all that interesting. Born in Tennessee in 1923, she studied to be a teacher, veering into modeling after landing in New York. Initially, she posed for camera clubs, shutterbug groups that paid models for private sessions. (A year before she hung up her garters, The New York Times ran a classified advertisement for one such session: "Shoot model in glamorous clothes eves 8 PM, Sat 2 PM Bettie Page and others. Concord Camera Circle, 118 W 47th St.") Rather surprisingly, some of the clubs were racially integrated, and it was a black man, Jerry Tibbs (Kevin Carroll), who gave Bettie her trademark when he suggested bangs to obscure her prominent forehead. Ms. Harron moves fluidly through Bettie's early years, which included brutal abuse that might have had something to do with why she entered a profession that allowed her to create and control a sexualized image of herself. Even so, while Ms. Harron and Ms. Turner don't shy away from these dark episodes -- and, notably, end Bettie's story before age and the really bad times intrude -- they are too smart to draw a direct line between the traumas and the person who survived them. A self-made woman, Bettie Page created an enduringly resonant persona out of an arsenal of smiles and sneers, and her impressively pliant figure. Depending on the costume, the photographer (two of the finest were women, Paula Klaw and Bunny Yeager) and her own ingenuity, she was a dark angel, a harem girl, a naturist or a very naughty miss, but she was also always her own woman. If the inner Bettie remains somewhat out of focus here, even to the beatific finale, it's largely because what made her a sensation -- both in the 1950's and the 1980's revival that made her into a modern cult figure -- wasn't her acting aspirations or the religious convictions that might have pushed her to leave modeling, but that she was a genius of the body. It's a truism of art history that while men act, women appear, smiling demurely away from the gaze of the viewer. In many of her photographs, by contrast, Bettie looks straight into the camera with a grin that is by turns twinkling and devouring, and flips that old truism on its head by turning her appearance into a performance. She knows what you want; she wants it, too. In keeping with its subject, "The Notorious Bettie Page" is principally a work of gorgeous surfaces, shot mostly in silvery black-and-white film by the cinematographer Mott Hupfel, with an occasional splash of saturated color. Like the Klaws, Ms. Harron ties Bettie up and ties her down, puts her in towering boots and cinched corsets. Every so often, she complicates the story a little, as when she introduces John Willie (Jared Harris in top form), the bondage artist and publisher of Bizarre magazine, who devised some of Bettie's more outrageous poses. When he asks Bettie how she reconciles her love for God with her profession, she refers to Adam and Eve naked in the Garden of Eden. John Willie's idea of paradise wears more clothes, but he gets the picture, ball gag or no. "The Notorious Bettie Page" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes female nudity, kinky outfits, bondage and intimations of sadomasochism. The Notorious Bettie Page Opens today in Manhattan Directed by Mary Harron; written by Ms. Harron and Guinevere Turner, based partly on research from "The Real Bettie Page" by Richard Foster; director of photography, Mott Hupfel; edited by Tricia Cooke; music by Mark Suozzo; production designer, Gideon Ponte; produced by Pamela Koffler, Kathie Roumel and Christine Vachon; executive producers, John Wells, Ms. Harron and Ms. Turner; co-producer, Lori Keith Douglas; released by Picturehouse and HBO Films.

Alex was a heartbroken Kerry supporter, and his grandfather, a lifelong Taft Republican, started telling Democrat jokes.

990-> Bloomberg Invites Other Mayors to Town to Discuss Gun Crime
More than a dozen mayors are to meet at Gracie Mansion next week to discuss ways of stopping illegal gun traffic and reducing gun violence. Mayors Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Thomas M. Menino of Boston are organizing the meeting, which will be attended by mayors from Seattle, Dallas, Washington, Milwaukee and cities in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Mr. Bloomberg has made combating illegal guns a priority of his second term, and the meeting will be a "positive move" to address a national problem, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday. "Our shootings are down this year; still, there's way too many guns," he said. "The state laws are very permissive in certain jurisdictions," Mr. Kelly said. "We know that the majority -- 82 percent -- of the guns we confiscate here come in from out of state. So we need to marshal support across the country, and I think this is an important first step on the part of the mayor." He said the mayors would "see if they can influence their legislators to change the state laws." Mr. Kelly said illegal guns seized in the city seemed to come particularly from Florida, West Virginia and Ohio. No mayors from those states are scheduled to attend the meeting. Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday that his office would notify some unrepresented cities of the subjects discussed at the meeting. To combat gun crime and illegal guns, New York City has created a special gun court and has increased penalties for gun crimes. Federal sentencing guidelines include stiffer penalties when a gun is used in a crime. Many states, including Florida, have also created harsher penalties for using a gun in a crime.

991-> Blood and Oil
Just as things seemed to be calming down in the delta region of Nigeria after a spate of kidnappings and insurgent attacks, the militant group calling itself the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta -- MEND -- announced last week to all who would listen that it was planning new violence against oil facilities in the region. Apparently unconcerned about tipping its hand to the authorities, MEND even gave a date for the start of its new campaign: April 25. The guerrillas could not have hoped for a better reaction. Crude oil prices immediately jumped on the news, hitting $70 a barrel, as new fears about a supply squeeze hit the global oil market. Adding to the concern is that the latest message, sent to various news organizations, seems a lot angrier and more violent than previous missives. The references to endless buckets of blood sounded more like an Al Qaeda rant than a threat from oil-market saboteurs. This really should serve notice to Olusegun Obasanjo, president of Africa's most populous country, Nigeria. MEND's tactics -- kidnapping oil workers, attacking facilities, killing government soldiers -- are despicable, and deserve international condemnation. But the demand for more local control over oil wealth cannot be dismissed just because of its source. Ever since Royal Dutch Shell discovered oil in the Niger Delta back in 1956, revenue from oil wells has gone to line the pockets of Nigeria's elite: military dictators and corrupt federal and local government officials. Very little has gone to help the impoverished communities in the delta, which remain among the poorest in the world. Environment degradation, caused by oil slicks and gas flares, has gone untreated. Under Nigerian law, oil revenues go to the federal government, which then passes on a percentage to the states. In 2004, for instance, the 36 Nigerian states received $6.2 billion. Supposedly, about one-third of that went to the four major oil-producing states. But thanks to theft, corruption and mismanagement, on both the federal and state levels, very little of that money reached the local communities. Traveling through the delta region, it is difficult to comprehend that this is actually an area wealthy in natural resources. Despite generating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue since oil was discovered, the Niger Delta is one of the poorest and least developed parts of the country. A Wall Street Journal article last week described Warri, the western delta's oil capital, as a "crime-ridden sprawl of rutted streets and cinderblock shops." Lydia Polgreen of The Times reported earlier this year on Obioku, an impoverished delta village that is completely isolated. "With no fast boats available, the nearest health center or clinic is a day's journey away," Ms. Polgreen wrote. "No telephone service exists here. Radio brings the only news of the world outside. Nothing hints that the people here live in a nation enjoying the profits of record-high oil prices." It is time for Nigeria's government to begin taking into account the plight of the people who live around the oil wells that have sustained the country for so long.

992-> World Business Briefing | Europe: Ireland: Elan Reports a Smaller Loss
Elan, the Irish biopharmaceutical company whose hopes are tied to Tysabri, a suspended multiple sclerosis drug, reported a smaller first-quarter loss yesterday than in the year-ago period and forecast a return to profitability if sales of Tysabri resume in the United States. Elan said it lost $33.3 million including stock compensation expenses, compared with a loss of $115.6 million in the quarter a year ago. It said sales rose 31 percent, to $134.3 million from $102.7 million a year earlier. Analysts said the future of the company, which is based in Dublin, depends on the return of Tysabri, a drug withdrawn in the United States early last year after being linked to a rare, often fatal brain disease. The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce by June 28 whether sales of Tysabri can resume.

994-> The Best Way to Reduce Abortions?
To the Editor: Nicholas D. Kristof ("Beyond Chastity Belts," column, May 2) is right that the vast majority of Americans wants their lawmakers to support common-sense efforts to prevent unintended pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. The Putting Prevention First Act, co-sponsored by Senators Harry Reid and Hillary Rodham Clinton (who have different views on a woman's right to choose), includes the specific goals Mr. Kristof cites as ways to prevent unintended pregnancies: improved access to birth control, including Plan B; accurate, age-appropriate sex education; and family-planning services for those without health insurance. Anti-choice politicians in Congress continue to block legislation like Prevention First, in much the same way that Bush political appointees obstructed Plan B at the F.D.A. Before November, voters must start asking candidates where they stand on prevention. Elections are the best way to end the hypocritical, ineffective policies that Mr. Kristof exposed.

995-> Call It the Deal of a Lifetime
MOST mornings these days, Michael J. Kopper wakes up early, slips on a pair of khakis and hops into his Nissan sport utility vehicle for the short commute from his duplex in a Houston suburb to his job at Legacy Community Health Services, a community clinic. The Prada suits gather lint in his closet, and the shiny BMW 530 has been sold. Mr. Kopper's work is different now: At Enron, he was a financial sophisticate who manufactured a series of arcane partnerships that paid him millions and helped to sink the company, which filed for bankruptcy in 2001. At Legacy, which provides health care and counseling services to H.I.V. patients and other chronically ill people, Mr. Kopper is a salaried grant writer who solicits financial support for the clinic. It has been a wrenching professional and personal reversal for Mr. Kopper, who three years ago became the first Enron executive to plead guilty to criminal charges and cut a deal with the government. Mr. Kopper was also the first high-ranking Enron employee to publicly admit to lying and stealing -- in his case, more than $16 million -- from the company. Mr. Kopper's money-making schemes, hatched together with Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer, lie at the root of the mercenary culture that propelled Enron to unforeseen heights while also paving the way for its Icarus-like descent. The partnerships were feats of financial alchemy that became a dumping ground for Enron's flagging assets and helped sustain the growing fabulism of the company's accounting as a wide-eyed investing world watched in wonder. The partnerships also transformed Mr. Kopper from a by-the-books child of the New York suburbs with an expertise in accounting into a high-stepping Texas deal maker with a hankering for fast cars and big houses. Despite all of this, there is a possibility that Mr. Kopper, who just turned 41, could end up spending not one day in prison, because of the crucial role he has played in helping the government build its case against more senior executives, such as Mr. Fastow; Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman; Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive; and Richard A. Causey, the former chief accounting officer. Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling are scheduled to stand trial on fraud and conspiracy charges later this month. Certainly, Mr. Kopper's circumstances have changed in the last three years. A year ago, he moved out of the $1.5 million dream house with its glass stairways and its contemporary Japanese motif that he had designed with his longtime partner, William D. Dodson. Mr. Kopper has recently pegged his net worth at around $100,000, and he now lives on the second story of a modest duplex for which he paid $380,000; he rents out the bottom floor to help meet his expenses. Even so, Mr. Kopper manages to lead a bit of the good life. Despite spending hundreds of hours in conference rooms in Houston and Washington briefing government prosecutors on Enron's inner workings, Mr. Kopper, known as a compulsive jet-setter during his Enron days, has remained an enthusiastic traveler. He has visited Phoenix and played golf in Boca Raton, Fla., with his father, a former magazine publisher at Times Mirror, and has gone on ski vacations in Colorado. Mr. Kopper and Mr. Dodson, who has not been charged, declined to comment for this article, although friends and former colleagues did. Mr. Kopper's deal with the government and the chance that he might have a reduced term or serve no jail time at all -- he has not yet been sentenced -- have angered people who blame him and Mr. Fastow for destroying the life savings of many former Enron employees and sending to prison others who had just the briefest brush with the company. "Of all the deals Kopper made, his best was the plea deal," said Richard J. Schaeffer, a defense lawyer who cross-examined him during the trial of the Enron and Merrill Lynch executives who were convicted of bolstering Enron's earnings by letting the company fraudulently appear to sell barges in Nigeria for a profit. "He was the magician behind these deals," Mr. Schaeffer added. "His sense of greed had overtaken him. He had this brilliant mind and dedicated it to this partnership of evil." This public caricature of Mr. Kopper as a malevolent financial sorcerer seems at odds with his middle-class roots. Indeed, his road to the heart of the Enron scandal was unusual. Born in Brooklyn and reared in Woodmere on Long Island, Mr. Kopper was always driven by an extra spurt of ambition and yearning for the big time that for years seemed to lie just beyond his grasp, people who know him say. Writing in his yearbook at Lawrence High School in 1982, his aspiration seemed simple, if not a bit vague: "To be successful in all my endeavors." HE first enrolled at tiny Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., but transferred to Duke, where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics. He also earned a degree in accounting and finance from the London School of Economics, and then began working as a loan officer at Chemical Bank in New York. But his appetite for deal-making lead him to Toronto Dominion Bank, where he cut his teeth as a financier, working on a number of project-finance deals with energy companies -- including, in the early 1990's, Enron. It was then that he met Mr. Fastow. The two men hit it off immediately. Both were young, hard-working and ambitious numbers guys with an appetite for deals and a desire to strike it rich as soon as possible, people who know both men say. It did not take long for Mr. Kopper, an eager Nick Carraway susceptible to the lure of Mr. Fastow's Gatsby, to join his mentor in Houston in 1994. Enron was developing a reputation as a freewheeling, innovative company, and its aggressive, meritocratic culture seemed the perfect fit for Mr. Kopper, who was looking to unleash his own pent-up professional and materialistic ambitions, former colleagues say. Once there, he became even closer to Mr. Fastow, going to temple with him and his wife, Leah, and socializing with them after work. It was not until 1996 that Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper created their first off-balance-sheet partnership, which they called Alpine Investors. Mr. Kopper would make no money from this partnership, which was designed to buy underperforming power plants from Enron, but he would make money in 1997 with RADR, another off-the-books deal formed to buy wind farms that Enron wanted to sell. Supposedly independent, RADR was financed with Enron money and controlled by Mr. Kopper and Mr. Fastow. They and some of their friends got payouts from the partnership, ultimately at Enron's expense. In that way, RADR was a template for more fraudulent schemes. Mr. Kopper had begun dating Mr. Dodson, who worked in the finance department at Continental Airlines and also wanted to become an investor. But he was making only about $100,000 a year at Continental, so Mr. Kopper borrowed some money from Mr. Fastow -- the amount has not been made public -- and lent it to Mr. Dodson, according to Mr. Kopper's own testimony. RADR was remarkably lucrative. In just four months, at virtually no risk, Mr. Kopper took in $40,000 from the deal. Mr. Fastow's $419,000 loan generated $62,850 in interest -- an annualized return of 45 percent. It is not clear how much Mr. Dodson made. Enron's shareholders, meanwhile, footed the bill for the enterprise, which was designed to deceive them about the precarious state of Enron's balance sheet. But it would be the next partnership, Chewco, also started in 1997, that would pay Mr. Kopper and Mr. Dodson an even more munificent return. "We made, after taxes, roughly $10.5 million," Mr. Kopper recounted to a defense lawyer during the trial in September 2004 on the separate Nigerian deal. (Mr. Kopper would collect more than $16 million from at least five partnerships that he and Mr. Fastow created over six years; with help from Mr. Dodson, he has paid $12 million back to the government, according to Creed C. Black Jr., Mr. Dodson's lawyer. Mr. Fastow collected more than $40 million, according to court documents.) As the money rolled in, Mr. Kopper indulged his taste for sleek foreign cars and exotic vacations and cultivated a more risqué demeanor in and about the company. He wore expensive suits and shirts with zippers that seemed to creep lower and lower the more successful he became, his former colleagues at Enron remember. He told one colleague that he had a collection of 20 designer eyeglasses. Generally aloof with his colleagues, he made more of an effort to fit in, serving on an Enron diversity committee. Of all the partnerships, it was perhaps Southampton, named after the opulent Houston suburb in which he lived, that came the closest to defining the corruptive, get-rich-quick and risk-free spirit of the off-balance-sheet entities at Enron. With three bankers from Greenwich NatWest, a British investment bank that did work for Enron, Mr. Kopper and Mr. Fastow created the partnership in 2000 to buy out the interests of Enron and NatWest in another entity, inserting themselves in the middle and deceiving both Enron and NatWest as to what they needed to pay. ON the stand last year, Mr. Kopper described the essence of the deal in a flat, analytical style. "We stood between the two parties in order to skim money off of it," Mr. Kopper said, his face blank and voice devoid of emotion. How much did he make on the deal? "Four and a half million dollars," he said. "That's a pretty good return on $25,000, isn't it?" a defense lawyer responded. Yes, it was, Mr. Kopper said. The lawyer asked how long it took to cobble together such a rich, efficient transaction. "Not that many hours," Mr. Kopper said. "Maybe 10 to 12 hours of work." Honing in, the lawyer asked, "You wanted to make just a ton of money." In a monotone, Mr. Kopper said simply, "Yes." By 2001, Mr. Kopper had his ton of money and was starting work on a new house in a wealthy Houston suburb with Mr. Dodson. Mr. Kopper had also bought out Mr. Fastow for full control of yet another off-balance-sheet entity created at Enron, LJM2. No longer would he be just another accounting executive; as general partner of LJM2, he would preside over a fast-growing private equity fund with some of the best names in high finance as investors. But Mr. Kopper's time in the sun would be short-lived. With Enron's collapse in December 2001, he quickly came under the scrutiny of prosecutors and regulators who immediately questioned the propriety and legality of the myriad funds. The pressure became intense. Always a slender man, he began to lose weight, and when he pleaded guilty in 2002, he said he was taking medication for stress and anxiety. As a government witness, Mr. Kopper, by all accounts, has been a success. At the barge trial last year, he powerfully evoked the financial cravings of Mr. Fastow, calling him "very greedy" and recounting examples of him giggling with childlike glee as he closed various deals. The government has not put Mr. Kopper on the list of witnesses it expects to call in the trial of Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling, but the defense has. Lawyers involved in the case say that Mr. Kopper may not even be called, given his lack of direct interaction with Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay. While the partnerships are expected to be a centerpiece of the trial, Mr. Fastow will be in a better position to discuss them and how they connect to Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling. Friends of Mr. Kopper say he rarely speaks of Enron matters these days. He has ignored the imprecations cast at him by Mr. Lay, who has said that Enron was destroyed by the rogue actions of Mr. Fastow and Mr. Kopper -- a view expressed by many members of Houston's business elite. Always a bit of an outsider, Mr. Kopper is now even more of one. He is precluded by his plea agreement from speaking with Mr. Fastow and spends most of his time with Mr. Dodson and a small circle of friends from Enron. And while he declined to comment for this article, his departing words in his 1982 high school yearbook seem to hold true today. Quoting from the song "Summer, Highland Falls" by Billy Joel, he wrote: "We are always what our situations hand us. It's either sadness or euphoria."

998-> Seven Dramas Illustrate the Merits of Staging Short Plays
Next to "confessional solo show" and "multimedia Greek tragedy," probably no theatrical form generates as little enthusiasm as the evening of one-acts -- which is a shame, since there's so much to recommend it. First, brevity. Second, more playwrights increases the chance of seeing the next David Mamet. Most of all, some great ideas just can't sustain an entire play. For example, the Naked Angels' enjoyable potpourri of seven shorts "The Mag-7" concludes with an incredibly clever piece of meta-theater by Itamar Moses, which, if it went on for much longer, would have been insufferable. "Untitled Short Play" asks the question: Why did I write this in the first place? It begins with a couple sitting at a table across the stage from a reader (Gideon Banner) introducing the script. But instead of simply laying out the situation, the reader never surrenders the play to the actors, mocking the drama's conceit and musing about the impossibility of representing truth onstage. This satire of stage direction does not cover especially new territory, and it won't satisfy those who found Mr. Moses' New York debut "Bach at Leipzig" to be a collegiate exercise, but in the compact time frame of a one-act, it manages a beginning, middle and end as well as pathos, honesty and the kind of nimble wordplay that holds your attention. "The Mag-7" also features more postmodern tricks ("Waning Poetic by Chip Dunnigan"), the usual paranoia about terrorism ("Orange Alert," "The Handlers") and a somber scene about Christian Science ("Waiting"). But its most seductive one-acts are those about, well, seductions. In the delightfully nutty "A Twist So Shocking You Have to See It to Believe It," Telly (Michael Crane) picks up Miranda (Abbie Killeen) in a bar with a whimsical monologue imagining their future together. She plays along, until it becomes clear that he is really trying to sell her life insurance. And Deirdre O'Connor's unexpectedly moving "Penicillin" finds John (an oddball James McMenamin) attempting to butter up Jen (Nancy McNulty in a resourceful performance) by telling her that of all the women that he's given a sexually transmitted disease to, she's the only one he visited in a health clinic. Which somehow comes off sweeter than it sounds. "The Mag-7" continues through March 12 at Flea Theater, 41 White Street, Lower Manhattan; (212) 352-3101.

999-> Go, L Team! Recall the Days of Glory and Stop Waffling
Liberalism, Peter Beinart writes, is "a political tradition so reviled that its adherents dare not speak its name." Democrats nowadays prefer "progressive" or nervously change the subject when asked to define themselves. Mr. Beinart, an editor at large of The New Republic, wants to change that. He wants Democrats to remember what they learned during the cold war, when they faced daunting international challenges with courage, determination and a clear set of goals. He wants them to take a good look in the mirror and say slowly, "I am a liberal, I'm proud of it, and by golly, we are going to win the next election." "The Good Fight" is an invigorating pep talk for a dispirited team that has lost the ability to sway voters the way it used to, especially on vital issues of foreign policy. Among voters who cited terrorism as their top concern in the 2004 presidential election, President Bush outperformed John Kerry by the astonishing margin of 72 points. White blue-collar voters, especially women, deserted the party after voting for Bill Clinton in two previous elections. The Democrats, in other words, have a big problem. They do not know where they stand on confronting terrorism, partly because, Mr. Beinart argues, they have forgotten who they are. In "The Good Fight" he intends to remind them, and to offer them "a narrative of the present based upon a memory of the past." Like a football coach, Mr. Beinart starts by rolling some inspirational film of great games played by previous winning teams. Nearly half the book is devoted to a retelling of postwar history and cold-war liberalism, which he holds up as a model for present-day Democrats. They need to recall the glory days of the late 1940's when, after facing down their own left wing, they dedicated themselves to a foreign policy of containment toward the Soviet Union, cooperation with their allies and economic investment in Western Europe through the Marshall Plan. Here Mr. Beinart arrives at the touchiest part of his argument. He draws a clear comparison between the threat posed by totalitarian regimes in the 1940's and in the postwar period, and the threat posed today by armed Islamic fundamentalism. Democrats, he argues, must stop equivocating and brace themselves for a long, tough battle. Their worst enemy is not George W. Bush. "If today's liberals cannot rouse as much passion for fighting a movement that flings acid at unveiled women as they do for taking back the Senate in 2006," he writes in his stirring introduction, "they have strayed far from liberalism's best traditions." As it happens, liberals are much better equipped to lead and win this fight than the Republicans, in Mr. Beinart's view. They proved during the cold war that the United States could win international respect by pursuing foreign policy goals with humility and restraint, and by investing heavily in foreign aid to shore up fragile democracies. Above all, they understood that foreign and domestic policies were indivisible: the United States could not afford to preach one set of values to the rest of the world while practicing another within its own borders. This same strategy can work again. Unfortunately, as Mr. Beinart sees it, the grim slog in Iraq is encouraging a dangerously isolationist, even defeatist, mood in the Democratic Party. He cites a poll, taken after the 2004 elections, showing that Republicans, and Americans overall, believed that dismantling Al Quaeda was one of the top two foreign-policy objectives for the United States. Among Democrats, it tied for 10th. He finds this disheartening. "America badly needs an alternative vision — rooted in the liberal tradition — for fighting global jihad," he writes. "And yet the liberalism emerging today denies that fighting global jihad should even be a priority." Liberals must take on this fight, Mr. Beinart writes, if only out of self-preservation. Without a clear policy on how to address the jihadists, they will further lose touch with American voters and undermine the values of a liberal society. In the climate of fear that followed the 9/11 attacks, Americans willingly accepted infringements on their civil liberties inscribed in the Patriot Act. Further attacks, Mr. Beinart writes, would inevitably lead to more of the same. Many Democrats on the left, committed to "self-righteous inaction," fearful that any exercise of American power might be imperialist, prefer to evade "the tragic choices that defending freedom requires," Mr. Beinart argues. Anything less than moral perfection is unacceptable. He points out, with some exasperation, that "America could not have built schools for Afghan girls had it not bombed the Taliban first." In the liberal tradition, he writes, "there is no contradiction between recognizing that our enemies are not intrinsically evil, and recognizing that they must be fought, just as there is no contradiction between recognizing that although we are not intrinsically good, we must still fight them." "The Good Fight" is a bracing read, a good two-fisted polemic intended to stiffen the Democratic spine. Mr. Beinart, although reasonable and judicious, knows how to lay out an argument. Yes, he sometimes stacks the deck, but at least he does it with skilled hands. He believes that his brand of liberalism can inspire voters, and he may be right. It's the party he needs to convince, and that looks like a much tougher sell.

1001-> Lincoln Center Is Awash in Tchaikovsky and Shakespeare
Lincoln Center was positively awash in dramatic music of Tchaikovsky on Monday evening. As Valery Gergiev and the Metropolitan Opera were presenting the company's first production of "Mazeppa" next door (review, Page 1), Vladimir Jurowski and the Russian National Orchestra afforded an in-depth exploration of Tchaikovsky's ventures into Shakespeare in the second of their three concerts in Avery Fisher Hall. In fact, the concert, too, presented in a darkened hall with atmospheric stage lighting, felt like a night at the opera -- and not a short one. Three works of Shakespeare figured here in mixes of speech and music, assembled by Mr. Jurowski and Gerard McBurney, the director. First came "The Tempest": a recitation of Prospero's "Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves," followed by the symphonic fantasy "The Tempest." Then "Romeo and Juliet," making use of the first and third versions of the famous fantasy overture and a duet setting of the balcony scene drawing on the same music, this time with readings throughout. Then, after intermission, came the most extended adventure: a presentation of Tchaikovsky's incidental music for "Hamlet," beginning with the overture and ending with its original coda, and filled out with fanfares and entr'actes, and readings often piled atop the music in the style of the old melodrama. This mélange seemed to be what Mr. McBurney was referring to in a preconcert talk when he spoke of "one of the strangest performances I've ever worked on," though he may also have meant the evening as a whole. The program was long and intense, and the audience thinned out considerably at intermission. Listeners, as they must have suspected, had already heard the best music, in "Romeo." The Prospero reading added little to the "Tempest" music, and that music, far from Tchaikovsky's best, added little but length to the program. The original program order, starting with "Romeo," would undoubtedly have been even worse, but it might have made more sense to drop "The Tempest" altogether, start with "Hamlet" and close grandly with "Romeo." Michael Cumpsty, the speaker, mostly surmounted the difficult issues of timing when setting his words atop the music, but even amplified, he was less successful with issues of projection. Tatiana Monogarova, a soprano, after opening the "Romeo" duet with a shrill and misplaced high fortissimo, was winning in different ways as Juliet and the mad Ophelia. Vsevolod Grivnov, a tenor, was more consistently shrill and off pitch in the balcony scene (performed in a balcony), and his heavy reliance on the score forestalled any real dramatic electricity. Virtuosity was never the point of the evening, but Mr. Jurowski drew a fair share of it from the orchestra. He and the players end their series more conventionally tonight, playing music by Tchaikovsky as well as Stravinsky reworkings of it. But a question will be left hanging: why did this little festival, called "Winter Dreams" and pointedly devoted to lesser-known Tchaikovsky, present the overworked First Piano Concerto rather than, say, the brilliant and enchanting First Symphony, subtitled "Winter Dreams"? The Russian National Orchestra performs tonight at 8 at Avery Fisher Hall; (212) 721-6500.

1003-> Shostakovich, Coloring a Night With Feeling
People say “thank you” according to their means, and so in its own way the New York Philharmonic celebrated the Shostakovich centenary on Thursday night. It offered the first of the cello concertos and the famous Fifth Symphony at Avery Fisher Hall. Lynn Harrell was the soloist. Lorin Maazel conducted. This music  tortured, cynical, wistful, sometimes wildly funny  seems to ask for playing of the most personal kind: sound and movement that communicate nerves rubbed raw and inspire empathy and commiseration. None of these are qualities people associate with the New York Philharmonic and its current music director, but together these musicians have other things to give. Foremost is an astonishing level of execution. I have been admiring up close, and for many years, the Philharmonic’s sheer brilliance of tone and fineness of performance, but its performances in the last few weeks seem to have reached another level. Philip Myers’s shining, steadfast horn solos in the concerto were just one example of how well this orchestra is playing. One can criticize with cause Mr. Maazel’s programming, his occasional perversity of interpretation and his general aloofness from the musical life of the city, but it is hard to deny that his players sound terrific. The First Cello Concerto is post-Stalin. It bears bruises of past persecutions but also a fearlessness in the originality of its design  particularly in the centrally located cadenza, with its whiny harmonics and meandering length. The slow movement is another example of a composer who finds new ways of speaking a tonal language so many of his contemporaries had given up as dead. Mr. Harrell played it all with energy, sureness and sympathy. The Fifth Symphony, from 1937, says not so much “thank you” as “I’m sorry.” It responds to a bad review of the opera “Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District” received from the chief Soviet music critic: Stalin himself. The four movements are an impressive combination of submissiveness and personal assertion, filled with enough nationalistic trumpeting to placate the commissars and yet beautiful as only Shostakovich could be beautiful. As for the New York Philharmonic, maybe it is unrealistic to expect an orchestra that is well paid, comfortable and luxuriating in a great city to come that close to the naked sensibilities of music like this. But it would be equally unfair to call the playing cold and removed. It is sensibility of a different kind, and how fortunate listeners are to have this point of view to go along with so many others.

1004-> Spinach Called Safe
Consumers can now resume buying and eating fresh spinach, the Food and Drug Administration said. The tainted spinach all came from Natural Selection Foods, a vegetable grower and processor in San Juan Bautista, Calif., said David Acheson, chief medical officer for the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition of the F.D.A. All brands that were affected by an outbreak of E. coli that killed one person and sickened 188 in the United States and Canada have been recalled, Dr. Acheson said. In Idaho, health officials said that tests showed E. coli in Kyle Allgood, 2, of Chubbuck, who died on Sept. 20, eight days after his parents said he drank a smoothie that contained fresh spinach. The state is conducting more tests to determine if the strain of E. coli was the same one that killed a woman in Wisconsin.

1005-> From the South of Australia, a Bottle of Liquid Gold
Yellingbo, a nature reserve in southern Australia, is adjacent to olive groves that Howard Meltzer planted more than 10 years ago. Mr. Meltzer and his son, Jeremy, are now selling Yellingbo Gold oils from the 2006 harvest that will hold their own when drizzled on fish or vegetables. The unfiltered black label Limited Release version has more pronounced fruitiness. Both are kosher. The regular oil is $17.99 and the Limited Release is $19.99 for 16.75 ounces at Whole Foods; at Citarella the regular is $16.99 and the Limited Release $19.99. The Limited Release is $25 at worldsfoods.com. Five percent of the profits are donated to the Jasmine Foundation, which helps children orphaned in the tsunami in 2004. The Meltzers were among the founders. Francesco Realmuto, a former diamond-cutter, opened a gelato stand, L’Arte del Gelato, in the Chelsea Market, 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), about six months ago. Now, in addition to vibrant sorbets (including irresistible pomegranate) and suavely creamy gelatos (like cherry-vanilla and pistachio), he is making party cakes. The star for the season, below, combines eggnog gelato with dark chocolate and costs $28 to serve 6, or $39 to serve 10. There are also terrine-shaped decorated semifreddos in various flavors, including tiramisù. The cakes and semifreddos have to be ordered a day in advance. Scoops of sorbetto and gelato start at $3.75, pints are $9.50: (212) 366-0570. Here is a clever way to cover leftovers: translucent silicone lids by Kuhn-Rikon and Silicone Zone that fit various size bowls and containers. When pressed into place, these lids form a gentle vacuum seal that keeps the food fresher. They are sturdy enough to allow containers to be stacked and can also be used as trivets. The Kuhn-Rikon model, in rounds from 8 to 12½ inches in diameter, $13.95 to $19.95 at cooking.com, has a metal rim. Those by Silicone Zone, $11 to $25.99 for rounds from 6 inches, and including an oblong 9 by 13 inches, come in colors and are sold at Art of Cooking in Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Kitchen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and at cookwareessentials.com.

1006-> See You in the Funny Papers
“Masters of American Comics” is a landmark and a pleasure. For many people, I suspect, it will be a revelation too. Organized by the Hammer Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, where it made a splash, it has come east cut in size and split between the far-flung Newark and Jewish museums, in which it looks cramped. Art Spiegelman, one of the masters, who helped instigate the exhibition, felt so aggrieved by the circumstances that at nearly the 11th hour he pulled his work. This was a pity, for the obvious reasons, and also because the Jewish Museum scrambled to fill the gap he left by appending a half-baked display of superhero comic artists, some great although in general reinforcing the exact cliché about comics just being schlock for kids that the exhibition was conceived to undo. Good grief. Still, the show shouldn’t be missed. It spotlights artists like Chris Ware and Gary Panter, amazing state-of-the-art talents and endearing in the tradition of all those shy, gifted kids who drew endlessly in their rooms when other kids wouldn’t play with them, dreaming about someday telling the world, “I told you so.” Well, that day has come. Mr. Ware’s craftsmanship and supernatural ability to draw serve a singular, melancholy vision that mixes allusions to mechanical drawings, bygone comic artists, Charlie Brown and Superman (the caped crusader “as signifier of lost illusions,” as the show’s co-curator John Carlin, puts it). Jimmy Corrigan is one of Mr. Ware’s title characters and alter egos; the work is surpassingly sad and beautiful. Mr. Panter, also a virtuoso, but rooted in punk, riffs on Goya and Picasso and Ukiyo-e prints and medieval illuminated manuscripts along with Dick Tracy and the Fantastic Four. His “Jimbo” comics turn Mr. Panter’s evangelical past (raised in Texas, a missionary in Belfast), with an evangelist’s stress on storytelling, into wild postapocalyptic fantasies. Forget Batman and Robin fantasy. Think Bosch and Blake. But we’ve gotten ahead of ourselves. The show tracks a century of formal comics invention (in Newark, mostly early strips; at the Jewish Museum, different comic book incarnations) through what are meant to be mini-retrospectives. This means Elzie Crisler Segar’s “Thimble Theater,” which introduced Popeye (he was far, far darker than the spinach-addled television cartoon), and Milton Caniff’s superstylish “Terry and the Pirates.” It means Frank King’s languid “Gasoline Alley” and Chester Gould’s “Dick Tracy,” which set the standard for hard-boiled grit and packed a visceral punch that came from tightly organized colors and shapes (Mr. Spiegelman calls it “blueprint Expressionism”) until Mr. Gould went kind of gaga and launched Tracy into outer space to fight bad guys on the moon in a rocket-powered garbage can. “Peanuts” is also in the show, in Newark, where Mr. Spiegelman (he and I visited there the other day) pointed out how its creator, Charles M. Schulz, designed the strip to be readable on a small scale and in different formats: either laid out left to right or in a box. The elegance of all great comics is that they capitalize on the medium’s shifting limitations. Mr. Schulz drew for the new tabloids. He invented a kind of graphic minimalism, which came, chronologically, to dovetail in the most unexpected way with art world minimalism. The warm-puppy side of Charlie Brown disguised the strip’s consistent psychological depth, until Mr. Schulz ran out of steam. Its simplicity belied the sophistication of his gossamer line. As a commercial enterprise, Mr. Spiegelman added, “Peanuts” was what he and underground artists of the 1960’s and 70’s like R. Crumb thought they were rebelling against. Now, he said, he can see the strip’s finesse thanks to younger artists like Mr. Ware. Mr. Schulz aside, comics aficionados will argue about which masters have been grievously excluded from the show. (Where’s Charles Burns? Daniel Clowes? Lynda Barry? Milt Gross? Jules Feiffer? Alex Raymond?) That’s a sure sign of the vitality of a field that has produced a slew of great artists over a century who haven’t had their due in museums. American comics arose partly because of new color-printing technologies that fueled circulation wars between Hearst and Pulitzer. The comic strip’s first genius back then was Winsor McCay, a Midwesterner, born just after the Civil War, a sign painter who developed a vaudeville routine painting outdoors high above a paying crowd, and who also drew carnival posters. Mr. McCay was as innovative an artist as America had at the turn of the 20th century. Working at The New York Herald, he early on drew a Sunday half-page feature called “Little Sammy Sneeze.” In it a toddler’s “ka-chow!” cracks the black-outline frame of the comic’s panel, as if it were a window, a joke exemplifying Mr. McCay’s fixation on the artifice of his craft. His strip also conveyed a Midwesterner’s goggle-eyed perspective on the metropolis. “Little Nemo in Slumberland,” which took over The Herald’s Sunday supplement cover in 1905, married something of Muybridge’s stop-action photography with Lewis Carroll to invent a phantasmagoric vision that guided a viewer’s eye seamlessly across differently shaped candied panels. They magically blended to make a collective cogent abstraction out of the page: the essence of comics art. Did I mention that Mr. McCay, in his ultra-finicky way, drew like a dream? With “Nemo” he did other strips like “Dream of the Rarebit Fiend,” in which a top-hatted dandy dashes along a city street that suddenly curves up and in on itself, becoming a tunnel, from which the bewildered fop slides (from one panel into the next) onto the seat of a bus, as if down a rabbit hole, saying he must have been dreaming. A slew of second-rate imitators and a few genuine pioneers followed Mr. McCay. One pioneer, the German artist Lyonel Feininger, briefly worked for The Chicago Tribune and also explored the medium’s formal devices. He turned the blank spaces between comic panels into architectural motifs, so that his pages had the look of late-19th-century buildings. And he drew changing landscapes that exploited the subtle color range of the early large-format Sunday supplements. Mr. Feininger had what you might call a German sense of humor. In Newark his work is a little lusterless sandwiched between “Nemo” and George Herriman’s great “Krazy Kat,” about which there is not much to add to a long history of praise except that it looks as fresh and modern as ever. All great art invents a universe unto itself, and Mr. Herriman even invented his own language (a crazy quilt of Spanish, Yiddish, English and slang). His slapstick strip, anticipating Beckett, unfolds in a desert landscape whose surrealism also beat Surrealists to the punch. Rooted in doodling, Mr. Herriman’s scratchy, elastic line revolutionized the art of comics, as did his canny psychologizing. You can see the influence throughout the show, particularly on Harvey Kurtzman’s Mad magazine and Mr. Crumb’s “Zap” comics. It’s too bad that both Mr. Kurtzman and Mr. Crumb are shortchanged at the Jewish Museum. Mr. Kurtzman altered not just the comics business, with his taboo-stomping Mad, but helped liberate a whole generation of rebellious teenagers. He deserves better than a Mad cover or two and a “Little Annie Fanny” spread from Playboy, the gig that marked his decline. Where are his thumbnail sketches, his early short humor comics, which were seeds for Mad, and which were in Los Angeles? At least one of Mr. Kurtzman’s great war comics about Korea is here. “Corpse on the Imjin!” — eschewing gung-ho propaganda — turns hand-to-hand combat into pure visual poetry. It’s a model of economy and dark human truth and, above all, of how the best comic artists organize and pace drama and text across a page. As for Mr. Crumb, he’s still the Picasso of comics: the unavoidable influence on all younger artists. His early drawings here, done with his brother Charles, are shockingly good. If he can be a little fastidious sometimes, he’s always ingenious and himself. The Jewish Museum cut out some of his racier works that had been in the exhibition in Los Angeles, lest they offend delicate visitors. Never mind the offense their exclusion does to the public’s intelligence and the show’s integrity. I can’t forget Will Eisner, master of the comic sweatshop. The show includes one of Mr. Eisner’s drawings for a “splash,” or title, page of his “Spirit” strip, and the printed version of it, each of which has its own aura, and raises the issue central to comic art: What is an original? “The Spirit,” which had snappy cinematic ambitions, was full of vertiginous views of the big bad city. Mr. Eisner’s later career as a graphic novelist, a term he coined, led him toward maudlin stories ruminating on God, but before that, he set a standard for the industry. And last but not least: Jack Kirby, whose “Fantastic Four,” “Captain America” and “Thor” crashed through Marvel Comics’ gaudy pages into the 1970’s. Their radicalism was plain to see. Being visual space busters, they have done more or less for the art of comics what Cubism did for painting. Forgive me. Mr. Kirby doesn’t need Cubism to justify his work any more than the other masters here do. They’re all heroes of an American tradition based on creative pragmatism. Superheroes, that is.

1007-> Trying to Shed Light on the Muddle of Long-Term Care
Most people don't hesitate to insure their life, car or home. But insurance for long-term care? They'll think about it, thanks. It's not that people don't think they'll ever get old -- and, perhaps, be unable to care for themselves. But those huge premiums, year after year, off into the sunset, leave a nagging fear that the money might go down the drain. Perhaps people feel they might be able to fend for themselves till near the end, and the money saved on insurance might cover their last chapter. If not, there's always (they hope) Medicare. But it's all rather vague. Now Inquiry, a publication of Excellus Health Plan, has tried to inject some precision into this dilemma. Among the forecasts in its study: half of those now turning 65 will face no out-of-pocket expenses for long-term care, but for an unlucky 6 percent, even investing $100,000 at 65 won't cover it. For the rest, maybe they can put away enough, maybe not. But over all, Inquiry projects, the government will pick up more than half the tab. Is that clearer now? HUBERT B. HERRING

1008-> Politicians Go on Parade in Brooklyn, and Some Come Under Fire
The four-way Democratic race for a Congressional seat in Brooklyn intensified yesterday on the busiest campaign day of the New York primary season, as one candidate faced hecklers — and even a hurtling doughnut — in a showdown that underscored the racial tensions in that race. The biggest names in state politics also descended on Eastern Parkway for the West Indian American Day Carnival Parade, like Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, a candidate for re-election, and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, a candidate for governor. Both are on next Tuesday’s primary ballot and were eager to energize voters in hopes of increasing their margins of victory. Yet it was the candidates in the two fiercest primary contests, the Brooklyn Congressional race and a four-man competition for attorney general, who had the most to gain from the voter contact along the route before tens of thousands of New Yorkers, at least some of whom were surely Democrats still undecided about their Primary Day choices. And if the scene was typically jubilant for a parade, there was also unpredictability elsewhere on the political trail. Angry residents of Wyckoff Gardens, a public housing complex in the Boerum Hill neighborhood, confronted one of the Congressional candidates, City Councilman David Yassky, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, heckling them as they announced a $600,000 allocation for security cameras. The news conference, held in the courtyard of the complex after both men visited the parade, was to be a boost for Mr. Yassky. But it quickly degenerated as a hostile crowd gathered and jeered, exposing the racial fault lines running through the campaign. Mr. Yassky is white and his three rivals are black; African-American politicians have held the seat for decades. “We don’t need him,” a few in the crowd shouted, referring to Mr. Yassky. Others called out, “Are the cameras going to catch police harassment?” and “We need jobs.” Things got so out of hand that at one point, the mayor’s companion, Diana Taylor, the state banking superintendent, took cover beneath a concrete overhang to avoid a chocolate frosted doughnut flung from the upper reaches of an apartment building. “This was a joke,” Beverly Corbin, a longtime resident, said of the news conference, “and it was a political ploy played on the people of Wyckoff Gardens. “And I’m mad about it because I’m a black woman who has lived here and has worked and paid taxes,” she continued, saying that the residents were being used and that both men should have come to the project when they “had shootings here.” “It wasn’t about no cameras, it was about supporting David Yassky,” she said, adding that city housing workers had rushed to clean up the grounds in recent days in preparation for the visit. A man in the crowd, Eddie Leigh, said, “It’s all politics — why come here?” None in the crowd would say whether they worked for any of Mr. Yassky’s opponents. Mr. Bloomberg, who has frequently slipped and referred to Mr. Yassky as Congressman, said that he was not endorsing the councilman’s candidacy. But the mayor, a Republican, had extremely kind words for Mr. Yassky nonetheless. “I’ll leave it up to the voters who they vote for, but he is a guy who’s really cared and has done exactly what I think City Council people should do: Focus not on yelling and screaming, but focus on trying to make life better in this city,” said Mr. Bloomberg, who was still in the festive hot pink sweater and matching socks he had worn for his march in the Caribbean parade. The parade’s proximity to the primary has always made it a prime spot for political photo opportunities. Four years ago, Mrs. Clinton decided to march alongside State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, then a candidate for governor, instead of a rival candidate, Andrew M. Cuomo, who withdrew from the campaign soon after. This year, Mr. Cuomo is a candidate for attorney general, and he marched with his three daughters — at first, just in front of Mrs. Clinton’s contingent. But Mr. Cuomo began to walk faster and caught up with the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was walking beside State Senator Carl Andrews, a candidate in the Brooklyn Congressional race. Mr. Sharpton was clearly one of the most popular political figures in the parade, with near universal recognition and applause; only Senator Clinton drew more enthusiastic cheers, as women and girls leaned over barricades to shout out warmly as she passed by. Mr. Sharpton said in an interview that he did not know if he would endorse Mr. Cuomo in the primary. “We’ll see,” he said, adding that he was interested in the campaign of Charlie King, another candidate in the Democratic primary for attorney general. By walking with Mr. Andrews, Mr. Sharpton sought to bolster his campaign in a parade that winds through a major thoroughfare in the 11th Congressional District. Another of Mr. Yassky’s rivals in the primary in the 11th Congressional District, Yvette Clarke, a city councilwoman whose mother was the first Jamaican-born member of the Council, campaigned at the parade with a large group of supporters. She walked along Eastern Parkway with United States Representative Anthony D. Weiner, who used a bullhorn to shout his support of Ms. Clarke to the cheering crowd. Mr. Yassky was received politely along the route. And the other Congressional candidate, Chris Owens, was there with a group of supporters, and at one point played a steel drum while riding on a flatbed truck with a group of Caribbean musicians. His father, Representative Major R. Owens, is retiring from the Congressional seat. Mr. Cuomo’s three rivals in the attorney general’s race, Mr. King, Mark Green and Sean Patrick Maloney, also waved and shook hands along the parade route. Mr. Green — whose fierce attacks were returned this weekend as Mr. Cuomo released his first negative television commercial — marched with former Mayor David N. Dinkins. Mark Benoit, a spokesman for Mr. Green, argued that the Brooklyn Congressional race would help Mr. Green because it would draw more Democrats to the polls — and many of them would remember Mr. Green fondly from his years as the city’s public advocate in the 1990s. “Any race in New York City that brings out the vote will help Mark,” Mr. Benoit said, “and the Brooklyn race has got a lot of people feeling engaged.” Another candidate who campaigned in this heavily Democratic borough was Jeanine F. Pirro, the Republican candidate for attorney general. She did not wear the flat shoes that many parade marchers chose, instead donning a pair of heels while carrying 14 flags of various Caribbean islands.

1009-> National Briefing | Mid-Atlantic: Pennsylvania: Man Accused Of Qaeda Conspiracy
A man arrested in an F.B.I. sting operation has been accused by a federal grand jury of trying to conspire with Al Qaeda to destroy major oil and gas pipelines in the United States and disrupt the nation's economy. The man, Michael C. Reynolds, left, 47, could face up to 80 years in prison and fines totaling $1.5 million if found guilty, according to the indictment filed Tuesday in the Federal District Court. Mr. Reynolds's lawyer, Joseph O'Brien, had no comment. The F.B.I. arrested Mr. Reynolds in a sting in December 2005. The prosecution said Mr. Reynolds began communicating with what he believed were Qaeda operatives through a Web-based chat group in October 2005. His contact in the forum was not a member of Al Qaeda, however, and began cooperating with the authorities.

1010-> Roddick Seeking Answers After Another Early Exit
MELBOURNE, Australia, Monday Jan. 23 - Marcos Baghdatis played well in his upset of Andy Roddick in the fourth round of the Australian Open. The trouble for Roddick is that Baghdatis, a 20-year-old Cypriot, is only the latest young and unseeded opponent to play well enough to beat him in the tournaments that matter most. Roddick was upset by Joachim Johansson of Sweden in the quarterfinals of the United States Open in 2004 and by Gilles Muller of Luxembourg in the first round last year. At the French Open, which does not offer Roddick's favorite surface, he was beaten on clay in the second round last year by Jose Acasuso of Argentina. On Sunday, under the closed roof at Rod Laver Arena, it was the 54th-ranked Baghdatis's turn to use Roddick for a career boost, winning, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4. Though Roddick had not dropped a set in his first three matches here, playing with renewed belief, he could never find a foolproof method of breaking down the defenses of Baghdatis, his much less experienced opponent. Like Muller, Roger Federer and Roddick, Baghdatis is a former world junior champion. And with the exception of the second set, he hit backhands down the line for winners off Roddick's normally more imposing forehands. He passed Roddick on critical points when Roddick pushed forward to the net, and he strung together effective returns off one of the game's most fearsome servers. When it came time to serve for his biggest victory, Baghdatis won the game at love. "I'm absolutely not surprised Marcos won," said Ivan Ljubicic, the seventh-seeded Croat who is in the quarterfinals here and has beaten Roddick twice in the past year. But in the aftermath of his latest disappointment, Roddick looked as perplexed as he did preoccupied. He arrived in fine shape, having cut short his 2005 season in November to give himself time to recover before this year. "I don't know if it's as easy just to shrug off; it's disappointing when you feel like you've put in the work," he said. "You know, there are no unanswered questions in my eyes as far as preparation and stuff like that. So you're kind of left searching a little bit." In the halls and courtside seats of Melbourne Park, the debate over the state of his game continued. There were essentially two schools of thought. The first, represented by the former star Jim Courier, is that there is no reason for Roddick to panic and that Roddick is still in the hit-or-miss process of trying to fashion himself into a more complete, attack-minded player. "The alarm bells shouldn't start ringing, but I think this loss is a wake-up call for Andy to begin thinking about making some midmatch transition," Courier said. "I don't think he coached himself very well in this match. I think he's playing pretty well. He's serving pretty well, but he's not making the adjustments he needs to make. He kept going to the Baghdatis forehand and was burned on it just way too many times, and in the fourth set he tried to come forward too much." The second school of thought, represented by the former Swedish champion Mats Wilander, is that Roddick is an increasingly lost soul with plummeting confidence and prospects who is gradually giving ground and computer points to the up-and-coming set while the smooth-moving Federer turns into a speck on the horizon. "He's now gone from being a really great talent or whatever to, in my mind, not a great player anymore," Wilander said of Roddick. "Now it's becoming ordinary, totally ordinary." Wilander expressed frustration with Roddick's tactics against Baghdatis, particularly his tendency to hit huge forehand returns from way behind the baseline that left too much of the court open for Baghdatis to hit backhand winners. He said he was also mystified by Roddick's decision to hit sliced backhands from positions of strength. "When he's not in control of the point, he tries to hit a two-hander," Wilander said. "He's got the whole strategy turned around." Wilander also said Roddick's increasingly frequent forays to the net were too predictable. "He's neutralized his own game and power; he's neutralized himself," Wilander said. Roddick and his coach of one year, Dean Goldfine, came into the Open talking about being more consistently aggressive. But they also conceded that it took time to learn how to make the right choices under pressure, and also for Roddick to improve his volleying, which is competent but far from excellent in an era when racket technology has made precise passing shots easier. "A lot of the times, a lot of winners he hit were from passing shots behind the baseline," Roddick said of Baghdatis. "A lot of times I was in control of the point, and he came up with the goods. A couple of times, I was sloppy at the wrong moments. You know, that's the way it is." The way it will be for Roddick, 23, remains unclear. It is hard to come up with an encore after winning the 2003 United States Open at 21 and finishing No. 1 in the ranking that same year. For some players, reaching successive Wimbledon finals -- as Roddick did in 2004 and 2005 -- would suffice. But he is not projecting fulfillment, and his strong presence in advertising campaigns magnifies his failures. "The thing that happened to Andy, and I think that in some ways has hurt him and has been a bit of a curse, was winning the U.S. Open as young as he did when really I don't think he was a complete tennis player at that point," Goldfine said last week. "I think he's becoming more and more of a complete tennis player." For the moment, however, his recent results in Grand Slam tournaments do not reflect that. NOTES Third-seeded Amélie Mauresmo reached the quarterfinals Monday with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over the Czech teenager Nicole Vaidisova. On Sunday night, Maria Sharapova advanced to the final eight with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Daniela Hantuchova. Sharapova will now try to beat her Russian countrywoman Nadia Petrova for the third straight time in a Grand Slam event. Nicolas Kiefer of Germany beat Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 6-3, and Nikolay Davydenko of Russia defeated the 12th-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, after being down two sets and a break. Fabrice Santoro, 33, of France finally reached the quarterfinals in a major on his 54th attempt by defeating the 11th-seeded Spaniard David Ferrer, 6-4, 7-5, 7-5.

1011-> Searching for Dummies
Plainsboro, N.J. - TALK of decline was old news in academia even in 1898, when traditionalists blasted Harvard for ending its Greek entrance requirement. But today there's a new twist in the story: Are search engines making today's students dumber? In December, the National Center for Education Statistics published a report on adult literacy revealing that the number of college graduates able to interpret complex texts proficiently had dropped since 1992 from 40 percent to 31 percent. As Mark S. Schneider, the center's commissioner of education statistics, put it, "What's disturbing is that the assessment is not designed to test your understanding of Proust, but to test your ability to read labels." The Higher Education Supplement of The Times of London reports that a British survey also finds that the ability of undergraduates to read critically and write cogently has fallen significantly since 1992. Students are not just more poorly prepared, a majority of queried faculty members believe, but less teachable. While some blame reality television, MP3 players, cellphones or the multitasking that juggles them all, the big change has been the Web. Beginning in the early 1990's, schools, libraries and governments embraced the Internet as the long promised portal to information access for all. And at the heart of their hopes for a cultural and educational breakthrough were superbly efficient search engines like Google and those of its rivals Yahoo and MSN. The new search engines not only find more, they are more likely to present usable information on the first screen. Google modestly declares its mission "to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful." But convenience may be part of the problem. In the Web's early days, the most serious search engine was AltaVista. To use it well, a searcher had to learn how to construct a search statement, like, say, "Engelbert Humperdinck and not Las Vegas" for the opera composer rather than the contemporary singer. It took practice to produce usable results. Now, thanks to brilliant programming, a simple query usually produces a first page that's at least adequate -- "satisficing," as the economist Herbert Simon called it. The efficiency of today's search engines arises from their ability to analyze links among Web sites. Google led in ranking sites by how often they are linked to other highly ranked sites. It did so using an elaborate variation of a concept familiar in natural science, citation analysis. Instead of looking at which papers are cited most often in the most influential journals, it measures how often Web pages are linked to highly ranked sites -- ranked by links to themselves. Citation analysis has been attacked in library circles for inflating the ratings (and indirectly the subscription prices) of certain journals. Search engines have the opposite problem: dispersion rather than concentration of interest. Despite constant tweaking, their formulas display irrelevant or mediocre sites on a par with truly expert ones. Curious about the academic field of world history? A neophyte would find little help entering "world history" in Google. When I tried, the only article on the world history movement, from the open-source Wikipedia project, didn't appear until the fifth screen and was brief and eccentric, erroneously dating the field from the 1980's. (In fairness to Wikipedia, that entry has since been corrected and improved; moreover, the paid-access Encyclopaedia Britannica site has no specific article at all.) Only on the seventh screen did I find the World History Network site, financed by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and it is not yet a good portal for beginners. Many students seem to lack the skills to structure their searches so they can find useful information quickly. In 2002, graduate students at Tel Aviv University were asked to find on the Web, with no time limit, a picture of the Mona Lisa; the complete text of either "Robinson Crusoe" or "David Copperfield"; and a recipe for apple pie accompanied by a photograph. Only 15 percent succeeded at all three assignments. Today, Google may have expedited such tasks, but the malaise remains. In the February newsletter of the American Historical Association, the reference librarian Lynn D. Lampert notes the prevalence of "ill-conceived (or often nonexistent) student research practices." As another university librarian, Pamela Martin, observed, "Google's simplicity and impressive search prowess trick students into thinking they are good all-around searchers, and when they fail in library searches, they are ashamed as well as confused." Higher education is fighting back. Librarians are teaching "information literacy" and establishing alternative Web indexes. Graduate students, in the front lines as teaching assistants, are starting to discuss joining Wikipedia rather than fighting it, as many instructors still, quixotically, do. Can better information in the classroom produce the literate, numerate society the Web once promised? There are two ways to proceed. More owners of free high-quality content should learn the tradecraft of tweaking their sites to improve search engine rankings. And Google can do more to educate users about the power -- and frequent advisability -- of its advanced search options. It would be a shame if brilliant technology were to end up threatening the kind of intellect that produced it. Op-Ed Contributor Edward Tenner, the author most recently of "Our Own Devices: How Technology Remakes Humanity," is working on a book about positive unintended consequences.

1012-> Few Reasons to Protest This God and King
The set for Jean-Pierre Ponnelle’s 1982 production of Mozart’s “Idomeneo” at the Metropolitan Opera is dominated by a huge detached head of a god. But the god in question is Neptune, who does not appear to have much of a constituency in New York these days. So before the performance on Thursday night, the first of the season, there was no fear of violent protest for desecrating a sacred figure, as there had been recently at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, where Hans Neuenfels’s controversial production of “Idomeneo” depicts the decapitated head of Muhammad, along with those of Jesus, Buddha and, as it turns out, Neptune. The threat so alarmed the directors of the Berlin company that they canceled a revival of the three-year-old production, a move that is being criticized in German cultural and political circles. At the Met, the revival of the highly stylized Ponnelle production, with its crumbling columns, simple painted flats and elaborate 18th-century costumes, proved a solid success on Thursday. Credit the sensitive conducting of James Levine, a vigorous champion of this breakthrough opera seria by the 24-year-old Mozart, and the singing of an exceptional cast, with Ben Heppner in the title role. Mr. Heppner, the leading Wagnerian tenor of our time, may seem an unlikely choice to sing a florid and demanding part in a Mozart opera. Actually, Idomeneo was the role of his 1991 Met debut, and there are good vocal reasons for him to return to it now. In recent decades, as this opera has gained a rightful place in the repertory, Idomeneo has been taken on by powerhouse tenors who emphasize the heroic dimensions of the role as conceived by Mozart. Luciano Pavarotti sang it when this production was new; the heldentenor Siegfried Jerusalem was another Met Idomeneo. More recently, Plácido Domingo made the role a specialty at the house. Right from his first scene, when the tormented Idomeneo, the king of Crete, is washed up on the shore of his homeland in the aftermath of the bitter Trojan War, Mr. Heppner sang with clarion tone and heroic heft, yet Mozartean refinement. In the story, when Idomeneo’s ship is close to being wrecked during a terrible storm at sea, the king makes a fateful bargain with Neptune: if the god will rescue him and his crew, Idomeneo will sacrifice the first person he meets on shore. That person turns out to be the king’s devoted son, Idamante. It may surprise Mr. Heppner’s admirers to hear this Tristan tenor singing embellished vocal lines, fancy passagework and trills, but he pulls it off. Indeed, Mr. Heppner opts for the ornately embellished original version of Idomeneo’s show-stopping Act II aria, “Fuor del mar,” in which he describes the storm raging within his soul. Mozart later wrote a simplified version of the aria, which was favored by Mr. Domingo, among others who have sung it at the Met. Mr. Heppner is smart to restrict the number of times he sings Tristan and to maintain Idomeneo, which should help him keep lightness and flexibility in his voice. The admirable mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson brought a rich voice and dramatic poignancy to the role of Idamante. The most exquisite singing of the night came from the soprano Dorothea Röschmann as Ilia, the captured Trojan princess who falls in love with Idamante. Ms. Röschmann’s voice has a distinctively earthy quality and throbbing warmth. Elettra, Ilia’s rival for the love of Idamante, was the bright-voiced soprano Olga Makarina, who sang with vigor and clarity but indulged in melodramatic touches instead of getting at the vengeful demons within her character. The hardy tenor Jeffrey Francis had a solid Met debut as Arbace, Idomeneo’s adviser. Mr. Levine drew a supple, nuanced and lucid account of this elegant work from the Met chorus and orchestra. At times, in a striving for nobility, the performance lost tension and seemed subdued. Everyone should gain confidence as the run continues.

1013-> Major Russian TV Station Is Accused of Censorship
MOSCOW, Jan. 1 - Recent turmoil in the news department of REN-TV, Russia's last nationwide television network with independent news programming, has caused concern among media analysts and free-speech advocates in the country. Last July, RTL Group, the broadcasting arm of the Bertelsmann Group, agreed to buy a 30 percent stake in REN-TV from Irena Lesnevskaya, who founded and ran the channel with her son, Dmitry Lesnevsky. Some journalists are criticizing RTL for not intervening in what they say are moves to restrict the station's coverage REN-TV has been known for critical news reporting that offered an alternative to state channels' uniformly positive coverage of President Vladimir V. Putin, media analysts said. Its signal reaches more than 113 million people, although its audience share hovers around 5 percent. "REN-TV was the last channel that had real news, people who tried to speak the truth," Aleksei Simonov, the president of the Glasnost Defense Foundation, a press freedom group, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station in October. Olga Romanova, the host of a news analysis program called "24," said that on Nov. 24, private security guards blocked her from entering the studio at the network's Moscow headquarters. She said the move was on the orders of Alexander Ordzhonikidze, a former gas industry and satellite television executive who was appointed by the new shareholders as chief executive of REN-TV Media Holding, parent company of the television channel. Mr. Ordzhonikidze told the Russian media that he was trying out new anchors for the program and that security in the studios was tight. Ms. Romanova said that in the weeks leading up to her departure as anchor, she protested what she said were Mr. Ordzhonikidze's decisions to keep several reports off the air -- pressure that began after she broadcast a report about a pro-fascist march in Moscow on Nov. 4. The reports included one about elections in Kazakhstan and another about prosecutors dropping charges against Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov's son, who was accused of killing a pedestrian with his car, Ms. Romanova said. In another example of what she called censorship, Ms. Romanova said, a report about a football team of homeless men from St. Petersburg traveling to Ireland to defend its title in the world homeless soccer championship was withdrawn by the new management. "It was removed with the words, 'There are no homeless people in St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg is rich, it is the city of the president,' " she said. Mr. Ordzhonikidze told the Interfax news agency, "I didn't give anyone any orders to remove any reports." Ralph Siebenaler, an RTL executive who has helped develop the group's stations in Central and Eastern Europe and was appointed chief executive of REN-TV, did not intervene, Ms. Romanova said. Mr. Siebenaler said in an e-mail message: "When you have a change of management in a company, it happens unfortunately that parts of the former management team do not get along with the new team." He added, "As news does not lie in my sphere of responsibilities in the channel, I do not want to openly comment about the acts and deeds of the people involved." RTL's investment in REN- TV is in part indicative of Russia's booming television advertising market. Renaissance Capital, a Moscow investment bank, reported this year that the television advertising market was expected to have grow by 36.5 percent, to $2 billion in 2005. Andrew Buckhurst, a senior vice president at RTL Group's headquarters in Luxembourg, said in an e-mail response to questions, "We are not aware of any political interference in the policies or decisions of the station. If we were, we would obviously be concerned." Mr. Buckhurst added, "While we are a minority shareholder with just 30 percent, we are clearly the shareholder with experience in the TV world, but it should be noted that we cannot be held responsible for ensuring or guaranteeing press freedom from this minority position." He continued: "All three shareholders share the same view that REN must continue with its editorial line, offering a full service to its audience, including news." RTL shares ownership of the station with a Russian steel maker and an oil company, whose chief executives both campaigned for President Putin in the 2004 presidential race. Unified Energy System, the electricity monopoly, sold its 70 percent stake in REN-TV in July to a subsidiary of Severstal, one of Russia's biggest steel makers, for $100 million. Severstal is led by the 40-year-old billionaire Aleksei Mordashov. Mr. Mordashov in turn sold 35 percent of REN-TV to Surgutneftegaz, a large Russian oil company headed by Vladimir Bogdanov, a reclusive Siberian billionaire. Some journalists and analysts say that Unified Energy System sold a part of its stake in REN-TV under Kremlin pressure. They also speculate that Severstal bought it at the Kremlin's request to clear the airwaves of critical coverage of President Putin and the government before the parliamentary and presidential elections in 2007 and 2008. Anatoly Chubais, the chairman of Unified Energy System and a liberal politician, has said that the company was divesting noncore assets. Ms. Romanova said she thought that executives were acting out of a desire to please the authorities, not on direct orders from the Kremlin. "For two days I sat and was silent, and then I quit," she said. Several news editors and staff members followed, she said, and several liberal newspapers, Web publications and the Ekho Moskvy radio station declared that independent television news was dead.

1014-> Vonage Buyers Told to Pay for Shares
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (Dow Jones/AP) — Vonage Holdings investors who have balked at paying for shares they bought in the company’s initial public offering, now worth less than half of the original price, began receiving letters this week from brokerage firms telling them to write a check or risk legal action. The exact number of letters that were sent to nonpaying investors this week was not disclosed, but the company said last month that customers of its Internet telephone service who signed up for the offering had refused to pay for more than a million shares. Vonage had set up the directed share program to allow its customers to participate in the May offering, and about 9,000 of them ultimately signed up to purchase 4.2 million shares. Anyone hoping for an easy profit was disappointed. Shares in the company, based in Holmdel, N.J., sank 13 percent on their first day of trading, meaning that investors in the offering had to pay more for the stock than it was worth after its debut, and some simply refused to do so. Shares of Vonage closed Tuesday at $7.55, down 56 percent from the initial offering price of $17.

1016-> A Duplex Large Enough to Get Lost In
THE point of moving in together was to enhance their quality of life, not to diminish it. For Rosie McCobb and Philip Oxenstein, this meant finding a place cheap enough that each would be paying less than before, and big enough — clichés notwithstanding — to give each his or her own space. Ms. McCobb, 37, a Massachusetts native, rented a floor of a brownstone in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, for $1,200 a month. It was big and lofty, though the building was badly maintained. As a photographer and filmmaker, she loved the area's artistic ambience. Mr. Oxenstein, 40, who is from northern New Jersey, lived in a "tiny, tiny, tiny" fifth-floor walk-up on Avenue A in the East Village, costing $1,500. He didn't like his place much. The worst part was the incessant noise, both from within the building and outside. "There is a reckless rambunctiousness to the crowd that parties in the East Village," Mr. Oxenstein said. "It has become a difficult place to make a home." The two, who met at a bicycle race nearly two years ago, began spending most of their time at her place, which was quieter and bigger, though not big enough. "I have a lot of stuff, and the apartment was just packed — not in an embarrassing way — and Phil has a huge book collection in these huge old antique bookcases," Ms. McCobb said. "I would feel bad that he couldn't have his stuff with him, knowing how important my stuff is to me." So they decided to find a place together. When and where? "We found ourselves in conflict on both counts," Mr. Oxenstein said. Ms. McCobb was eager to begin the hunt to get an idea of what was available. And she wanted to stay nearby. "I love this neighborhood because I feel it represents who I am at my age," she said. Mr. Oxenstein needed time to warm to the idea. "I like to think through my decisions and consider all my options," he said. "I am not a snap decision maker, for this type of decision, anyway. I was a little obstinate and wasn't prepared to spend every weekend apartment hunting when I didn't see a viable move-in date." And he preferred Manhattan, partly because of the easier commute to his Times Square office, where he works for Reuters. "I was committed to the vague idea — in a wholly ignorant way, having done zero research — that I was going to find a place in Manhattan that would provide the space both of us needed," he said. "Rosie, meanwhile, has always been a real-estate-o-phile, so she was speaking from a position of some authority that the dream of a Manhattan apartment with a splendid amount of space was not going to happen." She started looking in Clinton Hill last winter. Brownstone apartments within their budget range — no more than $2,400 — were usually carved into small rooms. They were tempted by bargains. A three-bedroom on St. James Place was just $1,650, but the living room was cavernous while the bedrooms were tiny. "It would be great if we were a year away from buying and moved into it to save money, but our quality of life would go down significantly," Ms. McCobb said. The roominess of Taaffe Place Lofts was appealing, but they happened to visit on a weekend afternoon when "really, really, really loud music was coming out of an apartment," Mr. Oxenstein said. "The agent was red-faced and upset that was happening when we arrived." The apartment they decided on, with a big front room and a yard, was on Cambridge Place. Under the staircase, there was storage space for their five bicycles. It seemed likely they would get the apartment, which rented for $2,200, so they gave notice to their landlords. They waited nearly three weeks for confirmation. "They agreed to take us only if Phil would be the only one on the lease," because of her freelance employment status, Ms. McCobb said. She was furious. "I felt really discounted as a human being, to be told your boyfriend is good enough to be put on the lease but you are not," she said. "I wonder if there was a weird component because Phil and I aren't married." Any financial worries by the landlord were absurd, she said, "because Phil wouldn't be living here if it weren't for my contribution." "It didn't even make sense to have him sign and be financially responsible, because he can't afford it on his own," she said. Ms. McCobb figured there would be further problems with such a finicky landlord. And she didn't care to deal with a landlord who "made me question all these things about myself and made me feel bad." But she was getting worried, so she lined up eight appointments for one Saturday. She left a message about a large duplex in Clinton Hill with a yard and a dishwasher, requiring no broker's fee, but the agent was sick and said he would call a few days later. She set up a time with another agent to see a large duplex, also with a yard and a dishwasher. This one charged a fee. Both rented for $2,200. It occurred to her that it was the same unit. Meanwhile, the first agent called back. She canceled the other appointment, telling the second agent that "because we spoke to someone else first, we are going to see it with him." The apartment, on Lefferts Place, was enormous. Upstairs was a living room, dining room, two offices and a bathroom. Downstairs was a bedroom, a row of closets, a kitchen, a bathroom and a laundry room. Ms. McCobb declared it a diamond in the rough. But the kitchen was ugly. The two decided to see the day's remaining places. Later, they did a drive-by. A couple was standing out front. "They were younger than us, in their mid-20's, and we thought: 'They don't deserve to live here. They haven't suffered enough,' " Ms. McCobb said. They called the agent immediately and said they were interested in applying. Within days, they heard the apartment was theirs. There is space enough for all their stuff and more. "This place is large enough that one has to either travel or shout very loudly to get the attention of the other person," Mr. Oxenstein said. "I have taken to traveling, and Rosie has taken to shouting." Two months after moving in, Ms. McCobb is still busy decorating — her taste runs to midcentury modern, with an influence of Spanish textiles — and is feeling some pressure from her friends "to make the place fabulous," she said. The two are going out less, "because we both love the house so much we want to come home."

Angola may not be able to hold elections next year, President José Eduardo dos Santos said, hinting at yet another delay in the oil-rich African country's first vote since 1992. He said technical issues and the question of whether to hold presidential and legislative polls simultaneously made it difficult to envision they would occur as expected. Voting was originally scheduled for this year. Many political observers say there is little will among governing ruling party leaders to hold an election any time soon.

1023-> Dell Will Recall Batteries in PC’s
Dell is recalling 4.1 million notebook computer batteries because they could erupt in flames, the company said yesterday. It will be the largest safety recall in the history of the consumer electronics industry, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Dell, the world’s largest PC maker, said the lithium-ion batteries were made by Sony and were installed in notebooks sold from April 2004 to July 18 of this year. The recall raises broader questions about lithium-ion batteries, which are used in devices like cellphones, portable power tools, camcorders, digital cameras and MP3 players. The potential for such batteries to catch fire has been acknowledged for years, and has prompted more limited recalls in the past. But a number of recent fires involving notebook computers, some aboard planes, have brought renewed scrutiny. Dell has reported to the safety agency that it documented six instances since December in which notebooks overheated or caught on fire. None of the incidents caused injuries or death. Dell said the problems were a result of a manufacturing defect in batteries made by Sony. The safety agency said the batteries’ problems were not unique to Dell, meaning that other companies using Sony batteries might also have to issue recalls. Sony has sold its batteries to most of the major computer makers. The recalled batteries were used in 2.7 million Dell computers sold in the United States and 1.4 million sold overseas. The total is about 18 percent of Dell’s notebook production during the period in question. Depending on how many of the batteries are still in use, the cost of the recall could exceed $300 million. Dell refused to estimate the cost, but said the recall would not materially affect its profits. Sony, which affirmed yesterday that its batteries were responsible, said it was “financially supporting” Dell in the recall. Dell said it would notify affected customers by mail and online, or through corporate sales representatives, and arrange to send a replacement battery. In the meantime, it advised owners to remove the original battery and use a power cord. The largest previous safety recall of a consumer electronics product, in October 2004, involved a million lithium-ion batteries for Kyocera cellphones. Dell has been bedeviled by reports of burning laptops in recent months. In June, a Dell notebook burst into flames during a conference in a hotel in Osaka, Japan. In that case, an analysis showed the fire was probably caused by microscopic metal particles produced during the manufacturing process. In July, firefighters in Vernon Hills, Ill., were called to an office of Tetra Pak, the food processing and packaging company, to extinguish a notebook fire hot enough to burn the desk beneath it. That same month, a Dell notebook in the cab of a pickup parked alongside Lake Mead in Nevada caught fire, igniting ammunition in the glove box and then the gas tanks. The truck exploded. “A few minutes later and we’d have been coming up out of the canyon when the notebook blew up,” said Thomas Forqueran, owner of the computer and truck. “Somebody is going to wind up getting killed.” The battery problem is the latest setback for Dell, long a highflier on Wall Street. Faced with stiffer competition that has forced price cuts, it has reported lower-than-expected sales and earnings over the last year, sending its stock down more than 40 percent. It is spending $100 million to improve its customer service, which it found had alienated consumers. Dell executives hope the recall, while vast, will prevent further damage to its image. “We’re getting ahead of the issue,” said Alex Gruzen, senior vice president and general manager of the product group at the company. “I don’t want any further incidents to take place.” Other computer makers that use Sony batteries were taking stock yesterday of their possible exposure to similar problems. An Apple spokeswoman, Lynn Fox, said, “We are currently investigating whether batteries that have been supplied to Apple for our current and previous notebook lines meet our high standards for battery safety and performance.” A Hewlett-Packard spokesman said the company’s notebooks would not be affected by the recall because its batteries were designed specifically for its products. A Lenovo spokesman, Robert Page, said, “To date, we have not seen any unusual pattern or problems with notebook PC’s.” The company said its batteries were designed differently from those used by Dell. “Not all notebook batteries are the same,” Mr. Page said. Lithium-ion batteries pack more energy in a smaller space than other types of batteries. They are the cheapest form of battery chemistry and are increasingly being used in more types of consumer products. What that means, said Richard Stern, associate director of fuel, electrical and recreational products at the product safety commission, is “more batteries, more likelihood for quality-control problems and for design problems and so we’d expect more incidents and more recalls of these batteries.” The federal safety agency has negotiated 10 recalls of lithium-ion batteries used in notebook computers since 2000 and another 12 battery recalls for other electronic products, including a Disney-brand children’s DVD player. Federal regulations require that lithium-ion batteries be clearly marked with warnings when they are shipped in bulk on airplanes, and various agencies are considering more stringent regulations after a fire that was detected as a United Parcel Service cargo plane began its descent into Philadelphia in February. Though a cause of that fire, which consumed and destroyed the plane after it landed, has not been determined, lithium-ion batteries are suspected. No one was hurt. A single battery also caught fire in the overhead luggage bin of a Lufthansa passenger jet about to depart from O’Hare International Airport in Chicago in May. A flight engineer tossed it to the tarmac, where the fire was extinguished. (Neither of the incidents resulted in injuries, nor are they said to involve Dell computers or Sony batteries.) The Federal Aviation Administration lists three other incidents involving burning lithium-ion batteries on cargo and passenger planes since 2004. The portable battery industry has said there is not a broad problem with lithium-ion battery fires. But makers have known of the ability of lithium-ion batteries to catch fire since its first commercial use in 1991. In 1995, a Sony lithium-ion battery factory in Koriyama, Japan, was partly destroyed when a battery undergoing a quality test caught fire. The current recall also leaves many questions unanswered on how Dell, as well as the product safety commission, deals with information about fire-damaged notebooks. Although Dell told the agency that only six incidents had occurred, a reporter viewed almost 100 photos of melted notebooks that were returned to the company between 2002 and 2004. The photos, from a Dell database, were supplied by a former Dell technician, Robert Day, who said such damage “was more of a common thing than they are letting on.” As many as several hundred a year were returned. Mr. Day said, “I did see so many pallets of stuff coming in that they had to use my lab for overflow storage.” But David Lear, the director of environmental affairs and product safety at Dell, said most of the damage to those notebooks was unrelated to battery issues. “Ninety-nine percent of the time they are not safety issues,” he said. Dell officials refused to say how many computers had been returned because of heat or fire damage, but said the company had acted on the problem as soon as it realized there might be a pattern. Mr. Gruzen said the publicity surrounding the notebook fire at the Osaka hotel did not prompt Dell to look into the problem, because the company was already having conversations with Sony. But the Osaka incident focused the company’s attention on the possibility that the fires might be a more widespread problem than originally thought. “It’s not that six was the magic number; we just didn’t have enough material,” Mr. Lear said. Given the number of computers that Dell sells, even several hundred incidents a year is statistically minuscule, about one in several hundred thousand computers. “We are talking about triangulating on very sparse data,” Mr. Gruzen said. A member of Mr. Lear’s staff, who happened to be in Japan at the time of the notebook fire, retrieved the damaged computer. It was taken to a Los Angeles area lab of Exponent, a failure-analysis firm, for examination. The unit worked when it was plugged in to the power cord, despite the fire, which told the investigators that the problem was not with any circuitry or microchips. An X-ray of the battery pack told them the fire was not caused by an overcharged battery, because a safety device was still intact. Rather, Dell said the cause of the fire was a short circuit in one of the fuel cells. It was caused by microscopic metal particles that contaminated the electrolyte. Dell thinks that the particles were released when the case of the cell was crimped near the end of Sony’s manufacturing process. It was the same problem associated with the 22,000 notebooks that Dell recalled in December. Sony technicians, who took part in the examination at the Exponent lab, looked at additional data on all its batteries, not just those sold to Dell, that suggested a problem in the manufacturing process. “As events trickled in, they seemed to reinforce a conclusion that these Sony cells had an issue,” Mr. Gruzen said. “They don’t show a predictable pattern, which is why we wanted to get them out of the marketplace.” Sony is the second-largest maker of lithium-ion batteries for notebooks, after Sanyo. The new Dell batteries, which the company hopes to distribute over the next four weeks, will be made by Sony and other vendors. Dell said it was confident that Sony had solved the problem by changing part of its manufacturing methods. “We are absolutely confident that when we replace the batteries that we are getting the at-risk batteries out of consumers’ hands and that there will be no more incidents,” Mr. Gruzen said.

1025-> The Mosque, the Mayor and Great Moments on the Playing Field
ON April 14, 1972, a false alarm about a police officer in distress triggered a confrontation at Mosque No. 7 in Harlem, led at the time by Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam. The episode ended with the fatal shooting of Phillip Cardillo, one of the officers who responded. Intent on avoiding racial strife, City Hall dismissed suspicions of police assassination plots and even apologized to the mosque ministers for the police “invasion” that left Patrolman Cardillo dead. That response angered the police for decades. “At his funeral, there was no mayor, no police commissioner,” Randy Jurgensen, the detective who helped crack the case, once told me. “Today, there’s a different generation of cops, but they’ve never forgotten that case.” To make sure they don’t, Mr. Jurgensen, with Robert Cea, another detective, has written (Disinformation Company, $23.95). Not many cop books open with an epigram from Calvin Coolidge (“Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence”) and close with a quotation from Theodore Roosevelt, a New York City police commissioner before he was president (“The credit belongs to those who are actually in the arena”). In between, you may learn far more about the mosque killing and its unsatisfying aftermath than you bargained for. The book doesn’t drag, but the case did, continuing into 1980, when Patrolman Cardillo’s widow won a $3 million award in a negligence suit against the city. Not surprisingly, Mr. Jurgensen blames the killing on department brass and City Hall, and hints at a larger conspiracy. He also harbors more suspicions about a cover-up than have been proved — so far. Whatever your own conclusions, you’re in for a personal account of an infuriating and frustrating chapter in the city’s history, a story of a tenacious officer and a case that became an object lesson in miscommunication and political meddling within the Police Department, no matter how well intentioned. •Wayne Barrett, the veteran investigative reporter of The Village Voice, sometimes diminishes his considerable talent by sounding like a strident scold or delivering an unforgiving screed. But in (HarperCollins, $25.95), he and Dan Collins, a senior producer at CBSNews.com, offer a generally sober and genuinely sobering account of the former mayor’s performance before, during and after the event that transformed him from a tarnished hero into “America’s mayor.” The title hints accurately at the authors’ take on the Giuliani record, and their perspective, like that of the 9/11 commission, is infused with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight. But given all the hagiography that has been generated by the subject, “Grand Illusion” is a welcome and overdue corrective, one that amplifies the gaps in preparedness, management and communications, and challenges the post-9/11 legend. “He articulated our grief, shored up our confidence, and insisted on a levelheaded response that gave no berth to intolerance,” the authors write. “We resist knowing anything more — about the eight-year history of error and indifference that preceded that moment, or the toxic disengagement that followed it.” “Grand Illusion” is a product of dogged reporting. It briefly gives the former mayor his due, but it also traces a litany of planning, operational and other flaws that dent the hero’s armor and leave the reader frustrated. Wouldn’t it be great to get the authors and Mr. Giuliani in the same room to figure out who’s right about what? • Talk about welcome correctives. With another wait-till-next-year finish to the New York baseball season, there’s some solace to be gained by looking back at years past. And Stuart Miller, a journalist, has devised a perfect antidote to our long winter of discontent: (Houghton Mifflin, $40). “How do you weigh the relative merits of such wildly diverse sports and time periods, of great comebacks versus dominant performances, of championship moments versus classic wins in a season that ended in defeat?” Mr. Miller asks. New Yorkers will undoubtedly debate his rankings, but they will revel in what he calls our “self-imposed myopia” about sports. Among the 100 “greatest days” are the Mets’ 1969 World Series victory and the Ali-Frazier fight in 1971. A warning, though: the book also recounts some of the “worst days” in New York sports, including, of course, the departure of the Dodgers after the 1957 season and the point-shaving scandal at City College in 1951. •Just when we thought we might be safe, Dr. Irwin Redlener, who is director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, tells us in (Knopf, $24) that the country is in a state of “excessive vulnerability.” His focus is national, but the book contains grim warnings for New Yorkers. Dr. Redlener generally praises the city’s state of emergency preparedness. But in one hypothetical scenario, he warns that New York, like the nation, is no match for an epidemic of avian flu, which could kill 50,000 city residents. Proper planning, he writes, could shrink the death toll to 7,500. Nobody likes a Cassandra. But this doctor’s prescription is well worth filling.

1026-> Enron Witness Says He Was Ordered to Mislead Company's Board
HOUSTON, Feb. 16 - Kenneth D. Rice, who headed Enron's broadband unit, testified Thursday that former chief executive Jeffrey K. Skilling directed him to paint a positive outlook for the company's board, even as Mr. Skilling knew the broadband division was struggling to survive. But Mr. Rice, testifying for a third day in the trial of Mr. Skilling and Enron's founder, Kenneth L. Lay, acknowledged under cross-examination that he had no documents or witnesses to support his claim that Mr. Skilling told him to change his presentation, and was only relying on his memory. And Mr. Rice later conceded that a document he believes was the less-optimistic draft presentation that Mr. Skilling rejected might have been compiled for another purpose. "Are you as certain about preparing that presentation before the May 1 board meeting as the rest of your testimony?" Mark Holscher, a lawyer for Mr. Skilling, asked. "I am more certain about some parts of my testimony than others," Mr. Rice replied. Mr. Rice's shaky memory over the claimed meeting underscores a central challenge facing the government in proving its case that Mr. Skilling and Mr. Lay conspired to defraud Enron and then lied about it to the investing public before the company's 2001 collapse. Without a paper trail linking the crimes to the former executives, the government is leaning heavily on the statements of more than 100 cooperating witnesses. Sixteen of those witnesses, including Mr. Rice, have pleaded guilty to lying or other crimes related to the Enron case and agreed to testify in the hope that they can reduce their potential prison sentences. Mr. Rice, a former confidant of Mr. Skilling, pleaded guilty in July 2004 to securities fraud and turned over $13.7 million in cash and property, including a Ferrari and a Colorado vacation home. He testified this week that he made between $40 million and $50 million in the last decade he worked at Enron and was able to keep about $10 million after striking his plea deal with prosecutors. Under his plea agreement, Mr. Rice faces up to 10 years in prison, but there is also the possibility that he will spend no time behind bars. Mr. Skilling faces 31 counts of fraud, conspiracy and insider trading, while Mr. Lay faces seven counts of fraud and conspiracy related to the months after he replaced Mr. Skilling as chief executive. Both men sold millions of dollars in stock before the company crumbled, but only Mr. Skilling is charged with improper stock sales. Mr. Rice's testimony, coming at the end of the trial's third week, provided one of the strongest links yet between Mr. Skilling and an effort to intentionally mislead people about the broadband unit, which Mr. Rice said by early 2001 lacked customers, revenue and deals to keep it afloat. He first mentioned the directors' meeting on Tuesday, but on Thursday he offered more details. A few days before the May 1, 2001, board meeting, Mr. Rice said he met with Mr. Skilling for less than 20 minutes to brief Mr. Skilling on what he planned to say about broadband. Mr. Skilling wanted him to "put a presentation together that was more consistent" with an earlier analyst presentation "and less direct about some of the challenges we were facing" at broadband, Mr. Rice said. Later, he added that Mr. Skilling "asked me to change direction, to do a different direction for the whole presentation." Mr. Rice said he gave the government a copy of his original PowerPoint presentation a year and a half ago, after finding it on the hard drive of a personal computer. The draft presentation outlined industry trends, which Mr. Rice painted in gloomy terms, and their implications. "Capital markets are closed," reads one entry under "trends," and "nobody is buying nothing," under "implications." He conceded that he did not go over aspects of the presentation with Mr. Skilling "slide by slide," but took his general direction to make it square with earlier statements to analysts. The alleged meeting took on a mysterious tone Thursday afternoon when prosecutor Sean M. Berkowitz, the director of the government's Enron Task Force, produced the document for the defense team, but later, when asked by Judge Simeon T. Lake III if the document was in the government's computer system, said, "I don't know." Mr. Holscher then asked Mr. Rice why the draft presentation was dated May 9 -- eight days after the board meeting. In response, Mr. Rice conceded that the document may have been prepared for another purpose, such as for a presentation for a potential takeover of another telecom company. But Mr. Rice insisted that despite all the confusion and emerging questions, his recollection was that he had prepared it for that May 1 board meeting. The government's next witnesses include Paula H. Rieker, Enron's former managing director for investor relations. She also served as corporate secretary, dealing directly with Mr. Lay and the company's directors, in the months before Enron failed. After Ms. Rieker, prosecutors expect to call Wesley H. Colwell, a former chief accounting officer for Enron's wholesale energy trading unit. The court will not be in session on Friday and Monday.

1028-> Europe Rejects Genetically Engineered Drug
European regulators declined yesterday to approve what would have been the first drug produced in the milk of genetically engineered animals, dealing a setback to a fledgling industry that aims to convert cows, goats and rabbits into low-cost pharmaceutical factories. The decision was closely watched because companies developing drug-producing animals need an approval from either the United States or Europe to persuade pharmaceutical companies to try the production method. The drug's developer, GTC Biotherapeutics, said it would appeal the decision, adding that the ruling was based mainly on a problem with its clinical trial, not on the fact that the drug was made in goats. "With a new technology there is a conservatism that is not inappropriate," Geoffrey F. Cox, chief executive of GTC, said in a conference call with analysts. But he added, "There is no way with this company and what we have achieved over 15 years that we will let this block us from getting the product to market." Shares of GTC, which is based in Framingham, Mass., fell 90 cents, or 40 percent, to $1.35. GTC and a few other companies put human genes into animals so they produce a human protein in their milk. The animals can be milked and the protein purified for use as a drug. The companies say the method is a cheaper and easier way to produce biotechnology drugs. Many biotech drugs, like cancer-fighting monoclonal antibodies, are made in vats containing cultures of genetically engineered animal cells. Such factories can cost several hundred million dollars. Other protein drugs, like the one GTC is developing, are extracted from donated blood, but are found in such minute quantities that they are often in short supply. GTC said it would take 90,000 blood donations to obtain as much of the protein as one of its goats can produce in a year. But drug companies have been reluctant to use the technology, in part because they were unsure how readily regulators would approve drugs developed that way. So GTC decided to seek an approval by itself, even if sales of the drug would be small. It tested an anticlotting protein called antithrombin on patients who have a rare inherited deficiency of the protein and are at risk of potentially fatal blood clots. The company tested the drug on 14 people who were undergoing surgery or giving birth. At those times, because of the risk of bleeding, such patients cannot take the blood thinners they usually use to prevent clots. The European Medicines Agency said yesterday that its advisory committee recommended against approval because too few patients undergoing surgery were tested. Also, the drug tested was not made in exactly the same way as the drug that would be sold, because a filtration step was added after the trial began. GTC executives said the committee decided not to count pregnant women included in the test, because the dosing of the drug was not optimal. They also said the regulators had concerns about possible immune reactions to the drug, though none were seen. The company is doing another trial aimed at applying early next year for approval in the United States. Another company, Pharming, has asked the Food and Drug Administration to certify its human lactoferrin protein, made in transgenic cows, as "generally recognized as safe." That designation would allow Pharming to sell the protein for use in food products. Human lactoferrin is naturally found in mother's milk. Pharming, a Dutch company that has recovered from a financial collapse a few years ago, is also in late-stage clinical trials of a protein called C1 inhibitor, produced in rabbits, to treat hereditary angioedema. PharmAthene, based in Annapolis, Md., is trying to win a contract from the Defense Department to supply a protein, butyrylcholinesterase, to help treat people exposed to nerve gas. The protein is found in blood plasma but in such small amounts it would be impossible to make as much as the military needs, the company said. "It would take approximately 500 liters of plasma to produce a single dose," the company's director for education, Stacey Jurchison, said. "We have about 250 goats. The milk they would produce in a year's time would be sufficient to produce 100,000 doses." Production of drugs in transgenic animals is not the only part of barnyard biotechnology that has suffered setbacks. So has cloning, which involves making copies of desirable animals, rather than putting foreign genes in them. The F.D.A. has continually put off making an expected decision that the meat and milk from cloned animals and their offspring are safe to consume.

1030-> Bittersweet Easter as Parish Fights for Survival
Lynn Tighe's parents, Michael and Mary, joined St. Paul's Roman Catholic parish 62 years ago, right after they married and moved to Staten Island. The parish had its own church then -- a modest house of worship in New Brighton that proved too feeble to withstand the wear of time. There was no money for a new church building, but it did not matter. In 1963, after a demolition crew turned the old church into a pile of rubble, a new place of worship rose in a squat brick building three blocks away, in a vast room that doubles as the gym and auditorium of St. Paul's Catholic School on Clinton Avenue, in the same neighborhood on the island's north shore. St. Paul's parish has weathered its share of troubles, starting with its lack of a real church building for the past four decades. But none has proved to be as big a threat to its survival as the impending realignment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, led by Cardinal Edward M. Egan. "To me, it's like a piece of my family's history is being wiped out," Ms. Tighe, 40, said yesterday, after she, her mother and five of her 11 siblings attended one of two packed Easter services that may have been the parish's last. Three weeks ago, the archdiocese announced plans to close 31 parishes and 14 schools throughout the metropolitan region as part of its most ambitious reorganization scheme so far. St. Paul's is set to lose both its parish and school, which means that a diverse flock of 400-plus families, as well as 190 pupils, may have to find new places to worship and learn. Like many parishioners, Ms. Tighe and her brothers and sisters all attended St. Paul's school and received their sacraments at the worship center, where Msgr. Vincent Bartley has celebrated weekend Mass for the past 13 years. The event requires preparation: Sturdy iron hooks hoist two basketball hoops to the ceiling, then a sheet of blue carpet covers the section of the parquet floor where the provisional altar stands. Worshipers sit on metal chairs. Yesterday, there were 300 such chairs, but they were not enough to accommodate all the people who showed up to celebrate Christianity's holiest day and pray together for the future of their parish and school. "Look at this. There are people of all colors," said Michael T. McVey, president of the parish council, pointing at the winding Eucharist line with its black, white, Hispanic and Asian congregants. "There are people of all colors. Isn't that what the church is supposed to be, a place that welcomes all? We are this kind of church, and that's why it's so hard to understand why they want to get rid of us." Monsignor Bartley said he had not been told why the archdiocese wanted to close St. Paul's parish. On broad terms, archdiocesan officials have said that the realignment addresses two main issues: the growing shortage of priests and the changing demographics of the archdiocese, which stretches from Staten Island to the Catskills. The realignment plan recommended the creation of five new parishes, including one on Staten Island's south shore. It also calls for several new church buildings, mostly in Dutchess, Rockland and northern Westchester Counties, where many Catholics who have left the city now live. The archdiocese has not yet decided when to release its final list of parish closings. A final decision regarding the schools is scheduled by next Monday. "I'm praying for a miracle," said Elizabeth López, 33, whose three children go to St. Paul's school. "I'm from Mexico; I have no one here. This parish is the only family I have." On May 10, Monsignor Bartley will have one last chance to convince the archdiocese that St. Paul's parish is worth saving. He plans to present some arguments, he said, including these: The parish does not have and does not need a church building because the worship center serves it just fine; it has had more baptisms than funerals in the past five years, which is a sign of growth. It has, however, held only 15 weddings in the same period because few brides are willing to get married in a church with no aisle. St. Paul's has many elderly parishioners, a number of whom walk to Mass from a public housing complex across the street. That might be harder to do if the parish is closed; according to Mr. McVey, the nearest parish, Assumption, at Webster and Brighton Avenues, is too far away to be reached on foot. Yesterday, Monsignor Bartley asked worshipers who were not already registered with the parish to sign up. "I know what I want in this life for myself and I know what I want for you, but what does God want for us?" he said in his sermon. "We know that others are going to make a very important decision for us," he added. "We can only hope and pray that they know -- that Cardinal Egan knows and all the others at the archdiocese know -- what God would want for St. Paul's."

1032-> Black Chefs' Struggle for the Top
MILTON GUZMAN arrived in the kitchen of Alinea, an avant-garde restaurant in Chicago, with a prestigious culinary degree and a sterling recommendation from the New York restaurant Per Se. He didn't feel he had truly made it, though, until the freezer broke down several months after the opening. Forced to remake a tray of melted confections as dinner was about to begin, the pastry chef, Alex Stupak, asked Mr. Guzman to spray a tray of newly frozen ganache with liquid chocolate, a technique requiring such speed and finesse that Mr. Stupak always did it himself. Mr. Guzman, now 29, remembers that as he watched the chocolate receive layer upon layer of cocoa-butter mist from his paint gun, he was proud: he felt he truly belonged. But he still knew that he stood out from the rest of the staff. He was, once again, the only black chef. Before going to Alinea, he had been the only black chef at Per Se. And at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan he had been the only black student in his class. "Why is that?" he wondered. "Where are they?" Years ago, when cooking at even the best restaurants was considered menial labor, blacks often worked the stoves. But as employment options opened up for blacks in the 1960's and 70's, kitchen work became less attractive. Now, with the restaurant industry booming and chefs becoming celebrities and wealthy entrepreneurs, few blacks are sharing in that success, and as young black men and women enter the profession they are finding few mentors or peers. "The adulation that the chef gets now and the rank that chefs are on the social scale now, African-Americans are not taking part of it at all," said the chef and cookbook author Jacques Pépin. Ask any professional cook to name one black chef other than Marcus Samuelsson, at Aquavit in Manhattan, and you're likely to hear silence, followed by a nervous chuckle. That was Mr. Guzman's response. Mr. Samuelsson said that blacks fill the ranks of lower-paying and nonmanagement positions in kitchens throughout the industry, "but not in the fine-dining community." "The sadness of it," he said, "is I can mention every black chef on one hand." Interviews with dozens of black chefs and restaurateurs revealed that struggles with family members, struggles with employers and struggles with themselves have all contributed to the scarcity. Mr. Guzman said that when he told his family in 2003 that he was leaving his job as a client manager for ACNielsen after six years to become a chef, his parents "thought I was taking a step backward." "I don't think cooking, when parents want their children to grow up and prosper, it's something that comes to mind," he added. What is more likely to come to mind, in his words, is "the house Negro" or Aunt Jemima. That might be one reason why of 2,700 students at the Culinary Institute of America, in Hyde Park, N.Y., 85 list themselves as African-American, up from only 49 in 2001. One of those students is Matthew Raiford, who delayed attending the school for 10 years because his father forbade him to enter an industry that had virtually no black success stories. "African-American parents -- our parents -- were Pullman porters and waiters and waitresses," said Mr. Raiford, an Atlanta chef who has returned to the institute to earn his bachelor's degree. "Once they had the ability for their children not to do that, they didn't want to choose that." The dining rooms of high-end restaurants often hold little more attraction for African-Americans than the kitchens. "It's very common that you go and don't see a single black face in the entire restaurant," said Alain Joseph, a black chef in the test kitchen at Emeril Lagasse's headquarters in New Orleans. "A restaurant with 200 people, you don't see a single black face." "If you never had that exposure to even dine in a fine-dining restaurant," Mr. Joseph said, "the thought of getting into the kitchen is greatly diminished." But while cultural stigmas have held back many aspiring chefs, others blame racism. Joe Brown, the chef at Mélange Cafe, which he owns with his wife in Cherry Hill, N.J., remembers, at his first job, being choked and called a racial epithet by the chef. He didn't stay long, but he continued to cook at numerous other restaurants. Lance Whitney Knowling, a veteran of high-end Manhattan kitchens who is now the chef and owner of Indigo Smoke in Montclair, N.J., said that five years ago he received a call from the owner of an upscale restaurant in New Jersey to whom he had sent a cover letter and résumé. "I'd have to have somebody like you," Mr. Knowling recalled the restaurateur's saying. "I couldn't have a black guy or a Latin guy back there, because it would make my customers uncomfortable." When Mr. Knowling said he was black, the restaurateur said, "You're kidding." No, Mr. Knowling said. The conversation grew awkward, and the restaurateur apologized. Even in questioning a chef's qualifications, employers can reveal their prejudices. Keith Williams, 47, said that he jumped at an offer last year to be executive chef at the chic restaurant BG at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan, but that job discussions in the past had been less pleasant. "The first thing they say is, "The only thing you know about is fried chicken and collard greens,' " Mr. Williams said. "And anybody you know that's in this business that's a black chef -- in most cases that's what he's cooking. Even if he came out of a French kitchen, he ends up cooking Southern food." Mr. Knowling pointed to his own experience: "I'm classically French trained. I wanted to be the French chef, and that's what I studied for years and years, and now I run a barbecue restaurant -- an upscale barbecue restaurant and soul food restaurant." Black chefs aren't the only workers to deal with insensitivity in restaurant kitchens, where abuse can be freely ladled out when the pressure gets high. Countless numbers of Hispanic workers have advanced through the ranks in top kitchens in the face of slurs and prejudice. And women have braved flagrant sexism that was once endemic in the male-dominated kitchen. But black chefs say the abuse raises especially sensitive questions of respect. Lloyd Roberts, 31, who is Mr. Williams's executive sous-chef at BG and is Jamaican, said his fellow black graduates of the New York Restaurant School are not comfortable facing that sort of abuse when they are the only blacks. "It's hard for African-Americans who were born here," he said. "It's as if the chef is picking on them," he added, "when in reality he's not." That's not much of an issue for restaurants if they've had few black employees. "We have had very few African-Americans apply for cooking positions over all in the 18 years I've been at Zuni Cafe, out of what I'd guess is thousands of applicants," said Judy Rodgers, the executive chef of the restaurant, in San Francisco. The chef Tom Colicchio said there were few blacks in his kitchens, including those at Gramercy Tavern and Craft. "Those roles are not being filled," he said, "and we're not getting the applications." And since many applicants hear of opportunities through word of mouth, the scarcity can be self-perpetuating. "For you to move up in this world, it's not just talent anymore; it's who you know," said Walter King, 36, a 1990 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America who left the professional kitchen in frustration several years ago to work in New York real estate. "And there's not enough of us in high positions to play the 'who you know' game." One person in a high position who has helped blacks to succeed is Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose restaurants have been incubators for the careers of several talented black chefs. Sylva Senate and Greg Gourdet are chefs de cuisine at two of Mr. Vongerichten's places, Mercer Kitchen and 66, respectively. Mr. Williams and Mr. Roberts of BG both rose at Vong, as did Charlene Shade, who has just been hired as executive chef at the Morgan Dining Room and the Morgan Cafe, which are to open soon at the Morgan Library. And moving up through the ranks of Jean Georges is Preston Clark, a son of Patrick Clark, who gained famed at Tavern on the Green. Patrick Clark, who died in 1998 at 42, was one of the first bona fide celebrity chefs and a role model for many, black and white. Even with the difficulty of advancement, some successful black chefs say that, for younger blacks, the rewards are now clearly worth the struggle. As Gerry Garvin, who started as a dishwasher in his hometown, Atlanta, and is now host of the cooking show "Turn Up the Heat With G. Garvin" on the TV One network, put it: "I heard everything you hear when you're a young black child coming into a culinary world where it was 90 percent European and a few white guys from Jersey. You can ride that culinary horror story of racism, and it doesn't go much further. Or you can embrace it, realize it happened and try to make it different for guys who are coming into the business, particularly young black males, and teach them how to get past the things I had to deal with." Richard Grausman, president and founder of the Careers Through Culinary Arts Program, which has headquarters in New York and provides scholarships and guidance for high school students interested in culinary careers, said the new acclaim for chefs in general is helping to breach the barriers. At first, Mr. Grausman said, "when I saw somebody had talent, they might say, Yes, but my mother doesn't want me to, or my family doesn't want me to." "That prevailed up until the last few years," he continued, "when the explosion of food and chefs' success has come through the Food Network and other TV shows. So that now I'm not hearing that. I haven't had resistance from family to let their kids pursue a career. The floodgates haven't opened, but that resistance doesn't seem to be there any longer, which is a big, big plus." As at the Culinary Institute of America, the black enrollment at the French Culinary Institute has risen by about half since 2002. Of the approximately 480 students, 35 to 40 are black, said officials at the school, who attributed much of the increase to scholarships from Mr. Grausman's program. One of those scholarships was won by Janise Addison, 19, of Corona, Queens, who graduated from the institute last year. She worked first at Town in New York; then, through word of mouth, she found her current job as a pastry chef at the Modern. "You make it based on what you can do or can't do," she said recently at the restaurant before beginning her shift. After graduating from Stanford, Beth Setrakian, 49, got her first job as a pastry chef in 1979 for Mark Miller at the Fourth Street Grill in Berkeley, Calif., where, she said, "I was definitely the only African-American in the kitchen." She opened her own business, Beth's Fine Desserts, in San Francisco in 1988; she said it now has annual sales of around $8 million. "There are so many black cooks," she said, adding: "We're on the verge of change. And thank goodness, because the heritage that we bring is a great addition to American cuisine as a whole."

1033-> Blast Wounds 30 in Turkey
ISTANBUL, April 16 - A bomb placed in a trash bin blew up beside a sidewalk cafe in a residential area close to Istanbul's international airport on Sunday, and the police said at least 30 people had been wounded, the Anatolia news agency reported. The police had no immediate information on the size of the bomb or the type of explosive used. The explosion shattered windows and sent glass shards flying, causing most of the injuries. There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing. But similar recent attacks have been claimed by the Kurdistan Liberation Hawks, a group possibly linked to separatist Kurdish groups. Two weeks ago, widespread rioting erupted in the predominantly Kurdish southeastern part of the country.

1034-> Nobel Laureate Is Robbed in Home
JOHANNESBURG, Oct. 28 (AP)  The Nobel Prize-winning author Nadine Gordimer was assaulted in her home by three unarmed men who robbed her of cash and jewelry, the police said Saturday. Ms. Gordimer, 83, was not seriously injured and no arrests have been made, said Sgt. Sanku Tsunke, a police spokesman. Sergeant Tsunke said the men broke into Ms. Gordimer’s home on Thursday morning and demanded that she open her safe. She handed over cash and jewelry but would not part with a wedding ring from her late husband, Reinhold Cassirer. The men then locked Ms. Gordimer and her assistant in a storeroom, the sergeant said. He said the assistant had pressed an alert button to summon security company guards, who arrived a half-hour later.

1036-> Billionaire Linked to Columnist Reports Being Shaken Down by a Hollywood Detective
LOS ANGELES, April 19 - When the supermarket billionaire Ronald W. Burkle accused a New York Post gossip columnist of demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars for protection from nasty items in Page Six, it was not the first time that he had told authorities he was the victim of a shakedown. In 2002, Mr. Burkle has told federal investigators, the Hollywood private detective Anthony Pellicano demanded that Mr. Burkle pay him $100,000 to $250,000 in exchange for Mr. Pellicano's agreeing not to investigate him. Mr. Pellicano told him he had been hired by Michael S. Ovitz, the former talent agent, who had been a partner with Mr. Burkle in several ill-fated business ventures. Mr. Burkle's account of that meeting to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, related in a summary that was reviewed by The New York Times and corroborated by Mr. Burkle in an interview this week, provides a new glimpse into Mr. Pellicano's methods of drumming up new business and holding himself out as a broker between rich and powerful adversaries -- thereby drawing them into his realm at Hollywood's underbelly. In Mr. Burkle's telling, it also shows how he was able to deflect a heavy-handed approach from Mr. Pellicano, while other Hollywood personalities, when similarly confronted, either hired Mr. Pellicano -- who was charged in February with wiretapping and conspiracy -- or became one of his targets. In contrast to his run-in with the Post reporter, Jared Paul Stern -- which culminated in a videotaped sting in cooperation with law-enforcement officials -- Mr. Burkle became friendly with Mr. Pellicano and provided him with favors, but not cash, long after Mr. Pellicano backed off, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. Mr. Ovitz, speaking to investigators, according to F.B.I. summaries, asserted that Mr. Pellicano had investigated him on Mr. Burkle's behalf, but also acknowledged paying Mr. Pellicano $75,000 to dig up embarrassing information on 15 to 20 people including Mr. Burkle. Mr. Ovitz's lawyer, Bart H. Williams, said on Wednesday that Mr. Ovitz had never hired the detective to investigate anyone but those who were suing him -- which Mr. Burkle was not, at the time -- and that Mr. Ovitz had neither asked for nor knew of any illegal activity by Mr. Pellicano. "Michael Ovitz never agreed to pay Anthony Pellicano to investigate Ron Burkle," Mr. Williams said. "However, it's not surprising that Mr. Pellicano would try to mislead Mr. Burkle in an effort to drum up business." Indeed, the material reviewed by The Times shows Mr. Pellicano playing Mr. Burkle and Mr. Ovitz against each other, seeking to use his mission in behalf of Mr. Ovitz to gain a much bigger payday from Mr. Burkle. Steven F. Gruel, a lawyer for Mr. Pellicano, could not be reached yesterday. At the root of Mr. Burkle's dealings with Mr. Pellicano was a business partnership between Mr. Burkle, who made billions buying and selling grocery chains in the 1990's, and Mr. Ovitz, who was forced to resign from the Walt Disney Company in 1996 and turned to Mr. Burkle, whom he had befriended a few years earlier, for advice on his next move. According to the F.B.I. summaries, Mr. Ovitz pressed a reluctant Mr. Burkle to become his partner, and Mr. Burkle eventually agreed to invest up to 10 percent in Mr. Ovitz's new ventures, which would include an unsuccessful bid to bring an National Football League team to Carson, Calif., and Internet startups like CheckOut.com, an entertainment-oriented site. The alliance between the two men was uneasy from the outset: Mr. Burkle was vexed when Mr. Ovitz trumpeted him as his partner in the N.F.L. project in 1998 without checking with Mr. Burkle first. Tensions boiled over after Mr. Burkle advanced both his own and Mr. Ovitz's shares of millions in investment dollars, but Mr. Ovitz failed to reimburse him, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. While Mr. Burkle mulled whether to sue Mr. Ovitz, an article appeared in The Los Angeles Times on Sept. 19, 2000, declaring that the "honeymoon is over" between the two moguls. Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. that he knew Mr. Ovitz was behind this article and took it as a "shot across the bow," signaling Mr. Ovitz's willingness to turn their "business dispute into a public affair." By 2001, as CheckOut.com fell into bankruptcy, Mr. Ovitz's attempt at a Hollywood comeback with Artists Management Group was also unraveling. Mr. Ovitz was warring with his former protégés at Creative Artists Agency, who had issued an edict barring their clients from working with Artists Management. On Aug. 10, 2001, prosecutors say, Mr. Pellicano had a police source illegally check motor-vehicle records on Bryan Lourd and Kevin Huvane, two top partners at C.A.A. Sometime later, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I., an ex-girlfriend put him in touch with a private investigator who reported that Mr. Pellicano had been hired by Mr. Ovitz to get information about him, Mr. Lourd and Mr. Huvane, and that Mr. Pellicano "would use wiretapping" as one of his methods. (Interviewed by the F.B.I. on May 6, 2004, Mr. Burkle actually posed the first question, asking two special agents if he had, indeed, been wiretapped. The agents demurred, according to their notes, saying they were "not in a position" to answer his question.) In response to the warning about Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Pellicano, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I., he arranged a meeting at his offices with Mr. Huvane, Mr. Lourd and a more senior C.A.A. partner, Richard Lovett. Without revealing his source, Mr. Burkle told the C.A.A. agents that they were potential targets of Mr. Pellicano and Mr. Ovitz; they replied that they had heard similar rumors. Mr. Burkle also warned them to be aware that their phones might be tapped. Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. that he next turned to his friend Steve Bing, a millionaire movie producer who was reported to have hired Mr. Pellicano in a paternity dispute with the model Elizabeth Hurley in late 2001. Mr. Bing called Mr. Pellicano a "decent guy" and urged Mr. Burkle to contact the detective personally. Over the objections of his own security aides, who Mr. Burkle said warned him both that Mr. Pellicano was a fraud and that he did illegal things, Mr. Burkle met with Mr. Pellicano at Mr. Bing's home in the summer of 2002. Asked why, Mr. Burkle said, "I thought if someone's coming after you and you get a free meeting, it's a good thing to do." Mr. Pellicano warned Mr. Burkle that he had already obtained all of his telephone numbers, and "was prepared to use any and every means to" investigate Mr. Burkle, but first asked him to tell his version of his dispute with Mr. Ovitz, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. When Mr. Burkle did so, asserting that Mr. Ovitz owed him money, he told the F.B.I., Mr. Pellicano reacted indignantly, using an expletive to refer to Mr. Ovitz and saying he did not work for "welshers" -- an exchange that was partly reported in Vanity Fair in 2004. But in the next breath, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I., Mr. Pellicano said he would be losing a lot of money by not working for Mr. Ovitz against Mr. Burkle and the men from C.A.A. A few days later, Mr. Burkle met again with Mr. Pellicano, this time in a poolside cabana at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr. Pellicano declared that his refusal to work for Mr. Ovitz against Mr. Burkle had cost him $100,000 to $250,000, and asked Mr. Burkle to reimburse him. Mr. Burkle refused, saying that Mr. Pellicano had not actually done any work worthy of payment. Mr. Pellicano shot back that "he had been good to Burkle and that Burkle should return the favor," according to an F.B.I. summary. Mr. Burkle countered with an offer to pay Mr. Pellicano only if he could broker a settlement of the Burkle-Ovitz dispute. Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. he met a second time at the hotel with Mr. Pellicano, who said Mr. Ovitz was considering a settlement, but none materialized. At one point, Mr. Burkle said, Mr. Pellicano showed him a letter, written a year earlier, between lawyers for Mr. Ovitz and Mr. Burkle detailing their dispute. Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I. that he took the letter as "establishing the bona fides of the Pellicano/Ovitz relationship." Sometime later, Mr. Burkle told the F.B.I., he bumped into Mr. Ovitz on the street in Beverly Hills, and the two spoke briefly. Mr. Ovitz had more to say about the encounter: he told the F.B.I. that Mr. Burkle had told him Mr. Pellicano had been "bad-mouthing" Mr. Ovitz; Mr. Burkle also mentioned that Mr. Pellicano had told him Mr. Ovitz was planning to sue Mr. Burkle. "It was then," the F.B.I. noted, "that Ovitz came to the realization that Pellicano had been working both men against one another." Mr. Burkle, for his part, spoke frequently and met at least once with Mr. Pellicano after Mr. Pellicano's arrest on explosives charges in November 2002. He told the F.B.I. that he had allowed Mr. Pellicano to use his retreat in La Jolla, Calif., had arranged to have Mr. Pellicano's son swim with dolphins at Sea World, and had given Mr. Pellicano tickets to the Hollywood Bowl. Asked by reporters why he was so generous to Mr. Pellicano, Mr. Burkle said: "He didn't come after me. Not coming after me was a pretty big give." Correction: April 27, 2006, Thursday An article in The Arts last Thursday about the Hollywood private investigator Anthony Pellicano and his dealings with the supermarket executive Ronald W. Burkle referred incompletely to published reports that Mr. Pellicano's clients included the movie producer Steve Bing, a friend of Mr. Burkle. Both Mr. Bing and Mr. Pellicano have denied reports that Mr. Bing hired Mr. Pellicano in 2001 during a paternity dispute.

1037-> ADDENDA; Unit of Interpublic Gets Orbitz Account
Orbitz, the travel Web site, has named Mullen in Wenham, Mass., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, as the creative agency on its account, with spending estimated at $50 million to $60 million a year. The assignment had been handled since January 2003 by the Chicago office of Y&R, which was dismissed last week. Although "Y&R was a very strong partner," said Randy Wagner, chief marketing officer at Orbitz Worldwide in Chicago, "it's not just thinking about what we're doing today. It's also about what we can do over the long term." The decision came after a brief review that had been narrowed to Mullen and Element 79 in Chicago, part of the Omnicom Group. Y&R is part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of the WPP Group. MediaCom, also part of WPP, remains the Orbitz media agency. Orbitz is a unit of Travelport, which is owned by the Blackstone Group.

1038-> Hold the Mojito and Margarita, Nicaragua Has el Macuá
NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico, Oct. 4 — Nicaraguan folk music fills the air at the House of the Mejías Godoy, a nightspot in Managua, the sprawling capital of Nicaragua. The plates of steaming food served there — beans and rice, plantains and chunks of tasty meat — are also 100 percent Nicaraguan. But the Nicaraguan authenticity comes to an end when it comes to quenching one’s thirst. Cuba’s mojito, with its crushed lime and mint leaves, is on the drinks menu. The margarita, Mexico’s way of showing off what tequila can do, is available as well. The bloody mary and Tom Collins are offered from the colossus to the north. But Nicaragua, alas, has no cocktail to call its own. Despite a top-quality domestic rum, the bartenders borrow from others when mixing it. They add Coca-Cola and call the resulting drink a Nica libre, which everyone knows is really just a Cuba libre knockoff. They add soda water or ice, which does little to make the resulting drink shout “Nicaragua!” But the country, which many still associate with the guerrilla war that tore the place apart in the 1980’s, is eager to stand on its own two feet again. A United States trade embargo that ended in 1990 leveled the country’s economy, but exports are now growing faster in Nicaragua than anywhere else in Central America. More and more visitors are arriving to climb the volcanoes and navigate the island-filled lakes. Soon those tourists may be able to sidle up to a bar on a sweltering evening and order a uniquely Nicaraguan trago, which translates as a drink or swallow or swig. “We want something authentic, something that goes down your throat and tastes Nicaraguan,” said René Hauser, the owner of a popular French restaurant in Managua and one of the judges in a competition to find an official national cocktail. The winning drink will not be the Nica rumba or the experanza or the fantasía del lago, all of which were also-rans in the contest, which wound up Tuesday. Judged on their taste and appearance, the erupsión pinolera, the nicarao and the monbacho en las rochas did not make the cut either. After sipping the numerous offerings, the judges have opted for a fruity concoction that they called el macuá, after a tropical bird found in this part of the world. The drink is one part white rum, one part guava juice, with a half-portion of lemon juice and some sugar and ice. If all goes according to plan, el macuá will soon be known worldwide as Nicaragua’s national thirst quencher, as closely tied to this country as the caipirinha is to Brazil and the pisco sour to Peru. Judges described this yellowish drink as strong, fruity and sweet. It was invented by Dr. Edmundo Miranda, 67, a pediatrician from the city of Granada on Lake Nicaragua. He said his wife, daughter and guava-loving son-in-law had helped him perfect the formula. One of the requirements was that the drink be appropriate for Nicaragua’s steaming climate. “We wanted something refreshing, that cools you in the heat,” Mr. Hauser said. “We didn’t want a drink that was too filling. You can have two or three mojitos and feel good.” Not surprisingly, given that Flor de Caña, Nicaragua’s rum company, was a sponsor, all entries had to be rum based. But other than that, the sky was the limit. Many of the drinks capitalized on Nicaragua’s array of tropical fruits, with banana, coconut, pineapple, melons and tamarind all showing up in the candidate drinks. One contestant that raised eyebrows exploited Nicaragua’s coffee beans by mixing them with rum. “Some of them were quite interesting,” said Jurg Benz, who works for a Swedish development agency and was invited as a judge to provide a foreigner’s perspective. “Others were too close to drinks I’d tried before.” That certainly cannot be said for the drinks that relied on Nicaragua’s more exotic agricultural offerings, like the pitaya, known as the dragon fruit, which grows on a cactus. Then there is the sapodilla, which is about the size of a baseball and has a yellowish pulp and a red rind. The jocote, which is eaten unripe or ripe, also appeared, as did the mamoncillo, which has a juice that Nicaraguans use to cure stomachaches. One of those sipping the finalists was Jean-Pierre Lafosse, the French ambassador to Nicaragua, who cannot imagine a country without a national drink. He said his country had three: Champagne; pastis, an aperitif that includes anis, nutmeg, sugar and other ingredients; and kir, which combines white wine and crème de cassis. “It’s part of the identity of a country,” he said. “Nicaragua needs a new identity that doesn’t have anything to do with revolution. This is a chance.” On top of that, Mr. Lafosse saw the open invitation that was offered to Nicaraguans to put their best drink forward as a model for the politicians now vying for the presidency in an increasingly ugly campaign that winds up on Nov. 5. “It was a democratic competition, where the best drink wins,” he said.

1039-> Alternatives: Evidence Is Slight for Melatonin as Sleeping Aid
Although melatonin is widely used as a sleep aid, a review of the research says there is little evidence that it works, either for jet lag, shift work or sleep difficulty caused by other medical or psychiatric problems. The review, published online Feb. 9 in BMJ -- Online First, analyzed 25 controlled trials that tested melatonin against placebos for various kinds of sleep disorders. The researchers performed a statistical analysis to combine the results. In six trials reporting on the amount of time spent asleep as a proportion of time spent in bed, they found a small but clinically insignificant effect: melatonin increased the amount of time people slept by about 10 minutes for eight hours spent in bed. In studies of those who had sleep problems caused by jet lag or shift work, the researchers found no difference at all in the effectiveness of melatonin compared to a placebo. Still, there was some good news for proponents of melatonin. The side effects it caused -- most commonly headaches, dizziness, nausea and drowsiness -- were no different from those caused by a placebo. The researchers concluded that, at least with short-term use, melatonin is safe, even if it is ineffective. They stress, however, that they found very little information about long-term safety. Nina Buscemi, the lead author of the study and a research associate at the University of Alberta, made no specific treatment recommendations. "What I hope will come out of this," Dr. Buscemi said, "is for people to look at the evidence when they're making decisions about whether or not to use melatonin."

1043-> Slave to Science
In recent years young adult fiction has proved a haven for novelists of ideas who also love storytelling. M. T. Anderson is one of the most interesting. His first novel was the unsettling suburban teenage vampire fantasy “Thirsty” (1997), but he didn’t capture a wide audience until 2002, when his cult hit “Feed” appeared. A surprisingly affecting commodity-culture satire — partly set on the moon, where rich teenagers go for spring break — it earned Anderson a slew of fans and his first National Book Award nomination. His second nomination came last month for his new novel, “The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing.” The hallmarks of Anderson’s style are a sharp ear for adolescent voices, a sometimes perverse sense of humor and an interest in the corrosive effects of groupthink on the average human’s ability to behave ethically. His new book has all those qualities, but represents a striking advance in terms of both technique and literary ambition. The novel is set in the 1760s, in Boston, where Octavian and his mother — a West African princess named Cassiopeia — live in the quarters of the Novanglian College of Lucidity, a near double for Swift’s preposterous Academy of Lagado in “Gulliver’s Travels” (1726). The college is a breeding ground for the kinds of pseudoscientific theory about differences between whites and blacks that make for queasy reading. Yet mother and son are treated well. Dressed in silks and expensive white wigs farmed from the heads of Prague pensioners, Octavian and his mother perform duets — Octavian plays the violin, his mother the harpsichord — and exchange syllogisms over dinner. Uneasily aware that not every little boy has his excrement weighed daily and tallied against the food he ingests (nor do most black boys in colonial Boston enjoy lessons in Latin, Greek, music and mathematics), Octavian solves the puzzle of his treatment with the help of the college’s slave Bono (short for “Pro Bono” — his mother was pregnant when the college bought her, meaning it got two slaves for the price of one), who tells Octavian that he and his mother are not royalty but slaves. Behind a Bluebeard-style forbidden door, Octavian discovers a chart of classifications of the races of men, an engraving of his naked mother (“Plate XVII. Pubescent female of the Oyo Country in Africa”) and volumes of data that reveal to him that he himself is the experiment. Octavian is being provided with a first-class education to help the collegians determine his capacity “for the acquisition of the noble arts and sciences” and divine whether he and his people are “a separate and distinct species.” Despite Octavian’s genuine desire to prove his abilities, the results of this experiment have of course been predetermined by the prejudices of the experimenters (whose conclusions about the inferiority of the African echo beliefs held by real historical figures like David Hume and Thomas Jefferson, as Anderson points out in an afterword). Formally, Anderson perfectly captures the narrative style of 18th-century books. The title page of “Octavian Nothing” presents Anderson (like novelists from Daniel Defoe to Samuel Richardson) as merely the editor of a compilation that relies on Octavian’s testimony, printed ephemera and newspaper excerpts, scientific articles and private letters. The chaotic early days of the conflict that would come to be known as the American Revolution unfold as a backdrop to his personal history, and the intensity of the violence Anderson depicts may be too intense for some readers. One of the most disturbing sections concerns the “pox party” of the subtitle, in which a select group of New England notables accept the college’s invitation to undergo inoculation against the smallpox raging through the colonies — a house party that will include games of whist and dancing, and “a glass jar full of contaminate matter from the pox-sores of the dead.” Such parties were popular at the time, despite the risk of disfigurement or death. In this case one of the inoculation’s unintended victims is Octavian’s mother, her decline and death described in absolutely gruesome detail. fter his mother’s death, language fails Octavian; Anderson gives instead his scratched-out passages of attempted description — a nod to Sterne’s “Tristram Shandy” and an eloquent way of expressing his pain. Indeed, Octavian’s only flaw as a narrator may be the extent to which he has taken to heart the college’s lessons of lucidity, making his voice less immediately engaging than Anderson’s earlier teenage narrators. As a child, Octavian says, he was taught the importance of observation: “precise in notation, acute in investigation and rational in inference.” These lessons could be grim — for example, when the men of the college pet a dog and then drown it to see how long it takes to die, or feed alley cats and then drop them from a scaffold to determine “the height from which cats no longer catch themselves, but shatter.” Octavian’s own battle between rage and reason is resolved on the side of reason, possibly at some cost to the reader’s ability to identify with him. But the story digs deep under one’s skin despite that aggressive self-distancing. Anderson’s imaginative and highly intelligent exploration of the horrors of human experimentation and the ambiguous history of America’s origins will leave readers impatient for the promised sequel.

1047-> When Moving a Mountain Is No Longer an Act of God
Lost Mountain A Year in the Vanishing Wilderness Radical Strip Mining and the Devastation of Appalachia By Erik Reece 250 pages. Illustrated. Riverhead Books. $24.95. In the course of his research for this book about the consequences of coal mining in Eastern Kentucky, Erik Reece arranged to join state regulators for a tour of one site. He encountered a representative of International Coal Group, the company that operated the mine. Mr. Reece had filed a citizen's complaint about the effects of blasting on a creek nearby. "We shook hands grimly and I tried to explain that I had nothing personal against his company -- that I chose to write about this mine site because I just liked the name Lost Mountain," Mr. Reece reports. "Lucky us," the mining executive replied. Mr. Reece was studying the systematic removal of mountaintops in places where radical strip mining occurs. To fly over this part of Eastern Kentucky, he says, is to view a gray, cratered landscape where a cemetery (which is mining-exempt) provides the rare touch of green. In the course of a year, he chose a particular spot and watched its step-by-step destruction. "It may be too obvious an irony that this particular ridge was called Lost Mountain," he writes. It may be too obvious. But it gave "Lost Mountain" a title just the same. "Lost Mountain" emerged from a summer environmental-writing program run by the University of Kentucky, where Mr. Reece teaches. His experience yielded a prize-winning article for Harper's magazine, and that led to this book. As evidence that not all log-rolling is done by mountain-clearing bulldozers, Mr. Reece's book has been cited approvingly by Bobbie Ann Mason, his colleague at the University of Kentucky. She is also the editor of "Missing Mountains," an anthology about mountaintop removal. "Lost Mountain" is assembled as a string of troubling anecdotes and encounters, held together by the author's desire to affirm what he already knows. It's possible to share Mr. Reece's dismay and outrage while also wishing that his book had been more sharply focused. "Lost Mountain" was edited by Sean McDonald, best known lately as James Frey's editor, but also the editor of episodic, glibly conceptual nonfiction by Steven Johnson ("Everything Bad is Good For You") and John Crawford ("The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell)." In similar fashion, "Lost Mountain" zeroes in on a riveting, important subject and then roams all over the map. Mr. Reece's conviction is never in question. But his book feels more like extended journalistic glimpses than a fully developed exploration. By way of creating a structure for "Lost Mountain," Mr. Reece describes monthly hikes, each one revealing that the landscape has been further nibbled away. He mentions indigenous flora and fauna, using mining-made dangers to their survival to illustrate larger points. ("In this way, the unassuming liverwort dramatizes one of the issues at the heart of mountaintop removal.") And he talks to Kentucky residents who are suffering the brunt of strip-mining's consequences and face governmental and corporate brush-offs that are truly Kafkaesque. Has a trailer near a mine site begun to tilt? "You've got an old trailer." Has blasting damaged the roof of the church? "You've got an old roof." It's true that Mr. Reece has a lot of ground to cover. He addresses the economics of mountaintop removal. There is vast environmental peril to describe. He explores the expedient use of Appalachia by politicians of many stripes, beginning with President Lyndon Johnson and his War on Poverty, all of them realizing that poverty has public relations value. "Hollows look enough like suburbs to Northerners," he is told by Greg Howard, director of the grassroots arts center Appalshop. "Poor white children look enough like their own kids." Mr. Reece dissects unholy alliances between politicians and the coal industry. He considers the effects of voracious globalism and suggests alternatives to a coal-based Kentucky economy. He advocates that other kinds of Kentucky-based industry (like furniture-making) be encouraged. He underscores the urgency of sustainable forest management. And he suggests that taxes reflect the true social and environmental costs of coal. Why? Because, as a woman who grew up in Harlan County puts it: "We all live downstream." When Barbara Kopple's documentary "Harlan County, U.S.A." was released in 1976, it depicted a fierce union struggle on the part of coal miners who worked underground. "Lost Mountain" argues persuasively that these dire conditions have only gotten worse. Beyond the catastrophic underground accidents that still take lives, the mountaintop mining described here inflicts much more onerous long-term damage. And it's done so easily, Mr. Reece says, "It doesn't take a whole lot of faith to move mountains; it takes about 10 men and a company called Caterpillar." At such moments, the anger of "Lost Mountain" is clear. It would have been clearer if the book avoided repeating itself, ascribed its facts more carefully (notes on sources are sketchy) and relied less on generalizations. Still, Mr. Reece ultimately makes his impressions all too believable. No wonder some Eastern Kentuckians were skeptical about Neil Armstrong's 1969 walk on the moon. They thought NASA had put Mr. Armstrong in a space suit and photographed him at a strip mine.

1052-> SPORTS BRIEFING: SOCCER; METROSTARS ACQUIRE TOP PICK
The MetroStars may no longer call Bob Bradley their coach, but that does not mean that Alexi Lalas, who fired Bradley, is averse to doing business with him. Bradley, now the coach of Chivas USA, traded the top pick in Major League Soccer's draft yesterday to the MetroStars for defender Jason Hernandez and the fifth pick over all. With No. 1, the MetroStars picked Marvell Wynne, 19, a strong, quick 5-foot-9 defender from U.C.L.A. who is the son of the former major league baseball player of the same name. "He is a diamond, and like all diamonds, the more you polish them, the better they look," Lalas, the MetroStars' president and general manager, said in a statement from Philadelphia, where the draft was held. Wynne, 19, drew interest from several European clubs with his strong play last June at the under-20 world championships in the Netherlands. In the draft's second round, the MetroStars selected Josmer Altidore, a 16-year-old striker from Newark. The club acquired a pick in the fourth and final round by trading goalkeeper Zach Wells, 24, to Houston and then selected Blake Camp, 22, a Duke midfielder. JACK BELL (NYT)

1053-> Seeing Four Women’s Lives, Full of Pluses and Minuses
In any work with three or four lead characters of the same sex, it is traditional for each audience member to identify with one character more closely than the others. Strangely, for me, in Keith Urban’s “I {Heart} Kant,” it was Maureen, the size 0 heroin addict in her early 20’s. There, on Lee Savage’s crafty segmented set, are four women whose only apparent common bond is that they live in New Jersey. Under Dylan McCullough’s direction, they all reveal the little humiliations and unexpected certainties of daily life. This is a nimble, knowing one-act with an admirable script carefully structured to appear free-flowing. Linda (Kate Benson), a graduate student in philosophy, has been working on the first chapter of her dissertation on Immanuel Kant for four years. She is annoyed about a male graduate student who is suddenly a star because of his paper on vagueness. Betsy (Frances Mercanti-Anthony) is on edge for two reasons: she is about to turn 30 and she recently drank too much at a family reunion and had sex with her brother. Pam (Edelen McWilliams) is a divorced mom, and really, everything in her life would be fine if someone hadn’t just detonated a bomb in her high-rise office building. Then there is Maureen (Kate Downing), whose boyfriend (Steven Boyer) hits her and explains to her why they take drugs. (“So we don’t have to do all this talking.”) Maybe it’s Maureen’s vulnerability that arouses such empathy. Mr. Boyer plays all the men in the women’s lives, including Betsy’s psychiatrist and the man who manipulates a stuffed cat that turn out to be Linda’s faculty adviser. All the performances are impressively detailed. Unfortunately, the overlapping dialogue, which may have been meant as some comment on avant-garde theatrics, is just noisy. A gimmick that is described in the program (different wardrobe, music and light cues each night) is meaningless to anybody who sees the play only once. But most important, there should have been more of the talking cat.

1054-> Sleeping With The Fishes
Wendy McClure's fish dilemma is a very common problem, from both a medical and an ethical perspective (The Funny Pages, Oct. 29). Bootsy's swimming problems could have been treated medically. There are now many veterinarians who specialize in the care and treatment of fishes. The humane euthanasia of fishes is also a common question. Finquel (also know as tricaine methanesulfonate, or MS-222), a fish anesthesia, is available at some of the larger aquarium outlets. An alternative is clove oil. Clove oil is a topical anesthetic used in dentistry and is available over the counter at most pharmacies. Adding the oil to a quart or two of isopropyl alcohol (I suppose McClure could have used her gin, but it would have proved abit more costly) will render the fish unconscious in about 5 to 10 minutes, whereupon the fish could be frozen and then decapitated. The gin is then consumed at the wake. Bob Groskin, D.V.M. Englewood Animal Hospital Englewood, N.J.

1055-> When No. 1 Has a Hard Time Hiring a No. 2
Since opening her Indian tea shop in Jersey City 10 months ago, Amy Dubin has interviewed more than 40 people to be her assistant manager. She offered the job to two of them, and each lasted two days. The first balked at cleaning the bathroom, the second at doing the dishes and at actually making tea. "Neither understood that in a small business, you have to do everything," Ms. Dubin said. And therein lies a conundrum for owners of very small businesses everywhere: recruiting employees who are smart, energetic and willing to tackle almost any task, even though the hours might be long and the paycheck paltry. Hiring by small businesses has been on the rise since 2002, and more than half of the owners of small businesses hired or tried to hire one or more workers in 2005, according to a study released last month by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, an advocacy group based in Nashville. Yet, 80 percent of small businesses with job openings, according to the study, said they found few or no qualified applicants. The survey mirrors what many owners of small businesses and career specialists already know. "Finding a good employee can be murder," says Frances McGuckin, chief executive of SmallBizPro.com Services, a consulting firm in Langley, British Columbia. As the job market tightens, Ms. McGuckin said, many owners of very small businesses find they cannot compete with the salaries and perks offered by larger companies. But even those very small businesses that can pay well have difficulty locating a jack-of-all-trades. "A sole proprietor does about 60 jobs, so they're going to want to unload 30 of those jobs to an employee," Ms. McGuckin said. "Finding someone who can do all those jobs is a tall order." Ms. Dubin, who likes to think of her tea shop, Janam, as a community where patrons can discuss art and politics and indulge in a free wireless connection, was looking for a talented and shrewd No. 2 who would be able to sell wholesale orders to corporate customers, design store displays, entertain the after-school crowd and be willing to do mundane chores like sweeping the floor. She finally hit pay dirt, just when she had all but given up. Last month, a customer who was a tea enthusiast walked through the door, résumé and cover letter in hand, and asked for a job. "We talked for three hours and she was it," Ms. Dubin said. The woman has been on the job for more than three weeks now, and Ms. Dubin says she is relieved. "I feel extremely lucky," she said. "I had resigned myself to having to go at this alone." She is lucky in another way, too: she had a full-time job to offer. Some small-business owners can afford to hire only part-time workers, and for those owners, the pool of competent candidates is even smaller. Fern Reiss, the chief executive of Expertizing.com, a company in Newton, Mass., that advises people about dealing with the news media, has gone through five assistants in the three years that she has been in business. The first claimed expertise she did not have in replicating compact discs, as Ms. Reiss discovered at a trade show after opening a package of CD's and binders the woman had prepared for her to give out to prospective clients. "Her work was totally shoddy," said Ms. Reiss, who had to redo the project. Two other assistants left after a few months to start their own businesses. The most recent one padded her hours until Ms. Reiss caught on and fired her. Some owners of small businesses have gone to creative lengths to find new talent. For instance, Mark Henson, whose unusual title is chief imagination officer of sparkspace, a company in Columbus, Ohio, that rents rooms for corporate meetings and conferences, wooed interns and recent college graduates by promising to increase their pay and work hours if they would help the business grow. "If you really want a job here, then you'll help me create it," Mr. Henson said. One intern he hired has since been promoted to a part-time staff job, with the chance to advance. "If she is good enough to free me up to do other things, like marketing the space, then she'll work herself into a great position," Mr. Henson said. He is also working to build relationships with local colleges and universities through internship programs, "so we can develop a bit of a farm team to tap into when we need it," he said. Offering candidates a job title that will help them build their resumes is one way to attract top talent, said Debra Condren, a psychologist and career coach with offices in New York City and San Francisco. "Title recognition is particularly attractive to young, talented, ambitious individuals who haven't yet established a track record in their industry," Ms. Condren said. She also recommends that supervisors offer a salary review in three to six months rather than annually and that they promise training and mentoring. That strategy has worked for Christine Comaford-Lynch, managing director of Novus Ventures, a venture capital firm in Cupertino, Calif. A few years ago, Ms. Comaford-Lynch beat out Intel to hire a promising candidate, even though she could not match the company's compensation package. Instead, she promised to introduce the candidate to all of her important contacts. "Luckily, he was a gambling man," she said. Once he joined the firm, Ms. Comaford-Lynch took him under her wing. "He was quickly promoted and his career is positioned for a glorious future," she said. Other specialists recommend offering to give discretionary bonuses to potential hires based on their performance, in lieu of a higher salary. That approach paid off for Vickie Sullivan, president of Sullivan Speaker Services, a firm in Tempe, Ariz., that represents professional speakers. Ms. Sullivan is the company's only full-time employee, but she has had success luring part-time assistants by giving them extra money when they perform well. Another strategy is to form partnerships with other entrepreneurs or independent contractors, rather than hiring somebody to work for you directly. Judi Henderson-Townsend, president of Mannequin Madness in Oakland, Calif., which sells new and used mannequins, recently hired a woman who owns a balloon company to sell her company's products. Because most clients of the two businesses are meeting planners, the alliance makes sense. "For her, the job is just an adjunct to something that she is already doing, so it works," Ms. Henderson-Townsend said. "And anyway, who needs the headaches of having a full-time employee?"

1056-> When Imitation Is Annoying, Not Flattering
IMITATION may be the highest form of flattery. But do you really want someone to copy your entire house? Many people who suffer through a remodeling project find that friends and neighbors love the end result -- so much so that they want to copy it exactly. After all, searching for every last tile, paint color, doorknob and light fixture is extremely time consuming and difficult. If you visit a house you love, why not just copy it? That, at least, seemed to be the reasoning of several of our recent guests. After living in a run-down 1950's ranch-style house in Rolling Hills, Calif., for almost 12 years and searching in vain for another house, we finally worked up the courage to hire an architect. Then, with the help of our contractor and designer, we gutted the entire structure and added 1,000 square feet. "Farmhouse with an edge" was the request we gave to our architect, George Sweeney, who is from Palos Verdes Estates, and our interior designer, Tim Clarke of Santa Monica. I had collected pictures from design magazines for more than a decade, organizing them into notebooks with titles like Fireplaces, Bookcases and Lighting. After countless design meetings and one and a half years of dusty construction, we're now very happy with our home. "I really love this," said a fellow mother at my children's school. "This is exactly what I want!" She was surveying the open kitchen family room, which has a 24-foot ridge beam skylight, wide plank heart pine floors and a stone fireplace inspired by a picture of a 16th-century wall. I had invited her over after recommending my design team for her building project. But she soon ruled out my architect and contractor, partly because of scheduling and cost. Hiring my designer seemed to be out of the question. "Would you mind if I come back to go over what you did?" the mother asked. "It's the exact style I love. I love the soapstone and the bead board." Having paid our designer a huge fee -- and having traipsed all over the city searching for the perfect materials -- this idea left me completely cold. Memories of hitting every stoneyard in the city in search of just the right kitchen counter, making endless samples of stain for the pine floor -- all came flooding back. So did the weeks of indecision, inviting friends over to help with paint samples. Not to mention the years of collecting pictures. It just seemed unfair. So when she called, I didn't call her back. She now seems to be glaring at me in the schoolyard. Am I wrong not to help her? Once you build a house, are you obligated to provide others with your ideas and sources? To be fair, I depended on other people's homes for inspiration. But I quickly learned the hard way that when people have hired a decorator and have paid a design fee of $20,000 to $50,000, plus 35 percent of furniture costs, they aren't too eager to hand over much more than the decorator's name and phone number. When I had asked a neighbor if I could see her newly built home, a rambling farmhouse with a much bigger budget, she replied that her decorator would be happy to take me through it. I wasn't trying to avoid hiring a designer. Being extremely indecisive, I knew I needed the help of someone. I was lucky to get Mr. Clarke, whose other clients, including the actors Matthew Perry and James Spader, all seemed to be famous. But even with his help, I usually felt compelled to see all other possibilities before reaching a decision. I debated every faucet in the city and spent hours taking pictures of stone pilasters. It turned out I wasn't alone in my resistance to being copied. "Most people refuse to let people copy," said my contractor, Bill Howe. "They'll say: 'I'm sorry. I'm flattered. I spent a lot of time and it cost me a lot of money.' " He recently had a client in Palos Verdes Estates design a custom color of stucco, a one-of-a kind taupe. When a neighbor asked for the name of the color, the client refused to divulge the formula. "We just said: 'Sorry. It's custom,' " he said. Indeed, those who don't find imitation the highest form of flattery may sue. After Fred Sands, a real estate magnate from Los Angeles, embarked on the design of a $20 million Bel Air home, two of his architects spotted a remarkably similar Tuscan villa under construction nearby. His architect, William Hablinski, filed suit against the owners of the "copycat house" in a federal court in 2003, alleging copyright infringement. Last April, a jury awarded Mr. Hablinski $5.9 million after finding that one of his former employees had conspired with the defendants to copy the plans. A judge, though, recently granted a retrial on the amount of damages. The suit was based on the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act of 1990, which gives copyright protection to buildings. But what about the hundreds of smaller decorating decisions, things like doorknob choices? Roger Behle Jr., one of Mr. Hablinski's lawyers, says that while design plans can be protected by copyright laws, people rarely file suit over their countertop and paint choices. "If you have yellow drapes and then your neighbor comes over and buys yellow drapes, that's not copyright infringement." he said. Still, it can be irritating. It took Michelle Dewey, the mother of one of my daughter's water polo teammates, more than two years to build a 6,300-square-foot "Old World French-style" home in La Canada Flint-ridge, Calif. "I'm a perfectionist," she said. "If I'm looking for doorknobs, I want the best doorknobs in the country." She raced all over the area, visiting some stoneyards up to 10 times trying to find the perfect slab of marble. Then, recently, she said, a friend who was about to remodel came over and said, "I want those and those and those." The friend, who is using the same contractor, explained that she isn't very picky and would just tell the contractor to "give me whatever Michelle has," Ms. Dewey recalled. This was upsetting. "I labored over my decision-making," Ms. Dewey said. "Everyone wants to know where everything comes from, like it's my job to tell them." Now, she says, her contractor knows not to send people over to see the house. But imitators don't necessarily need to gain access to the inside. Consider Ms. Dewey's front door. She spotted a picture she loved in a magazine and worked with a designer to create a mahogany door on the bottom topped with ironwork, antique glass and a fleur-de-lis design in the middle. Since then, she says, her contractor has received many calls about the door, and similar ones have been "springing up all over the place." "I hope you're not mad at me," said one acquaintance who had managed to come up with a near duplicate. "I just love the door." Of course, someone trying to imitate something doesn't always wind up with exactly the same result. Since I liked our contractor, I encouraged him to bring prospective clients through during the building process. One couple came through over and over again. I could spot the repeat visits since we were staying in the house across the street while the neighbors were away. "I just love what you did," the wife explained, when I discovered her wandering around inside the construction project. One year later, I spotted a truck driver in front of her house unloading what appeared to be my exact style of interior door -- a two-panel Shaker-style door without any decorative molding. When I stopped in to visit, as she had suggested, I noticed a lot of similarities, but it was a very different house. "The houses are similar," said Mr. Howe, my contractor. But he questions whether all my design choices are really so exclusive. "There's nothing new in the world. Everything has been copied." Still, all the arduous decisions make the end result feel like very personal property. So I was surprised, once again, while out on a morning run, to find another construction project within two miles of my house with a wall matching our stonework, almost exactly, covering the front of the house. There was the same Lompoc stone with wide mortar, designed to look like the 16th-century wall I had spotted in a design magazine many years ago. I talked to the people working on the house and learned that they were using the same architect and mason. George Sweeney, my architect, does not think I need to worry about the similar stone design. "Your family fireplace is unique," he said. Indeed, he said, "it's wonderful you have a house people want to imitate." Not everyone does. Madson Buchbinder, a friend, spent more than a year creating a "restored, 70's, modern, minimal" home in Long Beach -- in keeping with her husband's enthusiasm for modern design. "My house looks like a jail cell," she said. "No one is going to come copy it. My contractor calls it the iceberg." The floors are white marble. The kitchen counter is white marble. Even the dining room table is white marble. Ms. Buchbinder said, "I can't imagine what it would feel like to have a home that someone wanted to copy."

1057-> Romps by and About a Firebrand of Florence
Poor Machiavelli. The English language has made his very name synonymous with deceit and duplicity. For many people he was the embodiment of evil. Now there are two plays being staged at Manhattan Theater Source, a new one about his exile and a revival of his "Mandrake," in which his life and work are merely the fodder for whimsical comedy. In fact, Machiavelli was just the prototype of modern power politics. He sought to serve the republic of Florence by any means possible. If that meant lying, cheating and betrayal, well, it was Machiavelli who wrote that the ends often justify the means. He was, in that regard, no more nefarious than any competent lobbyist, spin doctor or politician working in Washington today. The new play, by Richard Vetere, is simply called "Machiavelli," with the subtitle "a comedy." The program should also carry a warning that while it is based on real people, almost nothing that happens onstage is true. After a prologue in rhymed couplets, the play opens with Machiavelli in prison undergoing torture. So far, so good. After the Medici returned to power in Florence in 1512, Machiavelli was fired from his post in the government. Two months later he was arrested and tortured on suspicion of being part of an anti-Medici plot. From then on, Mr. Vetere's play takes off on flights of fancy. Machiavelli was indeed spared execution and exiled to his estate outside Florence, where the play's second act takes place, but it was not as a result of his wife sleeping with Giuliano de' Medici, or of Machiavelli outwitting both Giuliano and his nephew Lorenzo when they visited him in prison. It is clear that Mr. Vetere is writing strictly for laughs. With his director, Andrew Frank, he has turned two Medici leaders into cartoon characters. When Giuliano enters Machiavelli's cell, he more resembles a foppish courtier, like Osric in "Hamlet," than the ruling prince of Florence. Lorenzo, on the other hand, comes on like a Renaissance Terminator, a bloodthirsty killer who lives only to whack people to death. A good cast delivers on the humor, and James Wetzel is especially admirable in the title role. But by playing so fast and loose with history, "Machiavelli" ends up being a spoof rather than a sophisticated comedy. (And for the record, Lorenzo did not assassinate Giuliano, nor did he woo Machiavelli's daughter or die by the sword. Both those Medici princes died natural deaths, Lorenzo eight years before Machiavelli.) During his exile on his farm, Machiavelli grew olives and wrote. He wrote "The Prince," "The Discourses" and "The Art of War," all works on which his reputation as a conniving, amoral politician is based. He also wrote plays. Oddly, he wrote comedies for the stage. If he was not exactly the Neil Simon of 16th-century Florence, he packed them in and left them laughing. His most popular play was "The Mandrake," which was widely performed and, by all accounts, wildly popular. The title comes from the old wives' tale that a woman who drinks a potion made from the mandrake root is certain to conceive a child, the only drawback being that the man with whom she first has sex after taking the potion will die within eight days. The story evolves around Callimaco, a lovesick Florentine who will do anything to bed Lucrezia, the beautiful young wife of Nicia, a doddering lawyer desperate for an heir. To his lustful ends Callimaco employs the services of Ligurio and Brother Timothy, a priest who will do anything for money. Some critics have tried to find a théâtre à clef in the play, but one could as easily assign real-life identities from the Bush White House as from the Medici court for Machiavelli's characters. As written by Machiavelli, "The Mandrake" is aimed at exposing the cupidity and corruption of church and state in Renaissance Florence. In the hands of Daryl Boling, the director, it is a sex romp, more a burlesque than a satirical farce. Still, the staging is not without its laughs, and a new translation by Vincent Marano is faithful to the original. Mr. Boling has employed a lot of shtick, especially when any hint of a double entendre crops up in the text. One extended bit of business with a bottle containing a urine sample almost reduces the entire proceedings to the nature of a frat house skit. An able and energetic cast throws itself into the action and earns its chuckles. Jeffrey Plunkett is quite good as Callimaco, giving a passable Gene Wilder impersonation in one monologue, and Michael Shattner is a droll foil as Nicia. "Machiavelli" runs through Feb. 4 and "The Mandrake" through Jan. 28 at Manhattan Theater Source, 177 MacDougal Street; (212) 260-4698.

1059-> Smiles Above, Grimaces Below
To the Editor: "Don't Fence the Sky," by Patrick Smith (Op-Ed, Oct. 29), was evidently written from the point of view of private pilots, a very small portion of the population. While his view that the risks of private aviation in the vicinity of Manhattan's buildings are overstated may have some validity, his article does not take into account the other negative effects of such traffic. Specifically, the volume of private aviation, including small planes and helicopters transporting tourists who would visit the city in any case, creates great noise pollution that adversely affects the quality of life of thousands of residents who live near the flight paths. It is unconscionable that the recreational interests of a few affluent people take precedence over and damage the daily living conditions of large numbers of city residents.

1060-> CONFERENCE CALL
A.C.C. No. 18 Maryland (14-5 over all), whose top scorer, Chris McCray, has been suspended for the season for academic reasons, had trouble on offense in a loss at Temple. That does not bode well for the Terrapins as they prepare to play host to North Carolina on Thursday and visit No. 15 North Carolina State next Sunday. BIG EAST Rutgers (13-7, 3-4) helped its faint N.C.A.A. tournament hopes with a quality victory against No. 22 Louisville. The Scarlet Knights have a shot at another such victory Wednesday when they play at No. 25 Syracuse (15-5, 3-3) which enters today's home game against Seton Hall (11-6, 2-3) on a three-game losing streak. No. 9 West Virginia (14-4, 5-0), the league leader, plays today at St. John's (10-7, 3-3). Connecticut (18-1, 6-1) is likely to face a stern challenge to its No. 1 ranking Tuesday when it plays host to No. 12 Pittsburgh (17-1, 6-1). BIG TEN Michigan (15-3, 5-2), off to its best start in 13 seasons, gained its second consecutive victory against a top 25 team when it beat No. 23 Wisconsin. The Wolverines moved into a tie for first place with the Badgers, No. 8 Illinois and Iowa. No. 11 Michigan State (16-5, 4-3) rebounded from its loss to Michigan by defeating Penn State despite being without center Paul Davis. He felt lightheaded after being elbowed in the head at practice Friday. BIG 12 No. 24 Oklahoma (13-4, 4-2) ended the nine-game winning streak of No. 5 Texas (17-3, 5-1) and tightened the standings. Texas is a half-game ahead of second-place Colorado (15-3, 5-2) and a game ahead of Oklahoma and Kansas, who meet next Sunday. PAC-10 No. 17 U.C.L.A. (17-4, 7-2) held on to first place by winning at Oregon State. The Bruins are likely to face a challenge to that lead Saturday when they play host to Arizona (13-7, 6-3), whose three-game winning streak ended with a loss at North Carolina. SEC Louisiana State (14-5, 6-0) strengthened its hold on first place in the West division with its victory at Mississippi. The Tigers have won six in a row. No. 19 Tennessee (14-3, 5-1), held on to the East lead with a victory at home against south carolina.

1061-> Will Agriculture Stay a Bright Spot in the Trade Data?
The trade deficit is always a dismaying topic. Every time new statistics come out, it’s a fresh reminder that the United States keeps importing far more than it exports, digging itself deeper into this particular hole. The latest numbers from the Census Bureau show a $63.8 billion May deficit, and as always, the gap with China kept widening, to $17.7 billion. Ethan S. Harris, a Lehman Brothers economist, said that the United States and China are “both dancing on the Titanic here,” suggesting that such a precarious imbalance in global trade could not continue indefinitely. Through it all, though, Americans could take comfort in being, at least, one of the world’s breadbaskets, with surplus after surplus in agricultural products. As recently as 2002, the United States exported $53.1 billion worth of such products, but imported only $41.9 billion worth. But even there the advantage is eroding. In April, in fact, agriculture slipped into a slight deficit, though the overall May figures — which actually weren’t bad if you could take oil out of the equation — gave agricultural exports an edge again.

1062-> Study Points to a Solution for Dread: Distraction
For those who dread a colonoscopy or a root canal so much that they avoid it altogether, scientists have good news. The first study ever to look at where sensations of dread arise in the brain finds that contrary to what is widely believed, dread does not involve fear and anxiety in the moment of an unpleasant event. Instead, it derives from the attention that people devote beforehand to what they think will be extremely unpleasant. So the solution to dread, the researchers say, is self-distraction. "We sort of knew that things like self-hypnosis help relieve dread, but now we know why," said Dr. Gregory S. Berns, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Emory University, who led the study. The research, being published today in the journal Science, is "terrific, " said a leading expert on brain imaging, Dr. Read Montague, a professor of neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine who was not involved in the study. It demonstrates that the brain "assigns a cost to waiting for something bad, so that the bad thing is worse when it's delayed farther in the future," Dr. Montague said. "Hence," he said, "the 'let's get it over with' bit when we're at the doctor's office waiting to get a shot." The research also sheds light on economic behavior, said George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist at Carnegie Mellon University. According to standard economic models of human behavior, choosing more pain in the short run is irrational, Dr. Loewenstein said: if you know something bad is going to happen, you should postpone it as long as possible, and if something good is going to happen, you should want it right away. In real life, people often do the exact opposite, he said. They delay gratification to savor a sweet sense of anticipation, and accelerate punishment just to get it over with. The new study sheds light, he said, on how the act of waiting can be used to describe economic behavior more accurately. For the study, Dr. Berns put 32 people into a brain scanner and applied brief electric shocks to the tops of their left feet. After their maximum pain threshold was determined, meaning the most pain they could withstand, they were each presented a series of 96 cues. Each cue stated how much voltage they were about to experience and how long they would have to wait for it. For example, one cue might say they were about to receive 60 percent of their maximum pain after 27 seconds. Another might warn of a 30 percent maximum shock after 9 seconds. Next the subjects were given options involving various combinations of voltage and how long they had to wait for it . For example, they could choose between getting 90 percent of their maximum voltage after three seconds or 60 percent after 27 seconds. Then they received the chosen shock to the foot. The scanner detected the brain activity involved in waiting for shocks, providing a road map for understanding the dread response. Twenty-three of the people, termed "mild dreaders," chose as short a delay as possible for any given voltage but were not willing to accept more pain just to get it over with, Dr. Berns said. The nine others, called "extreme dreaders," always took the highest voltage if it was sooner rather than later. They gladly accepted more pain to reduce their dread time. In comparing the brain scans of both groups, Dr. Berns found only one difference. During the waiting period, extreme dreaders showed high activity in a part of the brain's so-called pain matrix that involves attention. The pain matrix is a set of brain regions that become active when people experience pain, Dr. Berns said. Parts of it deal with sensing the body, while other regions are involved in intuition, emotions, fear or attention. Extreme dreaders, he said, deploy more attention to their soon-to-be-shocked foot than do mild dreaders. Above all else, dread involves attention to unpleasant things to come, making it quite different from anxiety or fear. When it comes to a root canal or a colonoscopy, it is not really the procedures themselves that people dread, but the waiting time, Dr. Berns said. For extreme dreaders, finding distraction is probably the best way to cope.

1064-> Creating Space for Town Services
RENEE BRATHWAITE would like to hire at least three more workers to help out in the cramped Justice Court in Southampton, the third busiest town court in New York State. "I don't have enough room to even ask for more people," Ms. Brathwaite, the chief clerk, said recently in her small corner office, once part of a larger office that was divided to create a file room. The court, which handled 3,800 civil cases, 4,200 criminal cases and more than 30,500 traffic tickets in 2004, is in the basement of Southampton Town Hall, a former public school building in the village of Southampton. The courthouse conditions are almost as crowded as the docket: three judges share a single chamber, a 150-capacity waiting room regularly holds nearly 200, 14 women employees share a single-stall bathroom and workers have to call ahead to ask if prisoners are being led in before they walk past the rear door. In the Land Management Department upstairs, rolls of building plans awaiting review are piled atop file cabinets in a maze of gray cubicles separated by footpath-sized corridors. "We're very tight for space," said Richard Blowes, the town management services administrator. "We're overflowing in some of these buildings, even in our Police Department." The town of Southampton is nearly 140 square miles and, in 2000, it had 35,836 housing units, according to the census. Of those, 35 percent were seasonal homes. Town officials estimated in a 1999 report on the Southampton Web site that the population triples during the summer months. Nowhere is that more apparent than on Montauk Highway at what is known locally as "the merge," the point in western Southampton where four lanes narrow to two. Cars and trucks of summer residents, landscapers and town workers, among others, crawl past the merge continuously from sunrise to sundown most days. In a resolution passed in February that may ultimately change daily life for Southampton town residents and improve crowded inefficient public facilities, the town approved the earliest phase of an innovative $40 million project that may take up to 10 years to complete. Roger Ferris, an architect and consultant whose firm, Roger Ferris & Partners, worked for a year with the town and with other consultants to analyze current facilities and produce what officials call the Jackson Avenue comprehensive plan. The plan would cluster many of the town's disparate facilities on a 30-acre town-owned site on the western end of town in the hamlet of Hampton Bays, bounded by Jackson Avenue, Old Riverhead Road and Red Creek Park. The site is west of the merge and would, among other things, alleviate some traffic congestion and move the town court next to the Police Department. The police station is already at the site along with other dilapidated municipal buildings, including facilities where public works functions are performed, a waste transfer facility and an old bait shack that is now space to the town's coast trustees. Seven buildings in all are planned, Mr. Ferris said, including a new town court. Next door, the ball fields and picnic areas in Red Creek Park would be expanded. The first $4 million approved for the project will be used to clean up the site, remove debris and update the public works building. "It's really kind of a disaster," Mr. Ferris said of the current site. "There are pine barrens all over the place, ecological issues that really need to be attended to." Restoring the area to its original state is the first step in a redevelopment that officials hope will meet the highest level of the emerging Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standard for environmentally sensitive development. The standard was created by the United States Green Building Council, an organization with members from the building industry in the United States and Canada. "It's not a common thing yet, but it's rapidly becoming the most important certification that you can get if you want to make your building green," said Marc Clejan, managing director of Greenlogic Energy in East Hampton, a company that installs solar energy-based systems. Mr. Clejan saw Mr. Ferris's February presentation in Southampton and intends to bid on the alternative energy part of the Jackson Avenue project if the town goes ahead with the plan and requests proposals. Although this element has not yet been formally approved, the plan lays out several ambitious green goals. These include the use of geothermal heat pumps, wind turbines and solar panels for power; building designs that maximize natural light and good air quality; and restoration of the mixed oak and pitch pine, low bush blueberry and black huckleberry of the original surrounding pine barrens. Another progressive feature is a wetlands area that would remove phosphates from the site's filtered wastewater using naturally occurring bacteria and then send the water outflow to irrigate plantings in the area. In a rendering, the wetlands area looks more like a very large koi pond, with water cascading down varying levels of rock walls and spiky green plants lining the banks of a stream. The scope of the green project, if it is achieved, would put Southampton in the vanguard of green development, according to Victor Canseco, owner of Sandpebble Builders, the company that is managing the Jackson Avenue project. "There's no real precedent for this, but it's something that would set a precedent for what could be done on say a school campus, a company campus or a town campus to make not just the buildings green but making the whole campus green," Mr. Canseco said. The town is addressing Hampton Bays residents' concerns about traffic congestion and the relocation of a wastewater treatment plant on the site from a central area to the area's periphery, Mr. Blowes said. Before the recent resolution was approved, there had been a plan to move all of town hall to Hampton Bays, but that was dropped in response to complaints by residents in the eastern part of town that they would have to travel too far west for basic services. "So we decided to retain town hall in Southampton for historical and for practical reasons," Mr. Blowes said, "and we decided to move forward with the design of the court facility." The details need to be worked out as yet and proposals will be requested for the new courthouse design in coming months, Mr. Blowes said, but if the plan continues moving forward "we hope to put a shovel in the ground by the end of fall this year."

1066-> Study Plays Down Export of Computer Jobs
The movement of computing work abroad represents an economic and scientific challenge, but the fears of job migration far outweigh the reality so far, according to a new study by the Association for Computing Machinery. The lengthy report, to be released today, is the result of a yearlong project by the professional organization to assess the impact and implications of the outsourcing of software development and research. The study concluded that dire predictions of job losses from shifting high-technology work to low-wage nations with strong education systems, like India and China, were greatly exaggerated. Though international in perspective, the study group found that the most likely prognosis for the United States would be that 2 percent to 3 percent of the jobs in information technology would go offshore annually over the next decade or so. But more jobs will be created than are lost in the future, they said, as long as the industry in America moves up the economic ladder to do higher-value work -- typically, applying information technology to other fields, like biology and business. They noted that employment in the information technology industry was higher today than it was at the peak of the dot-com bubble, despite the growth of offshore outsourcing in the last few years. "The global competition has gotten tougher and we have to run faster," said Moshe Y. Vardi, co-chair of the study group and a computer scientist at Rice University. "But the notion that information technology jobs are disappearing is just nonsense. The data don't bear that out." Yet the view that job opportunities in computing are dwindling fast is both common and potentially damaging to America's competitive prowess, according to David A. Patterson, president of the Association for Computing Machinery. He pointed to the declining interest in computer science as a major among American college students, based on a survey last year of the intentions of students entering college. The results suggested that only 1 in 75 students would major in computer science, compared with 1 in 30 in 2000. "The perception among high school students and their parents is that the game is over -- that all computing jobs are going overseas," observed Mr. Patterson, who is a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley. "It's an extraordinarily widely held misperception." The concern, he said, is that misplaced pessimism will deter bright young people from pursuing careers in computing. That, in turn, would erode the skills in a field that is crucial to the nation's economic competitiveness. In the recent debate on outsourcing, software has been considered one of the industries most susceptible to rapid job migration because code can be easily shipped over the Internet anywhere in the world. So the report's generally reassuring outlook is significant. Still, offshore outsourcing raises some serious issues, the report noted. The benefits and pain of the globalization of technical work are unevenly spread. "It may be good for the economy, but it may not be good for you" if you lose your job, said Mr. Vardi of Rice University. Federal job retraining programs, the report said, are currently focused on the manufacturing industry instead of high-technology services. The report also calls for changes in computing education. "This is a huge challenge to education," Mr. Vardi said, "to try to determine what is the right mix of skills as we try to move up the economic ladder." Ronil Hira, an assistant professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, was one of the experts consulted by the computing association's study group. Mr. Hira, coauthor of "Outsourcing America," said the report took "a feel-good" stance on the outlook for jobs.

1067-> BRIEFS: ECONOMY; CORZINE ADDRESSES FISCAL ILLS
A day after taking office, Gov. Jon S. Corzine left open the possibility last Wednesday that New Jersey's looming fiscal problems could force him to freeze aid to the state's municipalities. During a meeting with members of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, the first public event on his first full day as governor, Mr. Corzine said his administration was still weighing a range of options to address a budget deficit that he has predicted might be as high as $6 billion. While the governor reiterated his desire to lower property taxes, improve the child welfare system and possibly provide more money for antiterrorism efforts, he would not be drawn into a discussion of how the deficit might affect municipal aid.

1070-> National Briefing | West: California: Korean Grocers Sue Andrew Young
A Korean grocers' group has sued the former United Nations ambassador Andrew Young for libel for saying that they and other market owners "ripped off" blacks. The suit, filed recently in Los Angeles County Superior Court, also names the Wal-Mart store chain and seeks at least $7.5 million in damages. Mr. Young resigned as head of a Wal-Mart advocacy group on Aug. 18 amid controversy over comments he had made in an interview. The libel suit was filed by the California Korean American Grocery Retailer Association. Mr. Young did not return a telephone call to his spokesman's office, and Wal-mart declined to comment.

1071-> Scientists Commend NASA's Progress on Communications
A review of communications policies at NASA, set off by reports that political appointees had tried to muzzle some agency scientists, received a public vote of support yesterday from dozens of scientists and other staff members at the space agency. More than 140 NASA scientists, engineers and other civil servants from research centers across the country put their names on a statement, distributed in an e-mail message last night, that applauded the agency's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, for following up on his Feb. 4 pledge of "scientific openness." "His subsequent actions have reinforced his words," the statement said. A dozen senior NASA scientists and public affairs officials are drafting the agency's first new policy on public communications since 1987. The review began after political appointees altered news releases and Web presentations against the wishes of some NASA scientists and tried to restrict public comments by James E. Hansen, a top NASA climate scientist. Dr. Hansen has repeatedly said that global warming caused by humans poses an urgent threat, a position at odds with that of the Bush administration. Several civil servants involved in the review said in recent interviews that they were confident that the changes being considered would, if they gained final approval, limit the potential for political interference. A NASA official working on the draft policy, which is about five pages long, said it would probably be ready for review by Dr. Griffin and other senior officials by midweek. The official, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the review, said that for the moment, the policy met Dr. Griffin's stated goal of allowing NASA employees to discuss the implications of their work and not just the scientific facts, as long as they emphasized that they were speaking as individuals and not for the agency. Earlier this year, political appointees in the NASA press office repeatedly said that agency scientists could not discuss the broader implications of their work. The official involved in the review also said the new draft policy would ensure that if a reporter sought to speak with a specific NASA scientist, that could take place if the scientist was amenable. Dr. Hansen had been told earlier this year that his supervisors had the right to pre-empt him and do interviews in his place. "The goal is that the people directly responsible for a particular thing, a particular piece of research, should be the ones who speak," said the official. Yesterday, Dr. Hansen distributed an e-mail message to dozens of colleagues and other contacts saying that he, too, was satisfied that the review was substantive and that it was time for him to return to his climate research. Citing reports of efforts to filter scientific information and limit news media access to reporters at other scientific agencies, Dr. Hansen wrote: "The battle to achieve open communication between government scientists and their employer, the public, is far from won. Nevertheless, I agree with the opinion of colleagues that the focus should be on discussing solutions to global warming." "My personal aim is to get back to science research full time," he said, "especially on quantifying options for dealing with global warming."

1072-> NO PLANE NEEDED; Getting Off The Ground
MANY people associate paragliding with hang gliding, which went through a period of serious accidents when it first started. Hang gliders use metal spars and a triangular wing; paragliders are flying parachutes with no rigid structural parts. "Hang gliding started with barefoot hippies jumping off sand dunes in the early 70's with homemade gliders," said Steve Roti, an official with the United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association, known as Ushpa. Jim Little of Portland, Ore., a family physician and paragliding pilot who has studied accidents for Ushpa, says he believes paragliding's injury rate per participant is similar to that of activities like motorcycling, horseback riding and snowmobiling. The most common injuries are sprained or broken legs and ankles; fatalities are rare but do occur, Dr. Little said. "In aviation you can't leave the ground without assuming some degree of risk," he said. New pilots at paragliding schools must sign as many as five liability releases. You don't need a license from the Federal Aviation Administration to fly a paraglider, though Ushpa has established a voluntary pilot rating system that is followed at most domestic sites. While paragliders are not certified by the F.A.A., almost all of them are now commercially made and are tested by the German Hanggliding Association. Eagle Paragliding in Santa Barbara, Calif. (805-968-0980; www.eagleparagliding.com),offers one- and two-day introductory classes beginning at $200. The novice certification package requires six to eight days to earn a rating that allows flying without the supervision of an instructor and costs $1,500. Tandem flights are available for anyone under 250 pounds at any age with no experience necessary. Cost for a tandem flight is $250 with a video of your flight taken with a "helmet cam," or $200 without the video. The United States Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association (www.ushga.org -- it only recently added paragliding to its name), lists paragliding schools in California and elsewhere, along with events and other news and information. A complete paragliding rig (helmet, harness, paraglider and reserve chute) costs about $5,500. BILL BECHER

1076-> National Briefing | South: Georgia: Record Crystal Methamphetamine Raid
Just six days after federal agents set a state record by confiscating 187 pounds of crystal methamphetamine buried behind a home in Buford, federal, state and local law enforcement officers found 341 pounds of the crystals in Gainesville, the authorities announced. The stash was the sixth-largest supply of methamphetamine confiscated in the United States since 1970, said Ruth Porter-Whipple, the group supervisor of the Atlanta field division of the Drug Enforcement Agency. The discovery has alarmed drug enforcement agents and helped confirm Atlanta's emerging role as a distribution hub for crystal methamphetamine. Brenda Goodman (NYT)

1077-> Bush and the Senator-Elect: Who Was Rude? (2 Letters)
To the Editor: Re “A Breach of Manners Sets a Tough Town Atwitter” (Week in Review, Dec. 3): Who was rude? Senator-elect James Webb or President Bush? If my son were in Iraq and anyone asked how he was doing, I would say, “I worry about him every waking hour of my day.” That is basically what Mr. Webb said: “I’d like to get them out of Iraq.” The president, instead of saying “I do, too!,” responded, “I didn’t ask you that!” Who was rude here: the man who lives with the fear of his son’s safety, or the guy who lives in a bubble of fantasy? Patricia Shillingburg Shelter Island Heights, N.Y. Dec. 4, 2006 • To the Editor: It is stunning that a frank remark by the new senator from Virginia to the president about the war in Iraq is considered a breach of etiquette. President Bush is not a monarch. His testy response shows again that he believes he need answer to no one. Patricia J. Raube-Wilson Binghamton, N.Y., Dec. 4, 2006

1082-> Clinton Rival Tries to Make Most of Liberal Anger
As Ned Lamont basks in his Democratic primary victory in Connecticut, another antiwar underdog is trying to assume the same role of political giant-killer in next month’s elections in New York, though against much bigger prey: Hillary Rodham Clinton. But while Mr. Lamont united liberals and used $4 million of his own money to win his primary, Jonathan Tasini is struggling on a shoestring campaign to rise above his 12 percent standing in the polls, even as he hawks a message of left-wing anger over Iraq to an electorate that is more liberal than Connecticut’s. Mr. Tasini has qualified for the Sept. 12 primary ballot against Mrs. Clinton, and his positions on the Iraq war, the death penalty and gay marriage are in step with the progressive groups and liberal bloggers that contributed volunteers, money and buzz to Mr. Lamont. Yet some of these partisans say they are deeply reluctant, and in some cases scared, to criticize or abandon Mrs. Clinton, who supported the invasion of Iraq. They cite her power in the Democratic Party and her careful positioning that has made her, if not antiwar, then a sharp critic of the administration’s handling of Iraq, Hurricane Katrina and the economy. A former union leader, tireless and impolitic, Mr. Tasini has stirred some enthusiasm among voters — even young women, who are the Clinton core — and he is increasingly well received by liberal audiences, based on interviews with voters and time spent watching him work crowds. One reason for the enthusiasm is Mr. Lamont’s upset win over Senator Joseph I. Lieberman; some people wonder if some of that success could be replicated in New York. But Mr. Tasini has raised only $200,000 to Mrs. Clinton’s $44 million, and she has undercut his best shot at visibility by refusing to debate him. “I’m the eternal optimist, and I have two reasons to be optimistic: 65 percent of people don’t know me, and 62 percent solidly oppose the war,” Mr. Tasini said in an interview, referring to recent polls. “But Hillary is being incredibly antidemocratic by not debating me even though I am on the ballot.” Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Senator Clinton, said his camp would “see how the campaign plays out” before making a final decision on a debate. But Mr. Wolfson pointedly added that the New York race would not be a replay of the Connecticut primary two weeks ago. “The bottom line is that Hillary Clinton is no Joe Lieberman and Jonathan Tasini is no Ned Lamont, and no amount of increasingly over-the-top attacks from Mr. Tasini will change that reality,” he said. Mr. Wolfson was referring to a series of remarks by Mr. Tasini over the last several months: He has blamed Mrs. Clinton personally for the deaths of 2,500 American service members and others in Iraq, for instance, as well as “tens of thousands of Iraqis.” Mr. Tasini, who, at 49, has never run for public office before, is a complicated political animal. He has even been sharply critical of Mr. Lamont, arguing that he is insufficiently antiwar and would never have won without spending $4 million of his own money. Mr. Lamont, like Mrs. Clinton, has also strongly supported Israel in the ongoing conflict with Lebanon, while Mr. Tasini — who has many family members in Israel — has chastised Israel for its bombing and invasion of Lebanon. Mr. Tasini can come across as smart, credible, self-effacing, bombastic, self-aggrandizing and haughty, sometimes all in one conversation. Asked about his huge deficit in public opinion polls, Mr. Tasini can spin like a veteran politician: “If 100 percent of the population knew me, would I get all 62 percent of the antiwar vote? Well, maybe not all.” Some members of the National Writers Union, which Mr. Tasini led from 1990 to 2003, have openly described him as an opportunist, and his response is couched in characteristic hyperbole. “I don’t think I walk on water, but I am not the devil incarnate,” he said. Mr. Tasini was born in Houston but spent part of his childhood in New York State and now lives in Washington Heights, in Manhattan. He earned a bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles. To many antiwar partisans and liberal groups, Mr. Tasini is also not enough of a threat to Mrs. Clinton to be useful in pressuring her over Iraq. They say that instead of intervening in the primary race, it is more important to keep Mrs. Clinton as an ally and try to influence her foreign policy in friendly ways, since she could well become a presidential candidate in 2008. Otherwise, some fear, she might freeze them out. James Dean, the head of Democracy for America, a grass-roots group that fervently supported Mr. Lamont, said he planned to stay on the sidelines in the Clinton-Tasini contest. Mr. Dean said that his group was not scared to take on Senator Clinton over Iraq, but that there was “a time and a place” for such challenges — and spurning her within her own party did not make sense. “I think progressives are a lot more pragmatic than people think, and there are only so many battles that you can pick in one election year,” said Mr. Dean, whose brother, Howard Dean, inspired the group during his presidential bid in 2004. “Hillary has also clearly been a critic of the administration.” Roger Hickey, a co-director of Campaign for America’s Future, a liberal group that praised the Lamont victory, initially declined to speak about Mr. Tasini’s bid. He agreed to comment on the New York race only in relatively narrow terms. “Hillary by and large is a team player in terms of Democratic Party politics, and there’s one issue — the war — where we all felt she should have changed her position and where she is very slowly modifying to an antiwar position,” Mr. Hickey said. “The Connecticut race required one tactic from activist groups, a frontal tactic, and other races require other sorts of tactics.” Markos Moulitsas, whose blog, the Daily Kos, championed Mr. Lamont, was more blunt in explaining why he had not taken up Mr. Tasini’s banner. “I fed off the excitement and energy Lamont created amongst Connecticut activists and bloggers,” Mr. Moulitsas wrote in an e-mail message. “I see none of that energy or excitement for Tasini.” Mr. Tasini said he had a chicken-and-egg problem: Groups like MoveOn.org say their New York members are not excited enough about Mr. Tasini to become involved in the race, yet these groups have not systematically polled members to determine that. As a result, Mr. Tasini has had little help with introducing himself to voters. Some of them are not sure what to make of him, anyway. Tramping across picnic blankets before the outdoor movie in Bryant Park on Monday night — “Take off your shoes,” people yelled — Mr. Tasini drew skeptical glares as he bellowed: “New York Democrats? Any Democrats here?” Here and there he was invited to make his pitch: that Senator Clinton “supports criminalizing flag-burning,” “supports discrimination against gay couples on marriage,” and “supports the Yankees even though I’m the lifelong Yankees fan.” He was clearly grateful for any attention. Out of 20 voters who talked to Mr. Tasini, about half said in interviews afterward that they would consider voting for him. Among those were a group of young female voters, a demographic that the Clinton camp views as part of its core support. “I think Senator Clinton’s more of an opportunist, like supporting the war and now really criticizing it,” said Sarah Kaufmann, 23, a teacher in New York. “I hadn’t heard much about that guy before tonight, but he sounded like he cared about Democratic ideals.”

1088-> Searching Margaritaville for the Perfect Key Lime Pie
TRAVELERS come to the Florida Keys for the sun, the sand and the scenery of America gone Caribbean. They come for bone-fishing in the morning, margaritas at midday and sunset celebrations at dusk. And before it's time to depart, everybody wants a piece of Key lime pie. Never mind that most Key limes  golf-ball-size and yellowish, in contrast to the larger, greener Persian lime  are grown these days in Mexico. Or that first-rate Key lime pie can now be had in places like Brooklyn. A theme still hums through this island chain, audible to every tourist: "I eat Key lime pie, therefore I am vacationing in the Keys." The pie can be found in places from roadside diners to swank hotel restaurants. And if you drive out along the Key lime pie trail  U.S. 1 from Key Largo to Key West  you'll find no two pies are quite alike. The variety reflects a certain rugged individualism that's part and parcel of the way of life in the Keys, which have a sun-splashed beauty that often belies a rough-around-the-edges, weatherbeaten quality. Although the pie's origins remain a little fuzzy, there's a theory that without a supply of fresh milk  cows weren't around  settlers on the Keys took to making a pie with lime juice, eggs and condensed milk. Modern pastry chefs often twist and tweak a basic recipe: four egg yolks, a can of condensed milk and half a cup of bottled Key lime juice. The crust may be graham-cracker or pastry; the topping meringue or whipped cream. Nellie & Joe's is the most popular brand of lime juice, though some note that the label says the product is "Key West lime juice," leading to suspicion that Persian limes are part of the mix. The company, which no longer does its bottling in the Keys, having moved near Fort Lauderdale, will say only that the juice is based on a secret formula. My Key lime pie odyssey began in Homestead, the mostly rural city that's a gateway to both the Keys and the Everglades, at Robert Is Here, a homey stand about a mile west of U.S. 1 that specializes in tropical fruits long cultivated in the area. The owner, Robert Moehling, is indeed usually there, ready to explain his stock of fruits, which you'll never see in your neighborhood supermarket, from hard-to-find varieties of mangoes to the monstera deliciosa, which tastes like a cross between a banana and pineapple. He'll sell you Key limes, too  and Key lime pies, tarts and assorted products. But he's perhaps most renowned for his Key lime milkshake, which is thick, frosty and intensely flavorful. BUT where are the limes from? The amiable Mr. Moehling, who started the stand when he was a child, said there were local sources and pointed to a distant patch of Key lime trees, squat and thorny, on a neighboring farm. But he admitted that in fact, his supply comes from abroad. Homestead was the last place in Florida where Key limes were grown commercially, but the groves have been lost to hurricanes, citrus disease and encroaching development. When I asked Mr. Moehling what Homestead grows these days, he replied matter-of-factly, "Houses." From Homestead, I took Route 1 to Key Largo and into the Keys' most commercial and least scenic stretch, a place where tourists too lazy to drive farther south can pretend they have still gotten a taste of the islands. Signs called out "Yes, we have Key lime pie!" with what struck me as an air of desperation. Not the place to stop, I decided. Islamorada, where the pace becomes decidedly slower, and where you can actually see the water from the road (Florida Bay to your right; the Atlantic Ocean to your left), held more promise. At the Cheeca Lodge, a famed 60-year-old luxury resort that emphasizes what might be called tropical elegance  with hammocks along a beach lined with palm trees and plasma televisions in the well-appointed rooms  I enjoyed my Key lime pie in an airy courtyard setting that seemed to speak of the privileged essence of idleness. The pie was first-class and traditional, with a graham-cracker crust and a hint of whipped cream. The filling was sweet, but the squirt of lime juice on top balanced the taste with the necessary zing, and the result was like summer in a mouthful. I also found an actual Key lime tree on the property, but it was stripped bare; hotel employees had harvested all the limes last fall before a hurricane could do the job. On to Marathon, another commercialized stretch, where big-box stores and fast-food restaurants are everywhere. But the vibe is not so much touristy as working-class: although trailer homes can easily run to a half-million dollars in these parts, there's a contingent of Keys old-timers still hanging on. I found a good many of them at the Wooden Spoon, a half-century-old diner that looks like the sort of place you'd go for an early breakfast before a big day of fishing. The cooking was honest and homespun, and the pie was a throwback to the 1950's  an icebox pie, with a filling more like Key lime-flavored frozen whipped cream than custard. It was beyond delicious. Porky's Bayside Restaurant, an open-air barbecue place that's also on Marathon, had another variation: fried Key lime pie. It sounds stranger than it tasted  the crunchiness of the coating worked as a nice contrast to the creamy middle. But it was still not your normal pie. Then again, this wasn't your normal 'cue joint, as evidenced by the aging vocalist who commanded the restaurant's small stage, singing a fractured version of Jimmy Buffett's "Margaritaville"  the Keys' unofficial anthem  and dressed as if ready to play Johnny Depp's co-conspirator in the next "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie. Heading farther southwest, I drove across the landmark even Mile BridgeS. At one point, the span was so high I could fantasize that I had traded my Honda Civic for a small airplane. But I eventually came down to earth, and what terra firma it is. The Lower Keys have held on to that sense of unspoiled isolation that traditionally defined the chain. At Bahia Honda State Park, shorebirds seem more eager than sunbathers to claim the pristine beach. At Big Pine Key, the speed limit slows to 30 miles an hour at nightfall so that motorists can brake in time in case pint-sized Key deer wander across the road. The deer may be endangered, but the pie abounds. Yet it was here that I came to a revelation of a different sort: Key lime pie in the Keys can be bad. At a drab Cuban restaurant in the nowheresville of Cudjoe Key, I picked at a flat piece of pie, topped by collapsed meringue, that tasted as if it had sat in the refrigerator since last summer.  FINALLY I was in Key West, the island city that manages to feel historic and modern, gay and straight, residential and tourist-friendly, bustling and relaxed, with a sense that pretty much anything goes. Anything goes with the pies, too. At Pepe's Cafe and Steak House, a ramshackle restaurant that dates all the way back to 1909 (and bills itself as "a fairly good place for quite a long while"), the artwork was funky and Tabasco-sauce bottles served as toothpick holders. The Key lime pie was outstanding, with a cinnamon-accented graham-cracker crust and a plentiful topping of whipped cream, and arrived in a bowl, as if masquerading as a pudding. Before I could declare it one of the finest I'd had, the pastry chef, Charlie Christensen, a 17-year Pepe's veteran, told me about the verdict of a group of tourists who had devised an elaborate 80-point rating system for Key lime pies. "Pepe's got an 80," she said with pride. But I'd be hard pressed to give a lesser rating to the pie I had at the elegant Pier House, where you can sit outside at night and watch the passing boats. Appropriately, it was a work of art, served on a plate decorated with raspberry and mango sauces and a chocolate-covered strawberry. I followed it with a Key lime martini, the perfect nightcap. It was also in Key West that I found evidence of just how much a commercial enterprise Key lime pie has become. When a cruise ship docks for a half-day layover, passengers pour onto the streets, and bakers stand ready to provide them with the requisite slice. The visitors often end up at either the Blond Giraffe, a small bakery chain, or Kermit's Key West Lime Shoppe. The Blond Giraffe's flagship store near the cruise dock had the feel of a Key lime pie fantasia: workers prepared pies at a large, colorful kitchen in full view of customers. Yet the pie didn't taste mass-produced, thanks to its one-of-a-kind cookie crust. At Kermit's, Key lime overload was the theme, down to the green chef's hat on the proprietor, Kermit Carpenter. I bought a Key lime cookbook, Key lime shampoo and Key lime cookies. And, yes, I tried a slice of Kermit's pie  a classic with a graham-cracker crust. I spotted a group of cruise passengers doing the same. "It's a law," joked one of them, a Dallas meeting planner named Joyce Meyer. "You have to show proof you ate Key lime pie to get off the island." There were other Key lime pies in Key West: one with a near-towering meringue at the Blue Heaven, where some of the island's infamous roosters share space with patrons in the outdoor seating area; and one with a chocolate-lined graham-cracker crust and a curd-like filling at Alice's, the home of Alice Weingarten, perhaps the most inventive of Keys chefs. I even found a surprisingly edible pie at the Publix supermarket. Looking for a last tip or two about pies to try, I stepped into L. Valladares & Son, a bookstore that's been a Key West institution for decades. The woman behind the counter considered my query and volunteered this suggestion: "You know you can make your own?" Then she showed me a postcard with the classic recipe. "That will be 25 cents," she said. Key lime pie, like "Margaritaville," is emblematic of Florida's southernmost extremity. It can be found in establishments, both high-end and low-end, from Homestead, on the outskirts of Miami, to Key West. And it seems no two pies are alike. 19200 SW 344th Street, Homestead; 305-246-1592. 81801 Overseas Highway (near Mile Marker 82), Islamorada; 800-327-2888. 7007 Overseas Highway, Marathon; 305-743-8383. 1400 Overseas Highway, Marathon; 305-289-2065. 806 Caroline Street, Key West; 305-294-7192. 107 Simonton Street, Key West; 305-296-9174. 200-A Elizabeth Street, Key West; 305-296-0806. 1 Duval Street, Key West; 305-296-4600. 729 Thomas Street, Key West; 305-296-8666. 1114 Duval Street, Key West; 305-292-5733. lime juice can be ordered in 12-pack samplers at www.keylimejuice.com; a list of retail outlets is also on the site.

1089-> Rivals Spar at Gay Democrats' Forum
A forum sponsored by gay Manhattan Democrats spun briefly out of control last night as two candidates for state attorney general tried to upstage a leading rival, Andrew Cuomo, to curry favor with the group. Mr. Cuomo had signed up to speak to the Stonewall Democrats, and the other candidates were given other nights to appear. But the man they all hope to replace, and whose endorsement they covet, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, was also scheduled to speak about his bid for governor. For that reason, the two other candidates -- Mark Green and Sean Patrick Maloney -- pressured Stonewall Democrats for time to appear alongside Mr. Spitzer as well, according to the group's leader, Dirk McCall. He said he gave a firm no to Mr. Green, the former city public advocate, and to Mr. Maloney, a lawyer who is the only gay candidate in the race. But the two men showed up anyway. At one point, Mr. McCall told the crowd of about 200 people at the Center in Chelsea that Mr. Maloney was there, and Mr. Maloney bounded on stage, uninvited, and spoke for three minutes. Mr. Green then moved to the front of the room. Mr. McCall, saying he acted out of fairness, invited him to speak too, and Mr. Green held forth for six minutes. Mr. McCall said afterward that he was furious at Mr. Maloney, and predicted that his unbidden speech could cost him the group's endorsement. Later, during a question-and-answer segment, Mr. Spitzer was criticized for his office's position that court rulings favorable to gay marriage had been decided incorrectly. He countered by saying that, as governor, he would introduce a bill to legalize same-sex marriage. Later, Mr. Cuomo said he supported legalizing gay marriage -- a shift from his 2002 campaign for governor, when he supported same-sex civil unions. He said afterward that he supported gay marriage "in his heart" then but did not make it a campaign issue because the political focus was on civil unions. Mr. Green and Mr. Maloney have long supported gay marriage.

1090-> Dear Diary
DEAR DIARY: Recently, I was working as an extra on the film "My Super Ex-Girlfriend," being shot at 72nd Street and Broadway. I was part of a crowd of extras running back and forth and anxiously looking up at the Ansonia building. We were told to imagine that the Ansonia was on fire, and that the super ex-girlfriend would fly over, blow on the Ansonia and put out the fire. As is usual in New York, we were asked many times by passers-by for the name of the film. After many puzzled and strange looks when I told people the film's name, I thought I would give a different, more familiar title, "Gone With the Wind 3" sounded perfect. This new name was greeted with understanding smiles and nods. Well, the Ansonia was supposed to be on fire, and it was put out by a big wind! Pamela Blakeley Guthrie Dear Diary: Recently, my 5-year-old grandson was evaluated for admission to a private school. He was told he was very, very smart.

I sensed a person next to me and was surprised by that loud universal whistle through the lips to attract a cab. As a cab pulled up, I turned to see a very attractive woman. The whistler was Ms. Winters, who gave me a smile that seemed to say, "That's how you do it in New York, young man!"

Knowing that I was late to meet visiting in-laws, I ran the length of the block to catch the bus. Just as I arrived at the corner, the driver closed the doors. I waited for the driver to reopen the front doors. Instead, eyes peeled forward, he drove off. I looked ahead and saw that the bus lane was clogged with traffic. I bet I could beat it to the next stop two blocks away. Despite the fact that the last time I ran for a bus was 36 years ago, I took off. I pulled ahead of the bus. This is going to work, I thought. That is, until I saw the bus pull out of its lane and into the faster-moving traffic at the center of Madison Avenue. The bus sped ahead. I gave up. Then I saw the line of passengers waiting at 60th Street. I took off again. I closed in on the bus as the last passenger lingered on its steps. I made it aboard. Triumphantly, I slotted my MetroCard into the fare box. As I walked to my seat, a passenger turned to me and said, "We were all rooting for you." John Auerbach

1091-> Rink Collapses in Germany, Killing at Least 10
BERLIN, Tuesday, Jan. 3 - The roof of an ice-skating rink collapsed on Monday afternoon after a heavy snowfall in Bad Reichenhall, a resort in southern Germany. The collapse killed at least 10 people, a spokesman for the town council, Christoph Abriss, said early Tuesday, The Associated Press reported. The dead included two children, German television reported, citing local police officials. The chief of police in Traunstein, near Bad Reichenhall, said on television that some people were missing and were feared trapped. The chief, Fritz Braun, said no sounds were coming from the building, which rescue workers found difficult to enter because of the risk that the roof could collapse further. By early Tuesday, six of the dead had been removed and four other bodies had been located, Mr. Abriss said. The police said that with temperatures falling below 20 degrees, the greatest danger to anyone still trapped was the cold. With most schools off for the week, many Germans and Austrians were on vacation, and Bad Reichenhall, about two and a half hours southeast of Munich, is a popular sports destination in Bavaria. The collapse occurred only minutes before the rink's normal closing time of 4 p.m. on Monday. Two people were also killed in an avalanche earlier on Monday that struck in the mountains near Bad Reichenhall. One person was missing, and the search for him was hampered by the heavy snow, which grounded rescue helicopters. The continuing snowfall made it difficult for rescue workers, some from nearby Salzburg, Austria, to reach the skating rink. The German Automobile Association reported heavy traffic jams on the main road leading from Munich to the mountain area, while many smaller roads were impassable. Even so, by early in the evening some 700 rescue workers were on the scene. German television showed a heavy crane being trucked to the site in an effort to lift away portions of the collapsed roof, which was illuminated by searchlights. Dozens of Red Cross workers and firemen could be seen, some leading dogs trained to search for people buried in snow. Other workers tried to prop up portions of the building. According to Chief Braun, speaking in a television interview, a local youth ice hockey team that was due to practice at the rink late Monday afternoon was told not to come, so workers could sweep the snow from the roof as a precautionary measure. Local reports said 12 inches of snow had fallen overnight. But he said the snow on the roof had been measured earlier in the day and was not deemed to be a risk, so the normal closing hour of 4 p.m. was not changed. Chief Braun said the snowfall was not unusual, and speculated that a structural fault in the building rather than the snow might have been the cause of the collapse. He said the national police would begin a criminal investigation.

1092-> Dear Diary
DEAR DIARY: I'm walking down a busy Ninth Avenue during rush hour, and I accidentally jostle a woman pushing a baby carriage when she stops short at a corner. After saying, "Excuse me," I peer into the carriage, where I see what appears to be the back of an exceptionally curly headed blond tot. When I finally pass the woman, I see that the "tot" is actually a dog, who's sitting upright in the carriage, happy as can be. There is no actual baby in sight. The woman, who has the harried-mom look down pat, pushes on. Dawn Shurmaitis Dear Diary: A woman walking through Lord & Taylor in Garden City on Long Island amid a crowded after-Christmas sale, obviously burdened by the post-holiday crush, passed a display of hearts, cherubs and chocolate. Turning to her companion, she said: "Valentine's Day already? That's it. We're leaving." Barbara Shields Dear Diary: After a noontime walk-turned-half-jog in a chilly Central Park, I felt the need for a good stretch. I decided to kick out the kinks while waiting for the light to change at Columbus Circle. Right, left, right, left. After all, I said to myself, this is New York, no one will notice, and people do stranger things. As the light turned green and I stepped off the curb, a woman turned to me and said, "You're hired!" Janet Barnhart Dear Diary: Returning to Kennedy Airport from our winter break, we waited endlessly in the bitter cold for our budget pickup van. A shiny black limo pulled up to the curb. In the window, where the client name is customarily posted, was a sign with the word "Rich." "Why do they have to announce it?" my little girl asked. "Isn't it obvious?" Ora Shtull Dear Diary: A variety store in my neighborhood had a sign on its outside wall listing wallpaper, paint and art supplies among its stock. However, the "W" and the "P" were in a color different from the rest of the sign, and had faded to invisibility, leaving passers-by with the unarguable information that "allpaper aint Art Supplies." Hugh W. Thompson Dear Diary: A friend of mine has a housekeeper who was a C.P.A. in Poland but isn't licensed here. She is doing some freelance accounting work for neighbors and clients. Gives new meaning to the term "laundering money," doesn't it? R. K. Dillon Dear Diary: I walk with crutches and am quite large. Despite the crutches, I can sometimes be very helpful, as the following demonstrated. One very windy night I was crossing the avenue trying hard to keep my balance in the face of strong winds while being careful of the heavy traffic in my path. I found that when the wind was especially strong, all I could do was dig my crutches into the street and wait for the wind to subside. After a moment I discovered an older woman on my side, away from the wind, obviously using me as a shield. When I moved, she did as well. When I stopped, she did, too. When we were close enough to the curb, she gave me a big smile, mouthed a "thank you" and continued on her way. Victor Margolis Metropolitan Diary

1094-> Right on Cue, Anna Benson Throws in Her Two Cents
Wearing a black jersey of her new favorite team, the Baltimore Orioles, Anna Benson entered a cramped conference room of a Manhattan public-relations firm last night, her makeup still fresh from an earlier photo shoot for the April issue of FHM magazine. She slapped her husband, Kris, on the thigh as they sat down, then listened as he talked about being traded to Baltimore. Then it was Anna's turn to respond, and true to her reputation, she did not go quietly. The trade brought pitchers Jorge Julio and John Maine to the Mets, and Anna used the hastily arranged news conference to sound off on all things personal, baseball and Mets. It was Anna Benson being Anna Benson. "I think everyone blows me out of proportion," she said. She is a rarity among today's professional men's athletes: the wife who has more of a public persona than her husband. Her time in New York was, in some ways, more remarkable than that of her husband. Benson was moderately successful in his 18 months as a Met, but Anna stole the spotlight, sharing intimate details of their sex life, blasting the anti-establishment filmmaker Michael Moore and, more recently, criticizing the Mets for trying to trade her husband. Hours before the news conference, Kris Benson, in a conference call, said that he was looking forward to working with the Orioles' pitching coach, Leo Mazzone, and to pitching in Camden Yards, the only major league stadium he said he had never visited. Anna said in a statement released after the trade that she and Benson looked forward to "christening the parking lot" at the stadium, referring to her desire to have sex at every major league park. Whether her brashness contributed to the Mets' persistence in trying to trade Benson is unclear. Mets officials have publicly denied it, and the deal has been months in the making, especially on the Orioles' part. Only the terms needed tweaking. The Bensons said they hoped and believed that Anna's outsized personality had not factored into the Mets' decision, but their responses yesterday indicated that they were at least a little suspicious. Benson said he did not think the trade was "cut and dry." Anna was a little more straightforward. "If they traded Kris because of what I've done, then that's a dirty, nasty, rotten trick," she said, adding that he would have signed elsewhere last winter if they had known he would be traded this quickly after signing a three-year contract. As she spoke last night, enunciating clearly and forcefully, a smile did not leave her face, even as she addressed some weightier subjects. She has criticized the Mets for acquiring Carlos Delgado, who has not stood for the playing of "God Bless America" during games because of his opposition to American foreign policy. Clarifying those remarks last night, she said that she wondered why the Mets were willing to acquire Delgado but then were leery when she considered modeling for Playboy. "Be liberal or not, make a choice," Anna said, adding that her posing for Playboy was a dead issue. In Baltimore, it is unlikely that Anna Benson's outrageousness will cause as much of a stir as it did in New York. She will continue to spout shocking comments, wear revealing outfits -- like the low-cut dress she chose for the Mets' annual holiday party for children -- and try to be, according to her, "the sexiest woman in professional sports." Asked whether the move would damage her career as a model and as an all-around show-business personality, Anna deferred to her husband. "This is never about me," she said. "This is about him."

1096-> U.S. Muslims Confront Taboo on Nursing Homes
BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. — As a founder of the growing Shiite Muslim community here, Hussein Walji oversaw the building of the area's first mosque. He directed construction of its youth center, and followers hailed him as a visionary for adding an auditorium for ecumenical functions like the M&M picnic for Muslims and Methodists. But even family members find Mr. Walji's latest expansion uncomfortably American: he is developing plans for an assisted living and nursing complex in this Minneapolis suburb. "I could never do it," said Mohamed Remtula, Mr. Walji's brother-in-law, his ailing mother at his side in his living room as he and Mr. Walji discussed the planned complex. "It just is not in our culture." Such uneasy discussions are taking place in Islamic enclaves around the country as more families try to reconcile religious teachings on caring for elders with the modern realities of their hectic American lives. Muslim leaders from Florida to California are eager for a successful approach to the issue. But early efforts have been a tough sell. Sajda Khan and her husband, Rahmat, opened Fonthill Gardens, a six-bed assisted living home in Hawthorne, Calif., for the Los Angeles area's aging Muslim population. They found a contractor to provide halal meats, included a prayer room and made enthusiastic presentations to area mosques. A year later they have cared for two Christians and one Buddhist, but no Muslims. "People feel that others will criticize them," said Mrs. Khan, who is from Pakistan. "You know, 'So and so left her mother in a facility, and now look at her looking fashionable at the mall.' It's very frustrating." For generations, immigrant groups have grappled with the American concept of housing for the elderly, tailoring it to meet their ethnic, cultural and religious needs. But for many Muslims, the idea of placing parents in facilities is still unthinkable, seen as a violation of a Koranic obligation to care for one's elderly relatives. "This change will be difficult, but it is inevitable," said Mr. Walji, 54, who is also president of the North American Shia Ithna-Asheri Muslim Communities Organization, an association of mosques in the United States and Canada. "Someone has to make the first move." If families are being forced to consider outside care, he reasoned, having a facility affiliated with the mosque might ease the pain of the decision. In Ohio, the Islamic Center of Greater Toledo approved a proposal in May to develop elder housing near its mosque. The Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit is establishing a program to help the area's Muslim and Arab population address end-of-life issues. "Our immigrant Muslim populations are totally unprepared to deal with this," said Dr. Hasan Shanawani, a critical care specialist who is starting the program. "We talk about respect for our parents, but in the name of love and tradition we are often neglecting our loved ones. We have to accept that there are some things we just can't do on our own." The need for skilled care outside the home is, for an increasing number of Muslims, an unavoidable passage in the immigrant experience. Like many other American families, first- and second-generation adult siblings in Muslim families are often spread out around the country, struggling to balance the demands of dual-income marriages, work and children. Medical advances have enabled people to live longer, but often with chronic conditions that require more care than can easily be provided at home. The Koran does not directly deal with how to care for aging parents. But prophetic teachings emphasize children's responsibility to care for parents as they were cared for as infants. Traditionally, families and religious leaders have interpreted this as a duty to care for parents at home. "Yes, it is a mandate to take care of one's parents, but it is not explained how to do that," said Shakeel Syed, executive director of the Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, an organization of mosques. "You can keep your parents at home and not truly be caring for them, if you cannot meet their needs." Other traditional teachings have been updated to meet contemporary needs, Mr. Syed said. Day care and baby-sitting help, also once thought of as a violation of religious obligation to family, are now accepted by many working Muslim families. Mr. Walji's brother-in-law is not the only member of the family to have to consider the issue of elder care. Two years ago, Mr. Walji's wife's family made the tough decision to move an elderly aunt, with congestive heart failure, diabetes, leg problems and no children, into a local nursing facility. Sitting on her bed recently at the Maranatha Care Center in a neighboring suburb, three doting nieces at her side, the aunt, Zera Suchedina, said with a resigned nod that the place was "O.K. Fine." But of roughly 90 residents in the complex's nursing care wing, Ms. Suchedina, 75, with limited English language ability, is the only Muslim. She conducts her daily prayers alone in her room, she must accept care from male nurses — which she finds religiously unacceptable — and she eats vegetarian meals because no halal meats are offered. A Muslim woman on the kitchen staff keeps her company and warms up the curries that her nieces bring her. Still, Ms. Suchedina said: "I would feel more at home to be with people I can relate to. It would be good to be with Muslims." For advice on developing such a place, Mr. Walji has turned to the Lutheran Church, which helped his family settle in the Minneapolis area in 1972, after the dictator Idi Amin of Uganda expelled them and other ethnic Asians from the country. The Augustana Care Corporation, run by Lutherans, has provided health care to the elderly for over a century. Tim Tucker, its president, has offered to assist Mr. Walji with development and management of his project and with updating facilities to better meet the needs of Muslims. Over lunch in the dining room of Augustana's main elder care complex in Minneapolis, Mr. Tucker listened to Mr. Walji's wish list: communal prayer space, halal foods and same-sex nursing care. Mr. Tucker then posed a host of questions. What was the proposed size and budget for the project? What levels of care would the new facility offer? Would it be better to build a new building or buy an existing space? Would the new organization also provide day care for the elderly, or at-home services, which might be less objectionable? The lunch ended with the bulk of questions unanswered, but with a shared resolve. "This initiative will improve the way we think about care across the board," Mr. Tucker said. In recent decades, Asian and Hispanic immigrants have influenced the elder care industry, developing their own health services or adding multilingual staff members and a more diverse array of foods, activities and aesthetic touches to facilities. In Toledo, Manira Saide-Sallock is a supporter of her mosque's efforts to build an assisted living and nursing center. A retired teacher, Ms. Saide-Sallock, 66, is the primary person responsible for the care of both her mother and her mother-in-law, one weakened by a stroke, the other from a serious fall. "This level of care takes its toll physically and emotionally, and having a facility that was part of the mosque would be such a help," she said, adding, "Not that my mother or mother-in-law would ever go there." Though his family is struggling to manage, Mr. Remtula, Mr. Walji's brother-in-law, is adamant that his home is the only viable base of care for his mother, Sakina, 86, who has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and who now wears a motion sensor to sound warnings of her frequent and dangerous wanderings. Razia Remtula, Mr. Walji's sister, said that her brother's project, while controversial now, might one day ease the burden and guilt for her own children. "I know how hard it is for me to provide this care," she said, "and I don't want my children to struggle with these decisions." Her son, Sibtain, 27, listening intently from across the room, seemed puzzled by the discomfort surrounding his uncle's venture. "I think, in fact, it might be a better way to live when you are older, to be with your own peer group," he said. "If it was there, near the mosque, why not? I would definitely look into that." Unsurprised by his nephew's response, Mr. Walji said: "You see? Inevitable."

1108-> California Executes 76-Year-Old in Murders of 3 People
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17 - California on Tuesday executed Clarence Ray Allen, a 76-year-old sentenced to death in 1982 for arranging the murders of three people, amid the growing debate on capital punishment and a proposed moratorium on executions. Mr. Allen, the oldest of 647 prisoners on death row in California, died of a lethal injection at 12:38 a.m. Pacific time. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger had rejected a clemency petition in which Mr. Allen argued he was too old and infirm to be executed, and the federal courts turned away last-minute appeals. Mr. Allen, legally blind and suffering heart ailments, arranged the murders while in prison for having his teenage son's girlfriend killed so she would not tell the police about a burglary Mr. Allen had committed. Mr. Allen was sentenced to death after a gunman killed three witnesses from the earlier case. "Hoka hey, it's a good day to die," Mr. Allen, who is of Choctaw heritage, wrote in a statement to the warden, using a greeting that loosely translates as "pay attention." "Thank you very much, I love you all. Goodbye." His death at San Quentin State Prison near San Francisco attracted a fraction of the attention paid to that of Stanley Tookie Williams, who was executed last month and had drawn a flurry of interest because he was an early member of the Crips street gang, had claimed redemption and had written children's books to some acclaim. California has scheduled at least two more executions this year, more than in any year since the state restored the death penalty in 1977. Mr. Allen's was the 13th execution since 1977. State lawmakers are proposing a moratorium that would make California the third and largest state with such a suspension. Illinois, by executive order, and New Jersey, through its Legislature, have suspended executions. Maryland's governor imposed a moratorium in 2003 but his successor lifted it. Thirty-eight states have death penalty laws, though statutes in New York and Kansas were declared unconstitutional in 2004, and several other states are reviewing their laws. Capital punishment has undergone scrutiny in recent years because newly available DNA testing has led to the exoneration of several wrongly convicted people, some on death rows. In the last 25 years, six death row inmates in California have had their convictions or sentences overturned. "My concern is that the process is not accurate enough," said Assemblyman Paul Koretz, a Democrat whose district includes West Hollywood and whose bill would impose a two-year moratorium beginning next year, to dovetail with a report due later in 2007 from a state commission that is investigating wrongful convictions in state courts. Republicans have promised to fight the bill, which an Assembly committee is considering. Mr. Koretz said he was uncertain whether the full Assembly and Senate, both controlled by Democrats, would pass the bill. Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican and a vociferous advocate of the death penalty, has not taken a position on the bill, though a top aide has publicly criticized it. Assemblyman Todd Spitzer, an Orange County Republican who attended Mr. Allen's execution, said California's review of capital cases, with more layers and legal requirements than in many other states, ensured that the cases were sound. Mr. Spitzer said overturning the six death row cases in the state did not sway him, because most of the reversals occurred on what he considered technical or procedural errors, not "factual innocence." "I don't see any evidence we are convicting the innocent," Mr. Spitzer said. Correction: January 24, 2006, Tuesday Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the execution of Clarence Ray Allen in California referred incorrectly to the state's plans for more executions this year. It is expected to schedule at least two more; it has not already done so.

1109-> California Assembly Sidelines a Moratorium on Executions
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 19 - California lawmakers dashed the hopes of death penalty opponents on Thursday by not acting on legislation that would have imposed a two-year moratorium on executions in the state. The Assembly Appropriations Committee placed the bill on hold, essentially killing it for the remainder of this legislative session, several lawmakers said. The author of the bill, Assemblyman Paul Koretz, a Democrat from West Hollywood, said he would probably introduce another version of the bill after the June primary election, but Republican opponents of a moratorium said they would fight that effort as well. Mr. Koretz accused the Republicans of playing politics with his proposal. "Unfortunately, the Republicans in California have turned this issue into a political wedge," Mr. Koretz said. "And they did not give the bill a fair hearing." Mr. Koretz said Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature, did not want to push the matter further until after the election. "It has the potential to be used and misused in elections where state Democrats are running this year," he said. Assemblyman Todd Spitzer, a Republican from Orange County, said the bill's demise had "nothing to do with politics." "It has everything to do with a factual argument," Mr. Spitzer said, "that the death penalty is not abused or unfairly carried out in California." California is one of several states reviewing its use of the death penalty, which is legal in 38 states. New Jersey, Illinois and Maryland have imposed moratoriums, while in 2004 capital punishment in New York and Kansas was declared unconstitutional. The debate in California has picked up in recent months as the state prepares to quicken the pace of executions and a blue-ribbon commission studies, among other things, the state's prison system and the effectiveness, accuracy and fairness of capital punishment. Mr. Koretz's measure, Assembly Bill 1121, would have imposed a 24-month moratorium beginning next January so that the Legislature could review the recommendations of the blue-ribbon panel. In the meantime, executions move forward. The state executed Clarence Ray Allen, 76, on Tuesday. In 1980, while serving a life sentence for a 1974 killing, Mr. Allen ordered the killing of three people. A judge on Wednesday set Feb. 21 as the execution date for Michael Morales, 45, who would become the third death row inmate to die in three months. Mr. Morales was sentenced to death for the rape and killing in 1981 of a 17-year-old woman.

1110-> Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him
The top climate scientist at NASA says the Bush administration has tried to stop him from speaking out since he gave a lecture last month calling for prompt reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases linked to global warming. The scientist, James E. Hansen, longtime director of the agency's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in an interview that officials at NASA headquarters had ordered the public affairs staff to review his coming lectures, papers, postings on the Goddard Web site and requests for interviews from journalists. Dr. Hansen said he would ignore the restrictions. "They feel their job is to be this censor of information going out to the public," he said. Dean Acosta, deputy assistant administrator for public affairs at the space agency, said there was no effort to silence Dr. Hansen. "That's not the way we operate here at NASA," Mr. Acosta said. "We promote openness and we speak with the facts." He said the restrictions on Dr. Hansen applied to all National Aeronautics and Space Administration personnel. He added that government scientists were free to discuss scientific findings, but that policy statements should be left to policy makers and appointed spokesmen. Mr. Acosta said other reasons for requiring press officers to review interview requests were to have an orderly flow of information out of a sprawling agency and to avoid surprises. "This is not about any individual or any issue like global warming," he said. "It's about coordination." Dr. Hansen strongly disagreed with this characterization, saying such procedures had already prevented the public from fully grasping recent findings about climate change that point to risks ahead. "Communicating with the public seems to be essential," he said, "because public concern is probably the only thing capable of overcoming the special interests that have obfuscated the topic." Dr. Hansen, 63, a physicist who joined the space agency in 1967, directs efforts to simulate the global climate on computers at the Goddard Institute in Morningside Heights in Manhattan. Since 1988, he has been issuing public warnings about the long-term threat from heat-trapping emissions, dominated by carbon dioxide, that are an unavoidable byproduct of burning coal, oil and other fossil fuels. He has had run-ins with politicians or their appointees in various administrations, including budget watchers in the first Bush administration and Vice President Al Gore. In 2001, Dr. Hansen was invited twice to brief Vice President Dick Cheney and other cabinet members on climate change. White House officials were interested in his findings showing that cleaning up soot, which also warms the atmosphere, was an effective and far easier first step than curbing carbon dioxide. He fell out of favor with the White House in 2004 after giving a speech at the University of Iowa before the presidential election, in which he complained that government climate scientists were being muzzled and said he planned to vote for Senator John Kerry. But Dr. Hansen said that nothing in 30 years equaled the push made since early December to keep him from publicly discussing what he says are clear-cut dangers from further delay in curbing carbon dioxide. In several interviews with The New York Times in recent days, Dr. Hansen said it would be irresponsible not to speak out, particularly because NASA's mission statement includes the phrase "to understand and protect our home planet." He said he was particularly incensed that the directives had come through telephone conversations and not through formal channels, leaving no significant trails of documents. Dr. Hansen's supervisor, Franco Einaudi, said there had been no official "order or pressure to say shut Jim up." But Dr. Einaudi added, "That doesn't mean I like this kind of pressure being applied." The fresh efforts to quiet him, Dr. Hansen said, began in a series of calls after a lecture he gave on Dec. 6 at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. In the talk, he said that significant emission cuts could be achieved with existing technologies, particularly in the case of motor vehicles, and that without leadership by the United States, climate change would eventually leave the earth "a different planet." The administration's policy is to use voluntary measures to slow, but not reverse, the growth of emissions. After that speech and the release of data by Dr. Hansen on Dec. 15 showing that 2005 was probably the warmest year in at least a century, officials at the headquarters of the space agency repeatedly phoned public affairs officers, who relayed the warning to Dr. Hansen that there would be "dire consequences" if such statements continued, those officers and Dr. Hansen said in interviews. Among the restrictions, according to Dr. Hansen and an internal draft memorandum he provided to The Times, was that his supervisors could stand in for him in any news media interviews. Mr. Acosta said the calls and meetings with Goddard press officers were not to introduce restrictions, but to review existing rules. He said Dr. Hansen had continued to speak frequently with the news media. But Dr. Hansen and some of his colleagues said interviews were canceled as a result. In one call, George Deutsch, a recently appointed public affairs officer at NASA headquarters, rejected a request from a producer at National Public Radio to interview Dr. Hansen, said Leslie McCarthy, a public affairs officer responsible for the Goddard Institute. Citing handwritten notes taken during the conversation, Ms. McCarthy said Mr. Deutsch called N.P.R. "the most liberal" media outlet in the country. She said that in that call and others, Mr. Deutsch said his job was "to make the president look good" and that as a White House appointee that might be Mr. Deutsch's priority. But she added: "I'm a career civil servant and Jim Hansen is a scientist. That's not our job. That's not our mission. The inference was that Hansen was disloyal." Normally, Ms. McCarthy would not be free to describe such conversations to the news media, but she agreed to an interview after Mr. Acosta, at NASA headquarters, told The Times that she would not face any retribution for doing so. Mr. Acosta, Mr. Deutsch's supervisor, said that when Mr. Deutsch was asked about the conversations, he flatly denied saying anything of the sort. Mr. Deutsch referred all interview requests to Mr. Acosta. Ms. McCarthy, when told of the response, said: "Why am I going to go out of my way to make this up and back up Jim Hansen? I don't have a dog in this race. And what does Hansen have to gain?" Mr. Acosta said that for the moment he had no way of judging who was telling the truth. Several colleagues of both Ms. McCarthy and Dr. Hansen said Ms. McCarthy's statements were consistent with what she told them when the conversations occurred. "He's not trying to create a war over this," said Larry D. Travis, an astronomer who is Dr. Hansen's deputy at Goddard, "but really feels very strongly that this is an obligation we have as federal scientists, to inform the public." Dr. Travis said he walked into Ms. McCarthy's office in mid-December at the end of one of the calls from Mr. Deutsch demanding that Dr. Hansen be better controlled. In an interview on Friday, Ralph J. Cicerone, an atmospheric chemist and the president of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's leading independent scientific body, praised Dr. Hansen's scientific contributions and said he had always seemed to describe his public statements clearly as his personal views. "He really is one of the most productive and creative scientists in the world," Dr. Cicerone said. "I've heard Hansen speak many times and I've read many of his papers, starting in the late 70's. Every single time, in writing or when I've heard him speak, he's always clear that he's speaking for himself, not for NASA or the administration, whichever administration it's been." The fight between Dr. Hansen and administration officials echoes other recent disputes. At climate laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for example, many scientists who routinely took calls from reporters five years ago can now do so only if the interview is approved by administration officials in Washington, and then only if a public affairs officer is present or on the phone. Where scientists' points of view on climate policy align with those of the administration, however, there are few signs of restrictions on extracurricular lectures or writing. One example is Indur M. Goklany, assistant director of science and technology policy in the policy office of the Interior Department. For years, Dr. Goklany, an electrical engineer by training, has written in papers and books that it may be better not to force cuts in greenhouse gases because the added prosperity from unfettered economic activity would allow countries to exploit benefits of warming and adapt to problems. In an e-mail exchange on Friday, Dr. Goklany said that in the Clinton administration he was shifted to nonclimate-related work, but added that he had never had to stop his outside writing, as long as he identified the views as his own. "One reason why I still continue to do the extracurricular stuff," he wrote, "is because one doesn't have to get clearance for what I plan on saying or writing."

1111-> Fighting for Their Lives
The Australian writer Markus Zusak's brilliant and hugely ambitious new young-adult novel is startling in many ways, but the first thing many teenagers will notice is its length: 552 pages! It's one thing to write a long book about, say, a boy who happens across a dragon's egg; it's quite another to write a long, achingly sad, intricately structured book about Nazi Germany narrated by Death itself. Readers are introduced to this Death-as-storyteller concept in a too-long invocation that begins "The Book Thief." This is no Grim Reaper — we have here a kinder, gentler Death, who feels sympathy for his victims. As Death himself puts it on Page 1: "I can be amiable. Agreeable. Affable. And that's only the A's." Maybe so, but Death is so innocuous that he's not very absorbing. Or affecting. His periodic soliloquies aren't the most effective moments of the novel, and if he took an M.F.A. class, Death would doubtless be criticized for telling instead of showing. Fortunately, this book isn't about Death; it's about death, and so much else. Principally it is about Liesel Meminger, whose little brother dies just before Liesel's mother leaves her with foster parents in a dismal town in southern Germany (her father, a Communist, has been taken away). Her new Papa is the implausibly saintly Hans Hubermann (that is, über-man), so good a person he even manages to love his wife, Rosa, who is one of the more memorable foster moms in young-adult fiction. She looks, Death tells us, "like a small wardrobe with a coat thrown over it. There was a distinct waddle to her walk. Almost cute, if it wasn't for her face." Rosa periodically beats Liesel with a wooden spoon, and uses exceedingly foul language. Much of it can't be quoted in a family newspaper, but suffice it to say that she routinely refers to her husband and foster daughter as "filthy pigs." Still, she cares for Liesel — and as Death eventually shows us, "She was a good woman for a crisis." Liesel finds ways of coping with her losses. But she is disruptive in school (she volunteers answers to questions) and is predisposed to fighting with boys. More important, she becomes a thief. She commits her first theft at her brother's funeral, taking "The Grave Digger's Handbook," which had fallen on the ground. Hans teaches her to read it at night. While Liesel sometimes joins up with a gang to steal food and the like, her only thieving passion is for books. Not good books or bad books — just books. From her bedroom to the bomb shelter down the road, reading helps her commune with the living and the dead — and finally, it is the mere existence of stories that proves to be her salvation. Liesel is a very well-drawn character (and immensely likable), but many young readers will find the going slow until Max Vandenburg, a 24-year-old Jewish boxer, shows up at the family doorstep. Hans, as it happens, owes the fighter's dead father a favor, so he houses Max in the basement. Aside from his friendship with Liesel (in one of the book's many resonant metaphors, he makes her a comic book using painted-over pages from "Mein Kampf"), Max is arresting because of his situation. He has abandoned his doomed family in order to live in hiding. After leaving them, "the relief struggled inside him like an obscenity. It was something he didn't want to feel, but nonetheless, he felt it with such gusto it made him want to throw up. How could he? How could he? But he did." There is a cowardice to Max's fight for survival, and his guilt and shame tear at him. He and Liesel both suffer from nightmares — but Liesel's grief is relatively uncomplicated. She must live with her mother's choices. Max must live with his own. Max isn't the only fighter Marcus Zusak has written about. His first novel published in America, "Fighting Ruben Wolfe" (2001), follows the fistic exploits of Cameron and Ruben Wolfe, brothers who scrape by in a working-class neighborhood in Sydney. As boxers in an illicit league, Ruben becomes a champion and his little brother Cam, an inferior boxer, is known for his strong chin and resilience. In the end, it's Ruben who wants to be like Cam — better to be a fighter than a winner. That novel was followed by a sequel, "Getting the Girl" (2003), which is about learning to fight for, and open up to, love, and then by the award-winning "I Am the Messenger" (2005), a strange and alluring novel about a 19-year-old compelled to vigilantism by anonymous instructions delivered on playing cards. All of Zusak's protagonists have been fighters, whether born or made. But while his writing has always been ambitious and his characterizations precise, his early books merely celebrated fighting. In "The Book Thief," where battling to survive is sometimes an act of weakness, we see fighting in all its complexity. Max dreams, for instance, that he is boxing with the Führer. "There was only one round, and it lasted hours, and for the most part, nothing changed. The Führer pounded away at the punching-bag Jew." But then Max recovers and knocks Hitler down. Hitler takes off his gloves, seemingly defeated — until he whips the crowd into a fury. The "fists of an entire nation" attack Max, and he cannot fight them all off. This is fighting as "The Book Thief" understands it: winners often lose. Indeed, everything is upside down in Zusak's Nazi Germany. Sounds are tasted, visions are heard, death has a heart, the strong do not survive, and your best chance of living may be a concentration camp. The entropy of this world is near complete. Some will argue that a book so difficult and sad may not be appropriate for teenage readers. "The Book Thief" was published for adults in Zusak's native Australia, and I strongly suspect it was written for adults. Adults will probably like it (this one did), but it's a great young-adult novel. Many teenagers will find the story too slow to get going, which is a fair criticism. But it's the kind of book that can be life-changing, because without ever denying the essential amorality and randomness of the natural order, "The Book Thief" offers us a believable, hard-won hope. That hope is embodied in Liesel, who grows into a good and generous person despite the suffering all around her, and finally becomes a human even Death can love. The hope we see in Liesel is unassailable, the kind you can hang on to in the midst of poverty and war and violence. Young readers need such alternatives to ideological rigidity, and such explorations of how stories matter. And so, come to think of it, do adults.

1112-> Gas Guzzlers Find Price of Forgiveness
To people who take the threat of global warming personally, driving a car that spews heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere can be a guilt trip. But to help atone for that environmental sin, some drivers are turning to groups on the Internet that offer pain-free ways to assuage their guilt while promoting clean energy. It involves buying something known as a carbon offset: a relatively inexpensive way to stimulate the production of clean electricity. Just go to one of several carbon-offset Web sites, calculate the amount of carbon dioxide produced when you drive, fly or otherwise burn fossil fuels, and then buy an offset that pays for an equivalent amount of clean energy. Of course, emissions could be reduced the old-fashioned way -- by flying less, turning off the air-conditioning or buying a more fuel-efficient car. But that would probably require some sacrifice and perhaps even a change in lifestyle. Instead, carbon-offset programs allow individuals to skip the sacrifice and simply pay for the right to pollute. "To some extent, it's a way for people to buy their way into heaven," said Chip Giller, who is president of Grist.org, an online environmental magazine. "On the other hand, this is such a big macro problem that this is one of the few things people can do to really make a difference." While offsets do not actually eliminate pollution, they do enable groups like Carbonfund.org to use the money to stimulate the production of clean electricity, which is more costly than burning coal or oil. An independent organization ensures that the money supports real projects. Some groups subsidize existing power production; others finance the building of new wind turbines or solar collectors. In the two years since they appeared, such voluntary offset programs have become increasingly popular. But it is not clear whether they actually do any good, or are just one more way for Americans to feel good about doing things that pollute the atmosphere. Take Biff Cuthbert. Running an organic clam farm for a few years taught him all about being green. But when he recently needed a new vehicle to haul musical equipment for his folk band, as well as his two Akita dogs, Mr. Cuthbert ignored his environmental conscience and bought a cream-colored 2004 Land Rover, which gets 12 miles to the gallon. Feeling a pang of conscience about driving such a gas-guzzler, Mr. Cuthbert paid $79.95 to Terrapass.com, a group that helps finance non-polluting solar, wind and methane-driven energy projects. In exchange, he got a sticker for his windshield verifying that he is offsetting some of the 16,766 pounds of carbon dioxide his Land Rover will emit this year. "It rounds the edges off of the guilt a little bit, I guess," said Mr. Cuthbert, 62, of Guilford, Conn. "It's a little like having your cake and eating it too," Mr. Cuthbert said. Web sites like terrapass.com, carbonfund.org, nativeenergy.com and self.org focus on automobile emissions because drivers can become aware of their carbon footprint every time they fill up. An average car produces about 10,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. Tom Arnold, one of the founders of Terrapass, a carbon-offset seller that, unlike most others, actually intends to make a profit, said that just as in the dawn of recycling a generation ago, the idea of carbon offsetting is being embraced at first by "greenies" who already plant trees, eat organic foods and buy fuel-efficient cars. As these environmentalists accept the altruistic good of doing something for the planet that will not immediately benefit them, they hope to spread the ideal of living a "carbon-neutral" life to nonbelievers. Carbon offsets for power plants are already traded at an exchange in Chicago and will be part of a regional pact that New York and seven other northeastern states have formed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Rockefeller Brothers Fund bought offsets to cover the amount of pollution produced by all 1,479 people who attended conferences at its Pocantico Conference Center in Westchester County last year. Ben & Jerry's buys enough offsets to cover its manufacturing and retail operations, and even the Rolling Stones have bought offsets to make their concerts carbon neutral. The whole idea is to cap, and eventually reduce, the amount of greenhouse gases produced in the United States. But with gasoline prices nearing $3 a gallon, getting people to shell out even more to drive can be easier said than done. Take the Gormans of Stamford, Conn., a family of self-professed environmentalists. Cynthia Gorman, 52, works for a transportation safety company in New Rochelle, N.Y., and commutes the 20 miles each way in her dark green 2001 Toyota Prius hybrid. A dedicated recycler, she said she buys a carbon offset from Terrapass every year because driving the hybrid on the highway "only gets maybe 42 miles per gallon." Hybrids are more efficient in the city, where their electric motors take over. But when Ms. Gorman pulls back into the driveway of her Stamford home, she parks her Prius, with its Less Gs license plates, next to her husband Tony's dark green 2000 Dodge Durango, an S.U.V. that gets 13 miles per gallon, if that. "For all that I'm doing, he's screwing up everything," Ms. Gorman said. Mr. Gorman does not try to hide his responsibility. He is a hunter, and a reggae producer, and he needs the S.U.V. to haul things. His license plate reads "Ire Mon" -- a reggae singer's way of saying "It's O.K."--which is how he feels about his choice of wheels. Mr. Gorman said that his wife sent him Web information about carbon offsets a while ago but that he did not understand what it was about and just let it fall through the cracks. Mr. Gorman said he would probably buy his own pass at some point, but he worried that this green guilt thing could go too far. "It can really get you so depressed that you never leave the house," he said. "Look, sometimes you have to make a compromise. Yeah, I'm an environmentalist, but I need that vehicle." A few days ago, Ms. Gorman took the decision out of his hands and bought a Terrapass for his Durango. People who run offset programs insist that while guilt is part of the motivation for those who join, the movement really is more about a way of living. "What we're about is getting folks to live a net zero climate-neutral lifestyle," said Tom Boucher, president of Native Energy, which helps build wind turbines on Indian lands. Ann C. Seligman, 45, lives in Manhattan and owns a 2004 Prius, so her "carbon footprint" is already small. Nonetheless, her husband, Michael, gave her a $99 carbon pass from www.carbonfund.org for her birthday. "We live in a basement apartment, not far from the East River, so global warming may come back to haunt us," she said. Charles R. Church, 65, a retired lawyer in Manhattan, pays for a Native Energy $6-a-month pass even though he uses public transportation and rarely takes his 2002 Volvo station wagon out of its garage. "The threat of global warming is becoming part of the zeitgeist and I'm happy about that," Mr. Church said. Offsetting his carbon footprint does not cost much and does not take much effort, he said, adding, "It just strikes me as the right thing to do."

1113-> Gerard Reve, Provocative Author, Dies at 82
THE HAGUE, April 11 - Gerard Reve, considered one of the Dutch postwar literary greats, has died, his partner announced on Sunday. He was 82. Mr. Reve, whose full name was Gerard Kornelis van het Reve, published his first novel, "De Avonden" ("The Evenings"), in 1947. An account of the staunch, oppressive environment of the lower-middle-class Dutch in the postwar years, it is considered a classic of modern Dutch literature. Mr. Reve's much reprinted and controversial books "Op Weg Naar Het Einde" ("Approaching the End," 1963), and "Nader tot U" ("Nearer to Thee," 1966), in which he openly spoke of his homosexuality and his conversion to Roman Catholicism, established him as a public figure in the Netherlands. "Nader tot U" sparked controversy because Mr. Reve wrote about having sex with God, who appeared to him in the guise of a donkey. He was prosecuted for blasphemy, but cleared in 1968. Mr. Reve published many autobiographical books that were often a mixture of letters and novels. He won top literary honors, including the P. C. Hooft Prize in 1968 and the Prize of Dutch Letters in 2001. His books have been translated into French, German, English and several Eastern European languages. Mr. Reve, who had Alzheimer's disease, spent his final two years in a nursing home near his home in Belgium.

1114-> California Dreaming on Such a Winter's Day
Winter, to put it politely, is not kind to Rochester. How many other cities, after all, are regularly in the running for the Golden Snowball, an annual award presented to the upstate city with the most snowfall? (Rochester, at 113 inches, was bested last winter only by Syracuse at 137.) "It can be pretty bleak, let's be honest," said Anthony Bannon, director of George Eastman House, the renowned photography museum founded in the city in 1947. "There are times when it feels like you don't see the sun for months." This was one of the reasons that a light bulb -- actually more like a tanning lamp -- went off over Mr. Bannon's head more than a year ago when he became familiar with an odd, obsessive experiment being conducted by a photographer named Robert Weingarten. Mr. Weingarten, a former executive who took up a camera professionally at 54, travels around the world in search of images, and his work is now in the collections of several major museums. But in 2002, at the urging of Weston Naef, the photography curator at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, Mr. Weingarten decided to train his lens on his own backyard in Malibu, Calif., following Alfred Stieglitz's advice that photographers should first look for pictures at home before traveling to find them. The results of Mr. Weingarten's experiment went on view this week at Eastman House, beaming a little bit of Southern California to Rochester, at least photographically. His idea was to take pictures with a medium-format film camera every day that he was home, at exactly the same time, 6:30 in the morning, the camera pointed southeastward from his bedroom porch toward the same spot over Santa Monica Bay. Mr. Weingarten worked with an almost scientific rigor to ensure that the way he took each photograph was identical: he bought all the film from the same production batch and even stored it at the same temperature and humidity for a year as he took the pictures from January through December of 2003. The aperture was always set at f/22, and the lens always focused at infinity. His only intervention was to change the shutter speed depending on the amount of natural light available each morning. In a recent interview, he said that when he first started to look at the transparencies and see on film what he thought he could see with his eyes every morning, he was astonished at how artificial, almost painted, the images looked. "The depth of the color is either something you can't see or just don't concentrate hard enough to see in the sky and water," he said, adding that he was glad he had chosen film instead of digital photography. ("People would have said, 'Oh, you just played with Photoshop and manipulated that,' " he said.) Depending on what time of year the photographs were taken, they sometimes resemble striated Rothko paintings, the ominous light-rimmed clouds of El Greco or the candy-colored California skies of Ed Ruscha. In some pictures, the control tower of the Los Angeles International Airport is visible across the bay, but in most the water, horizon and sky blend together in fluid, fuzzy, gradations of color and sunlight. For the sun-starved of Rochester, Mr. Bannon thought, the pictures would be especially striking. But instead of showing them in an exhibition inside the museum, he proposed something that the institution had never done, placing enlarged photographs in front of the museum, like billboards from the land of perpetual summer. "It's our way of trying to turn lemons into lemonade," he said. "The winter is forbidding so you use it, try to turn it to your advantage." The exhibition, which remains up through Feb. 12, includes 19 enlargements of Mr. Weingarten's prints, blown up to 40 inches square and arrayed in Plexiglas cases on the front lawn of the Colonial Revival mansion that houses the museum, originally the home of Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Company. Mr. Weingarten, who was born in Brooklyn but decamped for California when he was young and never came back, said the show was a particularly personal one for him because of his gray early winter memories. "When I moved here," he said of California, "I told my friends that I was color-deprived from having grown up in New York, and they laughed at me. But it was true." He added that he had only one further hope for the show, one that Rochesterians in January probably don't want to hear: "I really hope it snows."

1115-> A Cozy December-December Romance Finds a Groove in Northern New Jersey
Few couples on the verge of cohabitation can avoid the fraught moving-van negotiation: how much, and precisely whose, stuff will fill it, and by extension, how the disparate possessions of two households will fit into one. “I’ve collected a few books over the years,” one partner might say, while the other winces and wonders, “How many is a few?” Kathleen Clark’s unshowy, affectingly plain-spoken new play, “Southern Comforts,” includes that generic romantic-comedy exchange but soon goes on to consider a thornier impasse, pondering not whether two retirement-age newlyweds, Gus Klingman (Larry Keith) and Amanda Cross (Penny Fuller), can live together in peace, but whether they’ll rest that way for eternity. I think it’s safe to say that few besotted young lovers, in fact or in fiction, have uttered the hurt, plaintive line, “I thought we were gettin’ a stone together,” as does Amanda when she learns that Gus plans instead to take the grave beside his first wife, Helen. Even a plot that’s paid for can thicken. As Amanda’s dropped “g” indicates, she’s a Southerner, a few rings past a belle but still as pert and cheering as a Tennessee wildflower when she breezes into Gus’s sparsely furnished New Jersey home at the top of the show. (Thomas Lynch designed the cozy single set, washed with seasonal scene changes by Brian Nason’s lights.) For his part, Gus is a standard-issue coot, albeit with complications: a tidy, taciturn retired stonemason, he relishes the undisturbed quiet since his first wife died five years ago. It was a tight-lipped slog of a marriage, he reports, not a noisy battle; but grim silence is easier to bear when it’s not shared. Still, the way he sizes up Ms. Fuller’s blond, petite Amanda proves that Gus has some fight left in him. “I can’t get away with too much around you — I like that,” he tells her after a few dates. “Sort of like a good cup of coffee. You keep me awake.” The modest specificity of that compliment suits Ms. Clark’s play as well. It has a gentle sitcom rhythm and a tidy approach to conflict resolution. At 100 minutes, it’s an economical mix of incident and introspection, and the director, Judith Ivey, keeps the momentum humming as smoothly as a Lincoln Town Car on a Sunday drive, its occupants bickering lightly over directions and stopping occasionally for refreshments. Ms. Fuller and Mr. Keith, seasoned pros both, offer a master class in unforced chemistry, if such a thing could be taught. The title “Southern Comforts” is misleading, though, and not only because the play, like the stubborn Gus, is set firmly in northern New Jersey. The title would also seem to suggest that this snowy old widower, warmed back to life by the merry widow with the honeyed accent, is the sole beneficiary of this merger. In fact, what’s most delightful, even sneakily sexy, about this December-December romance is that it clearly spreads comfort in both directions.

1116-> Put Coca Leaf on a Plate, Peru Leader Says
LIMA, Peru, Dec. 20 (AP) — President Alan García on Tuesday suggested an unorthodox use for the coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine: Why not toss it in a salad? “I insist that it can be consumed directly and elegantly in salad,” Mr. García told foreign correspondents at the Government Palace. His comments put him in the company of Presidents Evo Morales of Bolivia and Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, who have publicly promoted mixing the high-calcium leaf into everything from toothpaste to soft drinks. For centuries, coca has been considered a medicinal and ceremonial plant in Andean culture, and Mr. García said it should not be vilified as useful solely for producing the drug. He said Gastón Acurio, one of Peru’s best-known chefs, recently served several coca-based dishes for an event at the Government Palace. A recent report by a Peruvian antidrug group, however, said that some studies showed that coca’s nutrients could not be absorbed by the body. For years, the United States has pressed Peru, the second largest source of cocaine, after Colombia, to fight production of the drug. The American Embassy declined to react to Mr. García’s comments.

1117-> Metro Briefing | Manhattan: Boost For Library Face-Lift
The state will add $5 million to the $10 million it has already provided for restoration of the historic facade of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday. The work will include inspections, removal and replacement of worn mortar, restoration of ornamentation and statuary repair, resurfacing of stone and replacement of brackets. The Beaux-Arts building opened in 1911 -- then the largest marble structure in the country. The facade restoration is to be scheduled for completion in time for the library's centennial celebration in 2011.

1118-> The Everyman of Genocide
A SPECTER haunts this book, and her name is Hannah Arendt. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, Adolf Eichmann was portrayed by the prosecution as a gleefully genocidal monster intent on eliminating every Jew from the face of the earth. This picture was consistent with the common view of Nazis at the time: they were the embodiment of evil, the point at which reality merged with melodrama and kitsch. But Arendt saw something else. Eichmann, responsible for transporting millions of Jews to the death camps, was essentially a bureaucrat, with little more on his mind than pleasing his superiors. He was neither fanatical nor bloodthirsty, in fact had never directly killed anyone. He made trains run on time. Yet he was indisputably a mass murderer, and in the articles she wrote for The New Yorker, as well as in "Eichmann in Jerusalem," the book that followed, Arendt introduced a phrase to describe him that has become part of the modern vocabulary — "the banality of evil." "Anyone writing on the subject today works in the shadow of Hannah Arendt," David Cesarani observes in "Becoming Eichmann," the first full biography to appear since the 1960's. It is thoroughly researched, densely factual; there may never be need for another biography of the man. Cesarani, a British scholar specializing in Jewish history, can be a plodder — turf battles among the Nazis are like turf battles anywhere else — but his accounts of Eichmann's early years, of his escape to Argentina and eventual capture are richly informative. Cesarani believes his details add up to a portrait at odds with Arendt's banal bureaucrat, but what is striking is how far his research goes to reinforce her fundamental arguments. No issue is more important to understanding Eichmann than the nature of his anti-Semitism, and Cesarani is quite good on the context of Eichmann's anti-Jewish upbringing. He was raised in northern Austria, in a conventional middle-class household where conventionality included at least a casual anti-Semitism. But describing a gentile Austrian in the 1920's as an anti-Semite is like describing a white Mississippian in the 1920's as a racist; it tells us nothing about an individual. In Austria, Eichmann had Jewish friends, was employed by Jews as an oil and kerosene salesman, had Jewish relatives by marriage. In 1932 he became a Nazi not out of anti-Jewish conviction but, Arendt says, because he was a joiner. Cesarani stresses issues and personal connections more: Eichmann liked the Nazis' position on the Versailles Treaty. But he shares Arendt's opinion that it wasn't anti-Semitism that led Eichmann into the party. Both Arendt and Cesarani point to hard work and happenstance as the factors that propelled Eichmann's career forward. His job at first was to round up Jews and force them to leave the Reich, a task he undertook with his customary diligence as well as a repulsive brutality, yet not with any particular ideological fervor. The turning point came after 1941, when forced emigration gave way to genocide. Under the pressure of his new duties, Eichmann changed. Arendt depicts the change as a loss of whatever conscience he may have had, especially when he saw his superiors accepting and implementing the Final Solution. Cesarani presents a more committed Eichmann, who was no longer simply carrying out orders but had adopted eliminationist anti-Semitism as his own. Trying to sort out the difference between Arendt and Cesarani on this point plunges us into the hopeless murk of human psychology. But the larger truth is that Arendt and Cesarani both disagree with the Israeli prosecution: rabid anti-Semitism wasn't the motivating force throughout Eichmann's years as a Nazi. He had to become Eichmann. Neither are Arendt and Cesarani far apart in the conclusions they draw. One of Arendt's achievements was to tear down the wall that separated the Nazis from everyone else. Eichmann's ordinariness proved that normality was no protection against the commission of terrible crimes. "It would have been very comforting indeed to believe that Eichmann was a monster," she writes; melodrama, after all, with its white hats and black hats, is a form of absolution. But she will have none of that. She points an accusing finger at us all. So does Cesarani. Under the right circumstances, normal people will commit mass murder, he says, and the circumstances of our age — with its racism, ethnic cleansing, suicide bombers and genocidal killings — are ominous. "Eichmann appears more and more like a man of our time," are his concluding words. "Everyman as génocidaire." But if Cesarani is so close to Arendt, why is he so hostile to her? Her judgments were "wayward," he says. Her depiction of Eichmann was "self-serving, prejudiced and ultimately wrong." Arendt could be infuriatingly arrogant, and to impugn her objectivity, Cesarani cites disparaging comments she made about Eastern European Jews in private letters. He goes further: "She had much in common with Eichmann. There were two people in the courtroom who looked up to the German-born judges as the best of Germany and looked down on the prosecutor as a miserable Ostjude: one was Eichmann and the other was Hannah Arendt." This slur reveals a writer in control neither of his material nor of himself. Arendt did look down on the prosecutor, Gideon Hausner. She disapproved of his handling of the case. And Cesarani? He finds Hausner's conduct "bullying and aimless," "erratic," "half-baked," "a shambles." Maybe he doesn't like Ostjuden either. There's an easy explanation for Cesarani's hostility. He is writing "in the shadow" of one of the great books of the last half-century, and has to tear Arendt down to make space for himself. Still, more seems at stake here than a competition between scholars. Arendt's approach was unyieldingly universalistic. Her analysis of Eichmann was a demand for individual responsibility, an insistence on the need constantly to exercise personal choice, whatever society might dictate. This is a cold ethic, as severe as Kant's, so difficult it has a quality of the inhuman about it. For who among us can maintain the unceasing moral awareness she calls for? And, indeed, there is something inhuman in the passages of "Eichmann in Jerusalem" that have drawn the most criticism — the attack on the Jewish leaders who cooperated with the Nazis. For Arendt, the leaders embodied the general "moral collapse" of those years. She refused to grant Jews any special status, even as victims, rejecting what she called the "absurd assertion of a kind of collective innocence of the Jewish people." The Holocaust, she insisted, was "a crime against humanity, perpetrated upon the body of the Jewish people." The great historian Gershom Scholem, reproaching Arendt for this austere universalism, accused her of lacking "Ahabath Israel: Love of the Jewish people." Cesarani, though he doesn't say so explicitly, obviously sides with Scholem. He writes that Eichmann's "disdain for Jews found more than an echo" in Arendt. But he mistakes impartiality for hostility. One doesn't have to love the victims of genocide to hate the perpetrators. A fairer criticism is that Arendt ignored the particularity of the Holocaust, its central place in Jewish history and psychology. Her thought tended to move from individuality to universality without passing through the communal, lived world that provides most people with their sense of identity. Such radicalism is what gives her writing its power, but also what makes it so troubling. In her response to Scholem, she wrote: "I have never in my life 'loved' any people or collective — neither the German people, nor the French, nor the American, nor the working class or anything of that sort. I indeed love 'only' my friends and the only kind of love I know of and believe in is the love of persons." This is a statement that manages to be warm and chilling at the same time.

1119-> Editors' Note
An article on Sept. 18 about the California trial of Susan Mae Polk in the murder of her husband, Dr. Frank Felix Polk, a psychologist, described their history together since she became his patient at age 15. The article said she was 16 when they first had sex. That account was based on assertions by Ms. Polk in the couple's divorce proceeding, which were not specifically challenged by Dr. Polk and were supported by statements from people who knew the couple. The account should have been attributed. Further reporting has revealed that it was only after 24 years that Ms. Polk recalled the physical contact, and other friends of Dr. Polk contend in interviews that his wife may have been older when they first had sex.

1120-> Swinging for the Suburban Fences, but Not Too Hard
BELLAIRE, Tex. - It's not just one, two, three strikes you're out at the old softball game in Feld Park. Belting one over the fence will do it, too. Home runs are outs in this otherwise all-American Houston suburb about nine miles west of downtown, where encroaching development has upended one of the sport's most hallowed rules, even, for a time, getting home run hitters ejected from the batter's box. (Inside-the-park home runs -- what the Amateur Softball Association soothingly calls "four-base awards" -- are still O.K.) It is not as if this city of 17,000 -- named perhaps for the gulf breezes and swallowed by the Houston metroplex nearly 60 years ago -- has anything against the American pastime. The bulbous white water tower that looms over town like a giant onion still celebrates Bellaire's two baseball legends, the 1999 high school national champions and the Bellaire Little League All-Stars that took the American pennant in 2000, making it to the World Series in Williamsport, Pa., only to lose a heartbreaker to Maracaibo, Venezuela, 3-2. But when the love of green space and recreation ran headlong into property rights amid a homebuilding boom, something had to give. "I don't want to be in the backyard to be clunked on the head with a softball," said Lee Decker, a builder whose new and yet-unsold $721,000 two-story house overlooking left-center field lost two windows late last year to homegrown sultans of swat in the park's Optimist Club league. Mr. Decker has since been mollified by the long-ball sanctions and a 50-foot-high fence-and-net barrier that has proved impervious to all but one improbable blast of 300 feet or more several weeks ago that broke another window. "I thought there was no way anyone could hit that house," said Jane Dembski, Bellaire's director of parks and recreation, whose agency had paid most of the costs of the latest net. "It kind of went straight up and straight down." An old sign near the outfield spells out the stakes: "Ballplayers do not retrieve balls hit into yards without the residents' permission. Violators can be arrested for trespassing on private property." Or worse. "Why don't we enter the yards, Jackie?" a neighbor, Robert Duffield, asked his wife, eliciting her well-primed answer: "Because," she said, "this is Texas and you might get shot." Actually, Mr. Duffield, an engineer whose house on Beech Street backs up to the outfield fence near the left-field foul line, said he had no problem with the ballplayers. He even keeps a bucket filled with softballs that have landed in his yard for the owners to retrieve. His welcome when he moved into his new house in 1992, he said, was a broken window, but, he said, "one of the reasons I bought the house was because of the park nearby." Another neighbor, Don Copeland, who is in the oil and gas business, was similarly unfazed. "I've collected about 46 in eight months," he said, shrugging off the hazards of flying softballs. "But then again, I don't own an $800,000 house with glass all around." Mr. Decker, who does, and is planning to build a second new house next door, said he was amazed that the latest missile could have made it over the shield and had first blamed a painter for breaking the window. But he said he was satisfied with the efforts to solve the problem. Bellaire's property-based ban on homers may be unusual, but limiting the number of base-clearing blasts is a general rule in the Amateur Softball Association as a way of keeping the play competitive. The restrictions here grew piecemeal. A 20-foot-high fence, later topped by a 10-foot net, initially enclosed the ball field. Before the new house went up, clouts over the center field fence between the scoreboard and green water tanks were still home runs. But in December (field sports know no season in the semi-tropics) the full ban was instituted, along with a rule that yanked overachieving hitters from the batting order, sending some players grumbling to The Houston Chronicle. The final 20 feet of new net went up in March. The player who hit the new house several weeks ago, Jarrett Ledger, a 21-year-old firefighter in nearby Pecan Grove who plays for the Scrappers, said, "I don't try to do it," but another player needled him, growling, "Ahh, he does it on purpose." Still, it is all working out, said Ms. Dembski of Bellaire's park department, because of the cooperation of the league, which contributed $5,000 to the $16,000 cost of the new net and paid for the latest broken window. Of course they were cooperative, said Dean Smith IV, the club's president. "We're Optimists. We take an optimistic look at everyone and everything."

1123-> Suspect Surrenders in Killing of 2-Year-Old
The man accused of killing a 2 1/2-year-old Bronx boy who was riding in a minivan with his family to Easter dinner turned himself in last night after a day in which the police and the family pleaded for help in finding the gunman. The police had been searching for the suspect, Nicholas Morris, 26, who they say was shooting at a group of people at a busy intersection in the Morris Heights neighborhood when the minivan passed by about 2 p.m. on Sunday. According to the police, the events leading up to the shooting began with an exchange of "hard looks." The dispute escalated into offensive words and a slap on the face, and in a matter of minutes erupted into the gunfire in which the boy was killed in his car seat as his mother drove him, his two sisters and a cousin through the intersection. The police identified Mr. Morris, of 1926 University Avenue, and another man, Ronneil Gilliam, 25, of 1878 Harrison Avenue, as suspects earlier yesterday. The police arrested Mr. Morris about 7:45 p.m. after he called them from News 12 the Bronx, a local cable channel, to say he would surrender. Mr. Gilliam was still being sought last night. The police said they believed that the boy was struck by a bullet from a 9-millimeter gun fired by Mr. Morris. At least five bullets were fired, and shell casings were found at the scene, but no one else was injured. The gun has not been recovered. Earlier yesterday, a day after the boy, David Pacheco Jr., died from a bullet to his chest, the police provided more details about the events that led to the violence, and the boy's mother asked the public for help in finding those responsible for her son's death. "You have to feel my pain," the boy's mother, Joanne Sanabria, 28, said yesterday, standing at in front of her home on Bruckner Boulevard, clutching a SpongeBob SquarePants doll that belonged to her son. "He didn't sin. He was a good little boy. "That bullet went through my door and hit my son's car seat and went through my son." Yesterday afternoon, detectives carried cardboard boxes from the fourth-floor apartment where Mr. Morris lives with his mother, brother and girlfriend. Last evening the police said they had recovered a .22-caliber rifle and a small amount of narcotics from the home and had Mr. Morris's brother, though they did not provide his name or the charges. Officials appealed for the public's assistance: They placed fliers on car windshields, circulated photographs of the suspects and roamed the Morris Heights neighborhood in a car with a rooftop loudspeaker to spread their appeal. And the boy's family held a news conference to ask anyone who might have information about the case to step forward. "I want the person who did this to be caught," Ms. Sanabria said earlier yesterday, hours before Mr. Morris was arrested. "I want him to wake up every day and see my face and hear my voice and see my son's face." Last night, in an interview with News 12, Mr. Morris maintained his innocence. "I did not shoot anybody ever in my life," he said, speaking directly into the camera. "I wanted somebody to hear my story before I'm stuck in the interrogation room and with them trying to mix me up." Mr. Morris said he was blocks away when he heard the gunshots and ran with a crowd away from the shots, according to the station's report. About 7:45 p.m., the police arrived and took him into custody, though specific charges against him were still pending last night. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has made battling gun crime a priority of his second administration, pushing a raft of initiatives aimed at reducing the number of shootings in the city, which is down compared to the same period last year. The events on Sunday began to unfold shortly before 2 p.m., said the police, who gave the following account: Mr. Morris and Mr. Gilliam encountered a man on the street in front of 1730 Harrison Avenue. A stare down ensued. One of the two suspects slapped the man across the face. Then two men and a woman, all friends of the man who was slapped, approached. Outnumbered, the two suspects fled. The two men then went to Mr. Gilliam's home at 1878 Harrison Avenue, where they retrieved a gun, the police said. They returned to the street moments later, and, after seeing that the group had walked a block or so north and crossed the street, fired at them across the intersection of Harrison and West Tremont Avenues. According to witnesses, Mr. Morris was standing in front of 1812 Harrison Avenue when he fired at the group, which was at 1731 Harrison Avenue. Investigators said that they believed the two groups did not know one another and that there is no indication that gang affiliation or drugs played a part in the shooting, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman. In Morris Heights, the neighborhood where the shooting took place, crime has fallen significantly in recent months. At the direction of Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, the 46th Precinct, where the shooting happened, has been split in two, with a captain assuming command of each half, and more crime-fighting resources have been sent into those areas. Compared to the same period last year, overall crime in the precinct has dropped nearly 24 percent and murders are also down, to four from five, the police said. At the news conference yesterday, Ms. Sanabria recounted the moment when her son was hit. She said she was driving when she heard the gunshots, and then her son screamed. His sister, she said, shouted, "The baby, the baby's been hit!" When she stopped the minivan, she saw the bullet hole on the door behind her and then pulled up her son's shirt and saw his body covered in blood. "God only knows how much I wish that bullet had hit me," she said. Ms. Sanabria, who was joined at the news conference by the boy's father, David Pacheco Sr., thanked an off-duty emergency medical technician who came out of his apartment across the street and administered CPR. In an interview yesterday, the technician, Angelo Cruz, recounted the boy's final moments. He said that a livery cab driver stopped at the scene and took him, the wounded boy and his mother to Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center, where he was later pronounced dead. On the way, Mr. Cruz said the boy suddenly regained consciousness for a moment, opened his eyes, stretched his arms and looked around. "It was like a moment of hope," Mr. Cruz said. "But it had a feeling of a last goodbye." Then, he said, Ms. Sanabria, kissed her son on the head.

1124-> What Should the Democrats Do?
To the Editor: I am mystified by the media's repeated depiction of the Democrats as an idea-less, inept political party. In fact, minimal research reveals a party that has long promoted a specific and progressive agenda, rich with creative policy thinking on every subject -- from the war, the economy and the environment to Social Security and health care reform. Now, before the crucial midterm election campaign has even begun, your front page trumpets Democratic remorse over "missed opportunities." Worse yet, the Republican-promoted myths that some party leaders are angry (Hillary Rodham Clinton) and others "flawed messengers" (Howard Dean, John Kerry, Al Gore) are presented as if they were fact. I am waiting to read a front-page headline and article that state that Republicans may have to struggle to overcome both their own weak record and a strong Democratic platform in the 2006 midterm elections.

1126-> The Lure of Kansas (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re “ ” (front page, Oct. 23): I was surprised by the so-called experts quoted in the article who couldn’t explain the growth of Olathe, Kan. Apparently they have never spent much time here. Having worked in Olathe and lived in an adjoining suburb for more than 20 years, I think that the answer for its tremendous growth is no mystery. Olathe is situated in Johnson County, which is nationally known for excellent schools, police, fire and local government. Olathe and Johnson County are some of the best and safest places in the country to raise kids, which is still important to us here in the “fly-over states” — and people are willing to pay a premium for those attributes.

1127-> The Documentary 'The Age of AIDS' Begins on PBS
There's Elizabeth Taylor, pretty in pink, and beside her Nancy Reagan, elegant in white, wearing a cautious version of her adoring-wife gaze. Ms. Taylor looks pleased, too. It is 1987, and at her invitation, six years into the AIDS epidemic, President Ronald Reagan is making his first — and, as it turned out, only — speech on the subject. The scene is from "The Age of AIDS," a gripping (eventually) two-part, four-hour "Frontline" documentary that begins tonight on PBS. It doesn't offer a lot of movie star scenes like that, but it's loaded with drama. The most bizarre juxtaposition has to be Bono, of the rock group U2, quoting Scripture to Senator Jesse Helms. This year is the 25th anniversary of the epidemic, dating from the reports of the initial cases in the United States in 1981, first among gay men, then among intravenous drug users and then among Haitian immigrants. The program, perhaps trying a little too hard to maintain its dignity, manages to make the story of the earliest developments almost boring. Only Cleve Jones, founder of the Names Project (the AIDS memorial quilt), captures the overwhelming, almost surreal quality of those days. "It seems like it was just an avalanche," Mr. Jones recalls. "It was like one week we'd never heard of it, and then the next week everybody started to die. People began to vanish." Eventually, though, the story picks up steam, particularly in Part 2, to be shown tomorrow night. By the end, with all the outrages and grievous mistakes of the last quarter-century piled up, this has become a tremendously important television document with real impact. There are a few heroes, including Rock Hudson, who died of AIDS in 1985, and workers at the Centers for Disease Control, who have already been immortalized in Randy Shilts's AIDS history, "And the Band Played On." But there is a surfeit of villains. The biggest is Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa, who insisted that H.I.V. did not cause AIDS. "How does a virus cause a syndrome?" he asks rhetorically in a speech. "It can't." By 1999 one of five South African adults had the virus. One was a son of Mr. Mbeki's predecessor, Nelson Mandela; Mr. Mandela is seen briefly at his son's funeral in 2005. The program does recount some success stories. In Uganda an educational campaign focusing on prevention (condoms, abstinence or sexual fidelity) led to a major decline in the rate of infection. There were similar results in Thailand, where the government forced radio stations to broadcast AIDS education messages. In a way "The Age of AIDS" is the story of the drugs to treat it. AZT, a cancer medication from the 1950's, turned out to be a breakthrough, but thanks to its manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome, a year's supply initially cost about $10,000. Activists demonstrated and fought, and eventually prices were brought down, although not nearly enough to help the millions infected in Africa. Then in 1996 a cocktail of drugs, including protease inhibitors, was shown to suppress the virus, if taken regularly. For Americans with health insurance it has been a miracle. It is almost June, and so far this year The New York Times has published only one obituary in which the cause of death was given as AIDS. In 1991 there were 81, including those of Tony Richardson, Freddie Mercury and Larry Kert. But elsewhere on the planet, the pandemic is still growing. Some 30 million people have died of AIDS. Roughly 40 million new infections are predicted over the next decade. Near the end of "The Age of AIDS," former President Bill Clinton predicts a vaccine in his lifetime. Others are far less optimistic. On most PBS stations tonight and tomorrow night. (Check local listings.)

1128-> Travel Deals Lost in the Details
THERE is a reason some of the deals on the auction travel Web sites sound too good to be true, Budget Travel reports. While outright fraud is rare in the offerings posted by the three companies that dominate the travel auction scene -- SkyAuction, LuxuryLink and, of course, eBay -- in the rush to claim a good price, a buyer may not notice handling fees, blackout dates and penalties for changes that can be buried in the fine print. There are certainly deals to be found, Susan Stellin writes. A seven-night cruise in the western Caribbean on Norwegian Cruise Line sold for $449 a person on SkyAuction, compared with $737 through other sellers. Not surprisingly, the best deals can be found on the more expensive vacations, where higher profit margins are built into the everyday prices. But the packages could include unwanted features -- like spa treatments or diving trips -- and could actually be cheaper if booked directly. "At the minimum, expect blackout dates and penalties for changes (or no changes allowed)," Ms. Stellin writes. "Read the fine print -- twice." And then there are the fees. LuxuryLink charges $20 for every purchase, Ms. Stellin writes, and SkyAuction tacks on $32 a night at hotels and $195 a week on many condos. "What happens on the Internet isn't so much different from Sotheby's: one wrong move and you could end up spending a lot for something you didn't want." MYSTERY MEAT -- The major airlines are going through one of their periodic attempts to upgrade the meal service they offer to those in the first-class cabin, in an effort to lure more full-fare passengers, Condé Nast Traveler reports. But as the sidebar, "A Day in the Life of a Chicken Breast," makes clear, most of us are going to be far better off brown-bagging it the next time we fly. In turns out that the sauces served with the chicken are prepared 22 hours before the flight. The chicken itself is cooked 14 to 16 hours before takeoff and immediately "put into blast chillers for two to four hours and cooled to below 40 degrees." It is then wrapped and placed in cold storage. Some three and a half hours before the flight, the chicken breast is placed on a catering truck; 90 minutes before takeoff the food is loaded onboard, where eventually it is reheated. "The reality of airline food is that you are eating leftovers," says Ron DeSantis, a chef at the Culinary Institute of America who has done consulting work for the industry. Is it any wonder that the food tastes the way it does? WHOM DO YOU TRUST? -- "People tend to overvalue advice when the problem they're addressing is hard, and to undervalue it when the problem is easy," Francesca Gino writes in the current issue of The Harvard Business Review. Ms. Gino, a lecturer and postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Business School, said her research showed subjects would have been better off valuing all the advice they received equally. And her additional findings are potentially bad news for consultants. People "overvalue advice that they pay for," she writes. "Before acting on those premium-priced recommendations from your consultancy, ask what you'd do if you had gotten the same advice for free." FINAL TAKE -- If the members of the Cistercian Abbey of Our Lady of Spring Bank in Wisconsin ever want to go into business full time, there will be no shortage of takers for their marketing prowess. "LaserMonks: Real savings. Real monks. Supporting real people." That could be the positioning statement of their commercial subsidiary, LaserMonks.com, which sells discounted printer cartridges and other office supplies online, Fortune Small Business reports. The business had $2.5 million in sales in 2005, and the monks plan to offer a full line of office electronics later this year. Sales cover the $150,000 annual cost to maintain the monastery and its grounds. The rest of the company's profits, Christine Y. Chen writes, "help support charities that range from a camp for kids with H.I.V. to a Buddhist orphanage in Tibet." The Web site also accepts online prayer requests. PAUL B. BROWN

1130-> Working Girls With Dreams Beyond the Corner
A maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid, “Princesas” is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa. The princesses of the title — and what a facile conceit that is — are Caye (Candela Peña), a mousy Spaniard saving up for breast implants, and Zulema (Micaela Nevárez), a foxy Dominican saving money to send back home. They will bond and squabble over the course of the film, in which narrative drive is replaced by an episodic drip of breakdowns, soul searching, girly behavior (shopping, gossip, hairdressing) and improbable poetic monologues. Mr. Aranoa is good with actors but lousy with ideas, though he broaches themes of class conflict and the economic basis of racism. His best material observes the rivalry between a clique of native working girls and the dark-skinned streetwalkers newly arrived on the scene. Otherwise, “Princesas” rehearses “hooker with a heart of gold” tropes and indulges Almodóvarian clichés of Spanish spunk and solidarity. Irrelevant subplots burden the leads. Ms. Peña is saddled with a brittle, lonely mother. Ms. Nevárez fends off an abusive client. Both try hard to energize the material, but there’s only so much to be done under the guidance of a director whose imaginative limitations are suggested by his conception, offered in the press kit, of the Zulema character: “a princess in exile, sweet and swarthy, doomed daily by desperation to eat the bitter bread of banishment.” Written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) and directed by Fernando León de Aranoa; director of photography, Ramiro Civita; edited by Nacho Ruiz Capillas; music by Alfonso de Vilallonga and Manu Chao; art director, Llorenç Miquel; produced by Mr. Aranoa and Jaume Roures; released by IFC First Take. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 109 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Candela Peña (Caye), Micaela Nevárez (Zulema), Mariana Cordero (Pilar), Llum Barrera (Gloria), Violeta Pérez (Caren) and Mónica Van Campen (Ángela).

DEBORAH EISENBERG offers commanding proof that in the right hands, the short story can be a legitimate art form, not just a test run for writers warming up to write a novel. Long ago, Eisenberg leaped the hurdles assigned to the short story by turning out fiction novelistic in all but its length. Simply put, there aren't many contemporary novels as shudderingly intimate and mordantly funny as Eisenberg's best stories, and her latest collection, her fifth in 20 years, should finally establish her as one of the most important fiction writers now at work. When summarized, Eisenberg's stories don't seem much different from the wealth of contemporary realist American short fiction that peers into the lives of well-meaning people and turns their secrets into dramatic currency. Anxious siblings trade bitter insults while their grandmother, crippled by a stroke and entrusted to their care, stares at violent images on television. An impulsive young woman marries a man she has just met, only to fall under the increasingly menacing climate of his mood. A sheltered American in Italy, fleeing her ex-husband's bleak medical diagnosis, becomes the charity case of a worldly art dealer who has demons of his own. These are, in other words, sensitive, intelligent people who fail to know themselves in some crucial way and soon become smothered in misery. In terms of sheer rubbernecking spectacle, Eisenberg's stories rival any family train wreck Ingmar Bergman could imagine. But while she homes in on familial dissolution, heartbreak and Olympic-class sorrow, her domestic explosions more closely resemble those of John Cassavetes, since they're also desperately, queasily funny, even if you're not sure if it's O.K. to laugh. What distinguishes Eisenberg from peers like Grace Paley, Joy Williams and William Trevor is an approach to storytelling that can be dizzyingly prismatic, as if refracted through cracked glass. Eisenberg has little faith in the typical expository armatures that prop up dramatic scenes: who is talking and to whom and about what, even though close reading will answer these questions in time. By stripping away quotation marks and the informational fat that might provide obvious explanations, by thrusting readers into the middle of a conversation with characters we have yet to meet properly or playing hot potato with point of view, Eisenberg tests just how much can be left out before a story drowns in enigma. In "Window," for example, Kristina and Alma drink coffee while a toddler plays at their feet. We won't know for several pages that they're estranged sisters, that the child belongs to neither of them, that Kristina has abducted the boy from his father, who is violent and possibly hunting her down. What we see instead is a tense display of two women engaging in small talk. Although we sense how fraught the scene is, it's only when we surge deeper into the story that its real force erupts. This could seem like the studied omission of a minimalist trying to build a three-legged table, but in seemingly rejecting the stage directions and baby-sitting that a more traditional narrative would offer, Eisenberg shores up her scenes with mystery. They are captivating precisely because of what they don't say; injecting them with facts would also bleed them of suspense. It's rare to find a writer as beguilingly abstract as Eisenberg working in the literary tradition of familial angst that the stories of John Cheever defined so vividly. Aloof to the journalistic side of fiction, she's still deeply enjoyable to read -- indeed, ruthlessly acerbic and insightful. Few writers could, for instance, imagine the well-pressed customers at a restaurant in clinical terms that are also oddly lyrical, as Eisenberg does in "Like It or Not": "This aggregation of hairy vertebrates, scrubbed, scented, prancing about on hind legs, was ruthlessly bent on physical gratifications -- tactile, visual, gustatory, genital. . . . The candles! The flowers! A trough providing mass feedings for naked guests would be less pornographic." And few writers could convey so adroitly the detached self-effacement of a wife like Lulu in "Revenge of the Dinosaurs": "Jeff always used to be (his word) charmed that I wasn't a (his word) sucker for received (his phrase) structures of logic." If at times Eisenberg seems to examine behavior through a telescope, it's not only a way to avoid the corrosion of rueful sentimentality -- triggering self-pity in a character before a reader's sympathy can ignite -- but a way to reveal the basic vulnerability of being alive. In Eisenberg's hands, civility -- dressing up, going out, masking our feelings -- isn't an advancement upon our animal nature but simply a demonstration of its inevitability. She calibrates her stories so her characters appear to us just when this performance has begun to exhaust them and their bestial origins are harder to mask. Such is the case in the title story, about free-floating Nathaniel, who has the grim misfortune to sublet a penthouse apartment overlooking the site where the 9/11 attacks will soon take place. Nathaniel imagines trying to impress upon his future grandchildren (he isn't even married yet) the keen anxiety he experienced over the Y2K issue, an anxiety that abruptly seemed foolish in retrospect. He's both embarrassed by the strength of his feelings and desperate to communicate them. Later, he mentally ages himself in order to experience his mortality more vividly: "He was 24 years old! Soon he'd be 28. In a few more minutes he'd be 35, then 50. Five zero. How had that happened? He was 80! He could feel his vascular system and brain clogging with paste, he was drooling." If Nathan can start digging his own grave so casually, it's no wonder he can't bear to continue work on his soon-to-be extinct comic strip, "Passivityman," which features a superhero who is barely super at all. One day, Passivityman might get around to doing something important, but when told of Captain Corporation's increasingly malicious hold on the world, he realizes that it won't be today: " 'Sounds like it's totally too late already,' says Passivityman, reaching for a cigarette." "Twilight of the Superheroes" is a curious choice for a title, since Eisenberg seems as likely to write about superheroes as Lorrie Moore would be to script a computer virus. Yet the force-depleted superhero in his drowsy last days is an apt metaphor in Eisenberg's world, where her characters are just coming to realize that no one can save them. ("It always turns out," Nathaniel observes, "that no one is in charge of the things that really matter.") The dream of the superhero has turned too dreamlike. Even the creator of the superhero no longer believes in his powers. If it's our foolish instinct to long for a world where we're kept safe, where someone might swoop in to protect us, it's the role of a writer as shrewd as Eisenberg to reveal how perilous that desire can be. She suffuses her work with enough disappointment and loss to overwhelm readers looking for sunnier stories. But for those who like to leap past the defenses and see a character's fragile, fearful side -- for those who enjoy their fiction grimly existential, however slippery it might be to pin down -- Eisenberg is as brave a guide as there is. It's sobering, after reading her stories, to return to a life where secrets can be kept and feelings hidden. In some futuristic world, perhaps people will be fitted with devices that can penetrate their defenses, divining and broadcasting their deepest thoughts and fears. Until then, Eisenberg has given us these remarkable stories, machines of perfect revelation deftly constructed by a contemporary master. 'Twilight of the Superheroes,' by Deborah Eisenberg Ben Marcus's most recent novel is "Notable American Women."

1133-> World Briefing | Asia: India: Government Vows To Compensate Victims Of Dam Project
The federal government told the Supreme Court it wanted to keep building a high dam on the Narmada River in west-central India and resettle those displaced by it. Protesters had asked the court to stop work on the Sardar Sarovar Dam until the displaced received new homes and land. Medha Patkar, an advocate for the environment, and villagers are protesting the decision on March 8 to raise the dam's height to 400 feet from 363 feet. The increase will leave 35,000 families in need of resettlement, said Dipti Bhatnagar, a spokeswoman for the protest group. The company building the project says it has resettled about 10,000 other families displaced by the project.

1136-> A Promise for Immigrants Who Seek Hospital Care
The city's Health and Hospitals Corporation and the mayor's office said yesterday that they were taking aggressive steps to reassure immigrants that no one will question their status when they seek care at New York City's public hospitals. In a letter distributed in 11 languages, the corporation's president, Alan D. Aviles, promises city residents that public hospital employees will "keep confidential all information regarding your immigration status." If they do not, Mr. Aviles wrote, they may lose their jobs. The agency and the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs is sending out the letters because advocacy groups have been reporting that many undocumented immigrants are afraid of going to hospitals because they think that when they are asked for personal and financial information, hospital workers will realize they are in the country illegally and report them. Mr. Aviles cited the case of a mother of three who arrived in New York from Mexico eight months ago and was afraid to seek treatment for cervical cancer. After an advocacy group intervened on her behalf, the woman was scheduled for treatment at one of the city's hospitals. Another immigrant, a construction worker, broke his foot and instead of going to the hospital, went to a friend of a friend — "a so-called expert" — for treatment, Mr. Aviles said. Dr. Warren Seigel, chairman of the department of pediatrics at Coney Island Hospital, has had patients ask to meet him in a private office, rather than at the hospital. "It's part and parcel of providing medical care," Mr. Aviles said. "There has to be a system of trust between health care providers and the patients." To ensure that the city's public hospitals are able to build and keep that trust, Mr. Aviles sent a letter to all 39,000 employees at the agency reminding them of the confidentiality policy. In addition he plans to go on rounds with the staff for the next month to make sure that all employees know the policy and that they serve as ambassadors for the public hospitals. "It's a public health issue," Mr. Aviles said. "It's foolish for us not to do this." He said that if fear kept immigrants away, "all the work we have done to improve the health of our communities — getting more children vaccinated, increasing prenatal care, reducing teen pregnancy, managing diabetes and reducing the spread of H.I.V./AIDS — could potentially come undone." Adam Gurvitch, director of health advocacy for the New York Immigrant Coalition, an umbrella group for more than 150 immigrant organizations, said that because the national immigration debate was causing so much confusion, his group was calling for the hospital industry, both public and private, to remind employees and patients that personal information is confidential and is not shared with government agencies. Despite the continuing disagreements over immigration policy, "it's really important for people to understand that nothing has changed," Mr. Gurvitch said. "Health care remains a right for all people in America, for all immigrants, regardless of immigration status." The policy is in line with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's executive order that generally forbids city agencies from inquiring about or disclosing the immigration status of New Yorkers who come into contact with city government. Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday that he was concerned about the studies that show undocumented immigrants afraid of going to a hospital. Mr. Bloomberg again criticized the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. "All of this is a problem because 20 years ago Congress did not do what they were supposed to do: address the problem of people coming into this country illegally," he said. The immigration debate aside, Guillermo Linares, commissioner for the Office of Immigrant Affairs, said that the campaign to make sure immigrants received proper health care benefited the city. "A healthy New Yorker keeps a healthy city, and that's why we're here," he said.

1140-> It’s Her Party
AMY SEDARIS has written a book on entertaining. To my mind, the most entertaining thing thiswriter-actress ever did was to perform Off Broadway (in plays she wrote with herbrother David) in roles for which she would tape the tip of her nose up against her face. The effect was porcine. Moreover, the elongation of Miss Sedaris’s nostrils, combined with the actress’s feral energy and freshets of filthy dialogue, was comedically intoxicating: I laughed so hard that I tasted my own bile. Sedaris’s wonderfully dizzy new book has a less galvanizingeffect, but to hold anything up toher former nasal-comedic heights is only to make it look saggy and distended by comparison — less Amy Sedaris’s nose and more Nora Ephron’s neck. No, the more apt comparison is the interior designer Dorothy Draper’s 1941 classic, “Entertaining Is Fun!” As Draper did, Sedaris starts out by telling us what her book is not, and also by acknowledging that parties don’t need to be formal or extravagant. On the first subject, Sedaris writes, “This is not a joke cookbook.” On the second: “Don’t think of pony kegs and loud Southern rock or cigarillos and businesswomen. Don’t think of pools and diving for loose change. Don’t think about cockfights — even though it’s hard not to.” Instead, she urges us to “think simplicity. Because if there is one thing that I am, it’s clinically simple.” “Clinically simple” may not be the mots justes here — “preposterously resourceful” is more like it. After all, we’re talking about a hostess who, for 25 cents, will laminate her party guests’ baby pictures or customize their cigarette lighters by wrapping them insticky shelf paper. She suggests using both an espresso spoon to curl eyelashes and Milk of Magnesia as a face mask. She offers four ideas for repurposing pantyhose, including a plant hanger, a bath sachet and a somewhatterrifying beauty aid she calls an “eye burrito.” In short, I’m not sure what this author needs more — a round of applause or a fully licensed professional to sit her down and tell her all about lithium. Ever since I finished reading this book, I’ve spent a lot of time picturing Sedaris doing something she refers to several times — freshening up her cheese balls. This method of replenishing and re-forming round globs of nuts and cheese so they can be served at a second gathering is a good shorthand for Sedaris’s cooking style, which is the heart of the book (more than 200 recipes are included). In the kitchen, Sedaris is a magpie, a recycler of both foodstuffs and already published recipes. She is not afraid of the phrase “two cups potato chips, crushed.” Indeed, if Sedaris’s culinary approach seems to have gelled in about 1953, it owes less to the fresh-food enthusiast James Beard than it does to the convenience-food advocate Poppy Cannon. In one recipe, Sedaris impregnates whipped cream with canned fruit cocktail. Ardent foodies who read her book may be overcome with a desire to take her to a Greenmarket and say: “Darling, here are fresh peas. Explore.” But I viewed her retro approach less as a shortcoming than as a difference of opinion. The girl simply likes her crushed potato chips. What did strike me as a shortcoming is what I’ll call the book’s vision. The best guides to entertaining — like Draper’s — leave the reader feeling Poised and Prepared. In addition to wanting specific party tips and recipes, many of us read books on entertaining because to do so is to lessen our anxiety about letting others get close to us, literally and metaphorically. As hilarious and as relentlessly inventive as Sedaris is, her prescriptions are often more likely to induce laughter or awe than intimacy. The sheer force of Sedaris’s personality, both on the stage and on the page, could crush most other comic performers and writers like the tiny bugs we are, but a gracious host is as much an enabler as a doer. That said, I’m ready to unleash 7,000 pounds of wacky at my next gathering. I want to encourage some children to play a game called “Beauty Parlor.” (Instructions: “Do each other’s makeup and hair and talk about your problems.”) I want to add hot nuts to a bowl of rosemary, butter, brown sugar, cayenne pepper and candied ginger and “toss frantically.” I want to brown chicken “until tanned.” I may even heed the first line of the Gypsy Skirt Steak recipe and “Steal some skirt steaks.” Now, if I can just get the tape to stay attached to my nose. ...

1141-> British Ban Indoor Smoking
LONDON, Feb. 14 - After a tortured debate, Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for a total ban on smoking in indoor public places in England -- a move that seemed certain to end the time-hallowed traditions of the smoky British pub, where a pint of ale and a cigarette once defined the downtime of generations. The decision, by an unexpectedly high margin of 384 to 184, brought England into line with Ireland, which barred smoking in public places in March 2004, and with Scotland and Northern Ireland, where bans are to come into force over the next 13 months. The local parliament in Wales has also said it will seek a full ban. The English ban is expected to come into effect next year. The issue was seen as so divisive in the ranks of the governing Labor Party that legislators were given what is called a free vote, allowing them to defy the party line. The Tuesday ballot overturned the re-election campaign position of Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, which had supported a partial ban permitting smoking in private members' clubs and pubs that do not serve food. The compromise would have permitted smokers to congregate in drinks-only pubs. Opponents of that policy -- including Patricia Hewitt, Mr. Blair's health secretary and, according to the Press Association news agency, Mr. Blair himself -- had said passive smoking would damage the health of workers in any club or pub, whether food was served or not. "This legislation is good news for tens of thousands of bar staff up and down the country," said Steve Webb, a legislator from the Liberal Democratic opposition. "The key issue has always been the health and safety of people who work in public places." Ms. Hewitt said a total ban provided a "level playing field" among all premises serving alcohol. The government says around 600,000 people will give up smoking when the new law is enforced. "This bill is going to save thousands of people's lives," Ms. Hewitt said, comparing the ban to the legal requirement to wear safety belts in cars. Some smokers, interviewed on British television, said the decision was one more sign of a "nanny state" encroaching into private lives. But campaigners from many antismoking groups welcomed the move. Alex Markham, the head of Cancer Research UK, called the ban "the most important advance in public health for 50 years" since researchers linked smoking to lung cancer. Ben Youdan, of the group No Smoking Day, said, "Compromises can't be made when protecting people against a killer."

1143-> Scant Drop Seen in Abortion Rate if Parents Are Told
For all the passions they generate, laws that require minors to notify their parents or get permission to have an abortion do not appear to have produced the sharp drop in teenage abortion rates that some advocates hoped for, an analysis by The New York Times shows. The analysis, which looked at six states that introduced parental involvement laws in the last decade and is believed to be the first study to include data from years after 1999, found instead a scattering of divergent trends. For instance, in Tennessee, the abortion rate went down when a federal court suspended a parental consent requirement, then rose when the law went back into effect. In Texas, the rate fell after a notification law went into effect, but not as fast as it did in the years before the law. In Virginia, the rate barely moved when the state introduced a notification law in 1998, but fell after the requirement was changed to parental consent in 2003. Since the United States Supreme Court recognized states' rights to restrict abortion in 1992, parental involvement legislation has been a cornerstone in the effort to reduce abortions. Such laws have been a focus of divisive election campaigns, long court battles and grass-roots activism, and are now in place in 34 states. Most Americans say they favor them. "It's one of the few areas that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed states to legislate, so it's become a key for lowering the abortion rate," said Mary Spaulding Balch, director of state legislation for the National Right to Life Committee. Ms. Balch said she believed that consent laws were effective. Yet the Times analysis of the states that enacted laws from 1995 to 2004 -- most of which had low abortion rates to begin with -- found no evidence that the laws had a significant impact on the number of minors who got pregnant, or, once pregnant, the number who had abortions. A separate analysis considered whether the existence or absence of a law could be used to predict whether abortions went up or down. It could not. The six states studied are in the South and West: Arizona, Idaho, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. (A seventh state, Oklahoma, also passed a parental notification law in this period, but did not gather abortion data before 2000.) Supporters of the laws say they promote better decision-making and reduce teenage abortions; opponents say they chip away at abortion rights and endanger young lives by exposing them to potentially violent reaction from some parents. But some workers and doctors at abortion clinics said that the laws had little connection with the real lives of most teenagers, and that they more often saw parents pressing their daughters to have abortions than trying to stop them. And many teenagers say they never considered hiding their pregnancies or abortion plans from their mothers. "I would have told my mother anyway," said a 16-year-old named Nicole, who waited recently at a clinic in Allentown, Pa., a state that requires minors to get the permission of just one parent. Nicole's mother and father are divorced, and it was her mother she went to for permission to have an abortion. "She was the first person I called," Nicole said. "She's like a best friend to me." Abortion rates have been dropping nationwide since the mid-1980's, most precipitously for teenagers. But in three states -- Arizona, Idaho and Tennessee -- the percentage of pregnant minors who had abortions rose slightly after the consent laws went into effect. When the Times study compared the first full year after a state began enforcing a parental law with the last full year before the law, it found that abortions among minors dropped an average of 9 percent. But in the same period, the rates for pregnant 18- and 19-year-olds, who were not affected by the law, dropped by 5 percent, suggesting that most of the drop among minors was associated with other factors that affected minors and adults alike. "There are ongoing trends that are pushing both birth rates and abortion rates down significantly, and those larger trends are more important than the effect of these laws," said Ted Joyce, an economist at Baruch College in New York who has studied parental involvement laws. He found they had limited effects on small subgroups of minors but little impact over all. Of the remaining decline in teenage abortion rates in the Times study, Dr. Joyce said that some of it might be attributed to minors going out of state for abortions. The health departments in these states do not track data on such abortions, but in three previous studies of states where such data were available, completed before 1991, two found that any drop in minors' abortions was matched by an increase in minors getting abortions out of state. Previous research on the effects of parental notification laws has been slender and has produced contradictory conclusions. All were hampered by inconsistencies in the ways states gather and report data. The Times analysis was limited by its focus on just six states, but it avoided the possible distortions of including states that gather data in inconsistent ways. Phillip B. Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College, examined nationwide survey results from 1985 to 1996, a time when many parental involvement laws were put in place, and found that the laws were associated with about one-eighth of the total drop in minors' abortions in those states. Much of the drop was associated with other factors, which might include the economy, availability of abortion, changes in mores and other trends. "It's not surprising it's not popping out," Dr. Levine said of the small drop found in the Times analysis. "There is nothing overwhelmingly staggering" in the change associated with the laws. Supporters of parental involvement laws say they allow parents to help their children make an important health care decision, as parents would on any other surgical procedure. For Cathi Harrod, interim president of the Center for Arizona Policy, who lobbied for 15 years for her state's parental consent law, getting minors to involve their parents in their medical decisions was reason enough for the laws, whatever the impact on overall abortion rates. Arizona's law went into effect in 2003. Ms. Harrod said she believed that there was a groundswell of women who have had regrets about their own abortions and that as they made their feelings known, "we think the numbers will go down as minors learn more about their options." Either way, she said, her organization will push for stricter standards and more public accountability for judicial bypass through access to judges' records. But providers interviewed in 10 states with parental involvement laws all said that of the minors who came into their clinics, parents were more often the ones pushing for an abortion, even against the wishes of their daughters. "I see far more parents trying to pressure their daughters to have one," said Jane Bovard, owner of the Red River Women's Clinic in Fargo, N.D., a state where a minor needs consent from both parents. "As a parent myself, I can understand. But I say to parents, 'You force her to have this abortion, and I can tell you that within the next six months she's going to be pregnant again.' " Renee Chelian, director of Northland Family Planning Centers in the Detroit area, said she had had to call the police on parents who wanted their daughters to have abortions, "because they threaten physical violence on the kids." Ms. Chelian added that the laws might have unseen effects, including driving some teenagers to try to abort their pregnancies on their own. "Kids talk among themselves," she said. "When we tell them they need to go to court or tell their parents, that's when they tell us there's a Web site" for chemicals or herbal remedies that claims to induce abortions. Nearly all state parental involvement laws allow for minors to bypass their parents by going through a judge. Providers interviewed in 10 states all said that the process was generally not cumbersome, but that some girls would be afraid to go to court. For Nicole, the 16-year-old in the Allentown clinic, the hard part was telling her estranged father. "It was my choice to tell him," she said. "It hurt him, but he understands and is there for me. So in a way it brought us closer together."

1144-> Enforcer Paints Picture of Gotti as Powerful Don
It was Christmas Eve 1988, Michael DiLeonardo said, when Jackie D'Amico, a captain in the Gambino crime family, told him, "Put a suit on, you're going to get straightened out." He went to an apartment on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, a few blocks from the Ravenite Social Club, home base of the Gambino family. There he waited in a room with four other men, including John A. Gotti, the son of the family boss, to be inducted as "made men" into the family. The first knock was for Mr. Gotti, he said. The third knock, "That was my knock," Mr. DiLeonardo testified yesterday as a government witness at Mr. Gotti's racketeering trial. He was taken to another room and seated at a long table next to Sammy Gravano, a consigliere in the family who himself would one day turn into a government witness. "We've been watching you," Mr. Gravano told him. "This is not a club. This is a secret society. There is one way into this society, the way you come in today, and one way out -- on a slab." Mr. Gravano pricked Mr. DiLeonardo's trigger finger, squeezed the blood onto a crumpled picture of a saint and set the paper on fire in Mr. DiLeonardo's cupped palms. "If I betray the oath of omertà, may my soul burn in hell like this saint," Mr. DiLeonardo recited. That story came in a day of testimony in which the sins of the fathers were visited on the sons by federal prosecutors, who are trying to prove for a second time that Mr. Gotti became acting head of the Gambino family after his father, John J. Gotti, was arrested and jailed in 1990. Lawyers for the younger Mr. Gotti, 42, say that although he idolized his father, he had renounced a life of crime because he had seen how much damage it could do to his family. Michael McGovern, a prosecutor, led Mr. DiLeonardo, the star witness, through testimony that began with his Brooklyn grandfather's role in founding "the Black Hand," a precursor to the Mafia, in the early 1900's, to Mr. DiLeonardo's initiation into loan-sharking for the Gambino family at a tender age in his home neighborhood, Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. It continued through his account of becoming the enforcer for the younger Mr. Gotti. Mr. DiLeonardo has admitted to three murders (in the lingo, he said, a murder is "a piece of work") and is testifying in the hope that he will receive a reduced sentence. He also testified at Mr. Gotti's first trial, which ended in a hung jury. He was to continue testifying today, and has not yet been cross-examined by Mr. Gotti's lawyers. With his center-parted auburn hair and large reading glasses, Mr. DiLeonardo looked more like an accountant than a mobster. But he said he had been born into organized crime, on his father's side. He got the nickname Mikey Scars when he was about 8, he said, after a dog bit him in the face. Joe Colombo, boss of the crime family, happened to be playing cards upstairs at his grandfather's house and gave him a handkerchief to wipe up the blood, he testified. His role at this trial was to paint a picture of John A. Gotti as the personification of the Mafia, one of the last best-known dons of a dying breed. Because this is a racketeering trial, establishing that Mr. Gotti conspired to commit a pattern of crime -- he is accused of loan-sharking, extortion of the construction industry, and the kidnapping of Curtis Sliwa, the radio host and Guardian Angels founder -- is more important than specific events. Mr. DiLeonardo said he had been involved in a conversation at the Carousel Diner in Howard Beach, Queens, in which he said Mr. Gotti ordered Mr. Sliwa to be beaten "as bad as a beating can be without killing him." When Mr. Sliwa was shot in the stomach and leg, Mr. Gotti was upset, Mr. DiLeonardo said, because, "It was a mess." Mr. DiLeonardo said he had participated, on behalf of Mr. Gotti, in the extortion of various construction businesses and of Scores, a strip club. "I call it a mob tax," he said. "The government taxes, we tax. We tax everybody." So much dirty cash was funneled up through the ranks of the Gambino crime family that Mr. Gotti didn't know what to do with it, Mr. DiLeonardo testified. So Mr. DiLeonardo said he and two partners started a company, Metropolitan Stone, to launder the money, and returned checks to Mr. Gotti, which he invested in real estate. Asked by Mr. McGovern whether the company was legitimate, Mr. DiLeonardo, whose testimony often seemed polished to high gloss, replied: "Illegitimate. Anything I touch is illegitimate because I'm in the mob and anything I do facilitates my acts." Scraps of paper found by investigators in a Queens basement were identified by Mr. DiLeonardo as promotion lists for various mob families. There was a ceiling on how many members could be in each of the five or six families, he said, so for somebody to get "straightened out," somebody else has to die. Some of the names were preceded by Mr. and Mrs., but, he testified, women could not be made members. The honorifics, he said, were intended to fool law enforcement agents into thinking the paper was an invitation list. The most sentimental moment during the six hours of testimony came when Mr. DiLeonardo mentioned Kenneth McCabe, a retired police detective who spent years conducting surveillance of the mob. Mr. DiLeonardo seemed to choke up when he called Mr. McCabe particularly tenacious. Mr. McCabe, who was supposed to be a prosecution witness in this trial, died Sunday of cancer.

1146-> Students E-Mail the Oddest Things
To the Editor: While I agree that e-mail is a double-edged sword, there are instances where it can be very helpful. One of my students last semester had oral surgery that left his jaw wired shut for much of the semester. During that time, the class was reading Plato's "Republic," and my silenced student was bursting at the seams to express his reactions to the text. He sent me a long, thoughtful e-mail message, and I encouraged him to continue e-mailing his comments (to which I responded) for as long as he could not open his mouth in class. The resulting e-mail exchange proved very enriching and rewarding for me as a teacher and, I presume, for this young man as a student.

1147-> Is This Rent Legal?
  Robert Sokolski, a Manhattan lawyer who represents tenants, said landlords are required to register the legal regulated rents of rent-stabilized apartments with the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal every year. “To ascertain whether the rent you are paying constitutes an overcharge, you must first review the rental history for your apartment,” Mr. Sokolski said. He said a tenant can obtain a printout of an apartment’s rental history from the appropriate borough office of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. The office for Manhattan apartments on the north side of 110th Street and above is at 163 West 125th Street; the telephone number is (212) 961-8930. The office for apartments south of that is at 25 Beaver Street; the telephone number is (212) 480-6238. “If you go in person,” he wrote in an e-mail message, “be sure to bring proof of identity and proof of occupancy, like a copy of your lease or a rent or utility bill.” It is also possible to obtain the rental history under the Freedom of Information Law. The housing division has its own request form, which you can get from its Web site at dhcr.state.ny.us/index.htm (then search for FOIL-1). Or call the Rent InfoLine at (718) 739-6400. Another piece of information the tenant will need is a list of annual increases allowed by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board. He said, “You can get them on the board’s Web site at www.housingnyc.com/ or by calling (212) 385-2934.” Finally, Mr. Sokolski said, tenants should keep in mind that there is a four-year statute of limitations for an overcharge claim. This means that in most cases, tenants can get refunds for overcharges for only the preceding four years.

1149-> Mozart, Forever Young: 250 and the Hits Keep Coming
Here are some favorite Mozart recordings of the classical music critics of The New York Times. Availability is hard to determine; most of the recordings here can be found online or in major record stores. (An introduction appears on Page 1 of Weekend.) LE NOZZE DI FIGARO Patrizia Ciofi, Véronique Gens, Lorenzo Regazzo, Simon Keenlyside; Concerto Köln, conducted by René Jacobs (Harmonia Mundi France 901818/20; three CD's). REQUIEM Christine Schäfer, Bernarda Fink, Kurt Streit, Gerald Finley; Arnold Schoenberg Choir, Vienna Concentus Musicus, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 82876 58705; CD). SYMPHONIES (41) Mozart Akademie Amsterdam, conducted by Jaap ter Linden (Brilliant Classics 92110; 11 CD's). DIVERTIMENTO IN E FLAT (K. 563) Gidon Kremer, violinist; Kim Kashkashian, violist; Yo-Yo Ma, cellist (Sony Classical 39561; CD). NIGHT MUSIC English Concert, conducted by Andrew Manze (Harmonia Mundi France 907280; CD). "LE NOZZE DI FIGARO" has everything: a comic look at the battle of the sexes with an enduringly subversive political undercurrent. It is also a moving study in the power of forgiveness with magnificently turned arias, brilliant ensembles and a fantastic orchestral score. It's hard to imagine a more perfect opera (except, perhaps, when you're hearing "Die Zauberflöte"), and great recordings are plentiful. But René Jacobs's 2004 account is a high-water mark. Using period instruments and an energetic young cast schooled in historical style, Mr. Jacobs produces a finely nuanced but also viscerally exciting performance, propelled by sharp dynamic contrasts, brisk tempos and singing calibrated to reflect the score's changing emotional currents. Franz Xaver Süssmayr's completion of Mozart's Requiem has been roundly skewered as semicompetent, and though several compelling replacements have been proposed, the Süssmayr version has maintained its hold. Nikolaus Harnoncourt, certainly a discerning Mozartean, uses it -- though with touch-ups by Franz Beyer -- for his vivid 2003 concert recording, and to good effect. The remarkable combination of transparency and heft that Mr. Harnoncourt brings to the score yields an unusually potent performance. As a bonus, Mozart's sometimes sketchy manuscript score for the Introit, Kyrie, Sequence and Offertory are reproduced on a CD-ROM section, which scrolls as the music plays. Not long ago, complete traversals of the Mozart symphonies were rare on disc, mainly because the ones before No. 25 were usually ignored, and only a handful between No. 25 and No. 41 were truly part of the standard canon. Jaap ter Linden, though best known as a Baroque cellist and violist da gamba, leads his Mozart Akademie Amsterdam in shapely, energized performances of the full set, available in a midprice box of 11 CD's. The most familiar symphonies benefit from crisp articulation, lively tempos and masterly period-instrument playing. But the real surprises are the early works, which here bear some of the rhythmic and textural characteristics of Baroque works. It makes sense: Handel was dead only five years when Mozart, still a child, wrote the work now considered his First Symphony. Don't be fooled by the modest title Mozart gave his E flat string trio. Though he called it a Divertimento, which suggests a light entertainment, this 1788 score is really a stealth symphony, packed with substantial ideas ingeniously worked out. Some of it -- the modulations in the fifth-movement Minuet, for example -- stretches in the direction of Beethoven, and throughout the work, the dialogues among the string lines have an inviting intricacy. Gidon Kremer, Kim Kashkashian and Yo-Yo Ma, the ensemble of equals this score demands, play with an eloquence that underscores the music's most sublime qualities without shortchanging its brighter moments. Mozart's lighter side is captured appealingly in a collection by Andrew Manze and the English Concert that includes a zesty, beautifully shaped account of "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" and robust performances of the courtly "Serenata Notturna" and the deliberately crude "Musical Joke." But hidden among them is a glimpse of Mozart's more sober side, caught in the tragic contours of the Adagio and Fugue in C minor.

1157-> Clean Energy Project (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re "2 Industry Leaders Bet on Coal but Split on Cleaner Approach" ("The Energy Challenge" series, front page, May 28): FutureGen is an initiative to build the world's first integrated sequestration and hydrogen production research power plant. Contrary to assertions in your article, the FutureGen project is being pursued aggressively and is on schedule. The $1 billion project will be the cleanest fossil fuel-fired power plant in the world, establishing the technical and economic feasibility of producing electricity and hydrogen from coal, while capturing and permanently storing the carbon dioxide generated in the process. FutureGen has the broad support of major utilities, coal companies and governments throughout the world. It will help the world standardize the technology and protocols for safe, successful and long-term storage of carbon dioxide. FutureGen is an important part of the global solution to our energy challenges. It represents transformational technology that offers a real solution that is within our reach. Jeffrey D.

1158-> By Opening Day, Cablevision May Carry New Met Network
Cablevision is close to an agreement to carry the Mets' new cable network, SportsNet New York, that would allow the channel to be seen throughout the metropolitan region. But Mark Harrad, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, which is a partner with the Mets and Comcast in the network, cautioned that nothing formal had been signed. "Talks are progressing well," he said. "We are optimistic, but there is no deal in place yet." Jim Maiella, a Cablevision spokesman, would not describe the status of the negotiations, but he said officials expected to carry the Mets on opening day and beyond. SNY will start broadcasting March 16 with a Mets spring training game against the Atlanta Braves and will carry the opening-day game against the Washington Nationals on April 3. A deal with Cablevision would add its three million subscribers to the 3.1 million in the area who have been committed by Time Warner and Comcast. SNY is also in talks with the satellite operators DirecTV and Dish Network. The Mets paid Cablevision $54 million to be released from their contract with the MSG Network and Fox Sports New York after last season. Cablevision unsuccessfully sued the Mets for breach of contract and to prevent them from any planning on the new network until November 2005. Like the Mets, the Yankees left Cablevision to start their own channel, the YES Network. Cablevision refused to carry YES in 2002, arguing that it was worth far less than what was being charged. A deal brokered by the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, put YES on Cablevision in 2003, and a long-term contract was required by an arbitration panel. Officials have decided to place SNY at Channel 26 and move Fox Sports New York to Channel 79 on Time Warner's New York City system.

1159-> Looking Back on Iraq
To the Editor: Re "In Iraq, Wrongs Made a Right," by L. Paul Bremer III (Op-Ed, Jan. 13): Mr. Bremer, the former director of the Coalition Provisional Authority, finally admits some mistakes. That's refreshing. But he perpetuates the circular thinking of the administration when he says, "President Bush has correctly identified Iraq as the central front in the war on terrorism, as Osama bin Laden himself acknowledged when he told his followers 'the third world war has begun in Iraq' and that it would 'end there in victory and glory, or misery and humiliation.' " It is the central front in the war on terrorism because of our attack on Iraq. As has been apparent to those "outside the bubble," there are far more dangerous threats from Iran, North Korea and (on a continuing basis) Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda.

1160-> Restoring the Sound
It is commonly supposed that the health of Long Island Sound is chiefly the responsibility of the shoreline communities in Long Island, Westchester County and Connecticut. This is largely true. It is also true, however, that New York City has long been a major contributor to the environmental ills that afflict this noblest of American estuaries. The main reason is four antiquated municipal sewage treatment plants on the East River. Every day of every year, these plants deposit hundreds of thousands of gallons of partly treated wastewater into the river, which then, with tidal certainty, propels it into the Sound itself. The most damaging of the pollutants leaving the plants is nitrogen -- useful as a fertilizer on land but, in sufficient quantities, fatal to bodies of water like the Sound, where it stimulates the growth of bacteria and algae and robs the water of oxygen. This condition is known as hypoxia, and it suffocates marine life. Roughly half the nitrogen comes from treatment plants and other sources in about 80 shoreline communities, the other half comes from the New York City plants. It is thus cause for great celebration that the city agreed last week to settle a longstanding legal action and spend at least $700 million to upgrade these four plants, cutting their nitrogen output by nearly 60 percent by 2017. Audubon New York, a leader among the environmental groups that helped shape the agreement and move it forward when negotiations seemed to falter, called the agreement an historic moment in the long struggle to restore the Sound to good health. In retrospect, the most important moment in that struggle -- the moment from which all else has flowed, including last week's agreement-- came in 1994, when New York and Connecticut, after sustained pressure from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, approved a comprehensive plan to clean up the Sound. The city's main responsibility was to modernize its sewage treatment plants. The Giuliani administration left the bulk of the task to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Alarmed by the project's estimated $1.3 billion price tag, Mr. Bloomberg dispatched Christopher Ward, then the environmental commissioner, to find new, more cost-efficient waste treatment technologies. In due course, Mr. Ward and his counterpart in Albany, Erin Crotty, reached an agreement in principle to retrofit the plants at well under the original cost. After Mr. Ward and Ms. Crotty left public service, after further haggling aimed partly at ensuring that future city administrations could not wiggle out of the deal, and after further prodding by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, their successors, Emily Lloyd and Denise Sheehan, concluded the deal. This does not mean the Sound is no longer at risk. Far from it. Though still rich in marine and bird life, the Sound passes through the densest population corridor in the country, and will remain forever stressed by the 20 million people who live within 50 miles of its shores. Thus the shoreline communities in Long Island, Westchester and Connecticut must do more than ever to contain pollution (Connecticut in particular has made substantial investments in waste-treatment facilities.) So must the federal government, which remains a very important player. With President Bush's support, Congress recently authorized $40 million annually for various clean water projects under the Long Island Sound Restoration Act. But the Sound's many friends in the New York Congressional delegation must make sure that the money is actually appropriated.

1161-> For Education-Obsessed Parents, a New Disney Magazine
The Walt Disney Company, through its Disney Worldwide Publishing division, will join the crowded but profitable parenting magazine category next month. Wondertime, Disney's first new magazine since 1991, is aimed at education-obsessed parents of the very young. "The magazine is for parents, and more specifically moms, of children from birth to age 6," said Alexandra Kennedy, the vice president and editorial director of the United States consumer magazine group at Disney, which also publishes FamilyFun and Disney Adventures. In 2005, the publishing unit sold Discover magazine to Bob Guccione Jr. and shut down Disney magazine, which offered an inside look at Disney resorts, projects and history. The idea for Wondertime started with Ms. Kennedy. "We want to help moms understand how children are learning and growing," she said. She added that unlike most parenting magazines, which help women with their new roles as mothers, Wondertime will help them support their children's learning. The first issue will include articles on what babies know within hours of birth, like how to mimic a parent sticking out his or her tongue; how children understand concepts of time like duration, clocks and tomorrow; and what preschool teachers can teach mothers about instilling virtues such as kindness. If a company is going to start a new magazine, the parenting category is the place to do it: publications, which include American Baby, Babytalk, Child, Parenting and Parents, had an increase in advertising pages in 2005. Across the category, pages were up 5.7 percent over 2004. Wondertime is the second new magazine in the category in six months; Cookie, a style magazine aimed at wealthy parents, started last fall. Glenn Rosenbloom, senior vice president and group publisher for Disney's magazine group, said that Wondertime was aimed at better-educated mothers, and that "with education, you'd typically expect a mom with a better-than-average income." Most parenting magazines are anchored by "how-to" stories about nutritious lunches, creative art projects and making harried trips to the store efficient and entertaining. Wondertime's version of this type of service story will be how parents can play games with their children in the supermarket: concepts like sorting and math can be taught with apples and oranges in the produce section, and color names can be pointed out while perusing the yogurts. Ms. Kennedy said that mothers are tired of hearing things like "wait until they're teenagers" and want positive messages about parenting. Focus-group participants, she said, saw "raising children as an exciting time, when moms are discovering things along with their child." Wondertime is starting with the full marketing power of Disney behind it. The first issue features advertisers like Hasbro, which is running two multipage ads, as well as Kimberly Clark, Johnson & Johnson and Quaker Oats. The Baby Einstein Company, which makes educational videos, toys and books, is a sister company of Disney Worldwide Publishing, and Mr. Rosenbloom sees opportunities for cross-promotions like fliers tucked into DVD's. Lynn Wegner, a psychologist who heads the developmental and behavioral section of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that the magazine seemed to be tapping into a psychological need. "People are extraordinarily interested in their children's learning," she said. "Parents see their children as extensions of themselves, and if their children do well it reflects well on them."

1162-> BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; SETBACK FOR KAZ MATSUI
The Mets' Kazuo Matsui enlisted a private coach during the off-season to help him limit the injuries that have dominated his two disappointing seasons. No exercise could have prevented the knee injury Matsui sustained during the first inning of last night's 6-5 victory over Atlanta in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Matsui sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee while sliding awkwardly into second base. Matsui said he will have a magnetic resonance imaging exam today. "It's got to be a setback," Matsui said through an interpreter. "Like I said, I just want to get back on the field as soon as I can." Matsui has gone 8 for 30 since beginning the spring 0 for 9.

1163-> IN BRIEF: SHELTER ISLAND; Resolution Sought To Acquire Wetlands
Steve Levy, the Suffolk County executive, introduced a resolution last Monday to authorize the purchase of a six-acre parcel of land on Shelter Island that contains forested land and tidal and freshwater wetlands. The $925,000 purchase price would be split with Shelter Island. The land, whose acquisition is expected to be completed in the next couple of months, is important because it connects to Fresh Pond and Dickerson Creek and ultimately flows into the Peconic Bay, Mr. Levy said. Al Kilb, the Shelter Island supervisor, said in a statement that the land, known as the Sposato property, is environmentally sensitive and has 500 feet of frontage on Fresh Pond. STEWART AIN

A half-mile traffic jam behind a stalled car every now and then is understandable. A half-mile traffic jam behind a high school every single morning at 7:33 is ludicrous. Absurd. Hard to believe -- except for those who suffer through it every day in Shrub Oak, as Carin Rubenstein explained in this section last week. She described a phenomenon that has been growing more severe in Westchester and around the country: morning and afternoon gridlock around schools caused by ever-increasing numbers of parents chauffeuring their children to class. This is a particular problem in older suburbs, where street layouts reflect that cold, cruel bygone era when children were expected to walk, ride their bicycles or take the bus to school. Those heartless days have passed, it seems. The school bus is now perceived as inconvenient and lacking in cachet, so everyone piles into the car for the bumper-to-bumper crawl to school. Once the warmhearted mothers and fathers arrive, they turn heedless and rude. They create havoc by defying signs, double- and triple-parking, making illegal turns and generally getting in the way. Principals send memos, enact traffic plans and practically beg for parental cooperation, but still the hordes descend. In front of at least one school, custodians have been pressed into service as traffic cops. People have thrown up their hands. They shouldn't. It's ridiculous that a straightforward traffic-management problem that occurs at the same time every day, with the same people breaking the same rules, should somehow defy solution. This is a region, after all, with well-equipped, highly trained police officers who earn good salaries. Parents should get their children on the bus. Schools should enact strict procedures on parking and traffic flow. And until the rules sink in, police officers should be waiting, ready to turn each encounter with a scofflaw parent into a teachable moment.

1165-> Weld Suffers Two Setbacks to Candidacy in One Day
ALBANY, Feb. 21 - William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, suffered a pair of significant setbacks on Tuesday in his campaign to become the next governor of New York. On the legal front, a federal prosecutor said Mr. Weld had not been ruled out as a target in the investigation of student loan fraud at Decker College, a bankrupt Kentucky trade school at which Mr. Weld served as chief executive for 10 months until October of last year. The disclosure, first reported by The Phoenix, a weekly paper in Boston, appears to contradict what Mr. Weld has said in the past. On the political front, Michael R. Long, the chairman of the state Conservative Party, endorsed one of Mr. Weld's Republican rivals, former Assemblyman John Faso, in a letter to Conservative Party leaders. The endorsement is likely to make it more difficult for Mr. Weld to win the Conservative endorsement, which is considered important for Republicans running for statewide office. The developments could hurt the the candidacy of Mr. Weld, the favored choice of many, though not all, Republican Party leaders. Polls show him far behind the leading Democratic candidate, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. The scandal at Decker College has been difficult for Mr. Weld to shake. The school collapsed into bankruptcy weeks after he left his post as chief executive, and it is now the subject of a federal investigation into financial aid fraud. In response to questions from reporters outside a Republican Party meeting in December, Mr. Weld said he was not a target of the investigation. One reporter asked: "Have you asked the prosecutors whether or not you're a target in the investigation?" "Yeah," Mr. Weld said. "No, this has nothing to do with me." He was asked again: "You have asked the prosecutors?" "Yes," he answered. "And you're not?" a reporter asked. "Right," he replied. But Marisa Ford, the chief of the criminal division of the United States attorney's office in Louisville, said in an interview on Tuesday that "nobody in my office, in the western district of Kentucky, has had conversations with him about whether or not he was a target." "The investigation is in such early stages that it's premature to even try to make target designations," she added. In an interview on Tuesday, Mr. Weld said he was told by one of his lawyers at Frost Brown Todd, a law firm with an office in Louisville, that someone in the federal prosecutors' office had told a lawyer at the firm that Mr. Weld was not a target. "Maybe what they meant was not a target at that time, because somebody's status can always change in any direction," Mr. Weld said. Mr. Long's endorsement of Mr. Faso could also cause trouble for Mr. Weld, a moderate Republican, though it does not represent the backing of the whole party. In his letter to party leaders, Mr. Long said Mr. Faso "displayed the courage to fight for conservative issues." "He is pro-life and says so," the letter said. "He is committed to protecting marriage. He has the command of the intricacies of the budget to find and cut the waste." Mr. Faso, Mr. Weld and the two other Republican gubernatorial candidates -- Randy A. Daniels, a former New York secretary of state, and Assemblyman Pat Manning -- all courted party leaders at a Conservative Party gathering earlier this month. "Long is a big deal," said Mr. Weld, but added that he had been assured by Mr. Long he could still pursue the party's endorsement. "We're still pushing for that, and it comes a vote at a time." Mr. Faso said Mr. Long's support was "very important," adding, "there has not been any Republican elected to statewide office in New York without the support of the Conservative Party since 1974."

1166-> SEAL HUNTS AND TOURISM
To the Editor: "Urging Americans to Look North, Beyond the Border Hassles" (Practical Traveler, Feb. 26) focuses on the fact that Canada is concerned about the drop in tourism coming from the United States, and is taking steps to "lure more Yanks across the border." One reason for this decrease in tourism is almost certainly the annual Canadian seal hunt, which is about to begin in several weeks. Over 300,000 baby seals will most likely be clubbed and shot to death on the ice floes off Canada's east coast for their fur. The hunt is conducted by commercial fishermen who earn only a small fraction of their incomes from killing seals. The Humane Society of the United States is working to end this slaughter and has asked its nine million members and constituents, as well as the public at large, to avoid seafood from Canada and to think twice about traveling there until the hunt is ended for good. Over 220,000 people have signed pledges to boycott seafood from Canada, and many Humane Society members said they would not travel to Canada as long as the slaughter continues. Canada wants to spend an additional $100 million a year to promote tourism. The value of the seal hunt is only $16 million. It would make better financial and moral sense for Canada to spend some of that $100 million to retire the existing sealing licenses, allowing the seals, and tourism, to prosper once again.

1168-> Looking Back on Iraq
To the Editor: Whatever the accuracy of L. Paul Bremer III's response to the outcry about his book, his account is characterized by a humility largely unknown in the Bush administration. In discussing some of the mistakes he made in governing post-invasion Iraq, Mr. Bremer stands in stark contrast to his former boss. By his own accounting, President Bush made no mistakes at all during his first term. Pierre E. Biscaye Westwood, N.J., Jan. 13, 2006

1169-> 'Plastic Disasters,' a Documentary on Cosmetic Surgery, Has Its Premiere on HBO
Cosmetic surgery is fast becoming the new national pastime. Viewers are devoted to reality programs like the Discovery Health Channel's "Plastic Surgery: Before & After" and E! Entertainment Television's "Dr. 90210." They set their TiVos to capture the drama "Nip/Tuck." They pass around articles from Allure and Vogue and discuss the latest procedures touted on the "Today" show. And they trade gossip about star doctors. But like other body obsessions — fitness, dieting or tanning, for example — cosmetic procedures can sometimes cause extreme harm. That is the subject of "Plastic Disasters," an hourlong documentary on plastic surgery patients that has its premiere tonight at 10 p.m. on HBO. The film, directed and produced by David Heilbroner and Kate Davis, who won an Emmy Award for her 2004 HBO documentary "Jockey," positions itself as the antidote to television shows like "Extreme Makeover" and "The Swan." Those reality programs, both now defunct, promoted plastic surgeons as fairy godmothers, transforming patients (after hours on the operating table and months of recovery time) from frumpy Cinderellas to plasticized clones of Pamela Anderson. "Plastic Disasters" takes the opposite point of view, that plastic surgery is not a welcome boost to self-esteem. The show posits cosmetic surgery as an agent of total ruination, leaving its victims scarred, both physically and emotionally. The documentary is gruesomely compelling, complete with shots of gore and gangrene. It focuses on three patients who have had bad experiences: Mona, who had a botched liposuction; Tony, who undergoes a series of operations to correct a faulty nose job; and Lucille, who, after a nose job and two face lifts, is obsessed with her appearance. Each is presented as a plastic surgery victim possessed of a heroic survival story. And that is what the filmmakers boil it down to: superficial survival tales, devoid of the most basic biographical details, including the patients' last names, locations, ages and professions. Physically, the most horribly scarred is Mona, who had been an avid bowler. After seeing television advertisements for a local cosmetic surgery center, she underwent liposuction. But her intestines were perforated during the procedure, she says, and she was hospitalized with a massive infection in her abdomen. That was just the start of her troubles. After operations to repair her intestines, she developed bedsores — most likely because she is a diabetic with poor blood circulation — that left her with huge scars. Then veins in one foot collapsed and gangrene set in. Doctors amputated one of her legs above the knee, then the other. The camera follows Mona as she adjusts to life as an amputee, hoisting herself in and out of her bathtub, reaching for groceries located on tall shelves and maneuvering herself from car seat to wheelchair. (According to the film, she settled a malpractice suit against the center where she had surgery.) "I was told that this was such a simple procedure. No downtime," Mona says. "I never recovered and never will." Lucille, another of the documentary's victims, says she believes her facelifts have made breathing and swallowing difficult, and offers a similar sentiment. "I never wanted cosmetic surgery," she says. "In hindsight, it was the biggest mistake I ever made in my life." And that is the documentary's real theme, that cosmetic surgery is bad — an anti-vanity message straight out of the Old Testament, or at least rooted in the fable of Narcissus. It is a simplistic, anti-betterment view told through maudlin tales of malpractice, with little medical context for balance. But there is no gotcha here. No doctor is ambushed leaving a medical complex, or forced to dodge microphones and cameras. In fact, the documentary never interviews or even really describes the doctors who are the real villains of these tales. Viewers will be left wondering why these events occurred. Why would surgeons risk operations on a diabetic like Mona or on an emotionally overwrought character like Lucille, who clearly has body issues? Were these patients originally operated on by experienced plastic surgeons, inexperienced gynecologists or emergency room physicians? Were they physicians in good standing, or were they doctors with long malpractice records who had been disciplined by their state medical boards? The filmmakers don't tell us. The medical omissions are particularly frustrating in the case of Mona Alley (we discover her last name because the camera momentarily pans across one of her bowling trophies). According to interviews she gave to The Boca Raton News and U.S. News & World Report, Ms. Alley had liposuction at the Florida Center for Cosmetic Surgery in Fort Lauderdale. At least two patients died soon after having surgery there; the clinic settled 18 lawsuits with patients who claimed their operations were botched, according to The South Florida Sun-Sentinel. The center could have provided the filmmakers with a perfect case study on how the facility, abetted by lax state oversight, developed such a controversial reputation. But the film never asks why the Florida Department of Health and its Board of Medicine were slow to discipline some of the doctors from the center. Not one state or federal health official or representative from a medical association appears in the film. "Plastic Disasters" concludes with a caution that reads: "Over 9,000,000 cosmetic surgeries are performed each year in the United States. The total number of complications is not a matter of public record." But according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, an association of about 5,000 board-certified doctors, Americans had about 1.8 million cosmetic surgical procedures last year. And while it is true that no single national agency collects statistics on every problem caused by plastic surgery, researchers do publish data on complications. The filmmakers could easily have found a provocative number, for example, in a recent article in "Clinics of Plastic Surgery," which put the death rate from liposuction at one in 5,000 procedures. Still, the documentary is as gripping as any horror movie, and it offers a powerful counter to the sensational reality-television world of augmented physiques. "Plastic Disasters" makes clear that cosmetic surgery can change lives. But not always in the way that viewers of "The Swan" might expect.

1170-> For Dogs Behaving Badly, a Chance to Be Themselves
Go ahead, indulge in feeble wordplay if you want -- "Reality television goes to the dogs!" -- but you'll be guilty of misleading punning. Because "Underdogs," an installment of the PBS series "Nature" tomorrow night, is actually a vast improvement on most human-centered reality shows. This sweet, simple program follows Herbie and Holly, dogs with serious behavioral problems, as trainers take one last shot at making them bearable. Holly, a bloodhound, is "a misfit with little hope of finding another home," Henry Winkler, the narrator, says in his voiceover; she has already had six in her one year of life. And Herbie, a 3-year-old bearded collie, has a problem with sheep: he attacks them, Mr. Winkler says, and "he's been lucky to escape a farmer's bullet." As pets, they're both failures. The dogs, the program explains, are victims of their own genes: bloodhounds are built for tracking, and bearded collies were herders of sheep before border collies became more popular for that task. Could their juvenile delinquency be a result of the stifling of their primal natures? "Underdogs" finds out by pairing Holly with Larry Allen, an experienced bloodhound trainer in West Virginia, and Herbie with Barbara Sykes, a sheepdog trainer with a working farm in England. The program puts them on a clock, reality-television style: can the animals be reformed in 12 weeks? The genes may be there, but the trainers quickly discover complications with each dog. Holly, for instance, is inexplicably terrified of loud noises, a problem if she is going to be used for hunting or police work, because of the likelihood of gunfire. The contrasts between the two trainers make the program doubly interesting. Ms. Sykes is the more amusing: as previous tele-trainers have shown, there's nothing like a British accent to make doggie discipline fun. ("That's not good," she says when Herbie chomps down on a head-size ball early in his training. "That tells me straight away how naughty he could be with sheep.") If this were a human reality-television show, the goings-on would be stretched out over a season, far too long to sustain interest, but here they are condensed into an appealing hour. For the trainers, the barometer of success is whether the dogs can be sent along to new, more productive lives. Without giving too much away, there is a parting at the program's end that is painfully beautiful to watch. It puts those made-for-TV farewells at the end of episodes of shows like "Supernanny" to shame. Underdogs PBS, tomorrow night at 8 Eastern time; check local listings. Fred Kaufman, executive producer; Aidan Woodward, producer. Filmed, directed and produced by Karen Walsh. Narrated by Henry Winkler. Produced by Tigress Productions Limited and Thirteen/WNET New York in association with the British Broadcasting Corporation.

1173-> Pacific Pagans
On a sunny afternoon in 1871, in a palm-thatched hut on the island of Nukapu, the first bishop of Melanesia, John Coleridge Patteson, was clobbered to death by islanders he’d been trying to convert. He died with a smile on his face. Or so the story goes. The murder turned Patteson into a Christian martyr, and more than a century later inspired the quest recounted in this informed new South Seas memoir by Charles Montgomery. The book begins in Huck Finn fashion: as a 10-year-old Canadian farm boy, Montgomery digs around in his deceased father’s belongings and finds the yellowed pages of “The Light of Melanesia,” the century-old writings of his great-grandfather, the Rt. Rev. Henry Hutchinson Montgomery. Inspired by the Patteson legend, he had left his comfortable post as bishop of Tasmania and embarked on a mission to convert the inhabitants of the hundreds of islands in the Melanesian archipelago, which stretches from Fiji to New Guinea. Twenty years later and now an accomplished travel journalist, Charles Montgomery returns to those pages and begins to wonder about the war of religion his great-grandfather had waged with the 19th-century islanders. Who had won the battle for their hearts and souls? What had become of this archipelago? Montgomery sets off for the South Pacific islands, among them Efate, Tanna, Mota, Vanua Lava, and, ultimately, his grail, Nukapu — “where old Melanesia had made its last stand” against the evangelizing Christians. Despite himself, he entertains romantic notions of an unspoiled mystical place where “gospel and empire had never taken hold.” But those ideas soon start to crumble. Yes, there are white beaches, swollen coconuts for the taking and fascinatingly complex social structures, but there are also plenty of odd cults, half-working machine guns and black magic. There are economies in shambles, and the place seems awash in kava, a local intoxicant. While some Melanesians credit the introduction of Christianity with improving life on the islands, there is a sad laundry list of devastations the white missionaries inflicted, while the sandalwood traders who preceded them imported guns, disease and a new slave trade. Montgomery, never a shill for the church of his ancestors, condemns the Christian colonizers and is hellbent on exploring the local magic. He wants proof of the mysticism the missionaries swore to defeat. For the first half of the book he bungles along, looking in all the wrong places. On his first stop he enters a duel of oversimplification with a local woman. “I’m looking for heathens,” he tells her. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she responds. “This is a Christian island.” But it’s not, quite. Traditional Melanesian beliefs were (and still are, despite widespread Christianity) at odds with the missionary plan. The Melanesians are guided by two concepts: “kastom” and “mana.” “Kastom” is “Melanesian history, religion, ritual and magic, but it also refers to traditional systems of economics, social organization, politics and medicine,” Montgomery writes. “Mana” is “an invisible force that flowed through the atmosphere of life, through objects, people and actions.” Montgomery grapples with the Christian-pagan collision, which he sees by turns as a “train wreck of faiths,” a “psychospiritual Disneyland” or “spiritual acrobatics.” His gaze soon begins to shift from the differences between Christianity and the islands’ religious beliefs to their similarities, most important, their shared belief in miracles. Here, the journalist begins to give way and Montgomery, somewhat unwittingly, abandons his rationalist quest and joins the brotherhood of spiritual adventurers. He admits to envying the believers, both missionary and heathen. “I was drawn by the notion that perhaps they were on the right track when they knew that the world was more than a collection of serendipitously bonded atoms and spinning electrons,” he writes, “more than a series of accidents, collisions, explosions and diffusions bubbling endlessly in an insignificant corner of an otherwise empty cosmos.” Montgomery wants to believe in something without getting suckered, but first he has to develop his spiritual chops. A hallucinatory bout with malaria and a lucky invocation of a tropical storm begin to soften the cynic. But the real turning point comes when he’s underwater. While swimming with a man renowned for conjuring up the Shark God, Montgomery sees a peculiar sharklike shadow, an image he makes a conscious decision to believe is supernatural. “I would believe, and it would be true because I believed,” he writes. As both traveler and writer, Montgomery is a thoughtful and entertaining guide, and his story has rich layers of history and anthropology. He creates a vivid impression of a region where you might just as easily be greeted with a machete as a steaming pile of laplap (a root vegetable pudding baked and served in coconut leaves). Still, at times I wished there was a tad more introspection. For a memoir, “The Shark God” is remarkably outward-looking. In the book’s dramatic consummation, Montgomery takes his place in island mythology when he helps create the legend of a holy man he had befriended during his time in the islands, whose murder and subsequent martyrdom change the region’s political tide. From the old tale of Bishop Patteson’s demise to the latest headlines from the region’s bloody unrest, “The Shark God” is an embrace of myth-making — religious, secular and political. “Myth, like love, is a decision,” Montgomery writes. “What it answers is longing. What it demands is faith. What it opens is possibility.”

1174-> Fiction Chronicle
THE SUITORS. By Ben Ehrenreich. (Counterpoint, $23.) "The Odyssey" is one ransacked piece of literature, used for re-interpretation, reinvention, inspiration or simply as a backdrop by everyone from Joyce to Godard, Charles Frazier to the Coen brothers, Margaret Atwood to Theo Angelopoulos. This hasn't stopped Ehrenreich, in his first novel, from taking his own precocious turn. His rendition centers mainly around Penny, with her fetching green eyes. She was born before telephones and the Internet in "the immeasurable past," and before the urchins who try to woo her when Payne, her Odysseus, goes off to a vague, cataclysmic battle. But, says the sly narrator, "someone else may see fit to one day relay the full story of those oafish misadventures." While Penny writes Payne letters, chain-smokes, raises their son and keeps her suitors at bay in a fortified compound, complete with a full cache of weaponry, from the gothic to a Black Hawk helicopter, we don't see much of Payne, except poolside, enjoying a refreshing gin and quinine. Penny, as ever, is conflicted, and her grip on the encampment, which has become decadent and hedonistic, loosens. It's a nameless, faceless, grotesque setting somewhere in a North America that, if it weren't for references to laptop bags, cellphone transmission towers and maxed-out credit cards, could be antiquity, the Middle Ages or the future. There are allusions to "teenaged suicide bombers" and "a counterterrorism-covert-op brigade," but this isn't allegory, exactly. It's a fantastic hodgepodge. At times it's smart and postmodern in a puckish, Calvino-like sense. At other times, it's just pretentious and smarter-than-thou, and entitled and smug in a McSweeney's sense -- there are three titles for each chapter, for instance, and one chapter is numbered 12*. One thing's certain: Ehrenreich writes with an ease and pure line-by-line skill that's rare. This ultimately bails him out. THE MINISTRY OF PAIN. By Dubravka Ugresic. Translated by Michael Henry Heim. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $22.95.) While the political fallout from the disintegration of Yugoslavia remains in the news -- the death of Milosevic, the 10-year anniversary of Srebrenica, the hunt for Mladic and Karadzic -- what of the human consequences, of the seemingly humdrum rubble of the personal? This is where the novelist or memoirist is essential, and it's where Ugresic, the author of eight previous books who's taught Slavic literature in the Netherlands, steps in with her soulful, often searing novel of deracinated Croats, Serbs and Bosnians. Her protagonist is Tanja Lucic, an exiled Croatian writer who teaches Slavic lit. The backdrop is a guilt-ridden Amsterdam -- pre-euro, two years after Dayton -- where she and her students are all exiled, perhaps fittingly, below sea level, a place where Lucic is mistaken for a prostitute. The writing, in this translation, anyway, can be uneven. It's hokey (one character says, apparently without irony: "A penny for your thoughts"), and in some places the dialogue reads like a screenplay for a sweet art-house film (forget "Good Bye Lenin"; call this "Good Bye Tito"). Then there's the occasional, convenient stagy scene, like one on a plane with Lucic and a fellow Croat; they schematically delineate the state of their nation, young in sovereign years, ancient in sensibility. This is all countered, however, by paragraph after startling paragraph of heightened, philosophical musings. "There is no such thing as mercy, no such thing as compassion; there is only forgetting; there is only humiliation and the pain of endless memory. That is the lesson we brought with us from the country we came from, and it is a lesson we have not forgotten." Lucic knows her people, and hates them -- but loves them more. Which is why the narrator and, one senses, the author, is heartbroken. This is a work that comes from the gut, one that deserves to be read. VISIGOTH: Stories. By Gary Amdahl. (Milkweed, paper, $15.95.) Violence -- real and imagined, implied and impending -- breaks out in fits and starts in this rigorous debut collection. Amdahl considers, often in high style, the sometimes diabolical nature of men, a big theme and done to death, sure, but rarely in such off-kilter tones. The precedents are discreetly cited here -- Arthur Miller, Barry Hannah, David Rabe and Tim O'Brien, a fellow Minnesotan -- but Amdahl's voice is his own. Early Richard Ford would seem to be an influence, too. (The title story begins: "I am a hockey player.") His prose is dense and has a refreshing, un-M.F.A.-program tone, though someone should warn him about overusing the em dash, particularly within the same sentence. These stories lovingly, if that's the word in such brutal psychological terrain, evoke the Upper Midwest, especially Minnesota, with winks to its greatest figures: Humbert H. Humphrey, Paul Wellstone, Jim Kaat -- and, hey, is that an allusion to Alan Page? If "Visigoth" tries too hard to be literary with a capital L, it remains a serious, demanding collection. THE MERCY ROOM. By Gilles Rozier. Translated by Anthea Bell. (Little, Brown, $22.95.) Rozier, the director of the Center for Yiddish Culture in Paris and author of two previous novels, is a natural storyteller. This new novel, his first to be translated into English, begins: "If you want me to tell you the story, put some Schumann on; the music will bring my memories back. . . . I'll dim the light. Let the tea steep for a few minutes, would you? I like a drop of milk in it, Chinese tea. This is my grandmother's teapot." The narrator understands the fine points of the German language and its literature and describes life in occupied France. But there's a conceit to this novel: We don't know if this narrator is male or female, if the furtive relationship -- centered on books, poems, Yiddish and vigorous sex -- that develops with a young, handsome Jew is hetero or homosexual. While it may be fun for book clubs to try to decipher the clues of the narrator's identity, this device that shows little faith in the story itself, which is simple but complex, with themes well worth exploration: heroism and cowardice, domination and submission, war and comeuppance, sexual needs versus sexual wants. What's best is contemplating the narrator's motives, her (or his) ambivalence about -- or, scarier, indifference to -- the whirling horrors. The obfuscation only undermines it. THE MEMORY ARTISTS. By Jeffrey Moore. (St. Martin's Griffin, paper, $13.95.) If hypermnesia and synesthesia sound like an inscrutable subject for a work of fiction, fear not. It's a clever way for this Canadian novelist to take a fresh look at two familiar themes: memory and identity. The former term means near-perfect memory, the latter is when sounds, letters or numbers are translated into bursts of color. Noel Burun suffers from (or is blessed with) both. Nabokov and other geniuses have had synesthesia, in varying degrees. For Noel, who was accepted to M.I.T. and who may be a descendant of Lord Byron, synesthesia leaves him out-of-it -- it is "like nodding off on heroin" -- and a social misfit. Yet "he doesn't forget a . . . thing. He's like Proust, like Proust squared." At the same time, his mother is in the early stages of Alzheimer's; she's losing her memory and her very self. Noel believes there's nothing inevitable about his mother's condition and declares, "with my memory, I'll restore hers . . . I will save her." And so he sets out, with the help of a band of new friends, each escaping a previous identity, to do just that. The characters are well meaning, generous and sweet -- even, in his own way, the brilliant, misanthropic (and hilarious) ladies' man, Norval, described as a "sexistentialist." Among his many bilious aphorisms: "Sweeping statements are the only kind worth listening to. Balanced opinions are for bores and third-rate minds." This is a rich novel, erudite and funny, as much about brain chemistry, the wellness industry and poetry as it is about memory. Rich, but some parts feel too much like a situation comedy, and there are too many gimmicks -- different fonts, illustrations, news clippings, footnotes. Yet "The Memory Artists" is a pleasure to read; it's strangely uplifting to spend time with these flawed but humane characters. Michael J. Agovino is a writer and editor living in New York and Zurich. He is at work on a book about the Bronx in the 1970's and 80's. Correction: June 4, 2006, Sunday A picture caption on May 14 about "Andy Warhol 'Giant' Size," a visual biography from Phaidon Press, omitted the credit.

1175-> For DuPont and BP, the Storms Haven't Blown Over
HURRICANE season came to an official end more than a month ago, but it is continuing to take a toll -- and for longer than expected -- on the finances of chemical and oil companies. DuPont and BP warned yesterday that operational disruptions caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita would hurt their fourth-quarter results. The hurricanes, which were the most damaging of the 27 named storms last year, hit the Gulf Coast in late August and September. Physical damage and flooding were intense in some parts of the region, which has a large concentration of energy and petrochemical plants. The biggest challenges were logistical -- downed power lines, natural gas shortages and the slow return of workers -- and were concentrated in the early part of the fourth quarter, said Ben Dell, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Most Gulf Coast chemical plants and refineries are back to full operations. He cautioned, however, that the hurricanes could become a catch-all excuse used by companies reporting profit shortfalls during this earnings season. "Everyone who is going to miss the consensus number is going to throw out the hurricane as an excuse," he said, referring to the analyst earnings estimates used by Wall Street to grade the performances of companies in any given quarter. In DuPont's case, executives said they were "overly aggressive" in previous predictions about how quickly the company would be able to completely restore the 14 plants it was forced to close in the Gulf of Mexico. Based on preliminary figures, the company said those disruptions, along with rising raw materials prices and operational problems at three other factories unaffected by the storms, would lower DuPont's quarterly profits to about 10 cents a share, from a forecast of 20 cents to 25 cents a share made in October. DuPont missed analysts' earnings expectations in the first two quarters of 2005, but came in above Wall Street's forecast in the third quarter after excluding one-time charges. "We underestimated the effect Katrina and Rita would have on our business in the fourth quarter," Charles O. Holliday Jr., the chairman and chief executive of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, told Wall Street analysts in a conference call yesterday. "I have worked for DuPont for over 40 years, and the fourth quarter of 2005 was one of the most unusual quarters in my history with the company." Mr. Holliday repeatedly said he was "extremely disappointed" by DuPont's performance, saying at the outset of the call that the company should have done better. "While a significant number of factors leading to yesterday's announcement were caused by events beyond our control, an equal amount could have been prevented, and we should have prevented them," he said. Shares of DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., fell $1.41, to $41.14. At BP, storm damage limited how much oil and gas it could pump from the Gulf of Mexico, shut a huge refinery in Texas and hurt its ability to supply fuel to retail outlets and other customers. The company estimates it lost $900 million in profits for the quarter at its Texas City refinery, after losing $500 million in profits in the third quarter. The company will also face $130 million in additional costs, most of that to repair damaged offshore platforms and rigs. In the quarter, BP's oil and gas production in the gulf declined by 160,000 barrels; production fell by 135,000 barrels in the third quarter. The company's total worldwide production was down about 2 percent. A BP spokesman could not say when the company would restart its refinery in Texas City, near Houston, which can process up to 460,000 barrels of oil a day and was closed as Hurricane Katrina approached. The company has used the last several months to repair damage the refinery suffered in a large explosion last March that killed 15 workers and wounded 170 employees. "Once it was down, it is quite difficult to bring these refiners back up again," said Toby Odone, a BP spokesman in London, where the company is based. "The decision was made that while it is down, let's bring it back up safely and soundly." To put the forgone profits and production into context, BP and other oil companies have been reporting soaring profits because the price of oil, gasoline and other fuels jumped to new heights in the aftermath of the hurricanes. BP posted a 34 percent increase in third-quarter profits, to $6.46 billion. In its statement, the company estimated that its full-year 2005 refining profits would be about $1.1 billion higher than in 2004 because of higher prices and that the rise in crude oil prices would add another $500 million. In a move the company said was unrelated to the hurricanes, Mr. Odone said BP would cut 1,000 jobs in Europe to reduce costs. BP is also taking a $1.3 billion charge in the fourth quarter to account for the difference between the rise in the spot price for natural gas and the lower prices it had agreed to sell the commodity for in Britain. American depository receipts of BP fell 28 cents, to $67.90. DuPont will announce fourth-quarter results on Jan. 24, and BP will report on Feb. 7.

1176-> WORTH NOTING; Burying the Hatchet, If Only for a Day
All was comity and light on the day of the State of the State address as putative congressional rivals -- Rob Andrews, Frank Pallone and Robert Menendez -- paid their respects to the departing governor, Richard J. Codey. The three Democrats, sitting in the front row of Assembly chamber gallery for Mr. Codey's parting speech, had been in competition to serve the remainder of Jon S. Corzine's Senate term until Mr. Menendez finally edged out the other two men. Although the question of a possible primary challenge ahead of next year's election for a full Senate term was never settled, neither of Mr. Menendez's potential opponents seemed inclined to upstage the occasion by discussing their intentions. Mr. Andrews said that he had not made any decision on the matter. And Mr. Pallone, who has also left open the possibility of seeking the Democratic nomination -- perhaps depending on what Mr. Andrews decides to do -- had little to add. "I'm still weighing my options," he said. JOSH BENSON WORTH NOTING Correction: January 15, 2006, Sunday A report today in the Worth Noting column on Page 3 of the New Jersey section about potential rivals in the Democratic primary for United States Senate includes an outdated reference to Representative Robert Andrews, who said, "I'm still weighing my options."

A church closed because of a reconfiguration of parishes in the Archdiocese of Boston has been sold to a community group, officials said. The church, Our Lady of the Presentation Parish, in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, was closed in June 2005. The archdiocese locked the doors to the church’s school the night before kindergarten graduation, angering parishioners. Former parishioners formed a nonprofit organization that raised $1 million and brokered a deal to buy the property for much less than market value. It needs renovations and will become an educational center. Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley said the archdiocese regretted the situation in 2005.

1179-> QUICK BITE/Mamaroneck; Pssst. Caviar? Over Here.
There are few better ways to make holiday entertaining more festive than to serve caviar, on tray or at table. For many purists only fine Russian beluga or osetra packs a true caviar rush --the gentle pop of the eggs against the palate and the distinct buttery texture and unique aroma they release. At present, that particular sensory experience may remain only a memory. The legal harvest from the Caspian Sea's depleted stock of sturgeon is in short supply and expensive. The cheaper alternative, domestic caviar, though not yet a dead ringer for the genuine article, is being refined in quality and quantity with every harvest. To get what you pay for, deal with a knowledgeable purveyor. Patrick Portier, with his wife, Sandra, has for almost 20 years run Portier Fine Foods, supplier of caviar as well as other luxury items, like salmon (all fresh, house-smoked and hand-sliced), truffles, pâtes, fin and shellfish, fresh and smoked sausages, olive oils, chocolates and exotic game (feather and fur). And he knows his roe. Portier's has a limited supply of fresh caviar from the Caspian Sea: beluga from Kazakhstan at $250 an ounce; osetra is $140 an ounce (about 28.5 grams or 2 tablespoons). Prices can change daily. But bargains are to be had. Mr. Portier's personal preference in domestic caviar is osetra from wild American sturgeon, at $43 an ounce. Roe from farmed American sturgeon is $22 an ounce; and eggs from salmon, paddlefish and even tobikko make pretty garnishes at $3 to $8 an ounce, for 4-ounce minimums. Whatever the price, caviar should be kept cold but not frozen. Metal should never touch the eggs; spoons made of horn, bone, mother pearl or even plastic are recommended. Portier carries caviar spoons ($13, plain, to $35, with sterling tip) and individual footed glass caviar servers (with separate bowls for caviar and ice) at $30 each.

1187-> In Katharine Noel's 'Halfway House,' a Teenager Is Submerged in Psychosis
Halfway House By Katharine Noel 367 pages. Atlantic Monthly Press. $23. In her debut novel, "Halfway House," Katharine Noel ambitiously takes on the literary terrain of mental illness and how one family becomes unhinged by a daughter's continuing struggles with psychosis. At the novel's onset, readers meet Angie Voorster, a 17-year-old overachiever who lives with her family in a small town in rural New Hampshire. A competitive swimmer, Angie is being courted by multiple Ivy League coaches and recruiters. She is popular among her peers. She excels academically, taking honors classes and writing papers for extra credit. Immediately, Ms. Noel lets readers see the widening fissures in Angie's exuberant veneer. Her voice verges on too loud, her language turns crude, her enthusiasm for life is overpowering, as if it might break her at any second. And break her it does, within the novel's opening pages. After Angie wins yet another swim race -- and the next race is about to begin -- she experiences her first psychotic break. "Just as the air horn sounded and the swimmers launched themselves into the air, Angie cried out from the side of the pool," Ms. Noel writes. "She was running across the wet concrete toward the racing lanes. Still a yard from the water, she threw herself into a high, arching dive that made an almost imperceptible splash." As Angie sinks to the pool's bottom, the rest of her family -- father, Pieter; mother, Jordana; and younger brother, Luke -- are also submerged in the unending world of mental illness. Told from alternating points of view by each family member and later by Luke's girlfriend, Wendy, "Halfway House" provides a collage of perspectives on, and experiences of, the lifelong ramifications of mental illness. Initially, after a hospital stay, Angie lands in a residential therapeutic community on a working farm in eastern New York, where she forks hay and tends to the cows. Soon she returns home but then moves into a halfway house for the mentally ill. Eventually, Angie shares a worn-out Victorian with a group of transient young people. (None of her housemates are aware of her history of illness.) In between these different living arrangements, Angie bounces in and out of hospitals. Through the filter of each family member, the reader discovers how each character copes with Angie's precarious journey. This story is most compelling and convincing when told by Angie. Through her perspective, Ms. Noel ably depicts the monochromatic landscape of her illness: the dreary institutions, the chain-smoking, the blaring televisions, the endless quest for the right blend of medications to relieve her symptoms. (During the novel, she takes 19 different combinations.) At various points, Angie attempts to re-enter the mainstream, and readers may find themselves rooting for her to return to the metronomic rhythm of normal life, enter college, swim again, go out with boyfriends, break up with them. Angie has brushes with these realities: for several months, she has a boyfriend, Abe, an undergraduate at Harvard; she attends Middlebury for eight months; she holds temporary jobs. But in each case, subtle missteps send Angie reeling into dangerous manic episodes that are followed by further treatments. "Closing her eyes, she felt herself floating, the way she used to feel after swim practice, when she lay back in the water, exhausted, muscles aching," Ms. Noel writes about Angie after the girl has had an electroconvulsive treatment (ECT). "Except that then she'd felt relieved and happy. Now her head burned." Ms. Noel's command of the story falters with the adult characters, particularly Angie's mother. Jordana -- who is 15 years Pieter's junior and an administrator at an abortion clinic in town -- goes through the motions of her protracted family crisis, but her narrative rarely builds any emotional traction; instead, it slips into hollow generalities and clichés. Secondary characters -- like a high school girl, Kristen, obsessed with Luke (she spends hours standing in the Voorsters' yard), and the other mental patients (Trevor, Lily) whom Angie encounters along the way -- verge on caricature, never fully coming to life and thereby adding little to Ms. Noel's engaging narrative. Near the end, Pieter, who was born in the Netherlands, flashes back to his childhood during World War II, when he left his hometown: "It reminded him of something, and he closed his eyes until it came: a house half underwater that he'd seen the day he left Holland. In an attempt to hold back the invasion, the dikes had been opened, flooding the fields. Water pushed softly against the downstairs windows, so that the house had appeared to bob, unanchored." This is what Ms. Noel successfully captures, that in-between, unmoored state of debilitating psychosis, that place where life is half underwater. There are moments when the author could have allowed feel-good plot turns to transform the story into a sentimental domestic drama, but instead she tenaciously adheres to the realistic trajectory of mental illness. While reading "Halfway House," a reader can't help considering the classic protagonist of this literary genre: Esther Greenwood in "The Bell Jar," by Sylvia Plath. Near the end of her masterly novel, when Esther is about to be discharged from an asylum, Plath writes: "I took a deep breath and listened to the old brag of my heart. I am, I am, I am." Thankfully, Ms. Noel doesn't attempt to reinvent Plath's masterpiece; she steers clear of the first-person voice and instead relies on her third-person tapestry. That said, Ms. Noel offers her own contemporary, insightful chronicle of a young woman trying to define herself through the miasma of mental illness. "Oh, she missed herself," Angie confesses, like "the way she'd sometimes missed her parents when she was a child and had slept over at a friend's." BOOKS OF THE TIMES S.

Barbara Furrer Goodman, a teacher and former chairwoman of the board of trustees at Teachers College at Columbia University, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 74. The cause was complications from a kidney disorder, said her husband, former State Senator Roy M. Goodman. Mrs. Goodman, whose expertise was in early childhood education, joined the board at Teachers College in 1973 and led its committee on development before being elected the board's chairwoman in 1980. She held the post for 11 years. Born in Milwaukee in 1931, Mrs. Goodman earned her bachelor's degree from Radcliffe College and her master's degree from Teachers College. She taught at the Home School in New York City and was a former president of the Junior League. Besides her husband, a well-known Republican from the Upper East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Goodman is survived by a son, Randy, of Palo Alto, Calif.; two daughters, Claire Cloud, of New York City and Leslie Goodman, of Los Angeles; a brother, John Furrer, of Vero Beach, Fla.; and six grandchildren.

1191-> Softball and Partisanship (1 Letter)
To the Editor: Re "Washington's Un-American Pastime" (editorial, April 28): I write as a 15-year veteran of the Congressional softball league and as captain of Suspension of the Rules, a three-time league champion. Competing in softball is a Congressional tradition and a rite of passage for staff members. In recent years, however, a once-proud tournament has been subject to the ruling fiat of a sole, unelected commissioner. It should come as no surprise, then, that the great majority of the teams in the league, both Democratic and Republican, voluntarily opted out of the league when a new softball league was formed. They were motivated not by partisanship but by the desire to play in a league promising no fees, regulation fields, a better seeding system and a more convenient tournament schedule. In the grand scheme of things, softball is minor, but accusations of partisanship serve only to further poison the shallow well of good will left in Washington.

1193-> Losing the Alitos
If he'd been born a little earlier, Sam Alito would probably have been a Democrat. In the 1950's, the middle-class and lower-middle-class whites in places like Trenton, where Alito grew up, were the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. But by the late 1960's, cultural politics replaced New Deal politics, and liberal Democrats did their best to repel Northern white ethnic voters. Big-city liberals launched crusades against police brutality, portraying working-class cops as thuggish storm troopers for the establishment. In the media, educated liberals portrayed urban ethnics as uncultured, uneducated Archie Bunkers. The liberals were doves; the ethnics were hawks. The liberals had "Question Authority" bumper stickers; the ethnics had been taught in school to respect authority. The liberals thought an unjust society caused poverty; the ethnics believed in working their way out of poverty. Sam Alito emerged from his middle-class neighborhood about that time, made it to Princeton and found "very privileged people behaving irresponsibly." Alito wanted to learn; the richer liberals wanted to strike. He wanted to join R.O.T.C.; the liberal Princetonians expelled it from campus. He was orderly and respectful; they were disorderly and disrespectful. The experience was so searing that he mentioned it in the opening of his confirmation hearing 37 years later. In 1971, Fred Dutton, an important Democratic strategist, acknowledged the rift between educated liberals and the white working class. In a short book, "Changing Sources of Power," Dutton argued that white workers had "tended, in fact, to become a major redoubt of traditional Americanism and of the antinegro, antiyouth vote." The New Deal coalition, including Catholics and white ethnics, was dying, he argued, and should be replaced by a "loose peace coalition" of young people, educated suburbanites, feminists and blacks. That plan wasn't stupid, but it didn't work. The party has been in a downward spiral ever since. John Kerry lost the white working class by 23 percentage points. He lost among his fellow Catholics. He lost the election. After every defeat, Democrats vow to reconnect with middle-class whites. But if there is one lesson of the Alito hearings, it is that the Democratic Party continues to repel those voters just as vigorously as ever. The Democrats have amply shown why they remain the party of gown, but not town. First, there was the old subject of police brutality. If you listened to the questions of Jeff Sessions, a Republican, you heard a man exercised by the terror drug dealers can inflict on a neighborhood. If you listened to Ted Kennedy, you heard a man exercised by the terror law enforcement officials can inflict on a neighborhood. Kennedy railed against "Gestapo-like" tactics. Patrick Leahy accused Alito of rendering decisions in a "light most favorable to law enforcement." If forced to choose, most Americans side with the party that errs on the side of the cops, not the criminals. Then there was the old hawk-dove divide. If you listened to Lindsey Graham, a Republican, you heard a man alarmed by the threats posed by anti-American terrorists. If you listened to Leahy or Russ Feingold, you heard men alarmed by the threats posed by American counterterrorists. The Democratic questions implied that American counterterrorists are guilty until proved innocent, that a police state is being born. If forced to choose, most Americans want a party that will fight aggressively against the terrorists, not the N.S.A. Then there were the old accusations of bigotry. Kennedy misleadingly and maliciously asserted that Alito had never written a decision on behalf of an African-American. But those wild accusations don't carry weight any more. Rich liberals have been calling white ethnics bigots for 40 years. Finally, and most important, there is the question of demeanor. Alito is a paragon of the old-fashioned working-class ethic. In a culture of self-aggrandizement, Alito is modest. In a culture of self-exposure, Alito is reticent. In a culture of made-for-TV sentimentalism, Alito refuses to emote. In a culture that celebrates the rebel, or the fashionable pseudorebel, Alito respects tradition, order and authority. What sort of party doesn't admire these virtues in a judge? The big story of American politics, which was underlined by every hour of the Alito hearings, is that sometime between 1932 and 1968, the DNA of the Democratic Party fundamentally changed. In 1932, the Democrats had working-class DNA. Today, the Democrats have different DNA, the DNA of a minority party.

1194-> Buffalo: Reforms for Liquor Wholesalers
The state’s eight largest wine and liquor wholesalers will pay $1.6 million and adopt a series of reforms to resolve Attorney General Eliot Spitzer’s investigation of illegal marketing practices in the industry, according to an agreement announced yesterday. The deal is meant to stop wholesalers from favoring select retailers with gifts and discounts not available to thousands of smaller stores, bars and restaurants. Mr. Spitzer announced the agreement in Buffalo, where many of the practices were chronicled in The Buffalo News. In one of the most significant of the agreement’s provisions, wholesalers must now post all prices to retailers on company Web sites, ending “blind pricing,” which allowed them to offer deep discounts to some customers and not to others.

1199-> In New Twist on College Search, a First Choice, and 20 Backups
Michael Martin has done well in the college admissions sweepstakes, having been accepted by eight universities and rejected by one. But he expects to hear from 12 more colleges in the next few weeks, including Georgetown, Wake Forest and the University of California, Los Angeles. Worried about the increasingly competitive race to get into the nation's top universities, Mr. Martin decided he needed to apply to as many colleges as he could, 21 in all. "Compared to my dad's day and my grandfather's day, it's much harder to get into college," said Mr. Martin, 18, a senior at St. Margaret's Episcopal School in San Juan Capistrano, Calif. "I just think I needed to get my name out to many schools." His strategy is no longer that unusual. A generation ago, high school seniors applied to three, four or five colleges. But now students aiming for the most selective universities frequently apply to as many as 10 or 12; a significant number of students, especially in the last three years or so, apply to many, many more, guidance counselors and college admissions officials said. The main reason for this, guidance counselors and admissions officials say, is a growing anxiety about admissions, stoked by college ranking guides, the news media and, often, parents. Some students are desperate to do anything to get into a brand-name institution -- including applying to many of them. The growth of the common application, which more than 270 colleges accept, has contributed as well by making it easier to apply to a large number of institutions; so has an increase in the number of colleges that waive fees for online applications. Most colleges charge about $50 to $75 per application. And some students cast a wide net to increase their chances of snaring a substantial merit scholarship. At Millburn High School, a public school in an affluent northern New Jersey suburb, students routinely apply to 12 to 15 universities. "We have a high here of probably 30, and we have a solid 10 percent who have applied to at least 20," said Nancy Siegel, Millburn's head counselor and coordinator. Julia Sein, a senior at a magnet high school in Jacksonville, Fla., planned to apply this year to 21 colleges, before winnowing her list to 15. Neeta Kannan, who graduated from a Pittsburgh private school last year, applied to 22 colleges. Rahel Birru, who graduated from the same school a year earlier, applied to 23 (and was accepted by every one). At New Trier High School in Winnetka, Ill., another affluent suburban public school, about 15 to 20 seniors apply to as many as 20 colleges each year. An annual survey of college freshmen indicates that students bound for all kinds of institutions are filing more applications these days. In 1967, only 1.8 percent of freshman surveyed had applied to seven or more colleges, while in 2005, 17.4 percent had done so, according to the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at U.C.L.A., which conducts the survey. The survey began asking recently if the students had applied to 12 or more colleges; that proportion increased by 50 percent from 2001 to 2005. "Anecdotally, I know that many students do this almost as if a game, to see how many letters of acceptance they receive," said Andy Morris, associate director of admissions for the State University of New York at Binghamton. But many others are deadly serious, convinced that they must apply to myriad colleges to be assured of admission to at least one. Sometimes they apply to a vast range of colleges and sometimes to a dozen or more that are essentially the same. "They are just so nervous that they won't get in anywhere that they just keep coming in with applications," said Stephanie Lapasota, guidance director at the Farmingdale school district on Long Island. "It's not good for the kids," Ms. Lapasota added. "It's feeding an anxiety." Ms. Lapasota said the top students at Farmingdale apply to 8 to 12 colleges. "Every year we have a student who applies to 23," she said. Last year, a senior applied to 28. "We have kind of a counselor's pool each year as to who can get the right number," Ms. Lapasota said. Instead of taking a scattershot approach to applications, guidance counselors said students should concentrate on researching which colleges were a good fit for them, and not wait to make the hard choice until they have won admission to multiple institutions. Guidance counselors at public high schools said it would be difficult to limit applications. "I could never justify a limit," Ms. Lapasota said, "but we try to talk to them and get them to be reasonable." Some private schools are already limiting how many colleges students may apply to. The Sidwell Friends School in Washington, for example, allows up to nine applications. St. Margaret's Episcopal School in Southern California plans to impose a limit of 10 next year, after having some students apply to 25 or more. Schools typically provide transcripts and letters of recommendation among other information. At The Ellis School, a private girls' school in Pittsburgh, a new policy permits students to apply to 10 colleges, with a $35 fee for every application exceeding 10. Joanna Schultz, the school's director of college counseling, said she had reluctantly agreed to the fee because it was usually unnecessary to apply to 15 or 20 colleges. "You can apply to all of the Ivy League schools, and more often than not our students either get into all of them or none," Ms. Schultz said. While the increase in applications per student has helped swell the number of applications at many colleges -- a trend they like to trumpet -- even some admissions officials would not be disappointed if more high schools imposed limits. They said it was not good for students to be offered admission to a dozen or more colleges and then have only a few weeks in April to make a choice. Sometimes a student has good reasons for applying to many colleges. Ms. Kannan, who went to the Ellis School, applied to 22 last year because she wanted to go to medical school and considered programs that combined undergraduate and medical educations, as well as traditional undergraduate colleges. Ms. Kannan, now a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh in an eight-year program that includes medical school, said she was accepted to 14 or 15 universities, including Harvard and Brown. But she is confident she made the right choice. "I just like the thought of having a guaranteed med school as well," she said. Ms. Birru, who graduated two years ago, hopes to go to medical school and to earn a doctorate. She said she applied to 23 colleges -- among them, Wellesley, Colgate, Carnegie Mellon, Dickinson and Lafayette -- to see which would offer her the largest merit, or non-need based, scholarship. She selected the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, which admitted her to a scholarship program that promotes research careers in the sciences, especially for members of minorities. Mr. Martin, the senior in Southern California, is hoping his broad strategy produces similar results. "I kind of did it shotgun -- different campuses, different places, all across the country," said Mr. Martin, who said he hoped to become a wildlife veterinarian. He was asked what he would do if 15 or 20 colleges offered him admission. "That," Mr. Martin said, "would be a great problem to have."

1200-> Newark: Theft From Songwriters Guild
Two cousins admitted in Federal District Court that they stole $1.2 million from the Songwriters Guild of America, prosecutors said yesterday. One of the cousins, Nicole Williams, 27, of Brooklyn, admitted receiving $444,791 in royalty checks from August 2001 through June 2005. The other cousin, Anthony Ray, 33, of Providence, R.I., received $802,721 in checks during the same period, said Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney in New Jersey. Neither is a songwriter. Ms. Williams and Mr. Ray said they received the money from the guild’s royalty manager, whom they identified as a relative. The investigation into the manager remains active, Mr. Christie said in a statement. Both face up to five years in prison and fines when they are sentenced in December.

1202-> Louisiana in Limbo
New Orleans waits. While some heroic efforts at rebuilding are taking place, hundreds of thousands of residents have put their lives on hold until they know what the government's next steps will be, leaving the shells of their houses as placeholders. But the Bush administration has now rejected the most broadly supported plan for rebuilding communities while offering nothing to take its place. It has been five months since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast and for many the norm is still the claustrophobic new reality of tiny trailers and multiple families crammed into single apartments. Louisiana is trying. You can hear jackhammers pounding and buzz saws whirring on Canal Street in New Orleans. Dedicated workers endure a grinding daily commute from points north, like Baton Rouge, as they try to make the city and the region whole again. But the mission is far from complete and the challenge is beyond the scope of a broken city and a poor state. New Orleans's crisis has little relation to anything the nation has faced in modern memory, and traditional solutions will simply not help. Homeowners -- many very poor people whose houses had been in their families for generations -- had varying degrees of insurance before the disaster. When entire neighborhoods are devastated, their mildewed furniture and drywall piled on the roadsides, it's impossible to tell the people who are well insured to rebuild and hope that the houses all around them will somehow be reclaimed somewhere down the line. But the Bush administration refuses to support the plan of Representative Richard Baker, Republican of Louisiana, which would give everyone the capacity to rebuild and which had the backing of the mayor, the governor and the state's Congressional delegation. (To add insult to injury, two days after the White House shot down Mr. Baker's proposal, President Bush suggested at a news conference that Louisiana's problem was the lack of a plan.) Instead of an alternate solution, the president's Katrina czar, Donald Powell, has offered sleight of hand, touting $6.2 billion in development money for Louisiana passed last year by Congress as if it were somehow a substitute. And in an attempt to narrow the scope of the problem, Mr. Powell says the government first needs to care for the roughly 20,000 homeowners without flood insurance who lived outside the federally designated flood plain. The real tally of destroyed or damaged homes in the region is well over 200,000. And the real need is housing for residents, whether they were renters or owners, insured or uninsured, living above the flood plain or trusting the federal government's levees to protect them from storms. Perhaps too much emphasis has been placed on the wreckage of poor, low-lying New Orleans neighborhoods like the Lower Ninth Ward. That has sparked the unproductive, blame-the-victim debate revolving around whether people should have lived there in the first place. The Ninth Ward provides a misleading picture of the city, as do the relatively unscathed tourist areas like the French Quarter and the Garden District. Huge swaths of the city have the empty quality of a ghost town. Stores wait for residents to reopen; residents wait to see if neighbors will return. The city and surrounding parishes will not meet Mr. Powell's neat categories, when renters lived beside owners, insured next to uninsured. He is talking like an actuary when a leader is needed to rescue this region. Now, Congress has a responsibility to follow its own lead rather than the president's. We were outraged once, shocked at the images on our television sets, at the poverty in our collective backyard and at the devastation of a great city. As the disaster threatens to become permanent, we have every reason to remain so.

1205-> Love (and Leave) Thy Neighbor
HANNAH is the macabre temptress on the top floor who has dead spiders pinned and framed on her walls and a bed that swings from chains. Mike is the big-talking ladies' man in Apartment 2 who returns home -- often alone -- bragging about his conquests. Sara and Ramon of Apartments 4 and 5 are the canoodling couple, running back and forth between floors to fetch iPods and cigarettes. There are times when a confluence of people find a way to become a sort of family. It can happen at summer camp and in college dormitories and at Internet start-ups. But in New York, where many people don't know their neighbors and prefer it that way, 126 Rivington Street, where the residents eat together, often sleep together and live above a cupcake shop, is an anomaly. Ever since Mike Dreeland, 32, moved into the second-floor apartment with two friends from Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vt., two and a half years ago and started having parties on his rear patio, the 102-year-old tenement between Essex and Norfolk Streets on the Lower East Side has become a cross between the shenanigan-filled apartment building on "Friends" and the drama-soaked fictional complex Melrose Place, 3,000 miles away in Los Angeles. Other characters include Tom, "the old man" (37), who gave up a career to try making it as a writer in New York; Zobes, an aspiring rock star; Pauline, a photographer; Jo, a publicist for a clothing designer; Stefania, a pathology resident; Tito, a stock trader; and an honorary member, Piper Perabo, the actress. She lives in the building next door but socializes with 126 residents from her rear terrace. The 15 members of the 126 gang drink at Iggy's on Ludlow or Whiskey Ward on Essex, eat at 'Inoteca on Rivington (where they are friends with one of the chefs), buy birthday cupcakes at Sugar Sweet Sunshine on the ground floor, and wallow in one another's personal affairs whether they like to or not. There have been at least six sexual relationships in the building, along with an untold number of angrily slammed doors and tearful reconciliations. As with "Friends" and "Melrose Place," the central theme of this show may be: how long can one continue to enjoy the bacchanalian pleasures of youth before one craves a quieter adult existence? "One by one we met the neighbors," said James Moore, 24, an advertising executive who lives in Apartment 4, "and realized that pretty much everybody is under 30 and has a not-quite-serious career going on and a disposition to party -- too many nights a week probably." Most of the residents arrived three years ago after the building's owners completed a gut renovation and started renting the six units. (The three-bedroom floor-through apartments rent for around $3,000 a month each; the one-bedrooms for about $2,000.) And it wasn't long after Mr. Dreeland, an art director for Steve Madden, started having his patio parties that the soap operas began. One of Mr. Dreeland's roommates, Chris Lotito (called Tito), 31, fresh from a broken engagement, became entangled with a woman a floor above who has since moved out. "She popped in," he said on a recent Saturday at his apartment. "She took me for a little tour of the Lower East Side. Finally we left a bar together and nature took its course." That dalliance was short-lived. Soon after, Sara Rawitz, 26, a slim blonde with an easy-to-talk-to personality, moved to the fifth floor with two roommates, and Mr. Dreeland, Mr. Lotito and their other roommate, Kevin Marrazzo, 33, all began trying to wine and dine her. She chose one, Mr. Marrazzo, but the relationship didn't last. "I wasn't really interested, and I knew he was," Ms. Rawitz said. "He's one of those guys who falls hard." The two managed to go an entire year without talking or running into each other, until Mr. Marrazzo moved out last June, at which point Ms. Rawitz started a relationship with Ramon Lopez, 25, a lanky software consultant who lives on the fourth floor. "I got all hot and heavy one night because I was reading this book a girlfriend gave me about sexual techniques," she said. "He was text-messaging me, and I wrote, 'Hey, you should come up.' " Mr. Lopez climbed the fire escape straight into her room. On a recent Saturday the ebb and flow of life at 126 Rivington was on full display. In the fourth floor apartment, where there was a distinctive postparty odor in the air, Mr. Lopez was showing off his "Team Ramon" T-shirts, which he'd had made for fellow 126 tenants and other friends. The logo reads, "No Shame." Downstairs, Johanna Lafferty, known as Jo, could be heard returning to her second- floor apartment from a two-bloody-mary brunch across the street at Essex Restaurant. Mr. Lopez said it had been hard at first to negotiate a relationship with someone who lived so near by, but he said that he and Ms. Rawitz have just started treating their apartments like a duplex. As he spoke, Mr. Lopez's roommate, Chris Zobler, a software salesman for I.B.M. and an aspiring rock star who goes by Zobes, stared silently ahead. "He was my good friend I would hang out with and have fun with until I started sleeping with his roommate and best friend," Ms. Rawitz explained later, saying that Mr. Zobler "hates" the relationship and no longer speaks to her. A few days later Mr. Zobler, who is 25 and not dating anyone, said by phone that the couple is ruining the group dynamic. "It's all about the team," he said, "at least for the rest of us, but they've started separating out a bit." On the top floor Hannah Long, 27, lives in an apartment that smells like incense and hot tea. A scorpion, a tarantula and several preserved beetles hang in display boxes along the walls. She is a satellite fixture at 126, traveling a lot, but as a self-described "serial neighbor dater" she is an intimate member of the group nonetheless. Mr. Dreeland said that Ms. Long once telephoned him 15 times in a day. "It's a little soap opera I'd rather my boyfriend didn't know about," she said, rolling a cigarette on the arm of a large wooden chair from Bali. As for Mr. Dreeland, he now prefers to date people outside the building. Wearing a ski cap while watching Comedy Central in his apartment, he recounted the adventure of the night before, when he brought home what he described as an "urban cougar," a woman over 40, he explained, who is attracted to younger men. Apparently this particular cougar didn't turn out to be all that interested, he admitted. There are comfortably homey touches to life at 126, like the warm cake smell emanating from the exhaust fans of Sugar Sweet Sunshine on the first floor. Deb Weiner, a co-owner of the shop, doubles as a sort of den mother for the building, storing keys and accepting packages for residents. Most people seem to thrive on the ready-made companionship at 126. Tom Zoellner, a former newspaper reporter whose first book, "The Heartless Stone: A Journey Through the World of Diamonds, Deceit and Desire" (St. Martin's), is scheduled to come out in May, lives on the third floor with two female roommates and said that after sitting in his room all day writing he looks forward to socializing in the building. "The freelance life can be disconnected from the spin and flow of humanity," he said. And he likes the way his female roommates decorate, "a little slice of Des Moines on the Lower East Side," he said. "The sectional couch, the gingham checkered washcloths." At 37, he and Thomas Zoli, 34, an architect who lives in one of the top-floor one-bedrooms, are described by other residents as "older." Many New Yorkers their age -- or any age -- would not choose to live in a place almost devoid of privacy. In most buildings, especially rentals, "there's an unspoken social rule that you only nod at your neighbors or grunt at them in the elevator," said Lockhart Steele, the publisher of the real estate blog Curbed.com. Some who have tasted the 126 life prefer grunting at their neighbors to sleeping with them. Dave Courage, 28, a marketer at the publisher HarperCollins, who organized last year's Valentine's Day party at the building, moved out of his third-floor apartment in July. "It was a lot of fun, but I needed to start going to bed a little earlier," he said. He moved to Brooklyn. "There isn't any socializing in the building, which is a relief for me." The walls at 126 are thin. Ms. Long said she first met her next-door neighbor when she ran into him in the hall and mimicked the sounds she heard him make when in bed with his girlfriend. Ms. Lafferty of the third floor said she has had to beg the guys downstairs to turn their music down in the wee hours. One doesn't have to live in the building to be infected with its spirit of camaraderie. Ms. Perabo, 29, the actress, who is currently in "Cheaper by the Dozen 2," was watering plants on her terrace on the building next door to 126 when she met Ms. Rawitz, who was out on her fire escape. Since then Ms. Perabo has developed a friendly if at times adversarial relationship with the group. "The nights they have their music up really loud," Ms. Perabo said by phone from Los Angeles, "I will wake up really early, like I always do, and turn my yoga music up really loud. You woke me up, so I'll wake you up." Mr. Dreeland said he had no ill will for Ms. Perabo, a star of "Coyote Ugly." "Tell Piper we have no problem with her," he said. "We'd love for her to come down for a drink." Of 14 residents who lived at 126 in January 2003, eight are still there. "It's a love-hate relationship," said Vinnie Grippa, 33, who moved into Apartment 2 eight months ago. "When you're looking to party, it's good, but I don't know how long I can do it." The manager of the property, Rosalie Schwartz of S&H Equities in Great Neck, N.Y., didn't know that the building had become such a community. She said she has "no major problems" with the tenants. For now, whenever a rare vacancy comes up, the building mates put out word among their friends. Mr. Courage's replacement, Judy Lai, 25, who recently left her job as an investment associate on Wall Street and is unemployed, attended Babson College in Massachusetts with Mr. Zobler, Mr. Lopez and Mr. Moore. "Melrose Place," with its aging characters having finally bedded, punched, fired, betrayed and defrauded one another in nearly every possible combination, was canceled in 1999. "We're thinking we have two or three more years of this stuff before we have to wrap it up," Mr. Dreeland said. His roommate Mr. Lotito corrected him: "But we also said that when we were 27."

1206-> Low-Speed Chase on Carousel of the Mind
If speed -- the dizzying, liberating, body-hurtling, lose-your-lunch kind of speed -- is the hallmark of the conventional amusement park, are there still thrills if the rides are slowed down, way down in the name of art? That was the premise of Carsten Holler's "Amusement Park," which began operating this month at Mass MoCA in North Adams, Mass. As it turns out, the installation process itself was a bit of a roller-coaster ride. Like relics from a lost civilization, an enormous Gravitron, bumper cars and three other attractions have been plucked from fairgrounds and moved to a darkened, football-field-size gallery. The rides creak, moan and flash their lights at the same radically reduced rate that they turn and twitch. Space is distorted, too: like a funhouse mirror, a glass wall reflects the cavernous room in fractured form.Viewers can't go on the rides and of course they wouldn't be any fun at this rate. What Mr. Holler, a 44-year-old German scientist turned artist based in Stockholm, is offering is a different kind of mental trip with hallucinatory effects: did that tilt-a-whirl just jerk or was it a trick of the imagination? "You have to let go," he said, "like you would let go in your body in a real amusement park, but here it's about letting go in your mind." While the artist was on firm ground with the implications of sending viewers languidly through the looking glass, he had no idea how to pull it off. Modifying the contraptions fell to Art Gillette and his brothers, local fairground operators. "We're trained to always think about faster, louder, brighter, more exciting," Mr. Gillette said, adding later, "This was so simple it was difficult." For instance, the brothers grossly overengineered the Gravitron -- they realized there was no need to worry about vibrations or imbalance of people. And in a bumper car, the motor overheats and burns when it runs too slowly. The Gillettes had to scrap the original drive units and remanufacture them to meet the artist's requirement that the rides change direction and degree of slowness every day. At least one viewer considers the exhibit a success: "As we were installing and people were walking through, I began to understand what Carsten's doing," Art Gillette said. "You see the reactions these things bring out in people, like, I remember this, but it's not quite what I remember. Was that a dream or maybe this is the dream. It's a strange, fantastic experiment."

1207-> Same Cellphone Carrier, Same User Interface
In my e-mail column last Thursday, I mentioned how much I liked the intuitive, smartly designed menu system of the LG 8100 cellphone. The implication was that LG Electronics should get the credit. But Brenda Raney from Verizon Wireless (my carrier) soon set me straight on that point: "Glad you like the Verizon Wireless proprietary user interface on the LG. You buy that same phone from anyone else, and you don't get those features. Why? Verizon Wireless designed the user interface -- the screens, the menus, etc. -- solely for our phones. You will find that same user interface on the Motorola RAZR v3c, the Samsung a970 & a950, the VX 8945 and just about all of Verizon Wireless' phones. "We did a lot of research to determine what people wanted in their wireless phones and one of the things that surfaced was a phone that was intuitive...no one wants to read the manual. So regardless of the model or brand, once a customer gets used to our phones, they will know how to work all of them. No one else offers that convenience to customers." That's weird. I doubt most consumers realize that buying the same phone from different carriers means completely different user interfaces. I sure didn't.

1208-> Salary Cap Chaos Looms as Talks Drag On in N.F.L.
National Football League owners will meet in New York this morning in a last-ditch attempt to forge labor peace before the start of the signing period for free agents tomorrow. If no deal is reached, the annual salary-cap-induced purge of players is expected to balloon as teams struggle to get under a cap that could be at least $10 million lower than it would have been under a new labor agreement. The N.F.L. Management Council's executive committee met yesterday and unanimously rejected the players association's latest proposal. The council will report on the status of negotiations during the owners' meeting today. "Without an agreement with the union on an extension, the league year will begin as scheduled at midnight Thursday under the current terms of the C.B.A.," the league said in a statement last night, referring to the start of free agency in accord with the current collective bargaining agreement. Because of the chance of a last-minute deal, the league extended the deadline for player cuts to 10 p.m. from 4 p.m. Eastern today. The current deal does not expire until after the 2007 season, but Friday is a key day. If there is no new deal by then, the 2006 season will be the last one played with a salary cap. Teams and players will be confronted with a new set of contract rules for 2006 that figure to complicate negotiations and team finances so much that many player agents believe free agents will not be able to gain appropriate contracts. A new collective bargaining agreement could be reached after Friday, but once free agency begins with a new set of rules, contracts made under those rules would remain in place. But the real effects of the failure to reach a deal will be felt much sooner, when teams, scrambling today to comply with the salary cap, which was set at $94.5 million yesterday, start clearing their rosters. The Broncos got a jump on things yesterday, releasing three starters -- defensive end Trevor Pryce, running back Mike Anderson and tight end Jeb Putzier. The Buffalo Bills released defensive tackle Sam Adams, safety Lawyer Milloy and tight end Mark Campbell in moves resulting in part from salary-cap considerations. Some teams, including the Oakland Raiders, the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Dolphins, are well over the cap and might have to make deep cuts, while other teams -- among them the Minnesota Vikings, the Arizona Cardinals and the Cleveland Browns -- are poised to make a splash because they are far below the cap. Some people involved in the game remain hopeful that a deal can still get done, or at least that owners and players can agree to put off the start of free agency as negotiations continue. But the players' union chief, Gene Upshaw, has said that he will not delay the start of the signing period. The player agent Leigh Steinberg said he believed that the anticipated salary-cap purge today would not take place and that, instead, the two sides would at least agree to postpone the start of the new league year, which would keep the free-agency period from kicking in and allow teams to hold off on making deep player cuts to get under the cap. "I think as players and owners peer into the abyss, the ramifications of the negotiation landscape are so stark that they will push at the last moment to work out a compromise," Steinberg said. "Notwithstanding whatever fighting words you hear from the bargaining table, the reality is that with the new TV contract about to take effect and the incredibly lucrative ancillary revenue streams, both sides know we are on the verge of ushering in the most lucrative payday in the history of professional sports," Steinberg said. "The history of professional football is that nothing happens until the very last moment." But the N.F.L. talks are complicated by the owners' internal dissension over revenue-sharing, which Upshaw insists must be resolved before a new labor deal is reached. Talks between management and the players broke off on Tuesday. Revenue-sharing is an important issue because high-revenue teams have a financial advantage in luring free agents, something that could upset the competitive balance the league craves. If a new deal is not completed, several new rules will have an impact on contract negotiations. Signing bonuses, a favorite tool of agents because they offer the only guaranteed money in a contract, could be apportioned only over a four-year period on the salary cap, rather than the usual maximum of seven years. That is likely to mean much smaller bonuses. Other mechanisms that teams and agents use to get around the cap -- salary incentives that count in later salary-cap years -- will also be affected, with the result being that large contracts could be hard to come by even in the usually ferocious free-agent market for top-flight players. "It makes it very difficult for all the clubs," the agent Ralph Cindrich said. "I don't think there is any question there will be a lot of extremely talented players who are not going to be able to reach the levels of compensation many of their peers have reached in previous years."

1209-> Complete 360
Mark Danielewski’s publisher recommends you read his new book, “Only Revolutions” — it has been nominated for a National Book Award — in incremental bursts. The idea is that, if you turn the book upside down and swing it around every eight pages, you can alternate the monologues of its two narrators, Sam and Hailey, so as to spin them together. Should this idea be trusted? Pantheon, after all, also insists the book is a novel, and that’s quite a stretch. If we are to call “Only Revolutions” a novel, then we must, at the very least, call it a road novel in which the road (one of those numbered routes from an old, weird folk song) is a Möbius strip. Danielewski’s book would be better described as an epic tone poem, a cult object in search of a cult, an experiment gone perfectly mad or a sacrifice to the Ouroboros — the circular serpent symbolic of eternity, a snake eating its own tail. Further, to hijack Mary McCarthy’s line about Vladimir Nabokov’s “Pale Fire,” it is an infernal machine, a do-it-yourself kit ... and a trap to catch reviewers. This reviewer first felt trapped, then skinned. It was not a wholly unfamiliar sensation. Danielewski’s first book, “House of Leaves” (2000), was an erudite, quite horrible horror story in which a suburban family discovers that its house is bigger inside than outside; what starts as a little crack in domestic reality becomes a gaping cavern. Likewise, “Only Revolutions” begins as a standard exercise in narrative gamesmanship — frames within frames, narrators you perhaps ought not rely upon — and emerges as a sui generis art project where, as in a concrete poem, the very text scatters and dances and moves the action along. Let’s start at the end of “Only Revolutions,” which is also the beginning. The first page of Hailey’s story contains upside-down text that constitutes the final page of Sam’s story, and vice versa. (The author has the perfection of circles on his mind: it’s a 360-page book; each narrator proceeds by degrees.) Hailey kicks things off with a cry — “Samsara! Samarra! / Grand! / I can walk away / from anything” — that refers to the Hindu cycle of birth, death and rebirth. Here and throughout, Danielewski lays out the language — an onomatopoeic patois indebted to folkies, beatniks and golden-throated hustlers — like the lines of a lyric poem: “How’d I get so oodles for this nitwit, / zazzling strong, dingy and giddy / by my shazzling side?” Hailey continues, “Everyone loves / the Dream but I kill it,” and then begins talking, like Shiva, about destroying the world. Turn the book around, and Sam’s tale is wrapping up in a mirror mental image. “Everyone betrays the Dream / but who cares for it? O Hailey no, / I could never walk away from you.” Each story features, alongside the main narrative, a kind of sidebar with fragments of historical fact and shards of dialogue underneath a date, like snatches of some ominous news ticker. Hailey’s first page and Sam’s last is the one place where these dates converge, on Nov. 22, 1963. Meanwhile, at the other end of the book, Danielewski juxtaposes the beginning of Sam’s story — “I can walk away / from anything. / Everyone loves / the Dream but I kill it” — with a tally of names and ideas relevant to a century earlier, Nov. 22, 1863, the eve of the Battle of Chattanooga. And while the author has filled Hailey’s historical sidebar in only up to May 29, 2005, the dates themselves keep running, with blank space beneath them, through 2063, where Hailey fades away in a finale like Sam’s: “Everyone betrays the Dream / but who cares for it? O Sam no, / I could never walk away from you.” If you read “Only Revolutions” the way the publisher wants you to, you are assembling a nonstop adventure in which two 16-year-olds drive around with no particular place to go. Without aging, the pair go cruising in both a Model T and a Geo Metro in the course of this extended joy ride. At various points, Hailey and Sam seem to be friends, lovers, restless comrades and abstract concepts. They also share vibes with duos as various as Huck and Jim, Bonnie and Clyde, Vladimir and Estragon, and the Tweedles Dum and Dee. Still here? That’s two beginnings, two never-ending endings, 200 years of history in the making, one pivoting midpoint in Dealey Plaza, and one shared “dream.” The book — its plot is both a perpetual-motion machine and nonexistent — is baffling, quite possibly an elaborate folly that finds the author subordinating meaning to schema and human emotion to the presumed power of myth. But it’s clear that Danielewski has an entrancing way with overrich wordplay: “Sam admiring / how I tear through the current. / I am the current. And currently bare. / The currency of every dare.” And anyone can see that the “dream” at stake is America, a country that wouldn’t make complete sense if you thought on it till the end of time.

1210-> Rewriting Their Own Rules in Every Song
Avishai Cohen has all the power and tenacity he's going to need: he's the kind of trumpeter who can play hard, schooled, continuous improvisation with nothing but bass and drums behind him. (That pretty much describes his one and only recording, "The Trumpet Player," on Fresh Sound -- so named to distinguish him from the other Avishai Cohen on the New York jazz scene, a bassist.) But over the last three months he has been given the chance to grow a little as a bandleader as well, through regular weekly shows with different musicians at Fat Cat. On Wednesday at the club, he played with Olly's Beaches -- his semi-electric, vamp-oriented, West Africa-leaning band -- with some electric keyboard sounds and some digital-effects pedals for the front-line instruments. It was a full hybrid, a band that rewrote its own rules in each song. At times the keyboardist Jason Lindner added bits of color to the music, making distorted organ tones subtly creep up behind a soloist. But he also satisfied himself with his piano's natural acoustics, getting a hard, ringing sound; for those stretches, everyone else played with their natural sound as well. As for the music's Africanisms, they were not necessarily written into it. They were lent to it by the improvising force of the band's guitarist, Lionel Loueke, a musician originally from Benin, who has quickly become one of the astonishments in American jazz. Some of Mr. Cohen's songs were wide open, with a lot of vamping; Mr. Lindner, the bassist Omer Avital and the drummer Daniel Freedman ate them up, putting African and Cuban accents in them. One had an eight-bar funk line very much like the kind of thing Miles Davis played with his electric bands in the early 70's. Mr. Cohen warped the sound of his trumpet through a wah-wah pedal and used another pedal to feed his own lines back to him, setting up a call-and-response game. But Mr. Cohen was also, most often, the band's tie to a more conventional sense of jazz pedagogy, working in fragments of bebop tunes, rustling through some of the vocabulary of Freddie Hubbard as well as Miles Davis. Mr. Cohen's playing was strong enough, but Mr. Loueke simply destroyed. He played without a pick on a nylon-string, hollow-bodied, electrified acoustic guitar. He put a strip of paper underneath some of the strings, down by the bridge, to get a more percussive, scratchy sound. With cycles of fingerpicking on dampened strings, he could sound like a hand drummer; he played swift, Malian-sounding runs, unspooling beyond bar divisions but making sense within the groove of the music; he forged strong, improvised lines based on scales that clarified his connection to modern, post-Pat Metheny jazz guitar-playing and avoided any kind of typical jazz rhythmic phrasing. He surged through all the music, squeezing it for all its rhythmic and harmonic potential. At the same time, he seemed free to go in any direction he pleased. Avishai Cohen will perform again at Fat Cat, 75 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village on Thursday and Jan. 26, (212) 675-7369, and at Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, on Feb. 3 and 4, (212) 242-1063.

1211-> Resolved for 2006: Finding New Ways to Travel
NEW YEAR, NEW PLANS Sticking to New Year's resolutions doesn't always have to be a chore. While mending your ways in 2006, you can resolve to do something new in your travels. Here are some ways to enjoy (and, just maybe, improve) yourself this year. AUSTIN CONSIDINE SAIL AROUND THE WORLD Jules Verne's heroes did it in 80 days. These days, you don't have to circumnavigate the world by hot-air balloon -- four major cruise lines will offer around-the-world cruises in 2006 according to the Cruise Lines International Association. All cruises leave in January, but travelers can also book for smaller segments, from 11 to 80 days, according to the association. The longest trip offered is offered by Cunard Line (800-728-6273, www.cunard.com), on the Queen Elizabeth 2, which makes its 109-day journey from, and returning to, New York, departing Jan. 9, and making stops in places like Alexandria, Egypt, and Fuerte Amador, Panama, along the way. Trips start at $33,999, including air fare. Radisson Seven Seas Cruises (877-505-5370, www.rssc.com) offers the most destinations on a world cruise on the Seven Seas Voyager, with 45 ports visited in 108 days, in such places as Libya and Myanmar. The voyage departs Jan. 10 from Los Angeles and finishes in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., April 28. Fares start at $79,870, and include $1,500 credit toward air fare. VISIT A NATIONAL PARK Why not pack up the kids and hit the road to visit something a little closer to home: one of America's nearly 400 national park sites? Every year the country's parks draw more visitors, according to Elaine Sevy, a spokeswoman for the National Park Service, last year reaching 277 million visitors nationwide. With events of the last several years -- including Sept. 11, 2001, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- places associated with patriotism, like the World War II Memorial in Washington and Revolutionary War sites in Boston, have attracted more people, especially around July 4. And then there's the price: a fraction of the cost of tickets to an amusement park. Information: National Park Service, 202-208-6843, www.nps.gov. COLLECT NEW EXPERIENCES So you've seen the Eiffel Tower and the Taj Mahal. This year, how about something a little more hands-on? "Today's cruisers view their hard-earned vacation time as an opportunity to escape from the routines of everyday life," Terry L. Dale, president of the Cruise Lines International Association, wrote in an e-mail message, "and, thus, more consumers are seeking to experience exotic adventures in new and interesting locales." To be sure, excursions through cruises and travel agencies now offer adventures previously reserved for makers of nature documentaries. The options include everything from zip lining among treetops in Honduras to dog sledding in Alaska. Through FlyMIG.com (888-359-6442, www.flymig.com) you can even break the sound barrier or fly an aerobatics mission in a Russian MIG jet out of Zhukovsky Air Base, near Moscow, for prices from about $6,750 to more than $14,000. SPEND YOUR VACATION VOLUNTEERING A volunteer vacation is the perfect way to combine travel and altruism, without the long-term commitment of programs like the Peace Corps. Several nonprofit organizations, like Global Volunteers (800-487-1074, www.globalvolunteer.org), and Globe Aware (877-588-4562, www.globeaware.org), offer packages around the world that include meals, local transport, project expenses, lodging and other necessities. Habitat for Humanity (229-924-6935, www.habitat.org) also needs skilled and unskilled volunteer work in home building, abroad and domestically, in places like the Gulf Coast. Prices depend on the program. For example, a Global Volunteers program of three weeks in India helping to expand a children's home near Chennai, formerly known as Madras, through Global Volunteers, costs $2,295, air fare not included. A week teaching and caring for children two hours north of Lima, Peru, through Globe Aware, costs $1,050, without air fare. Habitat for Humanity usually does not charge project fees and does not cover expenses. WORK ON YOUR OTHER RESOLUTIONS Do you want to lose weight this year? Maybe you want to get in touch with your spiritual side, or stop drinking. There are plenty of ways to vacation while working on resolutions. Sober Vacations International (800-762-3738, www.sobervacations.com), for example, arranges no-alcohol vacations, for recovering alcoholics or for those looking to travel in a nondrinking environment. Spas and clinics that specialize in weight loss, like Green Mountain at Fox Run, in Ludlow, Vt. (800-448-8106, www.fitwoman.com), are numerous as those that focus on spiritual renewal, like the Chopra Center (888-424-6772, www.chopra.com), with locations in New York; Westminster, Colo.; San Diego; and Punta Mita, Mexico. For a choice of spas that may meet your needs, go to www.spafinder.com.

1213-> IN BRIEF; Bridgeport Names A New Police Chief
The City of Bridgeport said on Tuesday that Bryan T. Norwood would become its new police chief. Mr. Norwood, 39, has been with the New Haven Police Department for the last 17 years. He has been its assistant chief since 2002 and was its chief of detectives in the two years before that. Mr. Norwood, who grew up in Bridgeport, graduated from Masuk High School in Monroe and Hampton University in Virginia, was chosen after a national search. Mayor John M. Fabrizi said Mr. Norwood's "administrative skills" and "commitment to community policing" were among the reasons he was selected. Mr. Norwood said he would use the latest technologies to address crime. "One of the things we're looking at is geographic information systems, which is a special way of mapping crime," he said. Mr. Norwood will take over on April 22. Anthony Aremeno has been the interim chief of the department since Wibur L. Chapman resigned as chief in January 2005. JEFF HOLTZ

1214-> Stocks Lose Ground as Hopes for Rate Cut Fade
The stock market gave up ground last week as oil prices rose and government reports suggested that the economy remained relatively strong. Those reports — one on Friday, for example, that said that unemployment in October had fallen to a five-year low of 4.4 percent — set off speculation that the Federal Reserve would delay cutting short-term interest rates for months to come. , which posted disappointing sales in October, lost 6.3 percent for the week while , which said it was losing local phone business to cable competitors, dropped 5.5 percent. Those were the two worst weekly performances in the Dow Jones industrial average. climbed 1.3 percent and rose 1 percent, putting them at the top of the weekly list for the Dow. For the week, the Dow fell 104.22 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 11,986.04. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 13.04 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 1,364.30. The Nasdaq composite index lost 19.83 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 2.330.79. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond rose to 4.72 percent from 4.67 percent the previous week.

1217-> Reports Say New Jersey Falls Short of Child Welfare Goals
A report by the New Jersey child advocate has found that the state provided insufficient help to young adults preparing to leave foster care, and did not visit them as frequently as its policies require. Another report has found shortcomings in how the state handles cases of child abuse and neglect. In one of the two reports, which were released yesterday, the random sampling of 68 cases of 15-year-old foster children -- 10 percent of that population as of May 15, 2005 -- showed that teenagers in foster care are frequently shuffled from place to place. The average stay in state care is 3 1/2 years, with teenagers placed in four homes and assigned to four different caseworkers. The problems of children aging out of the foster care system when they become adults have received increasing attention nationally. In New Jersey, as the child welfare system is undergoing a $320 million court-ordered overhaul, the first report noted encouraging improvements, including the addition of 123 beds in facilities for such teenagers, and the policy of providing services to young people until they are 21. Those expanded services, the report said, will "place New Jersey at the forefront of efforts nationally to care for adolescents in foster care." Andy Williams, a spokesman for the Department of Human Services, said the number of adolescents leaving state custody to an adoptive family or to a relative who is a legal guardian had more than tripled, to 194 in 2005 from 62 in 2003. And the number of adolescents receiving services past their 18th birthdays almost tripled last year, he said, to 2,483 this month from 870 a year ago. But the report found that, in the cases reviewed, the state failed to develop meaningful plans to help teenagers in foster care make the transition to independence. Only 31 percent of the young people got instruction in life skills like job hunting, managing money, finding housing, and driving, the child advocate said. The state's caseworkers complied with their visiting schedule for the 15-year-olds only 57 percent of the time. And during those visits, according to the files studied, almost 30 percent of the time, caseworkers did not discuss the teenagers' goals and progress toward achieving them. Mr. Williams said new contracts for groups serving adolescents will require that life skills be taught. In the second report, the child advocate's office reported that far too often the state had failed to follow its own procedures in managing child abuse and neglect cases. The report looked at 269 children in 124 families, who were randomly selected from the 1,241 families who entered the Division of Youth and Family Services system in the first three months of 2004 and stayed in it at least through last June. Some of those cases were opened as early as six months before the state's child welfare reform plan was introduced in June 2004. The report found that in 29 percent of the cases studied, assessments of child safety were not done, potentially leaving children in harm's way. Only 12 percent of the families received all the services they required, and the division planned well for only 9.7 percent of the families. "At the dawn of a new administration, we hope the stories of kids and families who have endured this system over the last two years will resonate in a way that directs political will and attention to their needs," said Kevin M. Ryan, the state's child advocate.

1218-> Seeing DVD's as a Boon to Theaters
YOU might think that Michael L. Campbell, the chairman and chief executive of the Regal Entertainment Group, the nation's largest chain of movie theaters, would be nervous after 2005, when total admissions in the United States fell 8.7 percent, the third consecutive yearly decline. But if he is worried about the drop-off, he's not letting on. Indeed, Regal, with 6,463 screens in 555 locations, has had a promising start to 2006, he said. And even as critics see DVD's as a threat to theaters, Mr. Campbell, 52, says the format is a boon to his business. Mr. Campbell spoke recently about the industry. Following are excerpts: Q. Is this a good time to be in the movie theater business? A. There are a lot of reasons it is a good time. Sometimes people focus too much on short-term trends and try to extrapolate when the evidence to the contrary is very strong. I believe that the softness in attendance for 2005 was primarily a function of just the product versus other periods. Let's go back to Thanksgiving of 2005. Since that time, over 70 percent of the weeks have been up versus the period last year. Yet we've seen very, very little coverage in the press saying maybe attendance is beginning to turn around. Q. Are film studios doing enough to draw people to theaters? A. We're already having an up quarter. The balance of the year looks pretty strong. I think the studios are doing all they can do to deliver, but consumer taste is fickle. It would be unfair to point fingers at the studios and say "You guys didn't provide commercial product last year." I don't think any studio consciously sets out to make a noncommercial movie. Q. Is variable pricing -- pricing a film by when it is shown, and charging different ticket prices for different films -- inevitable? A. As it relates to pricing on different days of the week, on different times of the day, that's always been part of the pricing grid. I think that model can be tweaked to include more variation. I don't think it's going to happen in individual films. I don't think we want to get into the business of trying to pass judgment on the quality of films and relate that to our pricing structure. Q. Is the threat of DVD's to movie theaters overstated? A. I think DVD's have been the savior of not only the studio model but have been beneficial to theater owners, too, because it funnels more money back into the studios, which in turn fuels higher production budgets, greater numbers of films, and so on. We have seen the window shrink from an average of about six months between theatrical to video 10 years ago to about four and a half months today. Some compression of that window over time is justified, or has been justified at least in the past, because we generate our piece of the pie at the box office much quicker today than we did a decade ago. People who run the studios are smart people, and I think they realize the tremendous value of having that theatrical launch pad. And I don't think that's going to change. They make films to be released on the big screen. Q. What percentage of your revenue comes from concessions? A. Generally it's two-thirds tickets, a little less than a third concessions and the last few percentage points would be miscellaneous revenue. Q. As for commercials before movies, how do you try to show them without angering customers? A. Granted, not everyone likes advertising. But we're saying, look, give us credit. We have improved what has been here for a long time. And given a choice of either looking at a blank screen for 20 minutes or looking at the old slide carousel with faded, upside down ads and trivia questions, would you rather look at a sleek, new, entertaining digitized pre-show? And most people, when asked that way, would say, "Oh, yeah." Q. Are ticket prices too high? A. Ticket prices in movie theaters have increased far less over the 10- to 15-year time period than live concerts, live plays, sporting events and other similar out-of-home venues. And during that period I think we have dramatically improved and invested in our business, billions of dollars as an industry to upgrade the theatergoing experience. Going to the movies is probably not only the absolute cheapest form of out-of-home entertainment today but it's probably the best value.

1219-> Return of Congress: New Tests for Bush
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28 - With the Senate on the verge of confirming Judge Samuel A. Alito Jr. to the Supreme Court and Republican leadership elections looming in the House, Congress returns next week in a volatile climate that will test whether President Bush can reassert himself this election year. In a stark contrast from last year, when Republican leaders fell in line behind Mr. Bush as he embarked on what would be a losing effort to overhaul Social Security, the president, weakened after a series of setbacks in the past year, now faces a challenge in rallying his own party behind some of his most important initiatives. He is pressing for Congress to complete work on a package of budget cuts, a reauthorization of antiterrorism legislation and a measure to combat illegal immigration. But in each case, enough Republicans are balking to put the outcome in doubt, a sign of the legislative difficulty that the White House faces as lawmakers focus on what matters most to them -- winning re-election. "People look at public opinion polls, and members of Congress are no exception," Representative David Dreier, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Rules Committee, said. "I think it would be a stretch to argue that President Bush is at his strongest point. But I do think there is an underlying understanding and respect for his leadership skills." Democrats have yet to show that they can mount a consistently effective opposition to the administration and the Republican majority on Capitol Hill, and they may have an uphill battle ahead. The president's poll numbers, which plummeted last year, are beginning to inch up. The vote on Judge Alito's confirmation is likely to give a big boost for Republicans heading into the State of the Union address. Party leaders say Mr. Bush's hand will grow only stronger after the speech, in which he is expected to offer smaller-scale legislative initiatives on topics like health care and immigration. "His rhetoric was more impressive than I've seen it in a while," Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, said after Senate Republicans went to the White House on Friday to discuss their agenda with Mr. Bush. "He still has a great reservoir of support among Republicans." Mr. Bush's prospects are complicated by the presidential aspirations of several senators from his party, including the majority leader, Bill Frist of Tennessee, whose plans to retire from Congress effectively make him a lame duck. Congressional Republicans are also concerned about their own low poll numbers. A New York Times/CBS News poll published on Friday found that 61 percent of Americans had an unfavorable view of Congress, the highest in a decade. With Washington consumed by the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal, Republicans know they need quick legislative gains to turn around those numbers. In addition to tax cuts, immigration, health care and energy prices, a new item is on the agenda, lobbying reform. "I think we kind of have to find our way again," Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said. "I always felt we were the party of reform. When you become the party of the status quo and you lose that vision of really wanting to be the reformers and the catalysts for change, that's when you have to start asking some really hard questions." Before Congress can reform anything, lawmakers have to dive into a plate piled high with leftovers, including the antiterrorism law known as the USA Patriot Act, which expires on Friday unless it is extended again, and a $40 billion budget-cutting plan passed by the Senate, but with changes that will require another vote in the House. That vote is scheduled for Wednesday, and Republicans concede that it will be close. Last week, one Republican in a Democratic-leaning district, Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, said in an interview that he was "revisiting the vote" and told leaders that he was "a lean yes, but not a strong yes." Another, Representative Rob Simmons, also of Connecticut, said he would switch to oppose the plan. Mr. Simmons, who voted for the cuts when they came up in the House late last year, said in a statement that he had an earful about them from constituents, including representatives of AARP, the retirees' lobby. "In a democracy," Mr. Simmons said, "the government must serve the people, not reign over them." In other business from last year, the House and Senate also have to reconcile huge differences over how much money to commit to extending tax cuts, including a plan to prevent millions of additional families from becoming subject to the unpopular alternative minimum tax. The president has been pressing Congress to make his tax cuts permanent, but the chances of that are slim. Congress traditionally does little in the way of landmark legislation in an election year, because partisan politics get in the way. Even so, Mr. Lott said he was optimistic that "this could wind up a very positive year, and one quite different from what people anticipated." But he cautioned that the Republican agenda had to be "simple, achievable and explainable." Democrats, too, are sounding hopeful, if only because they hope that Mr. Bush's poll numbers, which are rising but still comparatively low, will help them score gains. "An off-year election is a referendum on the president, and the president at this point is vulnerable," Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, said. "My experience is that members of the president's party who don't believe he is a going to be a good ally for re-election will start looking across the aisle. So I am hopeful that we will have more independence in the Republican ranks." One indicator of Republican independence will be how the party handles the new Medicare prescription drug program, which is creating considerable confusion among older voters. Republicans see Medicare as a potential trouble spot in November, and Representative Jack Kingston, the Georgia Republican who is vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, said he was urging his colleagues to confront the issue head on at home. "Our members have to get out there and engage in this Medicare confusion," Mr. Kingston said. "Medicare is a big problem." So big, in fact, that Mr. Dreier, the representative from California, suggested in an interview that he would be willing to entertain a proposal, put forth by Democrats, to change the law to allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices. The White House has steadfastly opposed any changes in the law, and Mr. Dreier did not say explicitly that he would support them. But, he added, "At this juncture, I think that anything we can do to make it better and more effective and help seniors have more access to prescription drugs, I'm willing to look at." In the Senate and House, this session will open with wild cards. In the Senate, which is expected to vote to confirm Judge Alito to the Supreme Court on Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee will turn its attention to President Bush's admission he authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on the conversations of Americans. Hearings are expected to begin next week. In the House, the immediate focus is on the Republican leadership, where Representatives Roy Blunt of Missouri, John A. Boehner of Ohio and John Shadegg of Arizona are vying to succeed Representative Tom DeLay, who stepped aside after being indicted in his home state, Texas, on charges in a case tied to campaign funds. The leadership race is closely linked to lobbying reform. With Democrats hammering the theme of a "culture of corruption," Republicans are eager to show they are serious about changing the way Washington does business. The Senate has begun hearings on lobbying law changes, and both chambers hope to pass bills by the spring. House Republicans intend to make changes even sooner, by amending their rules to bar former colleagues who are registered lobbyists from the House floor and gymnasium, a symbolic move intended to quell persistent complaints about the so-called revolving door between Capitol Hill and K Street, the lobbyists' center. The idea, Mr. Kingston said, is to dispatch quickly with the lobbying changes, to change the topic to more winning issues. "If the main re-election topic is Jack Abramoff, it's going to be hard because you're an incumbent," he said. "If the main topic is the economy, the war on terrorism and fuel independence, then you should be O.K."

1220-> Bush and Others Shed Donations Tied to Lobbyist
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 - President Bush and senior Republican lawmakers moved on Wednesday to dump thousands of dollars in campaign donations from Jack Abramoff, the former lobbyist, hastily distancing themselves as he pleaded guilty to two more criminal counts under his agreement with prosecutors. Mr. Bush will donate $6,000, the amount he received from Mr. Abramoff, Mr. Abramoff's wife and a lobbying client in his re-election campaign in 2004, to the American Heart Association, a spokesman said. The former House majority leader Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, and his successor, Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, also announced plans to give away campaign cash related to Mr. Abramoff. "The funds were donated in full compliance with federal law and disclosed properly and publicly," said a spokeswoman for Mr. DeLay, Shannon Flaherty. After months of insisting that there was nothing wrong with his alliance with Mr. Abramoff, with whom he traveled repeatedly overseas, Mr. DeLay decided to return $15,000 in donations that flowed from Mr. Abramoff. Mr. Abramoff's "admission of guilt and improper actions warranted our action to make something positive come of all this by donating the money to local charities rather than retaining it," Ms. Flaherty said. Similarly, a spokeswoman for Mr. Blunt denied that the money was tainted even as he made plans to shed it. "While we firmly believe the contributions were legal at the time of receipt, the plea today indicates that such contributions may not have been given in the spirit in which they were received," said the spokeswoman, Burson Taylor. As the shock waves of the plea agreement on Tuesday reverberated through official Washington, Mr. Abramoff appeared in federal court in Miami to enter two guilty pleas in a related fraud case. Prosecutors have agreed to drop the remaining four charges in the Florida indictment in exchange for Mr. Abramoff's cooperation in a broad corruption case against as many as 12 members of Congress who are suspected of accepting bribes in exchange for legislative favors. No charges have been brought against lawmakers. But people involved in the case said prosecutors were methodically trying to build a case against Mr. DeLay, other Republican lawmakers and, perhaps, one or two Democratic officials. That process, a participant said, could last several months as prosecutors try "to get it right." Under the closest scrutiny are former staff members for Mr. DeLay, including Ed Buckham, former chief of staff, and Tony C. Rudy, former deputy chief of staff, according to people involved in the case who insisted on anonymity because that part of the investigation was continuing and Justice Department officials had asked that it not be publicly discussed. The two are lobbyists at the Alexander Strategy Group. After 18 months of secret negotiations with investigators, Mr. Abramoff spent a second whirlwind day in the public eye as he flew to Florida for his final round of court pleadings. Just as a former business partner, Adam Kidan, did last month, Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and fraud involving their purchase of a casino boat fleet in 2000. Unlike his court appearance in Washington on Tuesday, this one did not have Mr. Abramoff making a statement. He also changed his look, wearing a baseball cap in lieu of the dark fedora that he emerged from court in the day before. In the courtroom, Mr. Abramoff stood motionless as Judge Paul C. Huck of Federal District Court went over the agreement. In August, Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Kidan were named in a six-count indictment charging conspiracy and wire and mail fraud in connection with buying the company, SunCruz Casinos. Like Mr. Kidan, Mr. Abramoff said in the plea agreement that he was guilty of lying to lenders to qualify for a $60 million loan to buy the $147.5 million fleet. His trial had been scheduled to start here next Monday. Judge Huck scheduled sentencing for March 16. Prosecutors have recommended that Mr. Abramoff be given more than seven years in prison, though that could be reduced if he cooperates fully with the government. The prosecutors also want the term to be concurrent with the sentence in the Washington case. "He will face the consequences of his actions," said R. Alexander Acosta, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida. "Mr. Abramoff's deceptions have and will continue to have significant consequences for those who he has victimized." At a news conference after the hearing, Mr. Acosta declined to discuss the relationship between the SunCruz and Washington cases. Nor would he discuss a separate case involving the killing of Konstantinos Boulis, also known as Gus, the former owner of the casino boat fleet who was gunned down in 2001 amid bitter wrangling over the sale. Mr. Abramoff and Mr. Kidan have denied involvement in the killing. Mr. Kidan's lawyers have said he might help state prosecutors in the case. Three other men were charged last fall and pleaded not guilty. Mr. Abramoff told the judge that he had knee surgery scheduled for Thursday, and his lawyers said he was returning to Washington immediately after the pleading. They requested and obtained the judge's permission for Mr. Abramoff to discuss his bond status with a probation official in the courthouse so he would not have to walk past the news media to a nearby building. "I don't know if you know what the outside of the courthouse looks like," Neal Sonnett, a lawyer for Mr. Abramoff, told the judge. "But Mr. Abramoff almost got knocked over this morning as we were coming in." Mr. Abramoff left through a side entrance around 2:15 p.m., hurrying into a limousine with another lawyer, Abbe D. Lowell. Though Mr. Kidan and Mr. Abramoff have pleaded guilty in the SunCruz case, prosecutors described the inquiry as continuing and said there could be more defendants. The Miami and Washington cases are operating on largely separate but parallel tracks, but may diverge now that Mr. Abramoff has reached an accord and Washington investigators will be using him as a witness against members of Congress. Until this week, prosecutors had used the Miami case largely as a way to pressure Mr. Abramoff to cooperate. Still, at least one member of Congress, Representative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio, has been mentioned in connection to the Miami case for reportedly helping Mr. Abramoff by placing a comment in The Congressional Record. "Stay tuned," said Lawrence D. LaVecchio, an assistant United States attorney.

1221-> S.E.C. to Issue Guidelines on Subpoenas to Journalists
WASHINGTON, March 2 - Responding to criticism, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday that it would move quickly to write a policy that determines when it is appropriate to issue subpoenas to journalists. The decision was announced by the S.E.C. chairman after a unanimous vote of the commissioners. The chairman, Christopher Cox, told reporters that he expected the policy would make clear that such subpoenas would be issued "after other avenues are first exhausted" and that they would be written in a way that is "least intrusive upon the First Amendment." The commission's decision came after criticism over subpoenas issued last month to two Dow Jones columnists, Herb Greenberg and Carol S. Remond, and to James J. Cramer, the host of "Mad Money" on CNBC. They were subpoenaed in an investigation into accusations of stock manipulation by a group of hedge funds and a research firm, Gradient Analytics. In a lawsuit filed in California, Overstock.com, an Internet retail company, has accused Gradient and the hedge funds of conspiring to improperly manipulate its stock. Gradient and the hedge funds have denied the accusations. The enforcement of the S.E.C. subpoenas was suspended, at least temporarily, after reporters called the commission on Friday to prepare articles about them. Mr. Cox issued a statement Monday that rebuked the enforcement division for failing to inform him and other officials about the subpoenas. Mr. Cox told reporters on Thursday that he did not intend for his Monday statement to chill the enforcement division from acting aggressively in prosecutions, and he took issue with critics who have said that the subpoenas illustrate that staff lawyers have been overly zealous. He also expressed strong support for the work of financial journalists, saying they had a "similar mission" to that of the commission. "The S.E.C. takes very seriously the role of financial journalists and we will do everything we can to work in a collaborative manner because we share a public trust," he said. "Our sensitivity to these First Amendment issues and journalistic responsibilities in no way requires us to back off from aggressive securities law enforcement." He said that he expected the new policy would not require that the full commission approve subpoenas to journalists. Under current practice, enforcement lawyers have broad discretion to issue subpoenas. Instead, the policy would set guidelines for issuing subpoenas to journalists. The commission already has a written policy on issuing subpoenas in other comparable situations. Mr. Cox said he expected the policy would be completed in the next two weeks. He said that he expected that subpoenas to journalists "will continue to be exceedingly rare."

1222-> West Virginia Miner’s Air Pack Was Expired
One of the 12 miners killed in the Sago Mine disaster was carrying an expired air pack. The device may have been four or five months beyond the manufacturer's recommended 10-year service life, said Ira Gamm, a spokesman for the mine's owner, International Coal Group Inc. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that the outdated pack was assigned to Jesse L. Jones, 44, of Pickens, who died of carbon monoxide poisoning.

1223-> Passenger Rights Under E.U. Rules When a Flight Is Delayed
The Zoom agent was wrong. Zoom, a Canadian carrier, in your case is bound by European Union rules, which apply to passengers who have a confirmed reservation and who have checked in on time for their flight taking off from any European airport on any airline, or flying to a European airport on an E.U. airline. But judging from the e-mail from Zoom that you forwarded to me, this is not at issue. Zoom contends that, under E.U. regulations, it is not liable for damages “if the operations irregularity occurred due to circumstances beyond the carrier’s control that could not be prevented even when following all necessary measures and taking all precautions and was a threat to flight safety,” and directs you to the small print of “the terms and conditions of the ticket.” Indeed, one of the ambiguities of the E.U. rules is that airlines do not have to pay compensation if a delay or cancellation is due to “extraordinary circumstances that could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.” No wonder many passengers are reporting that they are being denied compensation. According to the British Consumers’ Association, the circumstances are “probably limited to very extreme weather or other unexpected problems that compromise safety like security alerts.” Obviously, safety would be compromised if a plane took off with a sick pilot, but one could argue that a replacement might be anticipated by a well-run airline. Even if the delay were held to be within the airline’s control, I doubt if you would have been entitled to a full refund, which would have been the case if the flight had been canceled. For delays of two, three or four hours, depending on length of flight, all airlines departing E.U. airports are required to serve refreshments or meals, while delays of five hours or more entitle you to a hotel room, if an overnight stay is required, plus a refund if you decide not to travel. In any case, airline officials should be considerate enough to at least feed passengers during such a long delay. I hope this was the case with Zoom.

1224-> Albany Weighs Risks of Health Care Plan
ALBANY, Nov. 28 — Like the federal government’s military base-closing commission, the state commission that called on Tuesday for closing hospitals across New York State was created in part to shield elected officials from potential fallout for taking the politically risky step of closing and cutting big institutions in their districts. Unless the commission’s proposal is rejected by Gov. George E. Pataki, who requested it, or by both houses of the Legislature, it will become law. And the Legislature can vote the plan down only in its entirety — so lawmakers cannot try to save individual hospitals or nursing homes in their districts without killing the whole plan. As a carrot of sorts, $1.5 billion in federal money will be available to help the state pay for the significant short-term costs of closing hospitals. But the money will come only if the plan is approved and certain other conditions are met. The change of governors may give the plan some further political muscle. The report recommends many closings, downsizings and shotgun mergers of hospitals to be carried out by Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer’s health commissioner, who has yet to be named. That could give Mr. Spitzer, who said during his campaign that closing hospitals would be a tough but necessary step, the opportunity to close hospitals, and save the state money, without having to go through the politically difficult step of choosing which ones to shutter. For all the political insulation afforded by the proposal, the fact remains that for it to become law, the health care plan must survive the scrutiny of the powers that be in Albany — Governor Pataki and the Legislature. And the halls of the Capitol are haunted by the ghosts of big plans that met their demises. In this case, the leaders must act fast — by the end of December — if they want to derail the plan. But most of the major players took a wait-and-see attitude on Tuesday. Governor Pataki, who was traveling, said in a statement that he would study the plan. The Republican-led State Senate and the Democratic-led Assembly both said they would hold hearings before deciding what to do. And in a statement, Mr. Spitzer said he would review the report and announce whether, if he were governor, he would approve it and send it to the Legislature. “Our state’s broken health care system requires drastic reform, and it is critical that we consider these recommendations seriously,” Mr. Spitzer said. Although the report recommends closing five hospitals, and effectively a sixth, in New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the plan seemed reasonable. “When I skimmed it, it looked like they were perfectly reasonable decisions,” he said. “You will always find somebody to put on television saying they’re not happy with it. But we have to address the issue that if we want good, quality medical care and we don’t want to go bankrupt paying for it, we’re going to have to have the resources that we need in the places we need them and not continue to have resources that we don’t need, where they’re not used.” Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, the powerful hospital workers’ union, issued a measured statement, but suggested in an interview that a battle could be looming. “It is fair to say that today my phone has been ringing nonstop from employers, legislators, pro bono groups and others, asking, ‘What should we do?’ ” he said. “And numerous people from different parts of the state have said they want to defeat this process in Albany or challenge it in court.” There is not much time for all sides to decide what they are going to do. Governor Pataki has until Tuesday to decide whether to approve the proposal and send it to the Legislature. An aide to the governor said that he would probably send it along earlier, possibly before Friday. And since the governor has called the Legislature into a special session on Dec. 13 to consider legislation to allow for the civil confinement of sex offenders, many lawmakers expect that they will decide whether to reject the report by that week. Of course, the Legislature could also pass a new law giving itself a later deadline to deal with the plan. Even if the proposal becomes law, the Legislature could always amend parts of it next year. And then there are the potential lawsuits. Daniel Sisto, the president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents more than 550 hospitals, nursing homes and other health care agencies, said that some organizations that could be told to merge or close are gearing up for legal action. “If the Legislature agrees to let this go forward, some of these institutions have already indicated a willingness to go to court to block it,” he said. The next step will include legislative hearings, which could be a magnet for opponents. Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Nassau County and chairman of the Senate’s health committee, will hold a hearing on Friday. The Assembly plans to hold public hearings in New York City, Long Island, Westchester, Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo. Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Assembly’s health committee, said Democrats discussed the report on Tuesday at a conference in Manhattan. “The option of voting to reject the package is very much on the table,” he said. “The recommendations are nowhere near as bad as they could have been, but there are still major problems.”

1225-> Bunny Chow Gets a Place at the Beach
A FUNKY South African hole in the wall that ignited Fort Greene's restaurant row with a taste of post-apartheid cuisine has spread its palate to South Beach. Madiba Miami is open for business. Flip-flop-wearing diners and their scarf-wearing counterparts at Madiba New York will simultaneously savor ostrich carpaccio, prawns peri-peri and curry-filled bread called bunny chow. The owner of both restaurants is Mark Henegan; he named them after his hero, Nelson Mandela, whose nickname is Madiba. Mr. Henegan is as passionate about politics and "peaceful transition" as he is about introducing people to South African cooking. His recipes for oxtail stews, spicy samoosas and sosaties (skewers of marinated mutton) reflect Indian, French, Portuguese, English, Dutch and German influences. Mr. Henegan moved to Brooklyn from South Africa 18 years ago, evolving from "starving piano player" to dishwasher and waiter. He opened the restaurant at 195 DeKalb Avenue in 1999, calling it I-Shebeen -- for the social halls where South Africans gather -- Madiba. He owns it with his American-born wife, Jenny Kennard Henegan, 41. The two cooked at their home across the street and carried the food to the restaurant. "People told me, 'Mark, you're crazy,' " he said recently. "You'll get a brick through the window. You're a white South African." But the racially diverse neighborhood, then grittier, found Madiba pitch-perfect, with a mix of world music against a backdrop of spontaneous dancing and tablehopping. After a year, the couple expanded and the restaurant became known for its exuberant cast of characters, which occasionally includes South African dignitaries. Rum drinks are served in Mason jars and there is an all-South African wine list. Masks, paintings and used furniture from Amish country in Pennsylvania contribute to the hodgepodge. "We built it with our bare hands," said Mr. Henegan, 37. "It looks like it's falling apart, and that's the charm." The Florida restaurant, larger and with Art Deco influences, is "more upscale," he said, describing the first-floor lounge and dance floor as "Afro-chic," with seductive day beds. The upstairs dining area aims for rusticity; it is hung with old pots, pans and lanterns, and furnished with flea market finds. The menu is the same as in Brooklyn, with mielie (corn in husks), boerewors (vinegar-soaked beef sausages), bobotie (meat pies) and uncrispy French fries called slap chips. Mr. Henegan's brother, Dennis DuPreez, who is in charge in Brooklyn, says the Miami locale is like the Durban waterfront area where they grew up. There is another difference between the two restaurants: the Miami prices are higher, Mr. Henegan said, because the rent is "20 times more expensive."

1226-> California: Toddler’s Shooting Called Accident
The district attorney’s office in Los Angeles will not file charges against 11 police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a toddler during a gun battle with her father last year. The toddler, 19-month-old Suzie Pena, was being used as a human shield by her father, District Attorney Steve Cooley said in a memorandum. Prosecutors found the SWAT officers were trying to defend themselves and others when they accidentally killed the child, Mr. Cooley said. The father, Jose Raul Pena, exchanged gunfire with the police during the hourslong July 2005 standoff before he was fatally shot. There were illegal drugs in his system and traces of cocaine in the toddler’s system, officials said.

1227-> California: School District Settles Suit
A California school district has settled a lawsuit that charged it with illegally using race to set school attendance boundaries. Under the terms of the settlement, proposed changes to attendance boundaries in the Capistrano Unified School District will take effect essentially as proposed. However, the district agreed to remove references to race in the policy governing drawing of attendance boundaries, and one community within the district, where some plaintiffs reside, will send their children to the current school. A conservative public interest law firm, the Pacific Legal Foundation, filed the suit last year on behalf of parents opposed to the plan proposed by the district.

1228-> Buyout Discussions End
A technology outsourcing company, Affiliated Computer Services, said yesterday that buyout discussions with private equity firms had ended. Stock in the company, which is based in Dallas, fell $4.32, or 7 percent, to $56 a share. Reports of private equity bidders surfaced in late December, with a possible buyout price said to be $62 to $65 a share, or about $8 billion. That helped push Affiliated Computer's shares up more than 10 percent in recent weeks. Affiliated Computer said yesterday that it had been considering options, including a sale to private equity firms and a possible dual-class recapitalization proposal. "The company did not reach agreement on either of these alternatives and they are no longer being considered," the company said.

1229-> By the Numbers: One Scourge in 2 Forms
Type 1 and Type 2 are diseases in which the amount of sugar in the blood rises to dangerous levels. Neither is truly curable. Type 2 is more prevalent, representing more than 90 percent of all cases. Blood sugar, known as glucose, is the body's primary fuel and is produced during digestion. The sugar is then shuttled by the blood to cells with the help of the hormone insulin. In Type 1, a gland, the pancreas, no longer produces insulin because the immune system has destroyed the cells that make it. Thus sugar builds up in the blood, causing internal damage, while cells starve. In Type 2, the body can generally produce insulin, but the diabetic's cells cannot properly use it. In some Type 2 cases, insulin production is insufficient. (A third type, gestational diabetes, afflicts a small number of pregnant women. It usually vanishes after the birth, though it increases the woman's risk of developing Type 2.) How people get diabetes remains unclear. Type 1 typically surfaces in childhood and is believed to stem from genetic factors activated by an environmental trigger, like a . Type 1 diabetics require daily insulin injections to live. Traditionally, Type 2 appears in people over 40. Its onset is also tied to , but is linked to and inactivity as well. Researchers agree that in many cases, the disease can be delayed, and possibly prevented, through exercise and weight loss. At the same time, individual behavior cannot explain everything. Most overweight people never develop Type 2 diabetes. And thin people do get it. But most Type 2 diabetics are overweight, especially those who carry extra weight in their abdomens. People typically have Type 2 for 7 to 10 years before it is diagnosed, by which time its untreated presence will often have led to complications. Type 2 diabetics typically take medicines that improve responsiveness to insulin and stimulate the pancreas to make more of it.

1230-> Bush Cites 2 Million New Jobs in 2005 and Healthy Economy
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 - The United States generated about 200,000 new jobs a month in the last part of 2005, a healthy pace that President Bush immediately used on Friday as part of a broader campaign to promote his economic record and agenda of tax cuts, tighter limits on government spending and more trade. The nation added 108,000 jobs in December as the unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent, the Labor Department said Friday. The job creation in December was much lower than most forecasters had expected, but the Labor Department also said the nation added far more jobs in November, 305,000, than it had estimated last month. Over all, the nation added about two million jobs in 2005, about the same as in 2004. Hourly wages rose about 3.1 percent over the year, a faster clip than in 2004 but not quite enough to keep up with inflation. Mr. Bush and his top team spread out across the country on Friday to celebrate what administration officials see as a largely unappreciated success amid gloomy news about the war in Iraq, criminal investigations into prominent Republicans and a sense among many people that the economy is not as good as the numbers say it is. "The American economy heads into 2006 with a full head of steam," Mr. Bush told a gathering of business executives in Chicago, citing data not only on job creation, but also on gains in productivity and homeownership. Then, he used his appearance to demand that Congress extend his major tax cuts on wages and on dividends, capital gains and estate taxes. "By cutting taxes on income, we helped create jobs," Mr. Bush said. "To keep this economy growing, to keep the entrepreneurial spirit alive, to make sure that the United States of America is the most productive nation in the world, the United States Congress must make the tax cuts permanent." Vice President Dick Cheney echoed the theme at a visit to a Harley-Davidson factory in Kansas, while other top members of the economic team gave speeches in New York, Pittsburgh and Louisville, Ky. By almost all measures, last year was a good one for the American economy. The economy expanded by about 3.6 percent in 2005, the fourth consecutive year of solid growth, despite the soaring energy prices and the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. Consumer prices climbed at a rate of 3.5 percent for the 12 months ended in November, but only about 2 percent after excluding the volatile sectors of food and energy. Many analysts said, however, that Mr. Bush's policies were not the primary reason for the economy's strength. "Tax cuts had very little to do with it," said Narimen Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass. "You had a housing boom, which had very little to do with tax cuts, driving consumer spending. We also had before this year the dollar coming down, which helped drive up exports." Analysts also noted that hourly wages did not keep up with inflation last year. The Labor Department estimated that hourly wages were about 3.1 percent higher in December than they were a year earlier. Mr. Bush has been eager to highlight his differences with Democrats over economic policy. He has sought to set up a contrast between what the White House says is a job-creating agenda and a Democratic approach that White House officials say would lead to higher taxes, a further surge in spending on domestic programs and a drift toward protectionism. Republicans say they expect Mr. Bush to make those assertions increasingly in coming months and include them in his State of Union address, tentatively scheduled for Jan. 31. Mr. Bush and his aides skirted around some of the biggest challenges facing the economy, including the slowing of the housing market, the surge in energy prices and the potentially long-term destabilizing effect of the nation's growing foreign indebtedness. Democrats said that Mr. Bush was out of touch with the needs of the middle class and was thoughtlessly determined to expand tax breaks for the nation's wealthiest people. "While some corporations are enjoying increased profits, the benefits of economic growth still have not reached many hard-working middle-class families," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic Senate leader. "Instead of pushing to spend billions of dollars on tax breaks for millionaires and the special interests, Republicans in the White House and Congress should join Democrats in pursuing policies that will address the factors squeezing middle-class families today." Mr. Bush and his aides have said, however, that the economy's performance showed their approach was creating jobs. "Some in Washington said these tax cuts would not work," Mr. Cheney said at the Harley-Davidson factory. But after seeing the nation add more than four million jobs since 2003, he said, "it's getting pretty hard for the critics to make the case that somehow these tax cuts weren't good for the economy." Most forecasters predict that economic growth will continue at a respectable pace through 2006, though many also say that the pace will slow and they caution that there are some major uncertainties. Perhaps the biggest uncertainty is the housing market, which has expanded at an explosive pace for the last several years as a result of extremely low interest rates. With mortgage rates climbing, and home buyers less confident that house prices will keep rising, demand is expected to slow. In addition, homeowners could sharply scale back on home-equity loans. Investors had a mixed reaction to the new data on employment. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose slightly. The dollar dropped against the euro and the yen, an unusual response in the face of strong economic news. But stocks jumped to their highest levels since 2001. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 77.16 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,959.31, a level not seen since June 7, 2001. The Nasdaq composite index was up 28.75 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,305.62, its highest since May 2001. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 11.97 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,285.45. The new unemployment data provided mixed signals about the economy's underlying strength. Retailers shed 15,600 jobs in December, despite the holiday shopping rush, the Labor Department reported. Over all, employment at department stores and other general merchandise retailers was down, the government said, because seasonal hiring was lower than usual and the industry's total employment has been "trending down." Employment at construction companies fell by 9,000 jobs, the biggest drop since February 2003 and a possible indicator of a retrenchment in home building. The unemployment rate edged down to 4.9 percent in December from 5 percent in November, but that decline had little to do with the comparatively small gain in jobs. Rather, it stemmed from the fact that more people dropped out of the work force. The unemployment rate has ranged from 4.9 percent to 5.1 percent since last March.

A federal judge in Houston ruled that the Federal Emergency Management Agency cannot prohibit victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita from using rental aid to pay utility bills, saying the public "has a significant interest in keeping those residents from becoming homeless once again." Previously, FEMA had said that leftover rental assistance money could not be used to pay for utilities, even though the assistance, provided to tens of thousands of families, was based on fair market rental rates that included utility costs. The judge, David Hittner, said that allowing extra money to pay for utilities would encourage families to seek out lower rents.

1234-> An Earnest Meditation on a Life Devoted to Human Suffering
VIENNA, Nov. 27 — The problem lies in the title: “La Passion de Simone.” In a work described as “a musical journey in 15 stations,” Kaija Saariaho, the Finnish composer, and Amin Maalouf, the Lebanese-born writer who also provided the librettos for Ms. Saariaho’s other two operas, follow a traditional religious model in a homage to someone they compare to Jesus. But in doing so, they effectively distort what Simone Weil, the French philosopher, mystic and activist, was about. Weil, who died in 1943 at 34, is notoriously difficult to summarize. Devoted to the study of human affliction, she worked herself to the point of illness at various factory jobs to understand better the workers’ lot; she developed a profound relationship with Christianity, but felt that to actually be baptized (she was Jewish) would be to betray the unsaved masses. She died in England when, sick and weak, she refused to eat more than her compatriots were getting in war-torn France: the cause of death was starvation. A contradictory and off-putting figure, she is best understood through her own words, which have a lucidity that Mr. Maalouf’s heightened second-person text, an apostrophe to Weil from an imaginary sister interwoven with quotations from Weil herself, largely obscures. “La Passion de Simone,” which opened on Sunday evening at the Jugendstiltheater in an outlying district of Vienna (at the center of a hospital complex renowned as a headquarters of Nazi medical experimentation), is a centerpiece of Peter Sellars’s New Crowned Hope festival, which is all about social relevance and working to improve society: goals to which Weil devoted her life. So she would seem to be an ideal subject. But at New Crowned Hope, interpretations of social relevance are filtered to yield tones of heartfelt, teary-eyed sincerity in attempts at the beautiful and the good. In short, they bear the stamp of Mr. Sellars himself. Mr. Sellars, who also directed Ms. Saariaho’s other operas, kept this one appropriately spare and dark. He had the vocal soloist, Pia Freund, enact the things she was describing (ending by writhing on the floor in her final death agony), and added a silent dancer as a personification of grace, the masses or anything else that needed personifying. Adding a figure was a reasonable response to the challenge of trying to stage a piece that is not inherently dramatic. For what Ms. Saariaho has produced is a meditation rather than an opera, with music that is mystical, angular, episodic, surging. Sustained tones in the strings or brasses, burnished with a kiss of gongs and electronic boosts, spread out a carpet of sound to support individual incidents, in which the energetic conductor, Susanna Malkki, often whips Klangforum Wien into an anguished frenzy. But like John Adams in his new opera-oratorio for New Crowned Hope, “A Flowering Tree,” Ms. Saariaho seems to have set out to create something beautiful and moving, and thereby achieved a self-conscious lushness that may be an aural hallmark of Mr. Sellars’s stamp. The piece was written for Dawn Upshaw, who had to cancel her New Crowned Hope commitments to deal with early-stage breast cancer, according to a statement from her manager earlier this month. Her replacement, Ms. Freund, offers a workable, straightforward voice, whose limitations are blurred by passionate intensity and smoothed away to some extent by the microphone. Amplification is necessary; the action plays on a raised platform at the back of the stage, with the orchestra spread before Ms. Freund and the Arnold Schoenberg Choir literally beneath her feet: an ocean of loud sound. What comes across is incidental music, since the story being told lies outside the piece itself. It is an accompaniment to Weil’s thought rather than an elucidation of it. The work shows yet again that it is hard to make cutting-edge art in a genre that is no longer inherently cutting edge. In fact, this piece represents many things Weil wanted to get away from; even if it is conceived in a spirit of breaking down barriers and challenging the status quo, a work presented in this form will reach only the elite it ostensibly sets out to reach past.

1238-> San Francisco Hedge Fund Invested in YouTube
Sequoia Capital, the marquee Silicon Valley venture capital firm, is not the only investor that is poised to score big when Google completes its $1.65 billion buyout of the Internet video-sharing site YouTube. Artis Capital Management, a hedge fund based in San Francisco, invested alongside Sequoia in the second round of financing in April 2006, when YouTube received $8 million, according to regulatory filings. Individuals also received small stakes in the company, said Roelof Botha, a South African and the Sequoia partner who led its investments in YouTube. Previously, YouTube had identified only Sequoia as an investor. In a news release in April that is still on its Web site, YouTube said it had “received $8 million in Series B funding from Sequoia Capital.” “They are a family business,” Mr. Botha said of Artis. “They didn’t have a desire to be in the limelight.” He would not say how much Artis had invested. A spokeswoman for YouTube, Julie Supan, said Artis “chose to remain behind the scenes.” John Milani, chief operating officer at Artis, declined to comment on Tuesday. Regulatory filings show that at the end of June, Artis managed more than $1.2 billion in investments. Its backing of YouTube was reported in PE Week, a newsletter and online service owned by Thomson Financial. Mr. Botha described Artis as “primarily a hedge fund that also invests in private companies as a passive investor.” He said friends and advisers of YouTube’s founders also invested in the first round of financing in November 2005, when the company received $3.5 million. Mr. Botha declined to identify those investors.

1239-> Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Orange: 16 Injured In School Fight
Police officers used pepper spray to break up a fight yesterday morning at Orange High School, resulting in the school's brief evacuation and about 16 injuries, officials said. Three 17-year-old students began fighting around 10 a.m. and 200 to 300 students gathered to watch as officers responded, said Edward Lucas, the police director. The three students were charged with fighting, the police said, and 10 others were taken to hospitals with minor injuries, most with respiratory problems from the spray. JOHN HOLL (NYT)

MICHAEL--Sidney, 85 years old, passed away on Saturday, April 1, 2006, from injuries sustained in a fall on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Sid, a lifelong resident of New York, was the owner of Capitol Distributors Corporation and a former board member of the City Athletic Club. A veteran of World War II, Sid served in the Army artillery, taking part in the Battle of the Bulge, avoiding capture by leading a group of men off the road and into the hills after discerning that the road signs had been reversed by German infiltrators. Sid later joined up with Airborne troops who had liberated Bastogne and, later still, rejoined the artillery units that marched into Germany. A gentle giant of a man, Sid was a superb athlete, avid sportsman, and was once asked to audition for the role of Tarzan, later given to Johnny Weissmuller. As a young man he was an expert rider and starred on the track and field team at DeWitt Clinton High School. Later in life loved deep sea fishing, golf and tennis. Sid loved taking adventuresome trips to places such as the Amazon, China, Africa, the Galapagos, New Zealand, etc. When a family member was not available to accompany him, Sid thought nothing of striking out on an adventure on his own, frequently telling his children that they should live with memories, not regrets. Family was the most important thing in Sid's life. He is survived by his wife of fifty three years, the former Lea Wynperle, as well as his two children, Lawrence Michaels and Leslie Michael Tabet, and their spouses Kathryn Flynn Michaels and Christian Antoine Tabet. In addition, he is survived by his adoring grandchildren Serena Michaels, Sarah-Rose Tabet and Max Tabet. Their loss is profound. Sid is also survived by his sisters, Miriam Schoeneman and Frances Randall, their children and grandchildren, as well as the family of his late brother, Melvin Michaels, with whom he worked in partnership for nearly fifty years. In addition, he is survived by his brotherin-law Bernard Wynperle, his wife Ann, and his mother-inlaw Sara Wynperle, as well as numerous friends and associates. The family also wishes to acknowledge the longtime devotion of the Michael's housekeeper Gloria Ortiz. All our hearts are broken by this unexpected tragedy. Services will be held at 12:45, Tuesday, April 4th, at The Riverside, 76th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The family is requesting that any donations be made in Sid's name to his longtime friend, Dr. Edgar Housepian at the Neurological Institute, 710 West 168th Street, New York, NY 10032.

1242-> Annual Sampler Ranges From Tableaus to a Pas de Deux
City Center’s wildly successful Fall for Dance festival got under way Thursday night, expanded by popular demand. Not expanded in format: there are still six programs offering five dance companies each, for $10 a ticket. But four of the six programs are now being repeated; Thursday’s opener was seen again last night. The festival, now in its third year, has been a success not just because it’s inexpensive, or because City Center has cleverly marketed it. It is also successful because the center has increasingly been able to attract not only unusual and interesting smaller groups, but also some of the heavy hitters in dance. And more and more companies are going all out, with lengthy pieces and elaborate production values. Thursday night’s bill was particularly weighted toward big names and elaborate productions. Yet it could be argued that the shortest and simplest number (an eight-minute pas de deux in plain costumes on a bare stage) was the most moving, the most mysterious, the most heartily cheered. That was “Before After,” choreographed and costumed by Annabelle Lopez Ochoa for the Dutch National Ballet and first seen in Amsterdam in 2002. It is the story of a relationship, with a voice-over intoning fragments of speech (“just before the light changes, the sound changes,” attributed to a New York street poet referring to traffic lights). The two fine dancers, Julie Gardette and François Rousseau, started dressed mostly in black, with one arm in colored fabric. They take off the black tops to reveal new tops in muted colors. By the end each is topless. He walks away, leaving her hunched on the floor. The dancing was sinuous and strong, and the dance as a whole deserved its cheers. The weakest number was the last, the Pennsylvania Ballet’s presentation of excerpts from Matthew Neenan’s setting of recorded songs by Rufus Wainwright. When it was new, in February 2005, there were six songs. (The title, “11:11,” refers to one not used.) On Thursday there were five, so the audience pretty much got the whole ballet. The trouble here was not in the dancing, which was excellent, but the curious mismatch between Mr. Wainwright’s haunted, not to say mopey, songs and Mr. Neenan’s mostly neat and clean balletic choreography. Occasionally there are flashes of wit and mystery, but not enough. The program began with the novelty of the night, the New York debut of the Yi-Jo Lim Sun Dance Company from South Korea. Its 20 minutes were devoted to boldly colorful dance that looked traditional but seemed to introduce some more modern choreographic notions as well. Mr. Lim took the lead role in most of the numbers, but there were 25 other dancers feverishly changing costumes between the short segments. It was like a potted survey of Korean dance, and slightly didactic as such. That left two familiar names, both with pieces first seen some years ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Bill T. Jones resurrected 25 minutes of “Last Supper at Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” his three-hour pageant, according to the program, of “history, spirituality, slavery and identity” from 1990. Even so radically truncated, this was a boldly disparate fresco, with 21 dancers (including Mr. Jones as a kind of ghostly griot), a complex set and props, and Julius Hemphill’s fine jazz sextet playing live onstage. As usual, Mr. Jones reaches, or overreaches, trying to say something about almost everything; he even inserted a lament about torture. As usual, there is such virtuosity and poetry and flair on hand that he achieves an awful lot. The most perfectly realized major work of the night was Trisha Brown’s “Set and Reset” (1983). It came from the period when Harvey Lichtenstein of the Brooklyn Academy was marrying famous choreographers, composers and designers into single, sometimes unwieldy unions. “Set and Reset” is anything but unwieldy. With a fascinating design by Robert Rauschenberg (geometric shapes, with flickering old newsreels projected on them) and an even better score by Laurie Anderson (mostly quirkily instrumental), Ms. Brown sets seven performers in sheer, flowing costumes (also by Mr. Rauschenberg) to dancing in her characteristic mature style. There are loping runs, gracious twirls, loosely swinging arms. Everything is calm, cool, yet warmly humanistic. It’s some piece.

1243-> Arts, Briefly; Twice-Told Tales Cost ABC
With ABC's usually commanding Sunday-night lineup in repeats, CBS was the most-watched network for the evening. But afternoon football on Fox, which spilled into prime time, gave Fox the lead among adults 18 to 49, while NBC's "Sunday Night Football" coverage of the Seattle Seahawks' nail-biting victory over the Denver Broncos finished the night in second place in that category. CBS outdrew ABC in both the 9 and 10 o'clock time slots, according to Nielsen's estimates, as CBS's "Cold Case" (14.2 million viewers) and "Without a Trace" (14.1 million) surpassed ABC's "Desperate Housewives" (12 million) and "Brothers & Sisters" (6.9 million). But at 8, CBS's "Amazing Race 10" (10.7 million) could not defeat ABC's "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" repeat (12.7 million). On Friday night ABC ranked first over all with a broadcast of the Robert Zemeckis film "The Polar Express" from 8 to 10. Also on Friday, a special two-hour episode of NBC's "Las Vegas" earned a season high 10.3 million viewers from 9 to 11, leading the 10 o'clock hour and giving NBC a second-place finish for the night.

1244-> Watching Prices Swing in Health, Housing and Stocks
BLUE-CHIP stocks flirted with record highs, buoyed by record corporate profits and moderating energy prices. The Dow Jones industrial average briefly poked above its record closing high during the day on Thursday, but later retreated to finish just shy of the mark. Then shares slipped in late afternoon trading yesterday, to close at 11,679.07, a bit shy of the record close of 11,722.98. Health care costs also continued to climb, but house prices fell for the first time in a decade. That led some economists and stock analysts to speculate that economic growth may be slowing. Almost in affirmation, the government reduced its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to a 2.6 percent annual rate from 2.9 percent. Tobacco companies lost a significant ruling in another big lawsuit when a federal judge in Brooklyn granted class-action status to a lawsuit in which smokers say that the industry fraudulently promoted light cigarettes as a safer alternative to regular cigarettes. The case, which names Philip Morris, R. J. Reynolds, British American Tobacco, Liggett, Brown & Williamson and Lorillard, differs from many previous lawsuits in that it does not say smokers suffered personal injury. Instead, it focuses on fraud. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs said tens of millions of people could join the class and damages could climb as high as $200 billion. Because the suit was filed under a federal racketeering law, damages could be tripled. Three other class-action cases based on the same theory have been certified, but they are all in state courts and involve fewer smokers. Congress is considering two bills that would increase regulation of the tobacco industry. One would ban the use of the terms “light” and “low tar.” Another would give the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco. For the first time in 11 years, monthly figures showed the median price of a previously owned home falling as inventories of unsold homes rose to levels not seen in more than a decade. The National Association of Realtors said that the median price in August fell to $225,000, down 1.7 percent from August 2005. That was the first time since April 1995 that the national median price was lower than the month a year before. Volume fell as well as prices. The number of existing-homes sold, which make up about 85 percent of all home sales, declined 0.5 percent in August from July. They had slumped in that month by 4.1 percent from June. At the same time, the Commerce Department said that sales of new homes rose 4.1 percent in August from July. But economists warned against reading too much into those figures because the government adjusted the July figure downward before making the comparison. The latest Commerce Department statistics on all construction spending will be released on Monday. Falling gasoline prices sent consumers’ moods soaring in September, the Conference Board said. Its consumer confidence index rose to 104.5, from 100.2. in August. Analysts had expected the index to rise to 103. A steady job market helped brighten consumers’ moods. The Labor Department said the number of people making initial claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 6,000, to 316,000, last week. Still, the Conference Board said it found lingering concern about jobs and wages. The Labor Department will shine some light on the employment outlook on Friday, when it releases statistics on job creation, wages and the unemployment rate in September. The cost of employee health care coverage rose 7.7 percent this year, according to a survey sponsored by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. That is the lowest increase since 1999, but was still more than double the inflation rate and more than the increase in workers’ incomes. At the same time, people had to pay a greater share of the cost of their care: $2,973 annually for family coverage, on average, out of a total cost of $11,481. The government forecasts that 20 million to 30 million people will have high-deductible insurance policies tied to health savings accounts by 2010. About three million people had such plans last December. Andrew S. Fastow, who engineered the collapse of the Enron Corporation and then helped prosecutors convict other executives who helped facilitate the fraud, was sentenced to six years in federal prison. Mr. Fastow had agreed to serve 10 years in jail when he pleaded guilty in 2004 to two counts of conspiracy, but Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt of Federal District Court said he deserved less time behind bars because he had cooperated with prosecutors and with investors seeking to recoup some of the billions lost when Enron collapsed in scandal in 2001. Mr. Fastow, Enron’s former finance chief, has surrendered nearly $30 million in cash and property to compensate investors. Coincidentally, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former chief executive of WorldCom, surrendered at a federal prison in Louisiana to begin a 25-year sentence for his role in the $11 billion accounting fraud that toppled that company. Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron’s former chief executive, is scheduled to be sentenced next month. He was convicted of fraud in May. As Hewlett-Packard’s former chairwoman, Patricia C. Dunn, prepared to testify before a Congressional committee investigating the company’s spying operation on its own directors, journalists and others, its general counsel, Ann O. Baskins, resigned. In quitting, Ms. Baskins joined a list of Hewlett-Packard officers who have left the company in the aftermath of the spying scandal. In addition to Ms. Dunn, who resigned last week, Anthony R. Gentilucci, H. P.’s manager of global investigations, and Kevin Hunsaker, director of ethics, have also stepped down. The company is waiting to see if prosecutors will file criminal charges in the case. Investigators used by H .P. may have illegally misrepresented themselves to obtain private phone records.

1246-> Stocks Slide, Ending Dow's Five-Week Advance
The broad stock market declined last week, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average down after five consecutive weeks of advances. Worries that rising commodity prices might be setting off inflation throughout the economy weighed on the stock market. The Labor Department said Friday that prices of imported goods rose 2.1 percent in April, compared with a decline of 0.2 percent in March. And a monthly University of Michigan survey found that consumer confidence in May decreased sharply. On Tuesday, Federal Reserve policy makers raised short-term interest rates by another quarter percent, to 5 percent, and said further increases might be in store. General Motors rose more than 12 percent for the week, the best performance among the Dow industrials. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 196.75 points, or 1.7 percent, to close at 11,380.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 34.52 points, or 2.6 percent, to close at 1,291.24. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 98.79 points, or 4.2 percent, to close at 2,243.78. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 5.19 percent from 5.10 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

1247-> Weather Looks Favorable for Shuttle Launching
After more than a week of storm delays, NASA may get its best weather yet for launching the space shuttle Atlantis, officials said. There is only a 20 percent chance that the weather in Florida will prohibit the shuttle from blasting off as planned tomorrow at 12:28 p.m., said Katherine A. Winters, the shuttle weather officer. The window for the launching opens before afternoon thunderstorms normally blow through. If Atlantis does not lift off, NASA will try again Thursday and possibly Friday. The shuttle was originally scheduled to lift off Aug. 27 on a mission to resume construction of the International Space Station, but that takeoff was delayed after a lightning strike at the launching pad.

1248-> To Save a Crippled City
It took a while, but President Bush finally seems to get what happened to New Orleans. More important, the administration sees what sort of basic commitments are needed if southern Louisiana is going to have the chance to rebuild itself. But he is going to have to push hard on the storm victims' behalf. There are frightening signs coming from Washington that legislators may shortchange distressed homeowners, playing politics as usual with relief funds. Louisiana certainly has every reason to be wary. As President Bush pointed out last week in New Orleans, legislators underfinanced the levee-rebuilding process by $1.5 billion. Less than three months before the start of the next hurricane season, the White House is still trying to get the money put back to reinforce the walls protecting the city. Now, lawmakers from other states are lobbying to get some of the funds intended for rebuilding Louisiana. Texas wants money to defray more of the costs from sheltering evacuees and putting their children into the state's schools. Mississippi has many rebuilding projects along its devastated coastline that could use more money. Those things should be considered. But not by siphoning money out of the Louisiana housing plan. Last month the Bush administration requested $4.2 billion in additional housing aid for Louisiana. The figure grew out of intense negotiating sessions in January and February between the state's recovery body and the administration's Katrina czar, Donald Powell. Both sides finally settled on a simple formula for rebuilding the storm-ravaged state. Homeowners would receive up to a maximum of $150,000 based on the pre-Katrina value of their property, with any insurance payments subtracted. The plan required the additional $4.2 billion in block grants. It was less than the Louisiana team had hoped for, but it was a commitment that would allow rebuilding to begin. From the very start Louisiana has been at a disadvantage. Its state and local officials have not always appeared competent. The state's Congressional delegation hurt its own cause by asking for an absurd $250 billion in reconstruction funds. But now only one thing matters: helping the hundreds of thousands of evacuees return and rebuild or, at minimum, freeing them from mortgages on ruined properties before they must declare bankruptcy. According to federal figures, more than 200,000 houses and apartments suffered major or severe damage in Louisiana, mostly in and around New Orleans. That is 12.4 percent of all housing units in the entire state. It is devastation you have to see to believe -- though many members of Congress have yet to find time to make the trip.

1249-> North Was an Actual Pro; South Was Playing Like One
How do professional sportsmen and women make a living? One way is from prize money. Another is from commercial sponsorships, particularly for athletes who are on television, like golfers and race drivers. How do bridge professionals make a living? Not from prize money, because there is none in the United States (or at world championships). Not from commercial sponsorships, either. It is from play for pay. The professionals are hired by clients, who enjoy the experience of playing with an expert. One of the most successful pros is John Solodar, who lived for most of his life in New York City but a few years ago migrated to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He is a top expert, having won the Bermuda Bowl world team championship in 1981. He is also popular as a professional because he has a placid presence at the table. But he cannot win events all on his own; his partners have to contribute. That was demonstrated in the diagramed deal, which was played during a sectional tournament in Vero Beach, Fla. South was Jane Sedlmayr, who needed a few master points to reach the Gold Life Master plateau (2,500 points). After Sedlmayr opened three hearts, showing seven respectable hearts and usually 6 to 10 high-card points, Solodar immediately introduced Roman Key Card Blackwood by jumping to four no-trump. The five-spade reply showed the heart queen and two key cards, either the trump king and one ace, or two aces. North optimistically asked if his partner had anything extra, and South answered in the negative by signing off in six hearts. After West led the diamond king, it looked as if there were 12 easy tricks: two spades, seven hearts, one diamond and two clubs. But when South took the first trick on the board, played a heart to her ace and cashed the heart king, she received the bad news, West discarding a low club. Now declarer’s only chance to make the contract was with a trump coup. At Trick 12, she had to be left with the queen-ten of hearts hovering over East’s jack-nine and to have the lead anywhere but in her own hand. Then East would not win a trump trick. South had to take three ruffs in her hand to reduce her trump length to two, the same as East. And she had to time the play perfectly, using her dummy entries in exactly the right sequence. Declarer played a spade to dummy’s king, cashed the spade ace, discarding a diamond from her hand, and ruffed a spade. She continued with a club to the king, a second spade ruff, a club to the ace and a club ruff, East throwing a diamond. It was Trick 11. South led her remaining diamond. West took the trick, but whatever he played next allowed declarer to coup East’s trumps. Plus 1,430 was a tied top on the board, they won the event, and Sedlmayr obtained the necessary master points.

1250-> Dream Weavers
Even for a children's book author, the popular and celebrated Lois Lowry is almost alarmingly prolific. Her two series of lighthearted adventures for younger readers about Anastasia Krupnik and her brother, Sam, number 13 books to date, and her other two series (about the Tate siblings and a high-spirited girl called Gooney Bird) add another five volumes to an already large oeuvre. But her critical reputation depends mainly on her young-adult books, especially the Newbery Medal-winning "Number the Stars," about a Danish family's resistance to the Nazis, and her brilliant and often disturbing trilogy of dystopian novels, "The Giver" (which also won the Newbery), "Gathering Blue" and "Messenger." Lowry's latest novel, "Gossamer," stands in the middle of her range. Less provocative than her Newbery winners, it's also more serious than the Krupnik and Gooney Bird books. The opening is a rare excursion for Lowry into pure fantasy, as two tiny dream-givers venture out one night on their appointed rounds to bestow dreams on the humans they've been assigned. It's also a training mission, as the older dream-giver, Fastidious (who is as tetchy as her name suggests), attempts to show the ropes to the easily distracted Littlest One. ("Are we a kind of dog?" she asks at an inopportune moment.) Soon, in a shrewd bit of management, the head dream-giver replaces Fastidious with the more patient Thin Elderly, and Littlest One, who is as bright and ambitious as she is immature, begins to learn the dream-giver technique of picking up fragments of happy memories from inanimate objects — photographs, pieces of clothing, dishes — and transforming them into pleasant dreams. It's a charming introduction, written with Lowry's characteristic elegance and economy, and with her usual attentiveness to the internal consistency of her imaginary world. In the meantime, in alternate chapters, we are introduced to the dream-givers' human clients: an old woman; a troubled boy named John whom she takes in as a foster child; and John's hardscrabble young mother, who is struggling to clean up her life and get her son back. Lowry unflinchingly examines the old woman's loneliness, the boy's rage and the mother's desperation. John is a particularly heartbreaking character, full of bluster as he tries to make sense of his abandonment by his abusive father and his well-meaning but immature mother. The woman who takes him in (who is never named) treats John with unflagging tenderness, and their relationship is the most absorbing element of the book. It's a mark of Lowry's artistry that in their scenes together, even when John is at his most thuggish — whining about the woman's lack of a television or threatening to kill her dog — we never lose sight of the anxious boy underneath. Even as the woman begins to win John's trust, he falls victim to the book's other supernatural element, the terrifying sinisteeds — giant, rampaging horses, literal nightmares, who are the enemies of the dream-givers. The two strands of the book, the realistic and the supernatural, are brought together as Thin Elderly and Littlest One engage the sinisteeds in a climactic battle for John's heart and soul. If "Gossamer" has a flaw, it is that John's very believably evoked problems are resolved not so much by the real-world patience of his foster guardian as by the intercession of tiny supernatural creatures; it's a little hard to credit that a troubled boy's salvation could lie in happy dreams. Still, the ending of "Gossamer" is satisfying and even reassuring, without being sugarcoated. Lowry's gifts as a writer — her precise and evocative prose, her vivid characters, her ability to ratchet up suspense — are displayed at full strength in this enormously entertaining and finally very moving novel.

1251-> Little Graduates, With Some Big Tests Yet Ahead
Commencement ceremonies are usually marked by a rendition of "Pomp and Circumstance," a speaker giving advice and parents beaming over their children's accomplishments. The ceremony at the Children's Learning Center at the Helen Keller Services for the Blind in downtown Brooklyn yesterday had all those features, even though none of the 14 graduates exceed 5 years of age. All ofthem face challenges that would overwhelm most children their age. They all have vision impairments, and many of them have hearing problems and other disabilities. A doctor had predicted that one of them, born very prematurely, would not live a year. But now each has conquered preschool. And yesterday at the center, the students, wearing blue gowns with yellow collars, made their way down the aisle to accept their first diplomas. The school's music director played "Pomp and Circumstance" on the flute, and the speaker, Matthew P. Sapolin, executive director of the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, told the graduates that they could achieve their goals. "Anything is possible when support like what's in this room is there," he said. Just as high schools bestow superlatives upon their seniors  most likely to succeed, best smile, best dressed  some of the center's graduates seemed ripe for titles of their own. Moise Joseph, 4, emerged as the man in charge. "He's like the mayor of this school," said Antoinette Richards, a clinical social worker. Moise spent his first two years in and out of hospitals. When he came to Helen Keller Services two years ago, he could not speak and had difficulty walking, said his teacher, Irina Kocherova. He is the type who wants to know just "what are you doing and where are you going," Ms. Kocherova said. Now, Moise not only walks, but also struts. "It's like a fashion show every morning," Ms. Kocherova said. Dior Wiggan, 4, was the showman, his voice ringing out even above that of the musical director, who led the group in a song called "I Will Be Your Friend." Urging his twin brother, Justin, to sing louder, Dior punctuated the song with a shout of, "Get going!" then, "Everybody sing!" all the while smiling at the crowd. Dior's mother, Shawnette Wiggan, said that the twins act like children who have never had a disability. "They've shocked me so much," she said. The twins were born about three months premature; Dior has no right eye, and Justin is legally blind in his right eye and has very poor vision in his left eye. "I don't even know what's next; they just have to show me," she said. Now, Dior and Justin, along with the other graduates, must make the transition into elementary schools. The principal of the center, Greg Santamoor, said the graduation ceremony was meant to help the students move on from the school, which serves children from 6 months to 5 years old. "Celebrating their accomplishments helps kids cope with the changes that will happen as they get older," Mr. Santamoor said. "We do have to prepare these kids for every stage of the game." Most will continue with occupational, physical and speech therapy at their new schools, but they must learn to deal with a new environment, new teachers and new rules. Lindy Jones, whose son, Mikael, 4, is blind, said: "I expect him to have a little withdrawal. With everything, he has a problem with it at first." He is even uncomfortable trying out a new pair of shoes, she said. But Ms. Jones said she expected Michael to get acclimated fast, just as her son has learned to walk with a cane and begun to read Braille. Mr. Santamoor said that the parents at the graduation ceremony may have actually learned as much as their children did at the center. For example, parents of children who had trouble walking were instructed on the finer points of using a cane, to allow them to help coach their children when they were at home. The parents have also been told what to look for at the new schools the children will attend to make sure they receive their fair share of attention. Maria Carmen Navarro, whose son Juan, 4, graduated yesterday, said she had learned how to bridge the gap between the sighted world and that of her son, who lost vision in one eye to glaucoma. "I feel stronger now," she said. "I learned to understand him."

1252-> Sandwich Shop Stays, Saved by a Regular
"I'M a preservationist," said Josh Konecky, 52, the big guy who has been standing behind the register since last fall at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop. Before that, he was on the other side of the marble counter, on one of the 23 turn-stools, a regular with such a taste for old New York that he wanted to eat it. Mr. Konecky sees himself as the curator of a lunch experience that -- as the sign outside reads -- has been around since 1929. He stands on linoleum that is worn to a Jasper Johns bull's-eye: green fading to red, to yellow, down to raw floorboards. He bought the place from the previous owner, Steve Oh, who bought it from Louie Weisberg, who acquired it from the Eisenbergs in the late 70's. But Mr. Konecky's purchase wasn't seamless: a rumor spread around the Flatiron district, in the toy companies and elsewhere, that Eisenberg's had closed, going the way of so many establishments from that era that had managed to hang on this long but no longer. Yet Eisenberg's persists like a reliable meatloaf on Fifth Avenue between 22nd and 23rd Streets, across the street from the Flatiron Building, between Jamba Juice and Lucky Jeans, which used to be Mom's Cigars with a candy shop in front and a humidor in back (Cubans even farther back, if you knew the owner). Mr. Konecky has an 18-year lease from his landlord, who eats there every day (for $2), occasionally ordering half a pound of Muenster cheese for his wife, who runs a Russian bookstore upstairs. Wooden signs hang like pennants in front of a grease-distorted mirror (like in a funhouse -- one side makes you look tall and skinny; the other side, more like what you ate): sliced peaches, Jell-o ("We don't have Jell-o anymore; that sign is from the 50's."), bacon and egg, ham and egg, bacon and tomato, cream cheese, peanut butter and jelly, egg creams. "Write everything on a bag," Mr. Konecky quoted the previous owner as telling him, one of the few instructions. He pointed to a stack of small brown paper bags, the only receipts his customers get. One sign says, "Welcome to the Hawaiian Room, your host Phil." It's really just a section of the counter where Phil, a Hawaiian from Brooklyn, has worked for three decades. A thickly frosted devil's food incubates under a cake dome. "Food tastes like food here," said a patron, Oliver McIntyre, who runs an advertising business, reaching over the counter to grab a half-gallon carton of whole milk to pour some into his coffee. He recounted watching, as if in slow motion, a man eating a giant doughnut the other day, finishing it off to announce how terrible it was.

1253-> Both Ford and G.M. to Scale Back Production
DETROIT, March 1 - Both General Motors and Ford said Wednesday they would scale back production in the second quarter, a move that reflects their falling sales and shrinking market share in the United States. As has been the case for much of the last year, Asian automakers' sales grew steadily last month. Honda's sales rose the most, with an 8.7 percent increase. Toyota, which has become accustomed to double-digit monthly gains, had a more modest 2.4 percent increase last month. That was in contrast to a 2.6 percent drop at G.M. and a 4.1 percent decline for Ford. Sales at DaimlerChrysler increased 4.3 percent, aided by a surge at Mercedes-Benz and sales to rental car and commercial vehicle fleets. Ford's fleet sales were also up, but that did little to offset a decline in sales at dealerships. Over all, auto sales in the United States rose a modest 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 16.6 million, according to Ward's AutoInfo Bank. In January, G.M., Ford and Chrysler all benefited from unusually high fleet sales. That helped lift sales at all three companies. In February, however, G.M. cut back on less-profitable fleet sales and paid the price. "It sure is going to be a struggle as we back off on rental sales," Paul Ballew, G.M.'s senior sales analyst, said. Noting that the strategy was consistent with the company's North American turnaround plan, he added, "You take your medicine and you go on." Much of General Motors' revival rests upon its new line of large S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks. In February, there were signs that the new Chevrolet Tahoe was exceeding the company's expectations, but that might not matter if G.M. cannot stabilize its market share. "It seems like we're still kind of waiting to see if it's really going to move the needle," Ron Tadross, a Banc of America Securities analyst, said to Mr. Ballew in a conference call Wednesday afternoon. "You guys talk about the new products and how well they're doing. I guess it's just hard to say that that's important if you can't get your overall sales up." Ron Pinelli, president of Autodata, an industry statistics firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said the main difference between thriving automakers and struggling ones was having a combination of a few runaway successes and vehicles that were solid sellers. "Some manufacturers are doing well with the new products they've introduced, but yet at the same time their disadvantage is older products," he said. "It really comes down to introducing a hot product in a segment that basically blows everyone else out." One breakout success was the new Honda Civic, whose sales grew 37.6 percent and helped push Honda's sales to record levels last month. That allowed Honda's market share to grow to 8.5 percent, compared with 7.8 percent a year ago, according to Autodata. G.M. slipped to 23.4 percent of the American market, compared with 24.2 percent a year earlier. Ford's share declined to 18.2 percent, from 18.9 percent a year earlier. Referring to G.M.'s market share, John Murphy, a Merrill Lynch analyst said, "That is not sustainable. The company will not survive if it does not improve that." Still, both G.M. and Ford will build produce fewer cars in the second quarter this year than they did in the same period last year. G.M. will cut second-quarter production by 3.7 percent, and Ford by 1.8 percent. G.M. suffered another blow on Wednesday as Fitch Ratings downgraded the company's debt rating deeper into junk status. Fitch cited concern over whether the automaker had been aggressive enough in its attempt to stem losses. Last year G.M. lost $8.6 billion. As G.M. and Ford announced they would cut production, there were rumblings that Honda might manufacture more cars in the United States. In an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Takeo Fukui, Honda's chief executive, said the automaker was looking to bolster United States production. A Honda spokesman, Chuck Schifsky, said it was too soon to say whether the company would build another United States assembly plant, but added, "We're running out of capacity in the U.S., and typically we like to build vehicles where we sell them." In a reversal from just a few months ago, Chrysler, still the sole bright spot among the traditional Big Three American automakers, is now facing what appears to be more than just a passing slowdown in sales. February was yet another lackluster month for the automaker, a division of DaimlerChrysler of Germany, which has struggled under the weight of losses at Mercedes-Benz. Last month, however, Mercedes sales in the United States were up 28 percent while Chrysler posted a 3 percent increase. "I don't think anyone around here is declaring victory," said Gary Dilts, Chrysler's senior vice president for sales. "We know there's a ton of competition, particularly in the truck and S.U.V. segments, we have to deal with."

1254-> For Nothing but Bones, Go Early
THE grilled chicken breast bones didn’t look much like food. But I was having dinner at Yakitori Torys, Midtown’s newest yakitori spot, at the unholy hour of 6 p.m. for the express purpose of getting to the really weird stuff before it was gone. (Show up at 8 and you will be out of luck.) So we dug in. The grill had colored the edges of the bones, impaled on bamboo skewers, a faint brown, which had the effect of highlighting their almost spooky, nearly translucent whiteness. They crunched like tough cartilage — as opposed to that soft cartilage crunch of jellyfish, for example — and reminded me of the flavor chicken bones contribute to chicken broth: not the meaty middle notes from the flesh, not the golden yellow richness from rendered fat and skin, but a higher, thinner, fainter, harder-to-put-your-finger-on one. They left me thinking that the English language is short on words to describe the flavor of cooked bones. A friend, however, was sure of his words the next time we talked: “Dude, I don’t think those things were totally edible.” He didn’t like them. You might not either. They are just one of the many avian oddities available at Torys, which is the mirror image of its sibling restaurant, Yakitori Totto on West 55th Street. The most unusual stuff on the menu is not for everybody. It’s best for those whose appreciation for chicken isn’t vanilla. For fowl fetishists. A dinner companion confided that at her home, her mother routinely absconded with the remains of roast chickens. When she was done, a pile of broken bones, stripped of every edible morsel and sucked clean of marrow, was all that was left. Torys is the restaurant for her. We moved on to skewers of inoffensive-if-not-compelling grilled necks, “soft knee bones” (“I guess these are softer than kneecaps would be,” said He Who Didn’t Like the Grilled Bones) and tails, which we unanimously adored for their perfect ratio of molten chicken fat to crispy chicken skin. On a couple of visits there were skewers of chicken oysters, those little nuggets of meat between the hip and the tail that all true chicken lovers covet. They are grilled medium-rare, with your choice of Okinawa sea salt or yakitori sauce, as are all the basic skewers (skewers run between $2 and $4). Though chicken sashimi has disappeared from the menu at Totto, Torys has brought it back. Yes, it’s probably a bad idea, health wise, to chance it with raw chicken. But for those who consider food safety warnings to be signposts to deliciousness, its flesh is sweet and firm, like that of a medium-fatty white fish. Torys also has an expansive and adventurous menu loaded with non-chicken items, like a bowl of tuna liver paste and cream cheese ($8) that practically screamed to be served with bagels, or a creamy dessert custard flavored with apricot kernels ($5.50). The tempura may not be flawlessly executed, but the selection of things that you can have fried — like a pile of baby octopuses ($7) or slices of arrestingly astringent bitter melon ($7) — is anything but ordinary. The moist chicken “meatball” ($3.50) is a far safer play. It looks like the thickest part of a baseball bat rendered in ground chicken that has been lacquered with a sweetish soy-brown sauce. Torys does the basics better than anyone (save perhaps Totto), turning out subtly flavored, carefully grilled chicken skewers from parts of the bird you might actually recognize, and does a commendable job with shishito peppers and other grilled veggies. The young Japanese guys who work the grills sacrifice their lungs in billowing clouds of chicken smoke as they gingerly flip skewers, misting them or the fire below with a squirt bottle to moderate the heat. It’s all in the name of getting your chicken to you a tender, moist medium-rare. If you want them to kill it on the grill, be sure to speak up. 248 East 52nd Street, Midtown; (212) 813-1800. All grilled skewers, particularly the chicken meatball, chicken heart and Kobe beef tongue; and anything with shishito peppers. Grilled skewers, $2 to $4 each; larger dishes, $4 to $12; desserts, $4 to $7. All major cards. Monday through Saturday, 6 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.; Sundays until 11 p.m. Narrow two-story flight of stairs to enter.

1255-> CURRENTS: CLOCKS; Because Time Won't Stand Still
Jonas Damon's latest creation, the Open Edition clock for Areaware, deconstructs the standard L.E.D. box into four separate modules, creating the illusion that one might actually have power over time. "You can play around with the order of the digits," said Mr. Damon, a Manhattan-based designer, "and then time's completely out the window." It isn't the first time Mr. Damon, who worked with the British designer Tom Dixon before establishing his own office in 2001, has taken on the L.E.D. clock. He previously developed quirky timepieces for the home accessories companies Umbra and Habitat.

1256-> Was Cheney's Mea Culpa Enough?
To the Editor: I agree with David Brooks that "the Cheney-Whittington accident was a sad but unremarkable event." What is somewhat amazing, however, is the way in which the response to this nonevent once again seems to highlight what many are perceiving as the continually escalating monumental incompetence of this administration. Even after the weapons of mass destruction debacle in Iraq; the heart-wrenching aftermath of dealing with the victims of Hurricane Katrina (which continues to this day); the bungled attempt to fix Social Security; and the poorly designed implementation process for the new Medicare prescription drug program, one might still hope that the aftermath of a simple accident could be handled in a forthright and intelligent manner.

1257-> The Sunburned Class
To the Editor: Re "Do Your Skin a Favor: Protect It in Summer" (Personal Health, June 6): Skin cancer, like many other illnesses, is a class-sensitive disease. The wealthy -- those who golf and play tennis, those who can afford to lie on the beach -- buy and use sunscreen. Bravo. But then there are those of us who work outdoors. We're the roofers, the carpenters, the lawn-care guys, the folks who grow your broccoli and tomatoes. Most of us earn marginal wages; we struggle each month to pay the rent, to feed the kids, to treat ourselves to an occasional pizza. We work hard; we sweat constantly (reapply every two hours!). Sure, we can buy sunscreen, but then the kids won't have shoes and the wives won't have the occasional night out. You rich people can do us a favor: buy your S.P.F. 30 by the gross and hand a few tubes to all the workers you see each day, especially those on your roof, in your garden, at your pool. You'll feel good; we'll live longer, and serve you longer. Kirk S. Nevin Corvallis, Ore.

To the Editor: Re "In the Execution Chamber, the Moral Compass Wavers" (Feb. 7): Sadly, this article on moral reasoning enables the biggest rationalization of them all: that people are forced to do "unpalatable" things by "economic necessity." That may apply in other parts of the world, but in a wealthy country like ours, it reeks of self-pity. Moral shortcuts that saved the lives of our pre-industrial ancestors have become like cellphones and S.U.V.'s, a frivolity that we refuse to live without. No wonder we choose leaders who lie habitually and make excuses. If they can do it, then we can, too. Christopher Bailey Seattle

1259-> Commuters, Sprawl And the Tappan Zee
To the Editor: Re "The Tappan Zee Divide" (May 7): The tenacious vitality of the New York region owes this century-long debt to our subway and commuter rail network: downtowns of great economic power and outlying train-station townships of idyllic charm. For our region, the emerging car-to-work trip is a destructive anomaly, and the Tappan Zee Bridge discussion should not focus on mitigating existing trip conditions or expanding auto trip patterns that foster sprawl. To serve future jobs and new families, a rail system instead should be put in place, supplemented by local zoning and land use regulations, to promote development around mass transit in the Interstate 287 corridor and to create train-station communities in the growing outer counties. We need to use our access infrastructure investments to shape our future. This may be the last time for the next 50 years we can return to the intelligent planning models of our past, so let's do it now.

1260-> Was Cheney's Mea Culpa Enough?
To the Editor: The Cheney incident highlights the difference between Washington and the rest of the country. What emanates from here is vitriol, jealousy and an unreasonable, obsessive scrutiny when examining the behavior of those in power. The media encourage this folly with their race to be heard first. The rest of the country knows and appears to accept that the vice president made a mistake, feels terrible about it and is sorry for it. In Washington, the minutiae of this event continue to be sifted and regurgitated. What Dick Cheney said about accuracy's being "enormously important" was dead on. The truth is often left in the dust when rushing to put the word out first. Isn't it better to glean the most accurate account possible of events rather than use cursory guessing at the truth by all concerned, many of whom have agendas unsympathetic to the simple truth in this instance?

1265-> Kinks at Kinko's
A few blogs ago, I passed on because it looked "too professional" (never mind that the woman seeking to buy the print was actually IN one of the photos). I was reminded again last night about how often people stand in the way of technology. I stopped in at a Kinko's with two projects. First, I hoped to print out color copies of a Photoshop document I'd made (an invitation to my son's birthday party). Second, I wanted to duplicate the script of a satirical musical I wrote in college ("Odysseus: The Man and His Music"), because a high school is considering reviving it. I arrived at 10 p.m. Two workers were on duty: a guy at the front desk and a woman at one of the desks in back. They were chatting as I entered. The guy pointed to the script. "I can't print that. That's copyrighted." I pointed out that *I* was the copyright holder--said so right on the title page. I offered my driver's license. He sighed regally, fished through drawers on a quest for a waiver form, didn't find it, gave up, and finally asked, "When do you need it?" "I was sort of hoping for a while-you-wait deal?" I explained. But he said no, I'd have to make a reservation for it. "Can't I do it myself on the self-service machines?" I asked. He grudgingly said yes. Next, I copied the Photoshop document from my laptop onto a flash drive and handed it to him. "It's a Mac? We can't print that," he said. The woman in the back had been listening in. "Felix, if it's a JPEG, it'll print," she told him. Bless you, dearie, I thought. With much eye-rolling and sighing, he approached the PC, turned his back to me and started working. Now I asked the woman, who had approached the counter to intervene: "Is there anything I need to know for using the self-service machines?" She smiled apologetically and took the script. "How many copies?" she asked--and then she dropped the script into her machine. In under a minute, the job was done. She made the visit quick, efficient and successful. But as I left, I couldn't help but wonder what the guy's problem was. In three different ways, he'd looked for reasons to *turn down* business. You know what? There's no such thing as technology. There's only technology+people.

1268-> Wonder Year
David Mitchell's novels are full of ghosts. In his first novel, "Ghostwritten" (2000), a "noncorpum" drifts restlessly around the world, possessing character after character, searching for a permanent home. Mitchell is so good at inhabiting other voices that halfway through his ambitious "Cloud Atlas" (2004)  the characters include a 19th-century traveler in the Chatham Islands and a genetically engineered slave in a futuristic Korean dystopia  I began to suspect that Mitchell himself might actually be a noncorpum, a spirit who has commandeered the body of a young Englishman to type out its books. Anxious, perhaps, about being mistaken for a supernatural being, Mitchell set himself a different sort of challenge in his brilliant new novel, "Black Swan Green." The book, set almost exclusively in a village of that name in quiet, provincial Worcestershire, follows 13-year-old Jason Taylor through 13 months, each folded into a storylike chapter. This rigid structure provides a certain narrative freedom, and the episodes of Jason's life don't have snug resolutions. Mitchell's storytelling method feels appropriate to adolescence, when each month encompasses so many changes that experience hardly seems contiguous at all. The challenge here, for Mitchell, is to recreate the sense of wonder of his earlier books in a more parochial setting, on a more intimate scale. It helps that Jason, his hero, has a similar affection for the exotic and otherworldly. He is drawn to the woods beside Black Swan Green, where Gypsies camp in the quarry, an old woman lives in an isolated, fairy-tale house and the ghost of a drowned boy circles the frozen lake on skates. At the same time, he's bound to his family, who live in a new, upper-middle-class development near the village and suffer more ordinary problems. Jason, an aspiring poet, still vividly recalls the stories he heard as a child: his father's office reminds him of Bluebeard's chamber, where visitors wander at their peril. When he asks his talented but stifled mother what's for dinner, she snaps back: "Toad." For a moment, Jason slips into the well of a fairy tale. "Black Swan Green" is uneventful, at least in comparison with Mitchell's other books. The war in the Falklands briefly intrudes, but is over almost as soon as it begins; Jason understands its import only through the battles between his parents and the endless fighting among his schoolmates: "It's all ranks, being a boy, like the army." Jason exists in the shadowy region of the not-popular-and-not-despised, but his place even there is threatened by a stammer he personifies as "Hangman." When he's alone, an articulate internal monologue replaces the stammer; some of those thoughts are written down in poems he submits to the parish newsletter, which are published under the august pseudonym "Eliot Bolivar." Anyone who reads Mitchell will start to notice the characters who skip from book to book, remaining themselves but playing different roles. This technique is thematically appropriate to "Black Swan Green," which is concerned with the repetition of language and experience. Madame Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck, an aging Belgian aristocrat who takes an interest in Jason's poetry, was a teenager in "Cloud Atlas." She introduces Jason to a new world of music and literature, including the genius Robert Frobisher (the most memorable character in Mitchell's last novel) and his forgotten "Cloud Atlas Sextet." "Recurrence is the heart of his music," Madame Crommelynck tells Jason, and the same is obviously true of Mitchell. Short, lyrical sentences resonate in the novel, building to a kind of refrain. "Birdsong's the thoughts of a wood," Jason thinks, and later: "Music's a wood you walk through." That poetic diction is mixed with the ever-evolving slang of the schoolyard (where using an expression like "ace" or "epic" after its expiration date spells social death). In Jason, Mitchell creates an evocative yet authentically adolescent voice, an achievement even more impressive than the ventriloquism of his earlier books. It's characterized by unusual contractions, and his habit of using nouns as verbs: "Graveyards're sardined with rotting bodies." Occasionally Jason's musings become a little too precociously poetic, but, then, he's that kind of kid. Jason, left alone for a day, decides to follow Black Swan Green's bridle path to an old Roman tunnel rumored to be in the Malvern Hills. His walk, a kind of odyssey, takes up an entire chapter: he watches a fight; encounters the girl of his 13-year-old dreams; and spies on a pair of lovers in a field. The real things that happen on the bridle path are hard to distinguish from fantasies: "Here was a pruney man in a turquoise smock, about 20 paces up the bridle path." (An escaped inmate from the Malvern asylum, who's stepped into a swarm of bees.) "Here was the dirt-smeared corpse of a boy my age." (His friend Dean, who has hidden in order to scare him.) Dangers pop up like enemies in a video game; Jason's adolescent credulity makes him the perfect narrator for a novel about the line between the fabulous and the real. Mitchell has, in his previous novels, resorted to farce whenever he writes about England or typically English characters, and I was worried when Jason and Dean stumble out of the woods onto the lawn of the lunatic asylum. (An asylum caper figured prominently in "Cloud Atlas," and even here Mitchell can't resist the schtick of an inmate dressed up in her keeper's uniform.) Almost immediately, however, he curbs his satirical impulse, and this chapter ends with the madwoman letting out a powerful scream: even if you'd "clambered into the lost tunnel, in that booming hollowness, deep beneath the Malvern Hills, even there, for sure, this tail-chasing wail'll find you, absolutely, even there." Rather than providing an escape, the magic in "Black Swan Green" eventually intersects with ordinary life. The Gypsies are threatened by bigoted villagers; Madame Crommelynck is deported; and the old woman who scared Jason with the story of the drowned skater moves out of the woods, to a "granny flat" across the road. Her son-in-law tells him that the whole wood is only "two or three footy pitches, tops," as if Jason should've known. And yet it's the granny who helps him understand how he might finally banish Hangman forever. The woods may have gotten smaller, but Jason would stop listening to their music at his peril. Novelists today sometimes seem a little sanctimonious about the importance of characterization in fiction. Even Mitchell, who takes greater formal and intellectual risks than most of his contemporaries, has said, "Ideas are well and good, but without characters to hang them on, fiction falls limp." It's true that you don't care about a book like "Cloud Atlas" chiefly because it manages to analyze a century and a half of exploitation in societies from Europe to the South Pacific. But as a reader, I don't want to be without the verbal play and inventiveness of the generation that came before Mitchell's. There has got to be a way to write fiction that pays attention to people at the same time that it represents the breadth and complexity of the kinds of societies we live in now. Mitchell is the rare novelist who makes me see that path clearly: it starts among suburban houses, passes through a meadow where boys are fighting, and somewhere up ahead leads into a shrinking wood, populated by ghosts on skates, lunatic beekeepers and Gypsies crouched around a dying fire.

Yet when separated from my suitcase for four days earlier this year, I was on hold for nearly half an hour each time I wanted an update on the location of my pillow and toothbrush. When the phone was finally answered, the representative (at a call center in El Salvador) had only the vaguest idea of my bag’s whereabouts.

1271-> Turning 'Neat Stuff' Into an Antiques Career
WILLIAM H. GUTHMAN'S lunch hours changed his life. In the 1940's and 50's, when he worked in Manhattan as a fabric buyer, he would browse through the antiques stores that lined Second and Third Avenues. And there, he figured out his future. Mr. Guthman, who died on Dec. 28 at age 81, became an antiques dealer himself, the owner of Guthman Americana in Westport and a frequent guest appraiser on "Antiques Roadshow" on PBS. An iconoclastic collector whose scholarly approach to American history made him one of the premier dealers in military antiques in the United States, he was known for spotting a find, holding it for a better look and remarking in his trademark phrase, "Neat stuff." "His love of the material was really infectious," said Nancy Druckman, the director of American folk art at Sotheby's, which held two sales from Mr. Guthman's collection, military items in January 2003 and books and manuscripts this past December. "He wasn't interested in the standard, pretty, commercial kind of stuff," she said. "He was absolutely devoted to the field, to the scholarship, the history, the interesting kinds of pieces that really reflected the history of the piece and the history of the time." Once he realized he was dying of lung cancer, Mr. Guthman let his commitment to the field guide his sales. He and his wife, Elizabeth Stillinger, recently sold 75 Colonial powder horns to Historic Deerfield in Massachusetts, the museum's single largest acquisition in 50 years. The museum called the powder-horn collection "the finest assemblage of this indigenous and truly unique Colonial art form." Powder horns were used by the citizen soldiers of the Revolutionary army to carry their gunpowder. The powder was poured into the wide end of a cow or ox horn, which was easily obtainable, and then capped with a wooden plug. The powder was then poured out the narrow end of the horn, which had a removable cork. Mr. Guthman was most intrigued by the use of powder horns as a form of art and information. Carvers used them to tell stories, often whittling the date and place the horn was created and sometimes their initials. Maps of forts, coats of arms, rhymes, animals and cartoons decorated the powder horns. Mr. Guthman's several books included "Drums A'Beating, Trumpets Sounding: Artistically Carved Powder Horns in the Provincial Manner, 1746-1781" (Connecticut Historical Society, 1993). One horn in Mr. Guthman's collection was owned by Israel Putnam, whose statue stands in Bushnell Park in Hartford, across from the Capitol. Putnam commanded the Connecticut troops at the Battle of Bunker Hill and carried a powder horn that held a map and architectural drawings of forts. Historic Deerfield plans an exhibition of the Guthman collection, including Putnam's powder horn, beginning on April 1 at the Flynt Center of Early New England Life. "It was for us a bargain sale, a gift purchase," said Philip Zea, the president of Historic Deerfield, but he would not say exactly what the museum paid. Mr. Zea said that the powder horns had been on extended loan at Historic Deerfield since last spring; Mr. Guthman and Ms. Stillinger signed the horns over to the museum in early November. "I've known Bill for years and years," Mr. Zea said. "He had an avaricious interest in the ephemeral world of equipment that surrounded being a citizen soldier during the French and Indian War, during the Revolution, and in the militia units that existed until the 1840's. He was the fellow who defined a lot of what we know about this sort of material." Mr. Guthman's straightforward approach sometimes belied his warm manner and his devotion to his collection and to others who shared his interest. He met Ms. Stillinger, who is known as Penny, in 1966 when she edited his first article for Antiques magazine. His collection, displayed at their home in Westport, eventually filled almost all the available space, and Mr. Guthman was forced to become much more selective when adding to his collection. "It fired his imagination," Ms. Stillinger said. Despite the sale to Historic Deerfield and the two Sotheby's sales, she is still surrounded by Mr. Guthman's ceramics, furniture and other objects made in the 18th and early 19th centuries. She said she expected to schedule a third sale of some of the collection. She estimated its total value, including the items already sold, at $3 million to $5 million. "He never was really interested in business or making money," she said. "Collecting these pieces of history meant so much more to him than going to work every day in a regular job in New York. He loved history, and he was very patriotic in the best way. Even though at the end of his life he was coming to worry about America, he believed in the goodness of this country."

1272-> Stolen Art?
 The world is changing, and you have to play by the rules. It now appears that the piece came to us in a completely improper way  through machinations, lies, clandestine night digging. As the representative of an honorable institution, I have to say no, this is not right. I have no idea. I don't think so. I suspect they're more likely to show it initially as a trophy of conquest in the Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia, which houses the greatest collection of vases in Rome. If you listen to the rhetoric of the Italian cabinet members on television, it's America, it's American buyers who are encouraging looting. They do not appear to be going after European museums or collectors, nor the gulf states, which are buying antiquities en masse. I don't want to single out Italy. The world has been atomized into a set of political entities. There is a resurgence of nationalism and misplaced patriotism. There is the sense that, "This is our identity." But I can't see how a Greek vase is the identity of a modern-day Italian. If Italy says that an object found on its soil is Italian property, and I buy it, I have bought stolen property. Perhaps those countries will realize that the tougher their patrimony laws, the more they are victims of illicit looting. Of course. Can you imagine if every Rembrandt were in Holland and every Poussin in Paris? It is safe to diversify a stock portfolio; it is also safe to diversify the shared heritage of mankind. You find Navajo pots and things of that sort. But otherwise, America does not have patrimony laws and you can buy all the Jasper Johnses and Gilbert Stuarts you want and take them anywhere. We have sent, in advance of the negotiations, a list of about two dozen vases that would be appropriate replacements for the Euphronios krater. I don't mean four years by long-term. I mean indefinite loans, for the simple reason that you cannot have great works of art perpetually on airplanes shuttling back and forth.

1275-> Dungeon Masters in Cyberspace
Gary Gygax, the original dungeon master, can see as well as anyone how computers have changed the face of gaming. All he has to do is look down the hall at his home in Lake Geneva, Wis. Three decades ago, when Mr. Gygax helped create the world's first role-playing game, Dungeons & Dragons, advanced game technology meant the exotic 20-sided dice players roll to determine if their imaginary sword has skewered the orc or manticore they are confronting. Traditional D&D is still around (the noted role-player Vin Diesel wrote the adoring foreword to a 2004 book celebrating the game's 30th anniversary). But these days, aspiring wizards, druids and paladins are more likely to click and type their way through the evil necromancer's tower rather than huddle around a table casting spells between grabbing bites of pizza. In recent years, millions of people have flocked to rich online games that let players express their inner warlock without leaving home. "My youngest son -- he's 19 -- even he stays up until 4 or 5 in the morning many times at the computer playing games like World of Warcraft," Mr. Gygax said recently, referring to one of the world's most successful online games, which could take in $1 billion in revenue this year. "The analogy I make is that pen-and-paper role-playing is live theater and computer games are television. People want the convenience and instant gratification of turning on the TV rather than getting dressed up and going out to see a live play. In the same way, the computer is a more immediately accessible way to play games." So in classic if-you-can't-beat-'em, join-'em fashion, dozens of programmers and artists in a Boston suburb have spent more than three years trying to bring Dungeons & Dragons online. Many hardcore "old-school" players continue to turn up their noses at digital fare, yet even Mr. Gygax and D&D's other co-creator, Dave Arneson, have lent their voices to the new project. The new game, called, simply enough, Dungeons & Dragons Online, is to be released tomorrow. "There have been a lot of video games based on Dungeons & Dragons, but in the past they have been almost entirely solo, single-player experiences," Jeff Anderson, chief executive of the company that makes the online game, Turbine Inc., based in Westwood, Mass., said last week. "Now, with the Internet and advances in graphics, we can finally create an online version of that classic sitting-around-the-kitchen-table Dungeons & Dragons experience, without people having to actually go out." More than 300,000 people signed up to test the game in recent months, and if a similar number subscribe to the final product, which will cost about $15 a month, Turbine and Hasbro, which now owns the Dungeons & Dragons brand, will have a moderate hit on their hands. Mr. Anderson hopes that the well-known D&D brand will bring in players from other online games while his project's close adherence to traditional D&D rules will also entice pen-and-paper holdouts to give cyberspace a chance. "As gaming has become more popular, you've started to see a change in how it's perceived socially," he said. "It went from something you did as a 13-year-old in the basement to something you might do with buddies in the living room. And a lot of those 13-year-olds are now 35-, 40-year-old guys. And we're hoping we can appeal to them." But judging by the general reaction Thursday night at Neutral Ground, a gaming store and parlor in Manhattan, the online game may be a tough sell to pen-and-paper diehards. "The video games are just so impersonal," said Louis Pirozzi, 38, of Jersey City, as he and five friends gathered around a table and prepared to play a D&D module called "Time's Tide on Bright Sands," an adventure into the desert wasteland controlled by a character named Rary the Traitor. "Role-playing games are about interacting with other players, other real people, not about interacting with a computer." Sam Weiss, 41, from the Bronx, leaned over a few dice and the erasable grid on the table that players use to lay out combat scenarios with miniature figures. "Computer games are inherently limited because they only give you a set number of options," he said. "In a game like this, what we can do is limited only by our minds." The night's dungeon master, Rich, tax director for a New York City company, would not divulge his last name out of what he described as professional discretion. "I play because I have a very creative mind and a very noncreative job," he said (though some tax experts might disagree). "So the game helps me balance it out. There is no creativity at the computer, because you're limited by what the programmers thought you might do. Here in person, I can react dynamically to the players and craft an adventure specifically for them." Mr. Pirozzi added: "Like in one campaign I was running, the players were fighting and I threw the 'South Park' kids into the fight and I had stats for them and everything. You can't have that kind of flexibility in a computer game." Nonetheless, D&D Online is meant in almost every way to mimic the classic pen-and-paper dungeon crawl. In both the online and traditional game, each player creates an avatar, with its own special abilities based on its race and profession, such as a dwarf warrior or an elf cleric. The players then form an adventuring band and strike off into a game world that is usually filled with innumerable monsters ripe for defeat and plunder. While pen-and-paper role playing usually involves thick rule books and sacks of special dice, in D&D Online the computer handles the number-crunching and rules adjudication while the players can see a computerized representation of their actions rather than having to (or being enabled to) imagine them. While players in most online games communicate by typing, Turbine has tried to enhance the in-person feel of D&D Online by building voice-chat software into the game so players can speak with one another using a microphone plugged into their computer. And while most video games try to adopt a cinematic mode of storytelling, D&D Online plainly reminds users that they are playing a computer approximation of a pen-and-paper game. During combat, an icon of a spinning 20-sided die appears in a corner of the screen, just as modern slot machines still show spinning reels even though a microchip has already decided if you've won the jackpot. Experienced video gamers will scoff at such window dressing, but those little touches are meant to provide a comfort level for pen-and-paper traditionalists. In addition, the game's makers hope to recapture men who may have played D&D in their youth but then given it up amid the mundane responsibilities of adulthood. (Women are a clear minority in almost all serious gaming circles.) "One of the hardest things about pen-and-paper games is that you have to actually get people together -- 'Hey, can you come over on Thursday night? No? How about Saturday afternoon?' " said David Eckelberry, one of D&D Online's lead designers. "It was a lot easier to do that when we were younger, but it's harder to find time with your friends as we get older and get lives and jobs and families. With the computer, the game world is always waiting for you, so you can play when you want." Keith Baker, a novelist in Colorado, who created the imaginary world of Eberron, where D&D Online is set, said that online gaming could provide a bonding experience for far-flung friends who might not just pick up the phone to chat. "What am I going to do, call my friends and just talk for four hours?" Mr. Baker said. "That's not going to happen. But if I have my friend in Austin and my friend in Los Angeles and we can get together online to go defeat the mummy king, it gives us something to do. And we can talk about other stuff while we're doing it, but it gives us a shared activity. Whether it's pen-and-paper or online, playing together with friends is what Dungeons & Dragons is all about."

1277-> World Briefing | Americas: Honduras: Ex-Colonel Ordered To Pay $47 Million In Torture Case
A United States District Court judge in Miami found a former Honduran Army colonel responsible for killings and kidnappings in Honduras during the 1980's and ordered him to pay $47 million to several torture victims and surviving relatives of the dead. Judge Joan A. Lenard found that the colonel, Juan López Grijalba, served as chief of an intelligence unit known as Battalion 3-16, which received money and training from the United States. The unit, organized as part of the Reagan administration's effort to stop the spread of Communism in Central America, was responsible for systematic abuses against civilians suspected as subversives. Mr. López Grijalba moved to Miami in 1998 but was deported in 2004. He has not faced criminal prosecution. Among the plaintiffs in the Florida suit, filed by the Center for Justice and Accountability, a human rights organization, were Óscar Reyes, a journalist, and his wife, Gloria, who were tortured, held for nearly five months and then forced into exile in the United States.

1281-> Dutch to Return Art Seized by Nazis
PARIS, Feb. 6 - In one of the largest restitutions ever of art seized by the Nazis, the Dutch government announced Monday that it would return more than 200 old-master paintings to the heir of Jacques Goudstikker, a wealthy Dutch Jewish dealer and collector who fled Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940. The works include oils by Jan Steen, Filippo Lippi, Anthony van Dyck, Salomon van Ruysdael, Jan Mostaert and Jan van Goyen that have been hanging in 17 Dutch museums and other government buildings since the 1950's. No immediate estimate of their market value was available. The restitution, the climax to an eight-year campaign led by Marei von Saher of Greenwich, Conn., the widow of Mr. Goudstikker's son, follows a recommendation made in December by a Restitutions Committee appointed by the Dutch government. Earlier, both the government and a Dutch court had refused to reopen the case. "Overwhelmed, thrilled, elated," Mrs. von Saher said, describing her reaction in a telephone interview from The Hague, where she had traveled to await the government's decision. "I can't believe that after this long battle we have finally succeeded." She credited the outcome to her lawyers and to "times changing, because people are looking at Holocaust victims differently." Mrs. von Saher, 61, said she would now study the recovered art and what might be done with it. "It's not the size or the value" that matters, but Mr. Goudstikker's legacy, she said. Her daughter, Charlène, said, "It's about a historical injustice put right." Announcing the decision, Medy van der Laan, the Dutch deputy culture minister, said the government decided that returning the works was the morally correct action. At the same time, she said, "this is a bloodletting for some of our museums," adding that the Dutch museums would not receive compensation for their losses. Since the mid-1990's, when attention turned anew to art looted by the Nazis from Jewish families and never returned to them, the only restitution larger than this one involved some 250 artworks returned to the Viennese branch of the Rothschild family by the Austrian government in 1999. Mr. Goudstikker, who was 42 when he died in an accident on the boat taking him to safety, was one of Europe's most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors. In an inventory he carried with him when he fled, he listed paintings by van Gogh, Rembrandt, Velázquez, Goya, Rubens, Titian and Tintoretto among the 1,113 works he left behind. He also left uncounted other works of art in his various properties. The collection was purchased in July 1940 by the Nazi leader Hermann Göring and his dealer, a German businessman called Alois Miedl. Göring, who built up a major art collection during the war, is thought to have taken 779 paintings. Postwar Dutch governments argued that the 1940 sales to Göring and Miedl were voluntary because they were approved by two of Mr. Goudstikker's employees and his mother, Emily. However, from her refuge in the United States, Mr. Goudstikker's widow, Desirée, objected to the sale. Further, there is evidence that Emily Goudstikker gave her approval in exchange for a promise of protection from anti-Jewish reprisals. Miedl also bought the Goudstikker gallery and used its prestige to sell thousands of other artworks, many once belonging to Jews, during World War II. Most of Mr. Goudstikker's finest paintings were never recovered, and many are believed to have entered museum and private collections around the world. Of some 335 of his artworks returned to the Netherlands after the war, the government sold 65 to 70 in the 1950's. Of the 267 incorporated into the Dutch National Collection, 202 are now being returned. The restitution is expected to leave holes in the collections of several leading museums, including the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Mauritshuis in The Hague, the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Boijmans van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam and, the most affected, the Bonnefantenmuseum in Maastricht. Among the treasures singled out by experts are Steen's 1671 "Sacrifice of Iphigenia," van Ruysdael's 1649 "Ferry on a River," Isaac van Ostade's "Winter Scene With an Inn by a Frozen Stream" and van Goyen's 1651 "View of Dordrecht." Ronald de Leeuw, the director of the Rijksmuseum, which will surrender 15 paintings, identified two "iconic" works: Daniel Vosmaer's 1663 "View of Delft" and Mostaert's 1540 "Episode From the Conquest of America." Lawrence M. Kaye of the New York law firm Herrick, Feinstein, who represents Mrs. von Saher, said that an estimated 1,000 works from the Goudstikker collection are still missing. He said that a team of experts was looking for them and that so far 32 had been recovered from museums in Europe and Israel as well as from some private collections. "We have identified a number of works and we're going to proceed with those claims," he added. The restitution of Mr. Goudstikker's artworks in the Netherlands was enormously complicated by the fact that Göring and Miedl paid for the paintings they took and that Desirée Goudstikker, the dealer's widow, signed an agreement with the Dutch government in 1952 renouncing her claim to works acquired by Miedl. In the late 1940's Desirée Goudstikker bought back 165 paintings found in the Goudstikker gallery at the end of the war as well as real estate, including Nijenrode Castle, once owned by her husband. When she signed the agreement on the so-called Miedl paintings in 1952, however, she attached a statement expressing her "grave disappointment" with the outcome and noting that she was making "extremely unfair" sacrifices. After that, it seems, she turned her back on the art. In 1950 she married A. E. D. von Saher, and Edward, her son with Mr. Goudstikker, took von Saher's name. Desirée von Saher died in February 1996 and Edward five months later. Edward's widow, Mrs. von Saher, said that she knew nothing about the Goudstikker legacy until a Dutch journalist, Pieter den Hollander, approached her with information about the collection in 1997. In January 1998 Mrs. von Saher formally requested the return of the paintings, but two months later she was rebuffed by the Dutch government, which said that Desirée Goudstikker had renounced the Miedl paintings and had "deliberately and consciously refrained" from claiming the Göring paintings. Mrs. von Saher then appealed this decision, but in December 1999 a Dutch court said that it was "incompetent" to overrule the government and that the application to reopen the entire case was "inadmissible" because it was made after a statute of limitations went into force in 1951. Meanwhile, aware of controversy over its handling of the Goudstikker case, the Dutch government formed a commission to investigate the provenance of all the art in its museums. This in turn led to the creation of the seven-member Restitutions Committee, with the mandate of studying specific claims. Until now, it had studied 19 claims and recommended restitution in 14 cases. In April 2004 Mrs. von Saher applied to the committee for restitution of 267 artworks. In its recommendation, made public today, the committee concluded that the sales of art and property to Göring and Miedl were "involuntary." Still more critically, while it recognized that Desirée Goudstikker waived her rights to the Miedl paintings, it decided that she did not waive her rights to those delivered to Göring. The committee further recommended that Goudstikker's heirs should not be required to pay for the returned works. It noted that at least 63 paintings from the stock were sold by the Dutch government, which kept the proceeds; that the Dutch government had use of the paintings for almost 60 years without payment; and that four were missing. In conclusion, the committee recommended the return of 202 of the 267 sought by Mrs. von Saher. It noted that 40 could not be related to Goudstikker; 21 were Miedl paintings covered by the 1952 accord; and 4 paintings were either lost or missing. One of those missing is Parmigianino's "St. John as a Child," a small oil that was recovered from Hitler's collection in 1945 and disappeared inexplicably from the Dutch collection in 1959. According to Dutch news reports, Monday's announcement was delayed for several days by the Dutch justice minister, Piet Hein Donner, who objected to the idea that the Restitutions Committee could overrule the 1999 court verdict. But the reports said he eventually accepted the restitution on moral and ethical grounds. The final decision to return the paintings was approved by the Dutch cabinet on Friday.

1289-> Shaking the Chill
Shaking the Chill Q. Last spring I planted two brugmansias in each of three large pots. They grew well and survived winter indoors, but now I want to separate them, put them in the ground and leave them. Can they live outdoors year round in southeast Georgia? A. Most brugmansias, a k a angels' trumpets, are happiest between 45 and 85 degrees. Temperatures above 85 discourage bloom, and those colder than 40 can damage soft growth; any part that freezes dies. Plants killed to the ground will resprout as long as the roots are healthy, but the sprouts take several months to bloom. So even if you plan to shorten old stems (potted brugmansias can grow 6 to 10 feet tall) you will have more flowers if you dig up your bushes in fall and winter and take them indoors. The root pruning incidental to digging will not hurt. We have been moving them in and out of our Hudson Valley garden for a decade with no serious loss. The only thing likely to damage yours is trying to separate entwined roots. If the plants come apart naturally when taken out of the pots, fine. Otherwise, either leave them alone or cut off the weaker of each pair at the soil line and keep removing its sprouts until it gives up. Three brugmansias sounds like plenty until you see the variety -- in white, pink, apricot, orange and red, most of them highly fragrant -- available from sources like Kartuz Greenhouses, kartuz.com or (760) 941-3613; Sandy Mush Herb Nursery, sandymushherbs.com or (828) 683-2014; and Logee's, logees.com or (888) 330-8038. Like a Blooming Rabbit Q. I just dug up a long iris bed. After discarding the old and weak rhizomes I planted half the healthy ones in a sunnier spot, replanted another half in the same bed, gave half away and still have half left. Is there any way to slow them down? A. No. If irises are healthy, they multiply in obscene numbers, just like dahlias and day lilies. But composting unwanted plants is not a sin. It is better to give them away, but when you run out of takers just think of the extras as thinnings -- no different, except in size, from tiny carrot seedlings. Garden Q & A

1290-> Britain to Reduce Its Iraq Troops
LONDON, March 13 - Britain said Monday that it would reduce its troop strength in Iraq by about 10 percent beginning in May, bringing the level down close to 7,000, the lowest since the war began in 2003. John Reid, the defense secretary, said the decision reflected the increasing preparedness of Iraqi forces to assume security responsibilities. Speaking to Parliament, he denied that British military planners feared being overstretched by a planned major deployment in Afghanistan in addition to the British presence in southern Iraq. "There is no connection with Afghanistan," he said. In early 2003, Britain contributed about 46,000 troops to the American-led invasion of Iraq. By May 2004, the number of British troops there had fallen to 18,000, and that number has been reduced over time to about 8,000. The latest reduction will be about 800 soldiers. Mr. Reid said the move marked "an indication of the incremental and increasing participation of Iraqi forces in counterterrorism in our operations." But he suggested that the British withdrawal would not mean handing over the command for counterinsurgency duties. "Let me stress that the reductions I have announced today are not part of a handover of security responsibility at operational level," he said. Despite the recent surge in violence in Iraq, Mr. Reid said he believed that civil war was "neither imminent nor inevitable." He said Iraqi security forces now numbered around 235,000, with 5,000 more volunteering to join every month. British forces -- the second largest contingent after the United States, with 135,000 troops -- are based in southeastern Iraq. The area is dominated by Shiite Muslims. Last week, Lt. Gen. Nick Houghton, Britain's highest-ranking army commander in Iraq, hinted that Britain might withdraw its troops completely from Iraq before the end of the summer of 2008. But Mr. Reid offered no direct comment on that assessment. "We will stay as long as we are needed, and wanted, and until the job is done," he said. The Iraq war has been generally unpopular in Britain. Antiwar advocates dismissed Mr. Reid's announcement as a ploy. David Wilson, a spokesman for an alliance of groups called Stop the War, said: "We are calling for total withdrawal. We suspect it is just John Reid trying to make it seem as though there is a policy for withdrawal when in fact there isn't."

1294-> Clinton Moves a Bit From Lieberman, and the War
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's decision not to back Senator Joseph I. Lieberman if he loses Connecticut's Democratic primary and runs as an independent reflected her efforts not to be portrayed as a staunch backer of the war in Iraq, Democratic strategists said yesterday. Leading Democrats in the Senate — including Senator Charles E. Schumer, the head of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts — are also planning to back the challenger, Ned Lamont, if he defeats Mr. Lieberman in the primary next month, their advisers said yesterday. But for Mrs. Clinton, the announcement had a special tactical significance. It allowed her to signal to her party's liberal base that she is not in lockstep with Mr. Lieberman in defending the war in Iraq, without actually changing her own position that her vote in 2002 to authorize the war was justified by what she knew then. And on a personal level, it was the latest twist in a sometimes tortured relationship between the Clintons and Mr. Lieberman, who denounced President Bill Clinton from the floor of the Senate during the impeachment scandal. Mr. Lieberman went on to become the vice presidential running mate to Al Gore, and the pair spent much of the 2000 campaign distancing themselves from the Clinton legacy — an approach that at least temporarily annoyed Mr. Clinton, who had worked on Mr. Lieberman's campaign for state senator 30 years earlier as a law student at Yale. Still, Senators Lieberman and Clinton have worked together since Mrs. Clinton was elected in 2000, especially on the Armed Services Committee, which Mrs. Clinton joined in 2003, and in initially backing President Bush in his invasion of Iraq. Mrs. Clinton, in her statement issued on Tuesday, noted their longstanding ties in her opening line. "I've known Joe Lieberman for more than 30 years. I have been pleased to support him in his campaign for re-election, and hope that he is our party's nominee," she wrote. She continued: "But I want to be clear that I will support the nominee chosen by Connecticut Democrats in their primary. I believe in the Democratic Party; and I believe we must honor the decisions made by Democratic primary voters." Advisers to both senators said the maneuver was not the product of lingering hard feelings stemming from impeachment or occasional differences since. Mrs. Clinton's aides alerted the Lieberman staff before she issued her statement, and he understood that hers was a political calculation, not a personal swipe, advisers to both senators said. "We appreciated Senator Clinton's endorsing Senator Lieberman in the primary, and in wanting him to return to the United States Senate," said Lanny Davis, a former White House lawyer in the Clinton administration and a close friend and supporter of Mr. Lieberman's. "We also understand her reasons for going further to state that she will support whoever wins the primary — and we are certainly happy with that, because we expect to be the nominee." Privately, some Clinton advisers said they were taken aback that Mrs. Clinton had chosen to open a rift with Mr. Lieberman before letting events unfold, especially at a time of such uncertainty for the Connecticut senator. He is scheduled to debate his primary opponent, Ned Lamont, tonight, three days after announcing his intent to collect signatures guaranteeing himself a place on the November ballot regardless of how the primary turns out. But Mr. Lieberman's supporters acknowledged that his own problematic political standing had proven troublesome for other Democrats. "He recognizes that she's in a very unique place — she would have been crucified either way," said one Lieberman adviser, who was granted anonymity because he was not authorized to speak for the senator. Given the choice of either abandoning the Democratic nominee or abandoning her longtime friend, the adviser said, "there was no right answer." However meaningless the endorsements may turn out to be in the end, the week's announcements, played out against the backdrop of the 2008 presidential primary, demonstrated the prominent role the Iraq war is bound to play in the race. One day after Mrs. Clinton issued her statement, Mr. Kerry, another likely presidential contender from a neighboring state, followed with his own declaration that he would support whoever won the nomination. But Mr. Kerry, who has sought to use his increasing criticism of the war in Iraq as a way to distinguish himself from Mrs. Clinton, went a step further: He also declined to endorse Mr. Lieberman in the primary. Mr. Kerry's aides said he was only endorsing Democrats in primary races involving veterans.

1298-> Time to Scrap the Electoral College?
To the Editor: While I can appreciate the reasoning of your call to drop the Electoral College as an antidemocratic force in American presidential politics, it seems to me that we have a greater antidemocratic threat than that. Our system of presidential primaries as it stands grants enormous power to a few select states, and all but guarantees that most Americans in effect have two candidates handed to them by the major parties. The people of Iowa, New Hampshire and the like have the opportunity to decide among many candidates. In theory, yes, someone could become a party's candidate by taking all the later primaries, but in fact we all know that momentum and the ability to raise the cash needed for our elections (another issue) all but determine the outcome of the primaries early on, if not the entire election process. The Electoral College does not come close to the primary system in its power to circumvent democracy in American presidential politics. Michael Anthony Novak Milwaukee, March 14, 2006

1302-> A Room With a Pedicure
Eric Price, a publishing executive from New York, likes to get a facial or massage on his business trips. “When you’re traveling and on long flights, you feel like your skin gets very dry,’’ Mr. Price, associate publisher and chief operating officer of Grove Atlantic, said. “It’s very nice to get a facial, you feel fresh and get energized for business meetings. And getting a massage after a long flight is really relaxing and helpful.” Mr. Price represents a steadily rising number of executives — both male and female — who seek spa treatments on business trips. It is a group the hotel industry is now actively courting. According to new research by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the consulting firm, a fifth of the top nonresort hotels in the United States now have spas. Of hotels in this category that are currently under construction or about to start construction, almost 40 percent will have spas, the survey found. Bjorn Hanson, a consultant with PricewaterhouseCoopers, said spas in business travel hotels were once “an unusual amenity, then became common and are now emerging as expected.’’ Top-tier urban hotels in the United States are building more spas, Mr. Hanson said, to respond to Americans’ growing interest in spa treatments. According to research released last month by the International Spa Association, a trade group, more than a fourth of American adults have visited a spa; 15 percent began going within the last year. The study also found that 31 percent of those who go to spas were men. Matthew Wiant, senior vice president of spa and new concepts for Starwood Hotels, said: “Historically, spa treatments were seen as a pampering routine for ladies who lunch. Now they’re part of a wellness routine.” And Alexander Mirza, senior vice president of corporate development for the Hilton Hotels Corporation, said travelers were increasingly stressed out. “It’s the BlackBerry generation,” he said. “They take one hour in a three-day trip and book a massage. That’s what’s driving demand for business.” Spas can also be major moneymakers for hotels, Mr. Hanson and other industry experts say. Mr. Hanson estimated that spas have the second-highest profit margin in hotels, after rooms. Gordon Tareta, assistant vice president of spa operations at the Hyatt Corporation, says spas generate, on average, 10 percent of a Hyatt hotel’s revenue. He said that figure could jump to 20 percent at city hotels favored by business travelers. Hotels also find spas lucrative in other ways. “If you have a 5 p.m. massage, you’re not as likely to leave the hotel to have dinner, you’ll stay for more services,” Susie Ellis, president of Spa Finder, a spa marketing company, said. A number of hotel companies including Mandarin Oriental, Hyatt, Starwood, Four Seasons and, most recently, Hilton are investing hundreds of millions of dollars on spas. Mandarin Oriental so far has invested $150 million on spas worldwide and will spend another $150 million in the next four years, said Ingo Schweder, who oversee the company’s spas. Mr. Tareta said Hyatt was spending $80 million on spas globally through 2008; Four Seasons is investing more than $100 million worldwide through mid-2008, said Craig Reid, general manager of the Four Seasons Resort and Club in Dallas. Starwood — which operates Bliss spas at W hotels and Remède spas at St. Regis hotels — will introduce new in-room spa treatments at Westin hotels this fall. The company, which also plans to open new spas at its Meridien and Sheraton hotels, now has spas at a fifth of its hotels. Hilton will offer spas at all Waldorf-Astoria and Conrad hotels, as well as at many Hilton hotels. When they do opt for spa treatments, business travelers usually demand no-frills services, often offered in an expedited way. “They’re going away from gimmicky treatments, with no rationale or physiological benefit,” said Susan Harmsworth, chief executive of Espa International, a global spa company based in Surrey, England. At Hyatt, massages are the most requested treatment, Mr. Tareta said. “Massage is seen as a tool of the trade,’’ he said. “It’s kind of like a power suit. It’s part of being on one’s best game. It can increase energy, get the blood circulating and insure that the person is not in a fog.’’ Mr. Reid of Four Seasons said he increasingly found that business travelers wanted spa treatments “on my time versus your time, on my schedule versus your schedule.” This means, he said, that the company is becoming flexible about the times and places services are available, with treatments offered both in the spa and in a guest’s room. Hotels are also creating treatments that can be delivered quickly and efficiently. Many Four Seasons hotels in the United States offer 25- or 30-minute “mini-treatments” that feature a massage, a facial or a manicure. And the Ritz-Carlton Coconut Grove in Miami offers a “tandem” treatment with two therapists simultaneously performing a pedicure and facial, intended for “women and, increasingly, men who are short on time and who consistently requested two treatments, a pedicure and facial,” Michelle Payer, a spokeswoman, said. Hyatt, at hotels in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Buenos Aires, has recently begun offering services at specific times of day, responding to a guest’s body clock. Ms. Ellis of Spa Finder said that concept was likely to become more popular among business travelers. “Spas always talk about nutrition and fitness, and I think you’ll see them talk a bit more about sleep,” she said. No doubt there will always be business travelers like Jane Jentgen, a marketing consultant from Columbus, Ohio, who treats herself to a spa service at her hotel each time she finishes an assignment. Interviewed before she had a pedicure at the Nob Hill Spa at the Huntington Hotel in San Francisco, she said: “I work nonstop when I come here, stay in the hotel and get my job done. The treatment helps me unwind and relax. It’s truly a reward for me. My client will always verbally reward me, but physically, I like to reward myself by getting a spa treatment.”

1303-> DANIEL JOHNSTON; But Is It Art?
To the Editor: Re "Man-Child in the Promised Land" [Feb. 19]: After reading Randy Kennedy's article, one has to ask: is this artist worthy of all this attention? Aside from Mr. Johnston's story (his illnesses, personal habits, experiments in music), is there any reason to take a single page of his and elevate it as fine art? I enjoy "The Simpsons," but I don't expect to see them in the Met's drawing and prints department next to Daumier or del Sarto. Thomas Warren Barlow New York City

1304-> Fitting In and Standing Out
ON a street lined with old loft buildings, the 17-story co-op at 4 West 21st Street, near Fifth Avenue, called the 4W, had to fit in, yet be distinct. "It's in a landmark district," the architect, Hugh Hardy, said of the building, "so it had to be -- the key word is -- appropriate" to meet the requirements of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The facade of the building in the Flatiron District uses "similar structural patterning to the neighboring buildings," he said, "but instead of being flat, the facade juts in and out to create rectangular floor-to-ceiling bay windows." "When you're inside, you can look diagonally down the street," Mr. Hardy said. Because the windows are asymmetrical, he said, the loftlike units offer several floor plans. That, apparently, has already been a selling point for the 56 units, which range from 1,073 square feet for a one-bedroom to 1,674 square feet for a three-bedroom. Contracts have been signed for 33 apartments, said James Lansill, the senior managing director of the Sunshine Group, the marketing and sales agent. All five of the three-bedroom apartments have been sold, Mr. Lansill said, with prices ranging from $1.99 million to $2.25 million. For the remaining units, prices range from $1.33 million to $1.46 million for a lower-floor one-bedroom, from $1.44 million to $1.79 million for a two-bedroom and from $2.05 million to $2.25 million for one of the two one-bedroom penthouses. The building was developed by the Brodsky Organization on the site of what had been a small commercial building and a parking lot. J. Dean Amro, a partner in the Brodsky Organization, said his company signed a 99-year ground lease with Brem Realty of Sherman Oaks, Calif. He would not disclose the upfront lease payments, but said the annual rent is $375,000. Occupancy in the building, which has a landscaped roof terrace, is expected in June. DENNIS HEVESI

1305-> Britain Upholds School Ban on a Muslim Gown
LONDON, March 22 - Britain's highest court ruled Wednesday that a secondary school was within its rights to bar a female student from wearing a jilbab, a loose, ankle-length gown, instead of the regular school uniform. Overturning a lower court ruling in favor of the student, Shabina Begum, a five-judge panel in the House of Lords pointed out that the school, Denbigh High School in Luton, had already taken great care to make its uniform acceptable to its students, 79 percent of whom are Muslim. "The school was entitled to consider that the rules about uniform were necessary for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others," one of the judges, Lord Hoffmann, said in his written opinion. The issue of what sort of religious dress, if any, is appropriate in state-run schools has become increasingly divisive in Europe, where the wishes of Muslim populations are often at odds with the rules set down by secular governments. In France, the hijab, the head scarf worn by many Muslim girls and women, and other "conspicuous" religious symbols are banned from schools. In 2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that a university in Turkey was within its rights to ban head scarves, saying that it was justified in avoiding giving preference to any one religion. By such standards, the British policy is comparatively liberal. Girls at Denbigh, for instance, have a wide choice of uniform -- a skirt, pants or the shalwar kameez, a flowing pants-and-tunic combination considered acceptable by many Muslims -- and they can also wear head scarves. Three nearby schools allow students to wear the jilbab. But Denbigh, a coeducational school with 1,000 students, had argued that permitting Ms. Begum, now 17, to wear the jilbab could prove divisive, possibly leading to arguments among students about whether it represented a more devout adherence to Islam. In addition, the school said, the jilbab is too constricting and would pose safety risks. Tahir Alam, the education spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain, a lobbying group, told Bloomberg News that the safety argument was "an excuse, really." "You have to ask yourself," he said, "how many people have fallen over and died because they tripped on their jilbab." In their unanimous ruling, the judges said Denbigh had "taken immense pains to devise a uniform policy that respected Muslim beliefs," laying down rules that "were as far from being mindless as uniform rules could ever be" and that were apparently "acceptable to mainstream Muslim opinion." Ms. Begum sued the school in 2002 after it insisted that she wear the required uniform, which, she told the BBC on Wednesday, she believed "did not satisfy Islamic clothing." Represented by Cherie Booth, a human rights lawyer and the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, she argued that the school had denied her the right to practice her religion. Speaking of the jilbab, which covers the entire body except for the hands and face, she told the BBC, "I feel that it is an obligation upon Muslim women to wear this, although there are other opinions." Ms. Begum said she was "saddened and disappointed" by the ruling. "I still don't see why I was told to go home from school when I was just practicing my religion," she said. As a result of Denbigh's policy, Ms. Begum spent two years out of school. She now attends another school where the jilbab is permitted. A spokesman for the Department of Education said it welcomed the ruling as reinforcement of its view that schools should be allowed to set their own uniform policies.

1306-> Club Bouncer Is Arraigned in Murder of Graduate Student
A Queens bouncer strangled a graduate student while trying to rape or sexually assault her, then dumped her body in a lot near the Belt Parkway, prosecutors said yesterday a few hours before the bouncer was arraigned in a Brooklyn courtroom overflowing with reporters and family and friends of the slain student. The arraignment of the bouncer, Darryl Littlejohn, 41, on first-degree murder charges came about a month after the body of Imette St. Guillen, 24, a student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, was found, and capped an investigation that yielded a bounty of forensic evidence. "I think someday this case is going to be taught at law school as a particularly special example of forensic testimony," said Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, at a news conference before Mr. Littlejohn's arraignment. Mr. Hynes, flanked by Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly and several prosecutors and detectives, said that blue rabbit fur and brown mink fur fibers from two jackets in Mr. Littlejohn's Queens home were consistent with those found on the tape that covered Ms. St. Guillen's head, on the quilted comforter in which her naked body was wrapped when found by the police, and in a van used by Mr. Littlejohn. Mr. Hynes also said that red polyester carpet fibers found in those places were consistent with fibers from the carpet in Mr. Littlejohn's home. A law enforcement official said that investigators have focused on the basement of Mr. Littlejohn's home as one likely scene of the assault on Ms. St. Guillen. The physical evidence was bolstered, Mr. Kelly said, by electronic information from cellphone records and by a witness who said he saw a van matching the description of the one used by Mr. Littlejohn making a U-turn at the place Ms. St. Guillen's body was left, about an hour before police found her there. Around the same time, he said, someone placed a call from nearby with Mr. Littlejohn's cellphone. Ms. St. Guillen's phone had been turned off around the time of the crime, Mr. Kelly said. Prosecutors said the clothing and carpet fibers, along with DNA testing, which showed that Mr. Littlejohn's blood matched that found on the plastic ties that bound the victim, were compelling evidence implicating Mr. Littlejohn in the murder. Mr. Littlejohn was charged with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. A requirement for a first-degree murder charge is that the killing must occur while another crime is being committed -- in this case, rape or sexual abuse. The charges were filed in Brooklyn because that is where the body was found. Mr. Hynes said prosecutors cannot yet prove when or where Ms. St. Guillen was killed. "If she had died in Queens or Manhattan, you wouldn't be here," Mr. Hynes said. "We have jurisdiction of this case because we cannot prove where she was killed." Investigators have still not identified the person who made a 911 call the night of the murder, alerting the police to the location of the body, and Mr. Hynes would not comment on whether prosecutors had ruled out Mr. Littlejohn as the caller. Mr. Hynes and Mr. Kelly also said they would not provide a more detailed timeline of the 17 hours between when Ms. St. Guillen was last seen leaving the Falls bar in SoHo, where Mr. Littlejohn worked, and when her body was found. A clear motive for the crime remained elusive. Mr. Littlejohn's arraignment, held at 2 p.m. in one of two large ceremonial courtrooms in the Brooklyn courthouse, seemed anticlimactic compared with the weeks of drama and speculation that preceded it. The suspect shuffled into the courtroom and watched silently as his lawyer, Kevin P. O'Donnell, and a prosecutor, Kenneth Taub, haggled over court dates. Mr. O'Donnell said his client would plead not guilty and would not ask to be released on bail, and Mr. Littlejohn was escorted out of the courtroom without saying a word. Speaking after the arraignment, Mr. O'Donnell expressed sympathy for the St. Guillen family but said that Mr. Littlejohn "is innocent of everything he is accused of." In a telephone conversation, Mr. O'Donnell added that despite his belief that Mr. Littlejohn would have a hard time finding impartial jurors, he would not seek to move the trial elsewhere. "He's going to find a jury of his peers nowhere else but Brooklyn," Mr. O'Donnell said. At a news conference outside the courtroom after the arraignment, the victim's sister, Alejandra St. Guillen, read a short statement before dozens of reporters, repeating it a few minutes later for other reporters gathered on the sidewalk outside. "New York was Imette's home," she said, straining to remain composed as her family stood behind her. "She loved the city and its people, and you have honored her memory with your outpourings of love and support for her and for our family." During the news conference, Mr. Hynes was asked about the role of Daniel Dorrian, a relative of the bar's co-owner, who law enforcement officials said changed his story and stymied the investigation; after initially saying that Ms. St. Guillen had left the bar unaccompanied that night, Mr. Dorrian later told investigators that he had ordered Mr. Littlejohn to remove Ms. St. Guillen from the bar at closing time. "I've been lied to before," Mr. Hynes said, shrugging off any suggestion that Mr. Dorrian had seriously impeded the police. "I'll get over it." In addition to the witness who saw the van, investigators have questioned several witnesses who claim to have seen Mr. Littlejohn and Ms. St. Guillen together as they left the bar that night. Although his lawyer said he did not drive the van to work that night, the police believe that Mr. Littlejohn drove a gray Ford van that they found about three blocks from his house in the early days of the investigation. Inside the van, investigators found the same distinctive selection of fibers -- carpet, mink and rabbit -- that were found on tape wrapped around Ms. St. Guillen's head, and the comforter she was bundled in. It was that find that buoyed law enforcement officials yesterday, and they pointed out that the bulk of recovered forensic evidence is still being tested.

1307-> Finding a Public Use for AT&T's Parthenon
Old Pennsylvania Station was "vast enough to hold the sound of time," Thomas Wolfe said. The lobby of the old AT&T headquarters at 195 Broadway was easily vast enough to hold the sounds of the 20th century. What will happen to it in the 21st? "This is going to become some kind of public space," said David W. Levinson, the chairman of L&L Holding Company, which bought 195 Broadway last year for $270 million from Peter S. Kalikow, a real estate developer who is chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "Whether a museum or retail, we don't know how it's going to evolve. But it's so important to bring this space back to the public." City officials consider the lobby so important that they hope to make it a landmark. It would be the first interior landmark designated in Lower Manhattan in seven years. Robert B. Tierney, the chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said the agency was having "very fruitful discussions" with Mr. Levinson and his architect, Michael Gabellini. A crucial point, he said, is configuring the lobby for the greatest public access. Only three of the 14 existing interior landmark spaces downtown are now open to casual visitors. [A scorecard of the most and least accessible landmarks, Page B5.] No. 195 was the headquarters of the American Telephone & Telegraph Company when it ruled electronic communication through the nationwide Bell System and linked the world by copper, cable and satellite; by telephone, radio and television. ("Commercial use in doubt," said a headline in The New York Times about Bell Laboratories' first demonstration of a television transmission, from Washington to New York, in 1927.) Nothing else would have suited this company but to draw from the greatest monuments of history: massive marble Doric columns modeled on those of the Parthenon, arrayed in forestlike rows recalling the hypostyle halls of Egyptian temples. Welles Bosworth, the architect of the 29-story building on Broadway, between Fulton and Dey Streets, which was constructed in stages from 1912 through 1923, said, "The spirit is that of a highly organized and fundamental public institution." Monopoly, more like it. In "The Biggest Company on Earth" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston, 1981), Sonny Kleinfield wrote that the lobby had "a palpable feeling of great size and great hush, of great sums of money being made and great sums being spent." Though AT&T left 23 years ago, the lobby lost no grandeur. It even kept such remnants of the telephone company as a muscular bronze figure by Chester Beach symbolizing "Service to the Nation in Peace and War," under a relief map of the United States commemorating the first transcontinental phone line of 1915. "This building is a museum," Mr. Levinson said. Admiringly. Striding quickly over floors polished to an icy sheen, he pointed out acorn-topped door hinges, locks ringed by ornamental wreaths, a seven-foot-tall marble mailbox and cherubs frolicking above the elevator doors. The hypostyle hall, which forms an L shape along Broadway and Fulton Street, has about 15,000 square feet of space and ceilings 40 feet high. By 2010, it will occupy the highly visible middle ground between the new Fulton Street Transit Center and the new World Trade Center PATH terminal and transportation hub. "We will be the link at street level and below grade," Mr. Levinson said. A pedestrian concourse under Dey Street will connect to 195 Broadway. The Dey Street end of the lobby, which was the building's original entrance, will continue to serve the office tower above, whose tenants include the Thomson Corporation, an electronic information company; Morgan Stanley; and the Holland & Knight law firm. The top three floors are vacant. So is the step pyramid at the summit. This was where "Golden Boy," a gilded nude male figure by Evelyn Beatrice Longman -- lightning bolts in one hand, a cable strand in the other -- stood until 1980. In the 1980's, the statue occupied the lobby of AT&T's headquarters on Madison Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets, as AT&T divested itself of local telephone companies, including Southwestern Bell, which later became SBC Communications. (SBC acquired its former parent company last year and renamed itself AT&T.) The statue moved next to Basking Ridge, N.J., then to AT&T's network operations center in Bedminster, N.J., where it remains today. Mr. Levinson said he would like "Golden Boy" to come home, but an AT&T spokesman said there were no plans to move it anywhere. For once.

1308-> Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 - Michael D. Brown, the former federal emergency management chief who became a ridiculed symbol of the Bush administration's flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, returned in anger to Capitol Hill on Friday and lashed back at his former superiors. Mr. Brown said that he told a senior White House official early on of the New Orleans flooding, and that the administration was too focused on terrorism to respond properly to natural disasters. Testifying before a Senate committee, Mr. Brown said he notified a senior White House official -- who he said was probably Joe Hagin, the deputy White House chief of staff, but might have been Andrew H. Card Jr., the chief of staff -- on the day the hurricane hit to report that it had turned into his "worst nightmare" and that New Orleans was flooding. It was the first public identification of any White House official who was said to have directly received reports of extensive flooding on Monday, Aug. 29, the day Hurricane Katrina hit. In the aftermath of the storm, administration officials said they were caught by surprise when they were told of the levee breach on Tuesday, Aug. 30. Mr. Hagin was the senior staff member with President Bush on the day the hurricane hit, when Mr. Bush was traveling in California. Mr. Brown's politically charged appearance before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs quickly divided the panel's members by party. Several Republican senators peppered him with hostile questions and suggested he was trying to deflect the blame from his own failures. In contrast, Mr. Brown drew a gentle, even warm response from Democrats who said he had unfairly been made a scapegoat by the administration, though last year it was frequently Mr. Brown himself who drew the most fire from Democrats in Washington. In contrast to low-key statements in the past, Mr. Brown, who resigned under pressure on Sept. 12 as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was aggressively on the defensive, saying he was "sick and tired" of his remarks or e-mail messages being taken out of context or hearing that he lacked the leadership skills for his job. Mr. Brown said it was "baloney" for Department of Homeland Security officials to claim they did not know of the extent of the flooding until Tuesday, because he and other FEMA officials had notified them the day before. In response to questioning, Mr. Brown also said he believed he told the White House on Monday that a breach had occurred in the 17th Street Canal levee, passing on observations made by one of his staff members on the ground in New Orleans that day. "Everything that we had planned about, worried about, that FEMA, frankly, had worried about for 10 years was coming true," Mr. Brown said he told the White House aide. Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Friday morning while the hearing was under way that the administration already knew the city was being flooded. Regardless of the call from Mr. Brown, there were conflicting reports about whether a levee had been breached, Mr. McClellan said. "The top priority at that time was on saving lives; it was on search and rescue operations," Mr. McClellan said. Mr. Brown said that he could not recall if he personally called the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, to relay the account of the levee breach. Even if he had, Mr. Brown said, it would have been a waste of time because FEMA's role within the Homeland Security Department had been subordinated to fighting terror. As a result of that, he said, he was unable to quickly get the kind of action he needed, unless he called the White House staff. The Bush administration, as a whole, he said, did not seem to care enough about natural disasters and had relegated natural disasters to a "stepchild" of national security. "It is my belief," Mr. Brown told the senators, that if "we've confirmed that a terrorist has blown up the 17th Street Canal levee, then everybody would have jumped all over that and been trying to do everything they could." Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman, said Mr. Brown's disdain for the new domestic security structure left the department without crucial information it needed about what was happening in New Orleans. Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, said Mr. Brown was shifting attention away from his own lack of responsiveness to the disaster. "You're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies and say, 'You know something, I made some big mistakes. I wasn't focused. I didn't get things done,' " Mr. Coleman said. The remark provoked Mr. Brown to raise his voice almost to a shout. "What do you want me to say?" Mr. Brown said. "I have admitted to mistakes publicly. I've admitted to mistakes in hearings. What more, Senator Coleman, do you want from me?" Mr. Coleman responded: "A little more candor would suffice." Democrats, including Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, said Mr. Brown was being made a scapegoat to deflect criticism from the White House. "Keep your chin up and fight back," Mr. Lautenberg said. Several senators, including Democrats, said they were surprised by Mr. Brown's inability to remember crucial details from the early days of the storm, including which White House aide he spoke with and whether Mr. Bush participated in the telephone call. Mr. Brown also gave differing answers about whether he actually mentioned the levee breach to the White House. At first he said he could not recall whether he used those words but then later he said that he was sure Mr. Hagin or Mr. Card knew it and that he would have told one of them about the breach during the conversation. He said he could not recall whether he told the White House aide that he needed any particular help -- at a time when the city was flooding, thousands were packed into the Superdome without adequate supplies and others were beginning to climb to roofs or attics to avoid drowning. Two senior Homeland Security Department officials, who testified after Mr. Brown, said that his unwillingness to honor the chain of command and give regular updates to Mr. Chertoff or others in the department severely hampered the department's response. "We have a president, we have a secretary that are seeing things on television, we're getting reports, what is going on down there?" said Gen. Matthew E. Broderick, who served as the director of the Homeland Security Department's information center in Washington during the storm, recalling his request to FEMA for more information.

1309-> Giving Advice To a New Mayor
To the Editor: One of the indignities of public office consists of the needless, often portentous, advice as to the proper course a newly elected official must take in order to save his jurisdiction. Thus, Julia Vitullo-Martin reveals through The Times to Cory Booker, Newark's mayor, that redevelopment and business improvement districts are just the undiscovered ticket to municipal salvation ("Gateway Newark," Op-Ed, Oct. 22). Oh yes, "public safety" is another item she says he needs to add to his agenda. Mr. Booker, a resident who has run citywide twice and served on City Council, has, safe to say, substantial knowledge of Newark's needs, and has probably given some thought to these standard urban remedies. He is doubtless inescapably aware that an improvement district has existed in Downtown for several years and that extensive redevelopment for housing exists within walking distance of the central business district. That he is struggling with the need to improve the economic climate by attending first to personal and property security simply shows he has his priorities straight. Lawrence O. Houstoun Jr. Cranbury, N.Y. The writer is an urban development consultant.

1310-> Pittsburgh Safety Could Lurk Anywhere Against Seattle
DETROIT, Jan. 29 - In the days before the 2003 N.F.L. draft, the dissection of the college prospects was already at its hypercritical zenith. One defensive back from the University of Southern California, with his 4.3 speed in the 40-yard dash, his 43-inch vertical leap and football instincts honed from hours of studying film, looked like a can't-miss pick. That was especially so because of defenses that were increasingly demanding players who possessed the intelligence to decipher different offenses and the athleticism to destroy them in seconds. But in the search for the perfect specimen, for an android in cleats, the scouts and the seers had allowed doubt to drift in. Could this back, Troy Polamalu, play against the pass? Three seasons later, offenses face a more vexing question: What can't Polamalu do? The Pittsburgh Steelers shook off the doubts and traded up to select Polamalu with their first pick, the 16th over all. In the last two years -- since Dick LeBeau's return as the Steelers' defensive coordinator -- Polamalu has emerged as the defense's man for all seasons, a blitzer of uncommon speed on passing downs, a tackler of staggering strength against the run, and a moving part so itinerant that opposing offenses find themselves playing Where's Troy before they snap the ball. Polamalu is listed on the roster as a strong safety because he has to be given a position. But the versatility and the skill he brings to the Steelers' secondary make him difficult to categorize. He finished the regular season with 100 tackles, 11 passes batted down, 3 sacks, 2 interceptions and a forced fumble, according to the Steelers. "He gives you unlimited flexibility," LeBeau said in a telephone interview from Pittsburgh last week. "He can play the deep perimeter. He can play as a linebacker support player. He can blitz. For a defensive coordinator, he's ideal. You can put him anyplace." Or no place. LeBeau trusts Polamalu so much that he is rarely confined to one area of the field. Instead, LeBeau gives Polamalu boundaries for what his role is on a play, and Polamalu takes it from there. In one of his most dazzling moves, he will fake a blitz, jumping in and out of gaps on the defensive line like a rabbit, then pull back, whirl around so that he appears headed for the secondary, only to spin back as the ball is snapped to attack the line of scrimmage. If Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is known for his arm-flapping orchestration of audibles, real and imagined, then Polamalu and his whirling-dervish routine are the defensive equivalent, a thickly layered disguise designed to make offenses wait until the snap before they know where he is going. It is particularly devastating because quarterbacks are taught to read where the safety is to know what kind of coverage the defense is in. "Troy improvises a lot of that stuff," LeBeau said, laughing. "We give him parameters, and sometimes Troy may stretch those a bit." Just a bit. Polamalu has not lined up at nose tackle, but he has done everything else in the Steelers' blitz-happy 3-4 defense (three defensive linemen, four linebackers). On first down, he is usually at the line of scrimmage over the tight end to stop the run, said Kennedy Pola, the Jacksonville Jaguars' running backs coach, who is also Polamalu's uncle. On second down, Polamalu might be at the line of scrimmage again or he might drop back and play deep. The critical element at the line, LeBeau said, is to make sure Polamalu does not have to take on the guard and the center, who each might outweigh Polamalu -- who is 5 feet 10 inches and 212 pounds -- by 100 pounds or more. But it is on third down and other passing situations that Polamalu becomes Pittsburgh's wild card. He might be a blitzing linebacker, rushing up the middle, or he might line up as a pass-rushing end off the edge of the line, essentially turning the 3-4 defense into a 4-4. He has covered the slot receiver as the nickelback, or fifth linebacker, and played deep safety, although his weakness is perceived to be when he has to cover receivers in the open field. Still, Polamalu came close to intercepting Manning in the American Football Conference divisional game against Indianapolis when he dove for a pass while running free in the middle of the field. "When you see a squat body with long hair, you don't think he can run that fast," Pola said. Big mistake. Steelers linebacker Joey Porter sacked Manning twice in three plays late in the fourth quarter because the Colts' offensive line thought Polamalu was coming up the middle. Against the Broncos in the A.F.C. title game, Polamalu tackled Denver running back Tatum Bell a yard short of a first down, while Polamalu was being blocked and was falling down. Later, Polamalu nearly tackled running back Mike Anderson for a safety on a screen pass on third-and-10 -- even though Polamalu was responsible for covering a deep pass in the seam. Those are the kinds of plays, LeBeau said, that caused him to run the film back asking, "Did he do that?" Polamalu's soft-spoke nature belies his fierce play, and Pola said that whenever they spoke, Polamalu talked only about how many of his other teammates should be going to the Pro Bowl with him. But those who have followed Polamalu's career know his instincts were apparent early. In one of his first scrimmages as a freshman at U.S.C., Polamalu burst into the backfield, tackled a senior running back, stripped him of the ball as he was knocking him down and took off the other way. "Everyone was like, 'Ohmigosh, this guy has no fear,' " U.S.C.'s linebackers coach, Rocky Seto, said. "Most guys who rush the quarterback -- from Lawrence Taylor to Reggie White -- they have a hunger and a desire to get there. He's not as big, but Troy certainly has that fire and tenacity." That tenacity is buttressed by his work habits. LeBeau said that Polamalu had watched more game film than anyone, and that after last season, Polamalu made a DVD of other N.F.L. safeties so he could study their techniques. Polamalu, in just his second full season in LeBeau's system, has learned to read an offense so well that LeBeau feels comfortable letting him follow his gut. That, LeBeau said, reminded him of how he used to feel about cornerback Rod Woodson and safety Carnell Lake, former Pro Bowl Steelers who also had the speed to play in the open field, the strength to play at the line of scrimmage and the sense to know where to go. "I know Dick preaches it, you don't want a robot as a player and you don't want a cowboy either," said Woodson, who works for the NFL Network. "You want a guy who plays within the system but who can play fast. He's a gambler. They're calculated risks. You study film and he believes in his eyes. For Troy, they've been his friend." The irony is that the gambler in Polamalu is what earned him a reputation before the 2003 draft as a player who "flew up on everything," said Gil Brandt, who helped shape the Dallas Cowboys as the vice president for player personnel from 1960 to 1989 and who now writes for NFL.com. The concern was that Polamalu would leave his safety position to try to get closer to the ball and risk getting burned by a deep pass in the process. Is that so wrong? Not anymore. "There's an old military axiom, 'Reinforce strength' " LeBeau said. "When you see a player who has a good feel for things, you try not to get in his way. If they are not where they are supposed to be, they better be making the play." Polamalu usually is.

1311-> Storyteller in the Family: Inspiration and Obligation
NOIDA, India - Vikram Seth has a house of his own. He just prefers to live in his parents' house, a few doors down. His father's study is his crash pad. His mother's study, connected by a door, can be invaded at any time. His parents' bedroom, with windows that overlook a small, tidy garden, is in effect the family room, too: before anyone goes on a journey, it is here, on the large square bed, that the family sits and chats. The upstairs quarters belong to Mr. Seth's brother and his wife. Nearly every day, a meal is eaten together, either upstairs or downstairs. What's the point, Mr. Seth asks, of being sequestered in your own house down the road? "This way, we wander through each other's life, and it's much nicer," he said. His books are likewise known for wandering through domestic life. His 800,000-word tome, "A Suitable Boy" (1993), chronicles the twined lives of four families in midcentury India. "Golden Gate" (1986) a novel in verse, meanders through a family of five friends in California. The latest, a memoir of sorts called "Two Lives," published by HarperCollins in November, tells the story of two misfits in marriage: Mr. Seth's great uncle, Shanti Seth, and Shanti's German-Jewish wife, Henny, and their lives before and after World War II. "Two Lives" is also an autobiography, in a manner of speaking. In it, Mr. Seth comes as close as he ever has to being honest about himself. (It has been nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, in the autobiography category; the winners are to be announced next month.) More to the point, if "Two Lives" draws daylight on his own kin, it also reveals something about the danger of having a storyteller in the family. (Mr. Seth's family has several; "On Balance," by his mother, Leila Seth, is an unusually candid family memoir of loss and belonging.) What Mr. Seth turns up about Shanti and Henny, through letters and interviews and finally a will, is both poignant and painfully revelatory. The letters, he concedes, were private -- "eyes-only letters," as he puts it. But for a writer, they were also a find. And their discovery presented twin obligations to story and family. "There's a duty to the living not to hurt them," Mr. Seth explained. And "there's a duty to write things as they are." Mr. Seth got his first glimpses into the lives of his great uncle and aunt when he lived with them in London as a young man. They were far removed from the intimacy -- and the stifling heat -- of the extended Seth family in India. Henny's mother and sister were killed in the Holocaust. She did not speak of that part of her past. Mr. Seth gleans Henny's story largely from her letters. He gleans his great uncle's largely from interviews he conducted with Shanti in 1994, after Henny's death. And then, in Shanti's death came a new and wrenching puzzle about Shanti's own relationship to family. It is not a riddle that his nephew, the writer, can solve. "I couldn't have written about Shanti Uncle and Aunty Henny when Uncle was still alive," he said. In the Seth family house here in Noida, an upmarket suburb of Delhi, the downstairs dining room exists in the shadow of Leila Seth's law books; Mrs. Seth was the first woman to be named chief justice of a state high court in India. Black and white portraits of the family hang above Mr. Seth's parents' bed. A narrow glass bookshelf in what Americans would call a living room (in a house like this, it still ought to be called a drawing room) contains "Two Lives," sandwiched between Nelson Mandela's "Long Walk to Freedom" and V. S. Naipaul's "Magic Seeds." "Two Lives" is the most tender of Mr. Seth's works. It is also the only book in which he directly engages the idea of growing old. "It's probably the most personal of my books," he said. That too was somewhat of a duty, he added, for there would be "an element of falsity in keeping an artificial distance." In the 1930's Mr. Seth's great uncle signed up to study dentistry in Germany and ended up joining the British troops during World War II. Henny lived in Berlin, where Shanti Seth was a boarder in her family home. She fled to London during the war. In Mr. Seth's rendering, it is unclear whether and how they fell in love, only that there was a kind of love between them. "Beset by life, isolated in the world, in each other they found a strong and sheltering harbor," Mr. Seth writes. To peer into a relationship, even for a writer whose métier is to peer into relationships, cannot yield a full portrait. Mr. Seth is the first to admit it. But to peer into two lives that intersect at such a formative historical juncture is the strength of Shanti and Henny's story. Mr. Seth opted not to write a novel based on their lives. He said he wanted the real to be revealed. "I did feel one had to get not just the facts, but the emotional underpinnings," he explained. "You could say it's a study of love, relationships, courage, psychology and moral decisions under incredible pressures." The Indian imagination has been riven by war since the birth of the nation in 1947: three wars with Pakistan, one with China, many conflicts since pitting Indians against themselves. But World War II was of vital importance to Indian history. There were Indian soldiers in the British Army. There was the Indian independence leader, Subhas Chandra Bose, who sought Hitler's assistance in ousting the British. Not least, during the war years, there was the awakening of Indian ideas of freedom. In 1939, as Mr. Seth writes, Britain declared war on behalf of India, without so much as consulting Indians. In 1942 Gandhi began the Quit India movement, which culminated with independence. "Two Lives" can also be read as an Indian claim to World War II. Mr. Seth today divides his time between Britain and India, with a house of his own in each country. He is fond of crediting his parents for having allowed him to live off them -- "sponged" is the word he uses -- for the many years it took to write "A Suitable Boy." Part of the payback is in making sure that his royalties guarantee a lifetime supply of books for his mother and whiskey for his father. He has sponged off his family aesthetically too, as writers are wont to do. By his own admission, some of the characters in "A Suitable Boy" are thinly disguised proxies of relatives, and they are not altogether flattering. "Time passes," is all he will say about whether he has been forgiven. The idea of "Two Lives" came from his mother over a decade ago, at a time when Mr. Seth was scratching around for something to write about. "Stop making a fuss," he recalled her saying. "There's Shanti Uncle." "The family," as he said, "is at my heart."

1314-> 'In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer': On National Security, Then and Now
The easy way to look at Heinar Kipphardt's "In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer" is in terms of present-day politics. "There are people who are willing to protect freedom until there is nothing left of it," the title character says to an unfriendly lawyer. Comments like that are highly satisfying for theatergoers who, like Oppenheimer, reside happily on the left side of politics. But the play, now at the Connelly Theater in the East Village, looks at even broader issues. This is a courtroom drama without a court. The 12 men in suits and ties who appear onstage portray Oppenheimer, his lawyers, opposing counsel, witnesses and members of a committee appointed by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1954 to determine whether Oppenheimer, the physicist considered the father of the atomic bomb, should continue to have top-security clearance. Act I is about Oppenheimer's mostly social connections with Communists (before the Soviet Union became an American ally in World War II). Act II looks at his opposition to the hydrogen bomb, considered by his enemies a sure sign of disloyalty to his government. Thomas Jay Ryan plays Oppenheimer with a calm confidence and easy intelligence that make morality, in its truest sense, look fashionable. Two other actors are particularly likable in good-guy roles: Jonathan Hogan as John Lansdale, the atomic weapons project's chief of security, and Dan Daily as Ward V. Evans, the committee's voice of open-mindedness. The bad guys, including Roger Robb (Rocco Sisto), are glaringly narrow. The 1968 play, based on transcripts of the security clearance review and directed with finesse by Carl Forsman, is all talk: literate, sometimes gripping talk among unique, well-defined characters. The proceedings do seem to lag at times in this relatively long evening of theater (roughly 2 hours 45 minutes). But so what? This is a play of real ideas, posing questions about moral relativism, the limits of vigilance and human decency.

1315-> Long Island Sound And Climate Change
To the Editor: Hypoxia won't be eliminated with technological fixes reducing nitrogen at New York City sewage treatment plants ("Restoring the Sound," editorial, Jan. 15). Oceanographic conditions changed over the past 50 years, increasing hypoxia's potential. Summertime water column stratification separates warm, fresher, oxygenated surface waters from cold, saltier, oxygen-depleted bottom waters. Isolation of deep waters prevents mixing of photosynthetic and atmospheric oxygen to depth, establishing conditions leading to hypoxia. Stratification now develops earlier in the year and is stronger. Summertime temperature differences between surface and bottom waters of the western sound have increased 1.2degreesC. Simultaneously, bottom concentration of dissolved oxygen declined 35 percent because oxygen replenishment to bottom waters ceases earlier in spring. The oxygen reservoir established during winter must now last for a longer period. The intensified and longer stratification period results from local climatological changes. Warming of the water commences earlier and wind stress is reduced over the western sound. In part, these are associated with localized hardening and heating of land surfaces (rooftops, roads) as population expands. Upgrading sewage treatment plants will reduce one contribution to oxygen stress. But hypoxia will likely be a problem into the future, despite upgrades. Hypoxia is clearly linked to climate variability. R. Lawrence Swanson Robert E. Wilson Stony Brook The writers are professors at the Marine Sciences Research Center, Stony Brook University.

1317-> A Dell Laptop That Is Light, Thin and Agile With the Data
The Dell Latitude D420 weighs a mere three pounds with a standard battery and is just one inch thick. But it's what's under the hood that may please business travelers: an optional EVDO or EDGE wireless Internet card that uses the Verizon Wireless or Cingular network to transfer data faster than many D.S.L., or digital subscriber line, connections. The D420, with a 12.1-inch wide-screen display, costs about $1,200 in its basic configuration (at ). It includes a 1.06-gigahertz Intel Core Solo processor and up to 1.5 gigabytes of RAM. The laptop includes Wi-Fi networking and a system that signals the presence of an open wireless hot spot even without booting up. It also has an SD card slot and an optional fingerprint reader for extra security. One caveat is that the D420 lacks a built-in optical drive, although Dell does offer external DVD and CD-ROM drives. While travelers might miss popping in a DVD for a long flight, the D420 is so light that they might just forget it's in their carry-on.

1318-> Flash Dazzles, but Hard Drive Still Has a Role
LAS VEGAS - Flash memory, which allows for the thin design of the Apple iPod Nano, was one of the stars of the International Consumer Electronics Show last week. Samsung Electronics and Pioneer Electronics, for example, drew attention to their $400 portable XM Satellite Radio players, the Samsung Helix and the Pioneer Inno, which both use flash memory to store as much as 50 hours of radio programming and music files. And Sandisk announced at the show that it would sell a $300 portable music player, the Sansa e200, that uses six gigabytes of flash memory rather than a hard drive. Flash memory also appeared in more video cameras and global positioning satellite devices this year. All told, worldwide demand for flash memory, typically a smaller, more portable form of memory, rose 240 percent in 2005, to 1,750 million gigabits, and is expected to grow at the same pace this year, according to industry estimates. Given those figures, one may be forgiven for thinking that hard disk drives are a technology of the past. But hard drives may instead be entering a new era of popularity as large home storage devices become more important. The reason is all those little hand-held devices, many built with flash memory. Consumers are discovering that at 99 cents a song or $9 a movie, the value of the content on a mobile media player can easily exceed the value of the device itself. "So what will you do?" asked William Watkins, president and chief executive of Seagate, which makes storage devices. "You'll back it up." While hard drives, at around one-sixth the capacity cost of flash memory, have a decided cost advantage, product designers like flash memory because it allows them to make smaller and thinner devices. But for huge amounts of storage, hard drives will have a prominent place in the home. Seagate, whose main business is selling hard drives to makers of PC's, also sells external drives directly to consumers. Some hold as much as a half a terabyte, or 500 gigabytes, of data. Seagate also sells the Mirra personal server, which can store data and share it with all the computers in a home, as well as allow remote access to that data. Maxtor, a company that Seagate announced last month that it was buying, also makes consumer models. "If anything, we are more confident in our position," Mr. Watkins said. Because hard drives get about six times more storage capacity per dollar, they are a cost-conscious solution for devices that need to store large amounts of data. Indeed, Maxtor is counting on consumers storing their libraries of digital content in three or four places in their homes. Consumers may also eventually install hard drives in their cars to have their music and video libraries accessible there. Navigation systems are already being built with larger-capacity hard drives to store information on routes, as well as music and videos. At the electronics show, Pioneer demonstrated the Avic-Z1 navigation system with a 30-gigabyte hard drive. It will appear in stores in April at around $2,250. Flash memory makers, many of which also make hard drives, see the next opportunity in enhancing hard drives. This year "is the year that flash memory invades the personal computer," said Don Barnetson, Samsung Semiconductor's associate director of flash marketing. Up to now, flash memory's only connection to the PC was when someone inserted a memory drive into a U.S.B. port. Samsung said that this year, hard drives would be made with flash memory added. That flash will take up some storage tasks such as accessing frequently used applications, cached pages of data or even elements of the operating system. Samsung says that because the drives will not have to spin as often, the addition of flash could cut the power consumption of a computer, which is critically important for battery-powered laptops, and make hard drives more reliable. Mr. Barnetson estimates that $2 to $5 of flash memory in a hybrid hard drive could allow a battery to run as much as 30 minutes longer on charge. Samsung and Seagate are both working on the hybrid hard drives. They are expected to be sold at the end of the year, after Microsoft releases its new Vista operating system.

1321-> Still Shortchanging the Troops
It's amazing how Donald Rumsfeld's Defense Department can produce a $439 billion spending plan and still skimp on the one thing the American military desperately needs: expanded ground forces so the weakened and cannibalized Army can meet the requirements of Iraq without hurting its ability to respond to other threats. While the Pentagon intends to increase pay and recruitment bonuses, no part of its nearly 7 percent budget increase is aimed at raising overall troop strength. Instead, a large chunk of this nearly $30 billion bonanza goes to buying more new weapons and postponing overdue cuts in wasteful Air Force and Navy projects unrelated to fighting terrorism. The prospects for Iraq might be very different today if Mr. Rumsfeld had listened to some of his own senior generals and occupation officials and authorized significantly larger ground forces from the beginning. The early looting might have been contained before it shattered political confidence and vital infrastructure. The insurgency might never have gotten such a head start. The incineration tactics of Falluja and the Abu Ghraib nightmare might have been avoided. And the Army's downward spiral of readiness, recruitment and morale might never have begun. But the obstinate ideologues in Mr. Rumsfeld's Pentagon have never accepted the fact that the reality of Iraq did not fit their assumptions. The budget and the four-year plan released with it read almost as if the current conflict had never happened and could never happen again. Instead of reallocating resources toward the real threats America faces, the military services continue to pour their money into fighting fictive superpowers in the wild blue yonder and on and below the seven seas. Pentagon budgeters showed themselves so pathetically unable to restrain spending on expensive ships and planes that they actually cut back, rather than increased, the overall size of the Army over the next few years to pay for it. It would cost about $4 billion to $5 billion a year to give the Army 30,000 more troops, the minimum it needs to check its alarming slide. Instead the Pentagon chose to begin the construction of two unneeded new stealth destroyers, which will end up costing $2 billion to $3 billion each. It also decided to splurge on a new nuclear attack submarine for $2.6 billion and to shell out $5.5 billion for separate Navy and Air Force versions of new stealth fighter jets, plus another $5.5 billion for yet a third version that either can use. In all, the Pentagon is asking for $84 billion to buy weapons systems (twice what it got in 1996) and $73 billion more for research and development. This budget would be wasteful even under a worst-case assumption that had a second superpower arising within the lifespan of these weapons, turning hostile to America and arming itself to the teeth with the most advanced weapons. There's still unnecessary spending that could be used to repair the Army, which has been ground down at least as much by Pentagon miserliness as by Iraqi insurgents. The military contractors are doing just fine. It's the troops in Iraq who need help from Washington.

1322-> Morgan Library to Reopen With an Expanded Look, Name and Mission
Being viewed as one of the best-kept secrets in New York might be flattering to some institutions, but not the Morgan. When it reopens next week after having been shuttered for nearly three years, it will have undergone not only a $106 million expansion and renovation but also an image makeover. Its new, gleaming steel-and-glass entrance is on Madison Avenue, supplanting the discreet Old World one around the corner on East 36th Street. And banners on the facade herald a change in name: rather than the Morgan Library, it is now the Morgan Library and Museum. For the 82-year-old Morgan, the point is to proclaim that it is not just a well-preserved relic from Manhattan's Gilded Age, but a modern museum with world-class collections and a full schedule of special exhibitions. For the first time it will have space to show off considerably more of its own treasures, including a rare Gutenberg Bible, ancient Near Eastern seals and drawings by masters like Leonardo, Rubens, Degas and Schiele. Its host of rare manuscripts range from medieval treatises to hundreds of letters from George Washington and Thomas Jefferson to an autographed manuscript of Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind." Renzo Piano, the architect who oversaw the expansion, designed a modern addition in keeping with the scale of its three existing buildings: the original 1906 Morgan library designed by Charles McKim; the 1928 Annex building designed by Benjamin Wistar Morris; and the mid-19th-century Morgan House, which was redesigned by R. H. Robertson. There are new galleries; a 280-seat auditorium for concerts and lectures; a restaurant in the former Morgan family dining room; a cafe; and a bookshop. "We're going to be the ultimate treasure show," Charles E. Pierce Jr., the Morgan's soft-spoken director, said last week as he showed off a new gallery, a 20-foot cube that, while painted a pristine white, was inspired by the proportions of grand rooms in Italian Renaissance villas. Here curators were about to install some of the Morgan's greatest medieval treasures, including the Stavelot Triptych, a reliquary made of gold, cloisonné and Mosan enamels and ancient gems, and the Lindau Gospels, with its elaborate jeweled bindings. "We're trying to educate the public about our collections," Mr. Pierce (pronounced purse) said. "If you took someone from Paris or St. Louis who had never been to New York, and asked them to characterize the Frick and the Morgan," he mused, "they would be able to characterize the Frick," the Fifth Avenue mansion turned museum that was once the home of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. "But they couldn't say what exactly what the Morgan was." Having grown by 75,000 square feet, the Morgan for the first time will be able really to tell its story of how the financier J. Pierpont Morgan spent a lifetime collecting, starting at age 14, when he ordered his first set of covers of the Illustrated London News in 1852. Eventually, Morgan assembled a library that ranged from collections of religious texts to classics of Victorian literature, medieval art and historical manuscripts. He collected paintings by Corot, Frederic Edwin Church and Asher B. Durand as well as old masters like Hans Memling and Perugino. From 1890 (when his father, Junius Morgan, died) to his death in 1913, Pierpont Morgan amassed more than 3,000 objects, including 600 medieval and Renaissance manuscripts and 1,500 old master drawings. His son, J. P. Morgan Jr., decided that his father's library was too important to remain in private hands, and in 1924 he opened it as a public institution. The Morgan's collections have since expanded through gifts and purchases. In 1994 the dealer, collector and longtime board member Eugene V. Thaw pledged his prestigious collection of old master and 19th-century drawings; in 1998, the Morgan also received Carter Burden's collection of American and European literary works and the Pierre Matisse Gallery archives, which includes letters from artists including Balthus, Chagall, Miró, Tanguy, Giacometti and Dubuffet. In designing his addition, Mr. Piano was as sensitive to the Morgan's past as he was to its needs for the future. Half of the expansion is below ground. Mr. Piano and his team burrowed down some 60 feet, removing about 46,000 tons of rock that Morgan officials say was carted away in 1,300 truckloads. Its underworld is a blend of public spaces -- the auditorium for concerts -- and highly private areas, like its climate-controlled storage vaults, meticulously organized by collecting category. Above ground are galleries that, while retaining the modest scale of the original Morgan buildings, are mainly set around large glass windows providing panoramic vistas of Manhattan buildings. In the old reading room can now be found a selection of drawings dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries: Leonardo and Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Rubens, Watteau and Tiepolo, Cézanne and Pollock. Across the hall, where special exhibitions were once installed, are custom-built cabinets displaying illuminated manuscripts set against dark brown ultrasuede. Here visitors will file past treats from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves to 35 hand-painted tarot cards, one of the earliest and most complete 15th-century sets known to exist. Signaling a new openness, the Morgan's office is no longer protected by red ropes. The public will be able to troop through that sanctum to admire his collection of Italian and Flemish old masters and family portraits on walls of crimson-flocked fabric. In anticipation of the reopening, all the artworks have been cleaned and the lighting updated. "We wanted to let the public have a closer look," Mr. Pierce said. Even the Morgan's original private vault in that room will be visible. The new, modern galleries will have a fresh emphasis on the 20th century. Last year the Morgan hired its first curator for works of art from the last century. In 2005 it also received an important bequest from the Broadway lyricist Fred Ebb: mostly works on paper by German Expressionist and Vienna Secessionist artists, including Max Beckmann, Otto Dix, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele. "Our basic challenge," Mr. Pierce said, "is how to maintain a balance between beautiful shows that relate to the permanent collection while at the same time have shows with popular appeal." One telling sign is an exhibition planned for this fall: "Bob Dylan's American Journey: 1956 to 1966."

1323-> Bringing One Woman's Holocaust Experience to Life
Letters posted with Hitler stamps and inky Z's for "zensiert," or censored. Tattered diary pages in Yiddish. The photograph of a young woman and her first love, peeking from the darkened doorway of a barracks. To those educated in the ways of the Holocaust, the most startling aspect of these documents is that they survived, and their bearer with them. Now they are on view through June 17 at the New York Public Library, in the exhibition "Letters to Sala": more than 100 postcards, letters, photographs and diary entries (out of a total of 300) that chronicle one woman's experience of the nightmare that unfolded as thousands of Jews from western Poland were transported to Nazi forced labor camps. They speak to the life of Sala Garncarz, who from the age of 16 to 21 worked in seven camps -- and painstakingly saved every paper that passed through her hands. Encased in glass, the yellowed documents, their Yiddish, Polish and German script faded across 60 years, are redolent with frustration and longing. Each is labeled with a summary of its contents; about 30 letters are translated in full on electronic screens. Photographs of the Garncarz family in happier times hang on the walls. Ms. Garncarz, now Sala Garncarz Kirschner, and her daughter, Ann Kirschner, presented the letters to the library's Dorot Jewish division in April 2005. They form a time capsule of extraordinary breadth from a less documented arm of the Nazi camp system, said David S. Ferriero, director of the research libraries. Ms. Kirschner hopes to pass on her mother's legacy. Her book, "Sala's Gift," is to be published by the Free Press in November, and a documentary and a play about Mrs. Kirschner are currently in development. The letters tell of a past locked away by a young woman who hoped never to resurrect it, and of the eventual understanding between a mother and a daughter. "These letters, I knew that I've got to have them," Mrs. Kirschner said in a telephone interview last Sunday, her 82nd birthday and 60th wedding anniversary. "They were a link to my home, to my friends, to my life, to everything. They helped me survive. These letters were my most precious thing." So precious that she once buried them, and another time threw them under a building, to ensure their life. And then she tucked them and her memories away, sharing them with no one -- not Sidney Kirschner, the American G.I. she eventually married, nor their children -- until 1991, when, scheduled to undergo a triple bypass, she presented her daughter with a box. "These are my letters from the war," she said. "At that moment I thought only of one thing: I don't know if I'm going to survive the surgery, and I don't want to take them with me," Mrs. Kirschner recalled. "My children are adults now. They can handle it." Her daughter said: "I think she was at first annoyed at my ignorance of what they were and who the people were and where she had been. It was almost as if she had forgotten her own years of silence." A literary scholar and media consultant, Ms. Kirschner spent the next 15 years unraveling her mother's story as she cataloged and deciphered the documents with the help of translators. "When I first got them," she said, "it was if the letters were written to me, they were so fresh. I read the letters so often that I could recite them in my sleep." Slowly, Ms. Kirschner unveiled a fearless young woman who, at 16, volunteered for what was to be a six-week stint at a forced labor camp in her sister's place. Though Raizel was two years older, it was Sala who was the bolder, scurrying through the night to scavenge food for her family, hiding in a tenement in Sosnowiec, near Krakow. "What I was thinking at the time was that I have a better chance to go than my sister, who was very into religion, very timid," Mrs. Kirschner said. "I believed it was my destiny to go, and I wanted to go. They promised that if one member of the family went, the rest would be safe at home." Her father, a Hebrew teacher who wore his beard long, blessed his daughter but did not see her off at the train. At the station, her mother wept and refused to release her. "I could not stop looking at you mother, because I felt something inside of me tearing, hurting," Mrs. Kirschner wrote in her diary on Oct. 28, 1940. "One more kiss, one more hug, and my mother does not want to let go of me. Let it go already, it is torture." It was then that she met Ala Gärtner, the woman she would call her guardian angel. Older and more sophisticated, Ms. Gärtner took the frightened teenager into her care as they journeyed to Geppersdorf, Germany, part of a network of 160 sites with 50,000 workers. The men in Geppersdorf built a branch of the autobahn, while the women did the chores to sustain them. And the letters began to arrive, mostly from Raizel, who slowly mastered the German language required by censors. "When mother received your postcard, she was the happiest person in the world," Raizel wrote in November. Less than a year later she told of the families' deteriorating circumstances. "May God always look after you," she wrote. It seemed, she said, as if "He has turned away from here." There were small kindnesses. In Geppersdorf, Mrs. Kirschner worked as a seamstress in the home of a German family whose daughter once removed the young woman's Jewish star and took her for a walk in the city. Later the family sent a package of food and clothing. It was delivered by their son, an SS officer in the camp. In September 1941, Mrs. Kirschner was allowed a three-day furlough home. In the summer of 1942, she was offered a second visit by a guard she had befriended, but on the departure date, Aug. 12, he failed to show. That day, her parents' ghetto was raided. Her sisters were sent to labor camps, her parents gassed at Auschwitz. Ala Gärtner was hanged there three years later for her role in an uprising. Mrs. Kirschner spent 1944 and 1945 at Schatzlar in a remote corner of Czechoslovakia, forgotten but out of harm's way. The letters stopped coming; now there were only the birthday cards sent within the barracks, written in Yiddish and decorated with images of forget-me-nots. In 1945, shortly after her liberation by the Red Army on May 8, Mrs. Kirschner met her future husband. She arrived in New York in 1946, one of the first war brides. "How many daughters get to know their mother as a brave and beautiful 16-year-old girl in the most extraordinary circumstances?" Ms. Kirschner asked. "Every letter became a way of reassuring herself that she mattered somewhere in the world, which is why saving these letters became to her exactly the same as saving herself. If these letters didn't survive, she didn't exist." Correction: March 15, 2006, Wednesday A picture caption in The Arts on Saturday with an article about an exhibition at the New York Public Library that chronicles the Holocaust experiences of Sala Garncarz Kirschner, a Jewish woman from western Poland, misstated the given name of a granddaughter who was shown with her at the library. She is Gabrielle Kirschner, not Abby.

1324-> Paperback Row
THE RIVER OF DOUBT: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest Journey, by Candice Millard. (Broadway, $14.95.) After losing his third-party bid to take back the presidency in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt joined the Brazilian explorer Col. Cândido Rondon on a survey of the Rio da Dúvida, an uncharted capillary of the Amazon. In this vibrant retelling of the expedition, Millard, a former writer and editor for National Geographic, records the incredible hardships that the travelers endured --starvation, Indian attack, disease, drowning and the loss of their boats and supplies. She also explains the evolution of the Amazon and the tectonic shifts that separated South America from Africa. In the Book Review, Bruce Barcott said Millard "combines high adventure well told with dazzling passages of nature writing that illuminate the darkest, steamiest sections of the Amazon forest." THE GREAT STINK, by Clare Clark. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) Clark's dark first novel, set in the sewers of Victorian London, alternates between the stories of two men: William May, a Crimean War veteran who has been sent home to help engineer a more effective sewer system; and a scavenger called Long Arm Tom, whose life's work has lain not in disposing of sewage but in making the most of it. ROGUE REGIME: Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea, by Jasper Becker. (Oxford University, $15.95.) Becker, a veteran Asia correspondent, takes an unblinking look at a regime that has made North Korea an international pariah, and defines its leader as a skillful tyrant presiding over a vast humanitarian catastrophe and a potential nuclear nightmare. PROSPERO'S DAUGHTER, by Elizabeth Nunez. (Ballantine, $13.95.) Nunez's richly imagined sixth novel, a retelling of "The Tempest" set in the 1960s on a tiny island off Trinidad, is spun from the most disconcerting moment in Shakespeare's play -- Caliban's enraged response to Prospero's accusation that he attempted to rape his daughter. FIRST MAN: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, by James R. Hansen. (Simon & Schuster, $18.) Hansen, a former NASA historian who interviewed Neil Armstrong for 50 hours in preparing "First Man," recounts Armstrong's boyhood in Ohio, his combat missions over Korea as a naval aviator, the 1966 Gemini 8 mission, and the Apollo 11 triumph three years later. Our reviewer, Douglas Brinkley, called this a "fine authorized biography brimming with groundbreaking research, fresh anecdotes and fair-minded analysis." GET A LIFE, by Nadine Gordimer. (Penguin, $14.) In her previous novels, Gordimer, a Nobel laureate, has written powerfully about the sickness of South Africa under apartheid. Her 14th novel focuses on a single unwell individual. Treated for thyroid cancer, Paul Bannerman, a white ecologist in South Africa, becomes radioactive. Quarantined for 16 days, he broods about his marriage and his career. AT DAY'S CLOSE: Night in Times Past, by A. Roger Ekirch. (Norton, $16.95.) This is a broad history of nighttime in Western society before the Industrial Revolution. Taking his examples primarily from the British Isles, Ekirch frames the book around night's various perils -- fires, crime, insurrection -- and the traditional association of nighttime with fear and suspicion. THE HOT KID, by Elmore Leonard. (HarperTorch, $9.99.) Set in Oklahoma in the 1930s, Leonard's pitch-perfect thriller captures an era. Levelheaded and cool, Deputy U.S. Marshal Carlos Webster wants to be a celebrity, but so does his antagonist, Jack Belmont, a small-time robber who aspires to be Public Enemy No. 1. Trailing them both is Tony Antonelli, an enterprising hack who manages to be on the scene at the novel's crucial moments. "Tony Antonelli isn't a portrait of the artist as a young man, exactly," Charles McGrath wrote here, "but rather a fond wink at the tradition of potboilers and genre writing that gave rise to Leonard himself." ALWAYS MAGIC IN THE AIR: The Bomp and Brilliance of the Brill Building Era, by Ken Emerson. (Penguin, $16.) With fly-on-the-wall detail, Emerson tells the story of the 14 New York songwriters who, in the interlude between Elvis Presley and the Beatles, came up with enduring hits like "Stand by Me" and "On Broadway," drawing their inspiration from rhythm and blues, classical composers, Irving Berlin, Hank Williams, doo-wop, bebop and Latin music. AND THEY ALL SANG: Adventures of an Eclectic Disc Jockey, by Studs Terkel. (New Press, $16.95.) In his latest indispensable oral history, adapted from interviews he conducted for his radio show on Chicago's WFMT, Terkel talks with more than 40 legends of jazz, blues, folk and classical music.

1326-> ART REVIEW; Russia, Before Art Became Mere Ideology
PRINCETON - WHATEVER side you were on in the ideological wars of the 20th century, a strong case can be made that in Russia, Communism was not good for the arts. "Mir Iskusstva: Russia's Age of Elegance," now at the Princeton University Art Museum, returns us to a moment before the Iron Curtain fell; when St. Petersburg was a cultural capital and Russian artists were counted among the European avant-garde. The exhibition celebrates a circle of artists, writers and set designers loosely associated with the Mir Iskusstva, or World of Art, movement, founded in 1898 under the leadership of the future ballet impresario Diaghilev. The movement championed Modernism in Russia and embraced all art forms, from architecture to decorative arts and the theater. The exhibition includes 80 paintings, sculptures, ceramic items, drawings and works on paper from the collection of the State Russian Museum in St. Petersburg. Much of the material has never been shown in Russia or elsewhere, having been suppressed during the Communist era because of its association with the final years of Imperial Russia. Even mention of the artists names was prohibited until the 1960's. Times have changed, of course, and Russians are now looking to reclaim their cultural past. This exhibition is part of that collective national effort, and thus will probably be of immense interest to Russian expatriates in the United States (there are many in New Jersey) as well as specialists in Russian art. But for more casual viewers, it is the handful of first-rate paintings that will be most captivating. Portraits of the World of Art movement's main protagonists, friends and admirers are the backbone of the exhibition, for reasons never adequately explained in the educational material or the catalog. (Was other work by these artists destroyed?) But there are also many landscapes, among them several fine color woodcuts and lithographs of St. Petersburg by Anna Ostrumova-Lebedeva. Among the portraits here, a handful stand out. There is -- right as you enter -- Boris Kustodiev's deft 1920 study for an intended large-group portrait of the movement's key members. Ostrumova-Lebedeva is there, right up front, the only woman in the room, looking considerably older than when she posed in 1901 for a portrait by Konstantin Somov that hangs in another room. Little is known about Ostrumova-Lebedeva, according to the exhibition catalog, which provides only bare, dry facts about her life: she was born in 1871 in St. Petersburg, and died in Leningrad in 1955. She studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, and later at Whistler's studio in Paris, before returning to Russia to become a master printmaker. The standout painting here is Leon Bakst's "Supper" (1902), an unusual, perhaps Symbolist-inspired image of a young woman with an enigmatic smile at a table in a restaurant. It is a remarkably modern painting for its time, and not surprisingly provoked immense critical discussion when first shown at a 1903 World of Art exhibition. Then there is Natan Altman's -- to quote from the catalog -- "Cubo-Futurist" portrait of the poet Anna Akhmatova. It is a striking picture, painted in 1915, the poet depicted in a dashing blue dress with yellow shawl against a kaleidoscopic green landscape. Her tightly angular body and features give the portrait added intensity. Bakst and Altman were among the most talented of the artists associated with the World of Art movement. Altman was a painter, sculptor and a designer who worked in books, theater and film, while Bakst juggled parallel careers as an artist and a designer of sets and costumes for theater and opera. He was a leading designer for Diaghilev's "Saisons Russes," and later designed sets for theaters in London, Paris and New York. Bakst was also among the first of the movement's members to leave Russia, settling in Paris in 1909. Many other major figures followed, including Aleksandr Benois and Boris Grigoriev. One or two movement members also came to the United States, like Boris Anisfeld, who from 1918 lived here and worked as a stage designer for the Metropolitan Opera and the Chicago Opera. Other members fared less well, like Grigoriev, who died poor and bitter in France at age 53. Talented and extroverted, he was just one of thousands of innocent victims of the once-misguided artistic policies of the Soviet government. It is nice to see he and his colleagues finally get their due. "Mir Iskusstva: Russia's Age of Elegance," Princeton University Art Museum, through June 11.

1327-> Each Trapped in a Box, Trying to Think Outside It
The line dividing inspired whimsy from tedious nonsense can be a fine one, and much of "The Wooden Breeks," a new play by Glen Berger, falls on the wrong side of it. This elaborately conceived comedy, which opened last night at the Lucille Lortel Theater in an MCC Theater production, seeks to celebrate the consolations of storytelling through the saga of a Scottish tinker who dreams up imaginary worlds to keep despair at bay. But it's more the pitfalls of narrative, rather than its rewards, that Mr. Berger succeeds in demonstrating. A lone figure sits hunched over a fading fire as the audience enters the theater, searching in the embers for the answer to the question that has left him ill-shaven and hollow-eyed. Tom Bosch (a nicely sardonic Adam Rothenberg) is a downcast fellow brooding on the betrayal of the faithless Hetty (Ana Reeder), who loved him, left him for a sailor, loved him again and then left him for good nine years ago. Held in thrall by the "magical" fire that's been smoldering before him ever since, Bosch has whiled away the endless hours by telling stories to himself and the bastard child Hetty left behind, tales in which he manufactures far-fetched explanations for her delayed return. Drained at last of hope that Hetty will come back, as promised, before the fire dies, Bosch tries to douse the flames and break the spell, but they burn on. He's forced to add another chapter to the saga, and so conjures up the mythical village of Brood. The fire's last, undying ember becomes the flashing beacon in the town lighthouse, and Bosch, desperate to reassert control over his life, will spend the rest of the play trying to enter his fictional world, put out the light and free himself from the task of tale-telling forever. Or something like that, anyway. Mr. Berger's elaborate framework has obviously been carefully constructed with an eye toward making clever points about the magic, the madness and the meta- of fiction, but audiences are not likely to take much pleasure in his handiwork. They're generally more interested in the quality of the tale being told than in the reasons for its telling. And, not having Bosch's intense interest in the narrative in question, they will probably be baffled or bored by his unnecessarily intricate story of romantic misadventures in Brood. For while they are embodied with winning verve by a talented cast under Trip Cullman's direction, the fanciful folk of this strange town are less full-bodied fictions than 19th-century templates for the supporting characters in television sitcoms. Jarl von Hoother (T. Ryder Smith) is the reclusive lighthouse keeper who spends his days sipping tea and rummaging amid his store of arcane books. The vicar Enry Leap (Steve Mellor) is secretly besotted with Mrs. Nelles (Veanne Cox), the prim proprietress of the only public house, who has shut her doors in mourning for her dead daughter, Lavender. A rival romance blooms between the pert laundress Tricity Tiara (Maria Dizzia) and her mustachioed swain, Armitage Shanks (Louis Cancelmi). (Beats me why this character is named after a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer, although a joke in the play has him stuck in the town "privy.") As their cute names (and cuter costumes by Anita Yavich) imply, these characters speak in colorful pseudo-brogues, allowing Mr. Berger to display a specialist's affection for the quaint speech patterns of yore. A similar affection for historical arcana figures in the complicated plot, cantilevered upon the arrival in Brood of a saleswoman hawking a contraption known as a bell device. These ghoulish novelties, briefly popular in 19th-century Britain according to a note in the script, were designed to placate fears of being buried alive. If you woke up to find yourself prematurely interred, you tugged a string attached to a bell hung above your coffin, and the little error could be rectified. Mr. Berger makes much metaphorical hay with this macabre tool. Characters find themselves stuck in all sorts of boxes, emotional, psychological and literal, and there is a complicated subplot about the townsfolk's attempts to solve the riddle of a locked box. The play's title, for the record, is a Scottish slang term for a coffin, "breeks" meaning britches. And yet the layered patterns of imagery in the play won't mean much to audiences looking merely to be engaged by a story, not dazzled by filigreed dramaturgy. Mr. Berger is the author of the popular solo play "Underneath the Lintel," which also unfolded a woolly saga full of peculiar events. He is plainly enamored of the seductions of a good story, the fancier the better. But in "The Wooden Breeks" Mr. Berger sacrifices the one crucial element in the art of fiction -- human interest -- to a muscular display of narrative prowess. More exhausting than entrancing, the play squanders more than two hours of stage time to spin a yarn that does not, in the end, convince us that it's worth spinning.

1328-> MUSIC IN REVIEW; Leon Fleisher
Solo performers find it curiously difficult to play a musical line simply and grammatically -- keeping the tempo, observing note values and moving to the correct rhythm. Interpretive sighs, surges and interruptions seem irresistible to them and certainly more fun. Children tend to be good at unadorned forward movement; so, too, distinguished pianists like Leon Fleisher, who played Bach, Stravinsky, Debussy, Albéniz and Chopin at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night. Mr. Fleisher hasn't much time for the usual recital decorum. Playing with the music in front of him and a page turner at his side, he courteously acknowledged applause from the large audience but did not seem to seek it out. His sound is not big, considering the size of the Isaac Stern Auditorium, but like most interesting musicians, Mr. Fleisher draws listeners toward him rather than reaching out for their attention. The program was as colorful as it was uneven. Some of the moments that didn't work had more to do with the material than with the man. The busier movements of Bach's "On the Departure of a Beloved Brother" simply do not translate clearly to the modern piano and big performance spaces. In the same way, Bach's D minor Fantasy and its mighty Fugue kept disappearing behind and reappearing from indistinct clouds of piano sound. Chopin's Scherzo in C sharp minor, if admirable for the performer's reckless courage, was made pretty much into a mess by Mr. Fleisher himself. It did offer some news, however, a message confirmed a little earlier in the evening by "El Puerto," Albéniz's fiendishly complicated excerpt for "Iberia": Mr. Fleisher's right hand, incapacitated for nearly 40 years, now works very well. Simplicity informed the most beautiful stretches of this evening: the two Bach chorale-tune transcriptions with their modesty and purity of line, and also the three excerpts from Debussy's Preludes, "Le Vent Dans la Plaine," "La Cathédrale Engloutie" and "La Puerta del Vino." The Debussy pieces are open to the indignities of interpretation more than a lot of music; Mr. Fleisher understood the moods and the colors, but more important, he honored the composer's exquisitely worked-out rhythmic and melodic writing. The Stravinsky of the Serenade in A, inserted here between the various Bach pieces, found the composer in his no-nonsense mid-1920's mode and practicing an ambiguity both of style (the 18th and 20th centuries dancing around each other) and of language (tonality but with several uncongenial keys operating at the same time). Albéniz's "Evocación" was done with a sympathetic languor (what great and neglected music this is), while Chopin's elaborate C sharp minor Mazurka and his D-flat Nocturne encapsulated what is best about this most original and elegant of composers.

1329-> Til Death Do They Part: Giambi and Bonds
TAMPA, Fla., March 8 - It may never end. Jason Giambi understands that now. Even after a vague apology, an award for comeback player of the year and the attempted restoration of his public image, Giambi remains tethered to Barry Bonds and the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative steroids scandal, though he is not the primary subject of the discussion. Giambi was not mentioned in the excerpt released Tuesday from "Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, Balco and the Steroids Scandal That Rocked Professional Sports," the soon-to-be-published book that says Bonds began using steroids after the 1998 season. But the book's cover, in what is probably not a coincidence, features a photograph of Giambi standing next to Bonds during a game. The book's authors, Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams, are the reporters who wrote in The San Francisco Chronicle in December 2004 that Giambi had admitted using steroids to the federal grand jury investigating Balco in 2003. Williams said Giambi's Balco involvement is part of the book, which addresses the entire case, not just baseball and Bonds. "Jason is an important character in the book," Williams said Wednesday. "He'll be treated fairly and accurately in the book." So, a year after Giambi thought he had put the issue behind him, he sat at his locker answering more questions about Bonds. "I understand it," said Giambi, who sat out Wednesday night's exhibition game against Pittsburgh because of a sore left calf. "It gets old. It was two seasons ago. But I know you guys have a job to do." The cover picture with Bonds didn't surprise him, either. "It's an easy link," Giambi said. "I'm not shocked." The Chronicle reported that, according to grand jury transcripts, Giambi had testified that he met Greg Anderson, Bonds's personal trainer, on a barnstorming trip to Japan after the 2002 season, and that Anderson later supplied him with steroids and advised him how to use human growth hormone. That allegation led to the curious news conference before spring training last year, when Giambi offered a public apology without specifying the reason. "I didn't want to be a distraction to my teammates," Giambi said. After Giambi took a .195 average into early May, the Yankees approached him about a minor league assignment. Giambi declined and eventually regained his stroke. His 14 homers in July were the most by a Yankee in any month since his idol Mickey Mantle hit 14 in July 1961. Giambi finished with 32 homers and 87 runs batted in, and later landed a multiyear endorsement deal with Reebok, the surest sign his image had recovered. Previously, Nike, Pepsi and Arm & Hammer had dropped him. "He cares," Yankees Manager Joe Torre said. "I'm not saying Barry doesn't care. But he tried to keep an upbeat attitude, and it's not easy to do. He's been as open as he could be." The way Giambi handled it worked for him. "I've got an award sitting on my mantle because of it," he said. But he stopped short of recommending that Bonds apologize. "Different situations," he said. "Barry is a friend of mine, and I don't really know what's going on. That's in the past, and I'm going forward." Even as Balco keeps pulling him back. INSIDE PITCH George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, chatting in the Legends Field lunchroom, said he had not watched much of the World Baseball Classic, which he opposed. A team employee shooed reporters away before anyone could ask Steinbrenner about the since-removed sign apologizing for the absence of five players competing in the Classic. Steinbrenner was in a good mood after learning that a local Boys and Girls Club would be named for him and his family. Gary Sheffield (strained right hamstring) returned as the designated hitter after missing three games. Carl Pavano (sore back) threw off the mound for the third time, and Joe Torre said Pavano could be ready to throw batting practice in a week.

1330-> Playing Mozart With Help From Handpicked Friends
The handpicked, whimsically named ensemble that tours for a few weeks a year, disbands and then reconvenes at its leader’s will seems to be the must-have accessory for middle-aged soloists these days. Gidon Kremer’s Kremerata Baltica is the model, and now the pianist Andras Schiff has an occasional band of his own, the Cappella Andrea Barca. Mr. Schiff started the group to accompany him in Mozart concertos and has broadened its repertory to include that composer’s symphonies and even an opera. Mr. Schiff brought his ensemble to Alice Tully Hall on Wednesday and Thursday evenings for the first two installments of a three-concert series, each including two concertos and a symphony. The performances, though not the last word in supercharged, gleaming precision that is currently the fashion, were generally tight, lively and never less than genial. And if Mr. Schiff’s conducting style in the symphonies (Nos. 36 and 41) was not as streamlined as that of a full-time conductor, his range of gestures  from sweeping to pugilistic  clearly conveyed plenty to the musicians, who responded with robust, sharply accented playing. Still, the concertos were the draw. Mr. Schiff offered No. 22 in E flat (K. 482) and No. 23 in A (K. 488) on Wednesday, and No. 24 in C minor (K. 491) and No. 25 in C (K. 503) on Thursday. In the solo lines, he plays with the same crisp articulation that he brings to Bach but with greater freedom in his dynamics and phrase shaping. And in the tradition of pianists who regard the slow movements of Mozart’s concertos as almost operatic, he kept the piano line smooth and songlike. Most strikingly, Mr. Schiff played Mozart’s cadenzas in the A-major Concerto but used his own in the others. This is as it should be, and Mr. Schiff’s were varied and consistently inventive. In the E-major Concerto, the first movement cadenza took the main themes through densely chromatic, high-energy variations, with the cadenza in the finale providing a countervailing courtliness. In the C-minor Concerto, Mr. Schiff’s cadenza was stormy and propulsive, and there was a hint of Dave Brubeck drifting through it, disguised by the dazzling Mozartean arpeggiation. And in the first movement cadenza of the C-major Concerto, Mr. Schiff wove in themes from “Le Nozze di Figaro,” which Mozart was writing at the time. Ideally, cadenzas should be improvised, but that’s asking a lot of a modern pianist. That Mr. Schiff took the trouble to write such detailed and entertaining ones says plenty about his musicmaking.

1331-> Burning Love
LAST month, on one of the coldest afternoons this winter, a fire broke out in the basement of my apartment building on West 16th Street in Chelsea. It spread quickly through the airshaft to the neighboring building and burned through to the first floor. One of my neighbors smelled the smoke, called 911, and then went door to door telling us to get out. By the time he reached my floor -- the fifth -- the Fire Department had already arrived and doused the first floor flames. A half a dozen firefighters were racing up my stairs with hoses breaking through doors to make sure the fire had not spread through the walls. In an instant, residents of the 15 apartments in my building and 20 in the one next door -- about 60 people in all, plus four dogs and two cats -- were standing on the sidewalk in shock watching our buildings burn. Eleven fire trucks lined our street and scores of firefighters were moving in and out, their radios blaring inaudible commands. As darkness fell and the hoopla on our street didn't subside, it became clear that we probably weren't going home that night. The fire, it seemed, was more serious than any of us had realized. The first floor of our buildings were reported to have collapsed into the basement and the masonry from some of the support walls had fallen, rendering both buildings structurally unsafe. It was at that point that things might have gotten ugly -- residents from 35 apartments out on the street on one of the coldest days of winter. But they didn't, thanks to an emergency response system that ran like clockwork and was executed with the efficiency, aplomb and humor that makes me love this city. Two buses were dispatched and parked in front of our buildings to keep us both warm and near. Now dozens of people, most of whom had seen each other in passing but barely acknowledged each other's presence, were sitting on a bus together. A burly guy with a bushy mustache -- whom I had often seen but never talked to -- announced that he was crazy about dogs and asked if he could hold Pocket, the froofy Maltese in the designer doggie coat. When Pocket began to whimper, the man laughed uncontrollably, and his amusement infected the rest of us. Chris, the guy who lives a floor below me, dug into the grocery bag he had been carrying into the building when the fire broke out and fished out a box of chocolate-chip cookies, which he passed around the bus. Outside, a police car blocked off the street. Representatives of the Red Cross descended en masse to hand out blankets, food, toiletry kits. They registered all of us and arranged for hotel rooms for those who didn't have any place to go. As workers from Con Edison and the Departments of Environmental Protection and Buildings moved in and out of the apartments, representatives from the Office of Emergency Management, which coordinated the activities of all the agencies, provided updates every 20 minutes or so. A representative from the mayor's office stopped in to ask us how things were being handled. Everyone asked us if we had any questions and tried to answer them. Eventually, we were told that residents of my building would be able to enter for five minutes to gather some belongings. This would be done floor by floor, starting from the top. Two firemen led the way up four flights of darkened stairs and shined their lights as I packed a bag. One of them checked out my bookshelves and asked if I'd actually read "The Power Broker," Robert Caro's huge biography of Robert Moses. "Isn't it amazing all of the stuff in there?" he asked. The other suggested that I take the bottle of rum sitting in my kitchen. One of them reminded me not to forget my iPod. When I was done, they carried my bags down the stairs. I hailed a cab with an affable driver who said he was sorry to hear about my building. The next morning, I realized I had left the scene without asking what the next steps should be and how I would find out about getting back into the building. I called 311 and was transferred to a supervisor at the Department of Buildings who informed me that a request had gone in to reinstate the utilities and that we would probably be able to return in a matter of days. In a time of bungled emergency responses and criticism of the city's rescue efforts during 9/11, it's important to point out some success stories. I know I speak for many at 345 and 347 West 16th Street in applauding the city's emergency response teams. New York took care of us.

1334-> Timing Is Everything as Georgetown Clicks
DAYTON, Ohio, March 19 - Roy Hibbert says he knows what a perfectly played Georgetown game looks and sounds like. It is a clock, one in which the complicated Hoya cut-and-pass offense moves in measured beats of sneakers squeaking around the court. It means playing the silent, smothering defense that causes a kind of creeping dread in opponents that their time is running out. "It's tick, tick, tick, when we got everything going right," said Hibbert, Georgetown's 7-foot-2 sophomore center. "You saw it tonight." For 40 minutes, so did second-seeded Ohio State (26-6), which chased the Hoyas around the floor always seemingly a step behind. The Buckeye faithful who filled up the University of Dayton Arena as if it were a home game also watched time stand still, then expire on their team's season in a 70-52 defeat. The seventh-seeded Hoyas (23-9) took a 38-25 halftime lead and never looked back as they advanced to the Round of 16 in the Minneapolis Region, where they will meet No. 3-seeded Florida (29-6). It was quite a performance from a team that lost a Big East Conference game 16 days ago to lowly South Florida and had been anything but precise coming into the tournament or in a first-round victory over Northern Iowa. The Hoyas, however, did topple No. 1 Duke last January in a methodical fashion remarkably similar to the way they finished off the Buckeyes. "We have a group of guys, I guess, that decided they want to keep playing, and so we're still playing," said John Thompson III ,who, in his second season, has Georgetown in the regional semifinals for the first time since 2001. Hibbert, who has blossomed into a dominating big man at exactly the right time, led the Hoyas. He scored 20 points on 7 of 13 shooting, pulled down 14 rebounds and blocked 3 shots. He had plenty of help from the 6-9 forward Jeff Green, who had 19 points, 9 rebounds and 6 assists. "Their size definitely mattered today," said Buckeye guard J. J. Sullinger. "It's always in the back of your head when you're driving through the lane that there's a 7-2 guy weighing 285 pounds who can move." The only Buckeye who challenged the Hoyas inside was Terence Dials, the Big Ten's Player of the Year, who slashed and banged for 19 points. Georgetown outrebounded Ohio State, 37-24, and intimidated the Buckeyes inside. "They got a lot of offensive rebounds," Dials said. "Not only are they long, they're athletic. They're a tough matchup for anyone who plays them." It was Georgetown's aggressive defense that snuffed out the few challenges Ohio State mounted. The Hoyas turned 11 Buckeye turnovers into 12 points. "We knew with their crowd here that we had to come up with the hustle plays early to take them out," said Georgetown guard Jonathan Wallace. With 5 minutes 11 seconds remaining in the game, Dials twisted inside for a layup and was fouled by Green. He hit the free throw, bringing Ohio State to 54-48. But the Georgetown guards forced Ohio State into off-balance and errant long-range shots that Hibbert and Green vacuumed off the boards. "We were struggling all game," Ohio State Coach Thad Matta said. "We had some balls that were bouncing around in our hands and they get it, and get a 3, then they hit a 2. It was one of those games for us." It was also a fitting punctuation to a dismal N.C.A.A. tournament showing by the Big Ten, which came in with six teams, but for the first time since 1996 failed to advance a single one past the second round. Georgetown, by making its cuts, looking for the extra pass and pounding the ball inside to Hibbert and Green, was on its way to becoming the fourth of eight Big East teams to advance to the Round of 16. When, in the closing minutes, Hibbert saw the Ohio State fans streaming for the exit, he knew how the Hoyas had punished the Buckeyes. "We were patient," he said. "We were steady. We just ticked and ticked. We were like a clock." The Hoyas also seemed to take their victory in stride, which was not the case when they defeated Duke and celebrated raucously. "We celebrated in the locker room, but we came off the court with poise," Hibbert said. Now, time will not run out on Georgetown's season for at least another few days.

1336-> What You Can Rent for $1,000
IN a city where the price of a cashmere sweater has surpassed $1,000 in some quarters and summer utility bills may do the same, finding a one-bedroom rental apartment at that price seems pretty improbable. Or so you'd think. But a survey released earlier this year by New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development found that $1,000 is the average price of a privately owned nonregulated rental apartment in the five boroughs. That included all sizes of apartments, from studios on up. The good news is that there are plenty of one-bedrooms renting for $1,000 to about $1,150, and they are better than decent. No, they aren't on every street corner in Manhattan, where the average one-bedroom in a non-doorman building ranges from about $1,850 in Hell's Kitchen to $2,850 in SoHo or TriBeCa, according to Citi Habitats' Black & White Report on rentals in the borough. But once you get out of Manhattan, where the vacancy rate for rentals is a slender 0.89 percent, according to the Citi Habitats' survey, there are apartments to be had — and they can be found without even looking very hard — as long as you act fast when you find one you like. "They are out there, but they are good deals so they don't last long," said Mary Guevara, an agent at MQ Realty, which handles rentals in Queens and Manhattan. Two of her recent listings were newly renovated one-bedroom units for $1,100 in Astoria, Queens, both with hardwood floors, and a third at the same price in Sunnyside, Queens. That apartment was a walk-up, but it was just two blocks from the No. 7 train to Midtown. Calls to two dozen brokers and managing agents over the last month turned up bargains in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island. In Manhattan, no rental Web site nor the dozen or so brokers reached directly by phone had any $1,100 one-bedroom apartments available, and that included the far reaches of Washington Heights and up-and-coming areas of West Harlem. Not that they don't exist, but they most often change hands by word of mouth, brokers said. The available apartments were a mix of privately owned, nonregulated and rent-stabilized units, in neighborhoods where market-rate rentals can be less than or equal to what rent stabilization laws will allow. In most case, the security deposits equaled a month's rent. None of the 12 apartments viewed for this article were awful, and there were more than a few pleasant surprises for the money, like panoramic vistas, doormen, palatial lobbies, hardwood floors, genial supers, fireplaces, inexpensive on-site gyms and ample street parking. In some of the apartments, dated faux-colonial kitchen cabinets or dirty or tasteless wall-to-wall carpeting seemed to be the only minuses, if you don't count some less-than-spectacular views. With rare exceptions, they were all clean enough to move right into. A majority had new stoves and refrigerators, some had dishwashers, but very few had air-conditioning. The toughest part about finding the apartments was occasionally having to endure the ritual of the scoffing broker, who delighted in spending the first few minutes of an exploratory phone call insisting that there were no one-bedrooms out there in the $1,000 range. One broker said: "$1,100 in Williamsburg? Must be a dump," as he scrolled down his listings. Another broker in the Bronx said "$1,100 in the city? Must be a studio." Once they got over being dismissive, they had some nice things to show. Web sites like Rent.com have lots of listings and often lead to good neighborhoods that buyers might not have considered exploring. Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, for instance, always seems to have something available at a good price. Queens has loads of great rentals in places like Astoria, but also in nonsexy neighborhoods like Ridgewood, where 90 percent of the housing stock is rental units, according to Paul Kerzner, the president of the Ridgewood Property Owners and Civic Association. In nearby Glendale, Joe Crifasi, a broker at Crifasi Real Estate Inc., listed an apartment for $1,100 a month in a 1920's brick building typical of the area. It was a corner top-floor unit in a four-story walk-up; it had a bright, sunny bedroom at the rear, views over trees and buildings, a new bathroom and a spacious kitchen. It also had the original hardwood floors, although these were in need of refinishing. One drawback was that it was a 10-minute bus ride to the subway station, although the bus stop was only half a block away. Mr. Crifasi also had a listing for just under $1,000 for a second-floor walk-up, a one-bedroom over a store on the corner of Myrtle Avenue and tree-lined 68th Street, also in Glendale. A cleanup was in progress, but the place was spacious and had lots of windows. A third listing, in Middle Village, Queens, was the whole top floor of an immaculate two-family house on a tidy street, for $1,000. The carpets needed replacing, but the rooms, especially the kitchen, were good-sized and the neighborhood was quiet. Brooklyn had the biggest bargain of the search, a huge $1,100 apartment in a doorman building on the edge of postcard-pretty Victorian Flatbush. It had an L-shaped living/dining room, a spacious kitchen, a refurbished bath and about as many closets as any individual or couple could dream of at any price. The views weren't great, and the building's lobby needed updating, but the second-floor apartment was a short walk to the Newkirk Avenue station of the B and Q subway lines, not far from shops and surrounded by fabulous old mansions. The broker, Jan Rosenberg of Brooklyn Hearth Realty, said that this part of Brooklyn had a variety of apartments at good prices, from those in larger prewar buildings to floor-throughs in three-story mixed-use buildings. "There's not a glut of available apartments, but the neighborhood was discovered recently enough so that there are still wonderful rental values here," she said. There were far fewer available apartments in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where the prices may be slightly ahead of gentrification. A lot of them have been carved out of once-grand single-family brownstones so they can have quirky layouts, like a $1,100 unit on Hancock Street available through Keiko Matsumura, a broker with the Corcoran Group. It had a clean, spacious bedroom that faced the street, an original fireplace and a charming landlady, but the bathroom in what was once a closet was clearly an afterthought. Still, it had a kind of homey appeal and a nice view of the back garden. Michael Cruz, a broker at Citi Habitats, was showing an apartment for $1,100 in a restored Bed-Stuy brownstone, a former single-room-occupancy hotel. The hallway and entry needed sprucing up, and the backyard was overgrown with weeds, but the pleasant parlor-floor apartment, on Gates Avenue, had a recently refurbished open kitchen, a huge bathroom, a living room in the front and a quiet bedroom at the rear. On the downside, it was a long hike from the Nostrand Avenue subway station and across the street from a crowded low-rise public housing complex. That apartment was downright enormous compared with another of Mr. Cruz's listings, a tiny new one-bedroom in what was once student nurses' quarters on Prospect Place in Prospect Heights, right across the street from the shuttle train to the 2, 3, 4, 5 and Q lines. For $1,125 per month, with a month's rent free, everything was brand-new — just really small. The bedroom measured about 10 feet by 12 feet, and the whole apartment was only 350 square feet. The building had an elevator, but the third-floor apartment had some not-very-interesting views of gray institutional architecture. Two Bronx buildings with available apartments both had great lobbies. The lobby of a building on Pelham Parkway North was about a block long, had all the original 1930's Art Deco mosaics and was slightly reminiscent of Radio City Music Hall. Patty Moccia of Maxx Management, which manages the building, had a fifth-floor apartment for $1,050 a month. It had no views, but the building had an elevator, and the apartment had a nice sunken living room, a bright, spacious bedroom, large closets and a good-sized kitchen. The entrance had a charming niche with built-in shelves. Not even the broker, Esther Zimet of Eldridge Properties of New York Inc., could believe it, but there was a $1,150-a-month one-bedroom available in Riverdale. It was on the top floor of a five-story walk-up on Greystone Avenue, a building with another beautiful lobby, this one with stained-glass windows. It was roomy, and the bright bedroom in the back corner had windows on two sides and vast views over buildings and treetops. The kitchen was large, and there was a capacious closet. On the negative side, there were no period details — the doors and woodwork had been replaced — so the apartment seemed kind of basic. Staten Island apartments can represent an extraordinary value for the money if you don't mind the commute to Manhattan. In the St. George section, in a four-building, 316-unit complex called Seaview Estates on Hamilton Avenue, there was a sunny, spacious second-floor one-bedroom available for $1,040, with a nice layout and good-sized kitchen and bath. A renovation in the late 1990's removed all the period details and character from the prewar complex, but it is nicely landscaped, each building had a laundry room, and a pleasant, well-equipped fitness center is available to residents for a one-time fee of $100 per apartment. There is free rush-hour van service to and from the Staten Island ferry terminal five minutes away — it's also walkable — but on-street parking is a serious problem, especially when Curtis High School, a block away, is in session. Parking isn't a problem at the parklike Tudor-style Foxwood condominium complex in Heartland Village, where an apartment for $1,100 was listed by Jonathan Chui, a broker at Century 21 Safari Realty. The complex, which has a swimming pool and fitness center, is across the street from the Staten Island Mall, and the apartment, which had a washer/dryer and a new kitchen, was on the ground floor with views of grass and trees. Express buses to Manhattan are nearby. Not quite parklike but set in 15 acres of grass and trees, the Grymes Hill Apartments are a complex of two-story brick buildings. Antonella Veltri, who manages the complex and handles the rentals, had a recently renovated ground-floor one-bedroom available for $1,000. It had a new kitchen and bath, hardwood floors and off-street parking for $75 per month, although free parking on the street is no problem. It was close to transportation to Manhattan and was also dog-friendly, provided that the dog isn't over 50 pounds. The complex is in the process of a long-overdue landscaping. One-bedrooms like these may not be a dime a dozen, but they are available online, through rental and real estate agencies and at large apartment complexes. The deal you find may depend on perseverance and a bit of luck. "With rentals, like everything else, it is all in the timing," said Willie Kathryn Suggs, an independent Harlem broker.

1337-> Bush Urges India to Split Civilian-Military Nuclear Plants
WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 - President Bush pressed India on Wednesday to move more aggressively to separate its civilian and military nuclear programs so that a faltering nuclear agreement between the United States and India might win the approval of a skeptical Congress and America's nuclear-armed allies. Mr. Bush plans a five-day trip to India and Pakistan next week. The agreement, reached in July 2005 with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, would permit India to buy nuclear fuel and reactor components from the United States and other countries and would allow international inspections of its civilian program. India would also retain its nuclear weapons. The problems facing the agreement, however, were urgent enough that R. Nicholas Burns, under secretary of state for political affairs, was scheduled to arrive in New Delhi on Wednesday night to try to work out some solution before Mr. Bush's arrival next week. The deal has been criticized by members of Congress and by factions in India's ruling coalition that distrust Washington's intentions. "This is not an easy decision for India, nor is it an easy decision for the United States, and implementing this agreement will take time and it will take patience for both our countries," Mr. Bush said in a speech to the Asia Society at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Washington. "I'll continue to encourage India to produce a credible, transparent and defensible plan to separate its civilian and military nuclear programs." Mr. Bush also strongly defended the outsourcing of American jobs to India, which he described as the reality of a global economy. "Losing a job is traumatic," Mr. Bush said. "It's difficult. It puts a strain on our families. But rather than respond with protectionist policies, I believe it makes sense to respond with educational policies to make sure that our workers are skilled for the jobs of the 21st century." He added that India's growth -- its middle class is now estimated at 300 million people, greater than the population of the United States -- had opened a vital new market for American goods, from jets to fast food. "Younger Indians are acquiring a taste for pizza from Domino's," Mr. Bush said. "And Air India ordered 68 planes valued at more than $11 billion from Boeing." But Mr. Bush's trip to India is likely to be dominated by the nuclear agreement and Indian discussions about the difficulty and expense of separating what is now a highly integrated civilian and military nuclear program. The United States, for example, would like India to classify most of its nuclear facilities as part of a civilian program, making them open to inspections, and India is certain to resist. The most contentious debate is certain to focus on India's prototype fast-breeder reactor, which is not yet complete. India is adamant that the reactor not be subject to international inspections, saying they would hamper research. But critics of the agreement say that the reactor would be a highly efficient producer of plutonium for nuclear weapons and that they are suspicious of India's intentions. Critics also say that a safeguarded civilian nuclear program is meaningless when India has a military nuclear program right alongside it. "If India is allowed to have a nuclear program that is half safeguarded and half not, it will be ridiculed as half-baked and would make a mockery of the I.A.E.A. and of the Nonproliferation Treaty," Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr. Markey is a leading opponent in Congress of the nuclear agreement. In his speech, Mr. Bush also called on India to lift its caps on foreign investments, lower its tariffs and open its markets to more American agricultural products and goods. "My attitude is this: If the rules are fair, I believe our companies and our farmers and our entrepreneurs can compete with anybody, anytime, anywhere," Mr. Bush said. After a two-day stay in India, Mr. Bush is to travel to Pakistan to meet with its president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf. In his speech, Mr. Bush praised Pakistan as an important ally in fighting terrorism but said the country "still has some distance to travel on the road to democracy."

1340-> Bush 'Satisfied' With Cheney Response
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 - President Bush said Thursday that Vice President Dick Cheney had handled the disclosure of an accidental shooting of a hunting partner "just fine" and that the incident had been a "traumatic moment" for Mr. Cheney as well as a tragic one for the victim. Mr. Bush's comments were his first on the matter since Mr. Cheney wounded the victim, a 78-year-old lawyer, Harry M. Whittington, on a quail-hunting expedition in Texas last weekend and his first public reaction to an interview that Mr. Cheney gave about the incident on Wednesday to Fox News. The remarks came on the same day that the local sheriff's department investigating the shooting said its inquiry was closed and no charges would be filed. The president's words appeared to be an effort to tamp down widespread talk about tensions between him and Mr. Cheney. Mr. Bush's aides had made little secret all week that they wished Mr. Cheney had handled the matter differently -- in particular by disclosing it more quickly and via a more established channel than the Web site of a local newspaper in Texas. And on Wednesday, the White House signaled that Mr. Bush was sympathetic to that view. The incident was not made public for more than 18 hours. "I thought his explanation yesterday was a powerful explanation," Mr. Bush told reporters in the Oval Office, speaking of Mr. Cheney's interview on Fox. "This is a man who likes the outdoors, and he likes to hunt. And he heard a bird flush and he turned and pulled the trigger and saw his friend get wounded. And it was a deeply traumatic moment for him, and obviously it was a tragic moment for Mr. Whittington." The president's words also appeared aimed at trying to put to rest an issue that has consumed the White House and kept Washington in an uproar for most of the week, distracting attention from Mr. Bush's efforts to rebuild his political standing and push his agenda. "I'm satisfied with the explanation he gave," Mr. Bush said twice. As Mr. Bush spoke, Mr. Cheney headed to Wyoming, his home state, to make a speech to the Legislature on Friday. Mr. Cheney was expected to mention the hunting accident in his remarks, which were scheduled before the accident. In his interview with Brit Hume of Fox, Mr. Cheney talked readily of hunting as a part of his life. "It's brought me great pleasure over the years," he said. "I love the people that I've hunted with and do hunt with; love the outdoors. It's part of my heritage, growing up in Wyoming. It's part of who I am." But Mr. Cheney could not say if he would continue his pastime. "The season is ending," he told Mr. Hume. "I'm going to let some time pass over it and think about the future." Mr. Cheney's staff members and friends say he takes at least six hunting trips a year and hunts on weekends in his new Chesapeake Bay retreat on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The Armstrong Ranch in South Texas, where he shot Mr. Whittington, was a favorite place to hunt quail. "Everybody forgets, Dick is from Wyoming," said J. Robinson West, a longtime friend of Mr. Cheney who runs an energy consulting firm in Washington. "What do you do in Wyoming? You fish and you shoot. This is how he relaxes. He doesn't play golf. I once asked him if he wanted to go sailing, and he stared at me blankly and said, 'I've never done it.' " Taxpayers pay for Mr. Cheney's trips, including the Secret Service protection and communications equipment that travel with him. The Secret Service would not say on Thursday what kind of precautions are taken, including whether Mr. Cheney wears a bulletproof vest or what kind of security checks are done on his hunting companions. One former White House official said, however, the Secret Service did not view Mr. Cheney's hunting trips as unusually dangerous. "There's more concern with the president using a chainsaw at his ranch," said the official, who asked not to be named because he did not want to be identified speaking about sensitive White House security matters. In Texas, the Kenedy County Sheriff's Department said that it had closed its investigation into the shooting at the Armstrong Ranch and that no charges would be filed. The department also issued a detailed account of its inquiry. Sheriff Ramon Salinas III said he had learned of the incident at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, moments after it happened, in a call from Capt. Charles Kirk, who said that he had been told of it -- in a way not explained in the report -- and that he was on his way to the ranch. Eight to 10 minutes later, the sheriff said, a Secret Service agent called him to report a shooting involving Mr. Cheney. Then, the account went on, Captain Kirk called to say he had been turned back at the ranch gate by a Border Patrol agent who said "he didn't know anything about the accident." Sheriff Salinas said that he then called a former sheriff who was working at the ranch, Ramiro Medellin Jr., and that Mr. Medellin said, "This in fact is an accident." The sheriff said he confirmed that with another unnamed "eyewitness" and decided to send his chief deputy to the ranch the next morning. In his account, the chief deputy, Gilberto San Miguel Jr., said he arrived at the ranch shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday and interviewed Mr. Cheney, who described accidentally shooting Mr. Whittington from about 30 yards away. The deputy then interviewed Katharine Armstrong, one of the ranch's owners, "who told me pretty much the same story." On Monday, Deputy San Miguel continued, he and a lieutenant interviewed Mr. Whittington in the hospital. According to the deputy's account, "Mr. Whittington again reiterated that this incident was just an accident." Deputy San Miguel said that he subsequently visited the site of the shooting and that he collected affidavits from witnesses. Some leading medical examiners, veteran hunters and shooting experts said Thursday that the shooting might have been at much closer range than cited in the accounts, based on reports of Mr. Whittington's medical condition. Dr. Michael M. Baden, director of the Medico-Legal Investigations Unit of the New York State Police, estimated that Mr. Whittington was 15 yards from Mr. Cheney when he was shot. "Witnesses' estimates of distances are notoriously off in such accidents," Dr. Baden said, adding that to determine what actually happened, a re-enactment would be needed. But Duncan MacPherson, author of the book "Bullet Penetration," said it was plausible that Mr. Whittington was 30 yards away. "The difference between 20 yards and 30 yards would be too small to probably tell any difference," he said.

1341-> Metro Briefing | New Jersey: Newark: Judge Approves Arena Financing
A judge threw out a legal challenge to the way Newark is financing its share of a downtown hockey arena now under construction. Judge Rachel N. Davidson of Essex County Superior Court ruled that it was proper for the city to bypass the city treasury and use money from a settlement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to finance the arena's construction. Newark has earmarked more than $200 million of that money to pay off, over 35 years, bonds that were issued for the city's share of the $310 million arena, which will be the home of the New Jersey Devils. Ira Karasick, the lawyer for residents who brought the lawsuit, said that he would appeal. RONALD SMOTHERS (NYT)

1343-> Bullets and Blood in the Air, Not to Mention a Hockey Puck
Lions and tigers and pimps, oh my! In the gleefully violent "Running Scared," the writer and director Wayne Kramer tries to go over the rainbow and put a self-consciously bloody spin on once upon a time. As in: once upon a hard-boiled time, there was a not-so-wise guy from New Jersey, Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker), who, when he wasn't taking care of his own family, was punching the clock, among other things, for his mob family. When the spooky kid next door, Oleg (professional spooky kid Cameron Bright), steals one of his guns, Joey gives chase into a long night crammed with tortured camera angles and creepy crawlers. The idea here is meta-movie to the max, a deconstructed modern action flick by way of the brothers Grimm, in which few live happily ever after, and most don't even make it to the next day. Given that someone once said it is always good to begin at the beginning, here's what happens first: a handful of twitchy guys are wheeling and dirty-dealing inside a requisite cheap room when (knock-knock) in walk three masked men toting large guns. (Bang-bang.) Bullets hang in the air, as they do in the "Matrix" films, and bodies (splat-splat) go flying, as they often do in action cinema post-John Woo. After the smoke and the room clear, Joey and his crew realize that one of the masked men is wearing a police badge. At the behest of his boss, Tommy (Tombs) Perello (Johnny Messner), Joey hides the gun that shot the cop in his basement, unaware that his son, Nicky (Alex Neuberger), is watching him alongside the kid's best friend, Oleg. What follows is a confusion of moods and tones, with Joey taking the missus (Vera Farmiga as Teresa) for a quick spin, and then alternately chiding his kid and his "Pops" (Jan Kohout) before everyone sits down for dinner. Mr. Kramer contrasts this putatively happy scene with Oleg's home life, which features his very own personal tormenter in the form of his stepfather, Anzor (Karel Roden), a sadist with an appetite for crystal meth and a John Wayne tattoo adorning his back. Mom (Ivana Milicevic), of course, is a saint and a punching bag. Any doubt that we are no longer in Kansas, much less a fake New Jersey town called Grimley, ends soon after Oleg puts a bullet in Anzor using the same gun that Joey stashed earlier. After Oleg starts running, er, scared, Joey gives chase, equally worried. Over one dragged-out evening and film, hunter and hunted run up against a pimp from central casting, a prostitute with a heart of gold, Italian mobsters and Russian gangsters. Also on tap are purveyors of child pornography who, in one of the few satisfying moments in the story, face down Teresa, a whirlwind of rage in high heels. Bullets, bodies and the camera zig and zag; blood splashes and sprays. In the film's second-most satisfying moment, a hockey puck bounces off Joey's apparently thick skull, if not quite hard enough. The ascendancy of Mr. Walker to the front of the B-lists is one of the mysteries of contemporary film. The movies have always had a cache of square-jawed slabs masquerading as leading men, California dreams incarnate. But at least Tab Hunter had charm and a glint of knowing wit behind his limpid peepers. Didn't anyone realize that the stars of "The Fast and the Furious," the film that helped break Mr. Walker out of the beach-boy pack, were Vin Diesel and all those revving engines? It isn't Mr. Walker's fault that he keeps getting hired (he's in the next Clint Eastwood film), but given how Ms. Farmiga and Mr. Bright enliven their scenes, it's hard not to wonder how this would have played out if it had starred a real actor. That said, even a talented lead couldn't save Mr. Kramer from himself. As a writer, he may have fashioned a genre-busting screenplay, one that has its postmodern cake and eats it, too, but as a director he proves himself as blood simple, if generally less adept, as any Hollywood hire. Mr. Kramer, whose debut feature, "The Cooler," was a dank little caper film memorable only because it stripped both Maria Bello and William H. Macy down to the nitty-gritty, has dedicated "Running Scared" to Sam Peckinpah, Brian De Palma and Walter Hill. It's a mystery how the last two gentlemen feel about being so honored, but the loud whirring sound you hear right now is Peckinpah rotating in his grave as fast as the Olympic ice dervish Yevgeny Plushenko sits and spins. "Running Scared" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is hyper-violent throughout and features many discomfiting scenes of a child in jeopardy. Running Scared Opens today nationwide. Written and directed by Wayne Kramer; director of photography, James Whitaker; edited by Arthur Coburn; music by Mark Isham; production designer, Toby Corbett; produced by Michael Pierce, Brett Ratner and Sammy Lee; released by New Line Cinema.

1344-> China and Hepatitis B (1 Letter)
To the Editor: "New York Asians Face Hidden Risk" (front page, May 11) notes that scientists do not know why the hepatitis B virus is common in China relative to other countries in the region. The real reason for the high prevalence of the disease in China is not often talked about. In its full swing into capitalism, the Chinese government has neglected its citizens. The disease can easily be prevented through vaccination, regulation of barbershop and manicure practices, and health education. Unlike its neighbors, virtually no money is spent on such cost-effective interventions in China. Peter Muennig, M.D. New York, May 11, 2006

1345-> After Years of Temporary Homes, One to Call Her Own
Maye Moran was living in and out of foster homes since she was 11, and it seemed as if the only source of stability in her life was her home health aide, who traveled with her from household to household. Ms. Moran, who was found to have cerebral palsy as a child, had been cared for by her maternal grandmother, a native of the Dominican Republic, until she was no longer able to do so. While living with her grandmother in Manhattan, Ms. Moran learned Spanish because that was the only language spoken at home. During that period, there were several unsuccessful tries to place her in a home, and the concept of finding a place where she could finally call home again began to dim. “When I was in different foster homes,” she said, “I sometimes wondered if I would find a family that would take care of me, and that I would love, too.” Little did Ms. Moran know that her home health aide, Dixia Muñoz-Perdomo, a native of Honduras who had traveled near and far to care for Ms. Moran as she moved from home to home, had a dream of her own: adopting Ms. Moran. “I couldn’t imagine Maye with anyone else,” she said through her translator, Carmen Ugas. “I decided enough was enough. I wanted to take care of her.” With the help of Lucy Jones, a senior social worker in the Post Legal Adoption Network program, or PLAN, at New Alternatives for Children, that dream became a reality. New Alternatives for Children is a nonprofit health and social services agency whose mission is to serve children with medical disabilities. Ms. Jones assisted Mrs. Muñoz-Perdomo and her husband, José, through the certification process to become foster parents, and in August 2002 — on Mrs. Muñoz-Perdomo’s birthday — Ms. Moran arrived at their Manhattan home as their foster child. “It was like a tremendous gift to me on my birthday,” Mrs. Muñoz-Perdomo said. Two years later, the Muñoz-Perdomos, who have three children of their own, legally adopted Ms. Moran, who now goes by the name Maye Moran Muñoz. “When I was placed in foster care, it was really, really hard not being where I was used to, with my grandmother,” she said. “But now I have a father, brothers, a sister and a mother who I love.” At 17, Ms. Muñoz, who is confined to a wheelchair, is a senior at Herbert H. Lehman High School in the Bronx. She is helped by a paraprofessional, a teaching assistant who guides Ms. Muñoz so she is able to keep up in her classes. They work with an Individual Educational Program, a written education plan for children with disabilities. “Over all the school is really supportive,” Ms. Muñoz said. “My para assists me with writing, and helps me get a better understanding of what the teacher is saying.” As Ms. Muñoz’s graduation date nears, her workload has increased in preparation for college. With a weak left hand from her cerebral palsy, Ms. Munoz, who is right-handed, overrelies on her functioning arm, which is reflected in her writing. “It was just harder to have work done not only on time, but in a way that you could read it,” she said. Mrs. Muñoz-Perdomo, although she still received calls offering her employment, had given up her career as a home health aide once she adopted Ms. Muñoz. Her husband makes a modest living as the superintendent of their building, but they were unable to buy Ms. Muñoz a personal computer. “When she used to come home from school, she used to talk about how much she needed a computer,” Mrs. Muñoz-Perdomo said. “And I used to feel bad that I was unable to purchase it for her.” This summer, Ms. Muñoz, with the assistance of Ms. Ugas, a caseworker in the post legal adoption program at New Alternatives for Children, wrote a letter to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund explaining her need for a computer. New Alternatives for Children is a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven agencies supported by the New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. Through the fund, Ms. Muñoz received a grant in the amount of $986 to buy a personal desktop computer. Ms. Muñoz mainly uses her right hand to type and receives physical and occupational therapy twice a week for her left hand. With stability at home from her extended family, Ms. Muñoz is looking toward the future. Although she is not certain of a college major yet, she is considering becoming a child physiologist for children with special needs. “When you relate to something,” she said, “you can understand it better.”

1346-> Rutgers Plays Its Way Into Big East Tourney
Gary Waters is not going anywhere, at least for a few days. Waters, who announced his resignation as Rutgers's coach Wednesday after agreeing to a buyout package, received a going-away present from his team yesterday. Rutgers earned a spot in the Big East tournament and extended its season with an 82-70 victory against St. John's at Carnesecca Arena in Queens in what amounted to a play-in game for the conference tournament. The winner would earn the 10th seeding in the tournament; the loser would not be invited. Twelve of the Big East's 16 teams take part. "It was monumental," Waters said of the victory. "You can call it that. It was something our kids wanted. A lot of people are going to say they were playing for me. No. They were playing to better themselves, and I want to see them have success. Once this thing is over with, they're not going to see me much anymore." Rutgers, which finished the regular season at 17-12 and 7-9 in the Big East, will play seventh-seeded Seton Hall (18-10, 9-7) on Wednesday night in opening-round play. The Scarlet Knights' finish was not good enough for Waters, in his fifth season at Rutgers, to keep his job. He is expected to be replaced by his associate head coach, Fred Hill. "We had to face a lot of adversity this week with all the media attention and the coaching situation," said Frank Russell, a seldom-used reserve, who had 9 points and 5 rebounds in 22 minutes. "When you're faced with adversity, that's when families come together. That's what we've been preaching all year. We really bonded. When the chips were down, we really stepped it up." The Scarlet Knights received another superb effort from the junior guard Quincy Douby, who scored 36 points and connected on 6 of 9 3-point attempts. "Give Douby credit," St. John's Coach Norm Roberts said. "God, he made some unbelievable shots. Most people just don't make those shots." The Red Storm (12-15, 5-11) was undermanned much of the game. The senior starter Ryan Williams sprained his right knee early in the game and played only two minutes. Douby broke a 47-47 tie with a 3-pointer to give the Scarlet Knights the lead for good with 11 minutes 55 seconds remaining. Rutgers did not cool off either, shooting 61.5 percent in the second half. St. John's could not take advantage of numerous trips to the free-throw line, at one point missing 5 of 8 attempts. St. John's finish was an improvement, however; the Red Storm won only nine games last season and just three in Big East play. But yesterday's game was still a bitter disappointment for the team, which was one home-court victory from qualifying for the Big East tournament for the first time since the 2002-3 season. "What I told the guys in the locker room was that this hurts, but it means we're playing in games that mean something," Roberts said. "To get to where we want to go, at the top, you have to go through some of this before you get there. It should hurt, and it does hurt." The sophomore guard Eugene Lawrence led St. John's with 22 points and 7 assists. Lamont Hamilton, a junior forward, had 14 points and 8 rebounds. REBOUNDS The Big East tournament opens Wednesday at Madison Square Garden with eighth-seeded Cincinnati facing No. 9 Syracuse at noon; No. 5 Georgetown against No. 12 Notre Dame at 2 p.m.; Seton Hall-Rutgers at 7; and No. 6 Pittsburgh versus No. 11 Louisville at 9.

1347-> Student-Driven Sudan Divestment Campaign Grows
NEW HAVEN, April 25 - Universities across the country have divested themselves of endowment assets in companies doing business in Sudan, reacting to pressure from students to take a financial stand against the violence in the Darfur region. At least seven universities have gotten rid of some of their assets, including the 10-campus University of California system, Harvard, Yale, Stanford and Brown. Divestment campaigns are under way at several other universities, including the University of Maryland, Indiana University and the University of Virginia. The campaign is organized by a national student-led group, Sudan Divestment Task Force, and is reminiscent of a campaign in the 1980's when student-led groups lobbied 55 universities to remove money from companies affiliated with the South African apartheid regime. The Sudan campaign also aims at states and municipalities. Illinois, New Jersey and Oregon have approved divestment, and legislation is pending in several other states. Earlier this month, Providence, R.I., became the first American city to authorize divestment. Last week, New Haven announced that it would strip municipal employees' pension funds of investments in companies doing business with the Sudanese government. "It can't just be the sort of piecemeal one-or-two companies symbolic approach," said Daniel Millenson, 19, a Brandeis University freshman and executive director of the task force. "It needs to be several universities, states, whatever, all passing the same kind of divestment solutions." Students pressing for divestment are holding rallies, collecting signatures, meeting with administrators to present research against the Sudanese government and writing opinion articles in campus newspapers. The task force is planning a bus trip to Washington on Thursday for about 500 students to participate in a day of lobbying on Friday and a protest on Sunday. They want troops sent to Darfur. Mr. Millenson and other student leaders concede that the effect of divestment is largely symbolic at this stage. They hope that eventually the companies' stock values will drop, leading them to re-evaluate their business ties to the Sudanese government, which has supported militias in a conflict that has killed more than 200,000 people and that the Bush administration has labeled genocide. "Nobody's really under the impression that divestment is going to be a cure-all for the genocide," said Eric Bloom, 20, a sophomore and co-coordinator of the divestment campaign here at Yale. Seeking to counter the divestment campaign, Sudan's ambassador to the United States issued a statement on April 5, calling on American companies and universities to increase investments in Sudan. "If your goal is to send a message of disapproval, divestment is not the correct tactic," wrote the ambassador, Khidir Haroun Ahmed. "If your goal is to promote peace, unity and development in Sudan, engagement is the correct course." The campaign began last spring at Harvard, when the university sold its estimated $4.4 million stake in PetroChina, a Beijing-based oil company with ties to Sudan. Harvard has the nation's largest endowment, valued last year at $25.9 billion. The move created an example that other universities could feel safe following, said Samantha Power, a Harvard professor who advised Lawrence H. Summers, the university's president, as he considered whether to divest. "It created a cloak for every other individual on a university board," Ms. Power said. "It really was, 'Hey, if Harvard is doing this, we're not some wacky lefties.' " Soon afterward, though, Harvard was criticized for increasing its holdings in Sinopec, another oil company doing business with Sudan. Last month, the university divested its shares in Sinopec, then valued at $8.3 million, after 1,200 students, faculty members and staff workers signed an online petition urging the action. At Yale, which has the nation's second-largest endowment, valued at $15.2 billion, the university's governing body ordered endowment managers in February to eliminate its holdings in seven oil companies doing business in Sudan and ban future investments in Sudanese government bonds. The move followed months of student pressure. The president of Amherst College, Anthony W. Marx, was a vocal advocate of divestment in South Africa when he was an undergraduate at Wesleyan and Yale in the 1980's. At Amherst, he sought out student advocates for discussion of Sudan before the college decided in January to separate from 19 companies."It felt a little eerie to sort of be sitting on this side of the table in that particular conversation, but I also felt in some ways like a bit of a circle being closed," Mr. Marx said. He added, "We live in a world where we can't hide from our interconnections, particularly when an issue like genocide comes around."

1350-> The Retooling of a Search Engine
OAKLAND, Calif., Dec. 3 — A replica of what looks like Han Solo of “Star Wars,” frozen in carbonite, sits outside Jim Lanzone’s office here. A closer inspection, however, reveals that the frozen body is that of another fictional character: Jeeves, the English butler best known in Internet circles as the mascot of the Ask Jeeves search engine. For Mr. Lanzone, chief executive of Ask.com, the prop is a reminder of what the Internet search company he runs has ceased to be. Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, headed by Barry Diller, in March 2005 for nearly $2 billion. A year later, IAC ditched Jeeves and renamed the search service Ask.com. “The reputation of Ask Jeeves was very poor,” Mr. Lanzone said. Now, Mr. Lanzone, who became chief executive in April, is ready to proclaim that efforts to transform that reputation are paying off. Like every other major search company, Ask would like to narrow Google’s huge lead in search and search advertising. After losing a distribution deal with Dell Computer late last year, Ask actually gave up market share to other search engines. But Mr. Lanzone said that in the last four months, Ask has steadily regained ground, to grab the No. 4 spot — even as larger companies like Microsoft and AOL, whose search is run by Google, have seen their market share erode. On Monday, Ask.com is introducing AskCity, a service that integrates maps with information about local businesses, restaurants, concert and movie listings and reviews. These so-called local searches already account for 10 percent of all Internet queries and are expected to grow faster than other searches. They are also seen as a way to tap into tens of billions in spending by small businesses, which have yet to switch much of their advertising dollars to the Internet. Early reviews of the service by analysts are positive, and Mr. Lanzone said AskCity, which makes use of data from other IAC businesses like Citysearch and Ticketmaster, was just the kind of service that was slowly helping Ask build a top-quality search engine. “Right now, the focus is almost entirely on improving the user experience,” Mr. Lanzone said. “This is the product that, to date, we are the most proud of. It is going to have a huge impact for people who use Ask.” For his part, Mr. Diller said AskCity was a demonstration of Ask’s role in helping tie together the disparate properties owned by IAC. AskCity is “a really good service that is dependent on the information from all these IAC sites, which is the raison d’être of the company itself,” Mr. Diller said, adding that over time, other IAC entities, which include HSN, LendingTree.com, Evite and Match.com, will be more tightly integrated with Ask. Accounting for 5.8 percent of all the searches in the United States in October, Ask has edged out AOL to become the fourth most popular search engine, according to comScore Media Metrix. By comparison, Google had 45.4 percent of all searches, Yahoo 28.2 percent and Microsoft 11.7 percent. Data from Nielsen NetRatings, which measures only searches on Ask.com, not on related sites in the Ask network, shows that Ask’s use grew 25 percent in October from a year earlier, the second highest rate of growth among the major search engines, after Yahoo. The turnaround of Ask began long before Mr. Diller acquired the company. After the collapse of the dot-com bubble, shares of Ask Jeeves dropped below $1 and the company was close to extinction. But in 2001, it sowed the seeds of its rebirth when it spent about $4 million to acquire Teoma Technologies, a small company in New Jersey that had developed well-regarded search technology. A year later, Ask Jeeves got a lifeline from Google, which cut a deal to place ads next to Ask Jeeves search results. Other major search engines largely organize results based on the number of links a Web site receives from other sites. But Teoma’s software first clusters sites based on content categories, then chooses the most popular sites in those categories. That approach, known as Expert Rank, has allowed Ask to do a better job at finding specialty sites that may be the most authoritative on a given subject, even though they may not be the most popular. Ask also has differentiated itself by giving users previews of the Web sites that appear in their searches and offering simple ways to narrow or expand search results. In a search for the keywords “California and wine,” for instance, a set of options will appear next to the results allowing you to focus your search on, say, California wineries, California wine ratings or California wine prices. You can also expand your query to famous foods in California. And Ask eliminated the emphasis on answering questions through Ask Jeeves, a feat it was able to accomplish on only a limited number of queries. The steady improvements have earned Ask the praise of analysts, reviewers and even some competitors. “They are doing a lot of clever and interesting things,” said Marissa Mayer, Google’s vice president for search products and user experience. AskCity is getting similar praise. “Over all, it is an impressive product,” said Greg Sterling, founder of Sterling Market Intelligence, a research firm. Mr. Sterling said AskCity compared favorably with competing local search services offered by Google, Yahoo and Microsoft. AskCity takes content from other companies, including some owned by IAC, and mixes it all into one site. If you search for a French restaurant in San Francisco, for instance, you will see a listing of all the restaurants alongside a map with the locations highlighted. A third pane allows you to narrow your search to a specific neighborhood, or immediately search for another kind of cuisine. It is also easy to view individual restaurant reviews through Citysearch or make reservations through a service called OpenTable. You can also select one restaurant and then do a subsequent search for nearby movies, concerts or other events, and book tickets for those events right on the site through Ticketmaster or TicketWeb. AskCity will also display walking or driving directions from the restaurant to the movie theater or concert hall. You can also annotate an AskCity map and e-mail it to others. You could, for instance, tell friends to meet at a certain location — say, Gate F at Monster Park, home of the San Francisco 49ers — mark the location with an X on the map, and send the map to friends who may not be familiar with the stadium. Or you could save a search of all the music clubs near your house and go back to it time and again to see what is playing at each location. While other local search sites require users to jump from event listings to maps and other services, AskCity “has integrated all those disparate services into one common interface,” said Jeetil Patel, an analyst for Deutsche Bank. “Ask has always been very good with the quality of its results, and this is another way to grow usage.” Mr. Lanzone is optimistic — perhaps overly so — about Ask’s prospects. “There is room for a Pepsi to Google’s Coke,” Mr. Lanzone said. For the foreseeable future, however, the Pepsi label would have to remain Yahoo’s, as Ask is a distant fourth in the search engine race — and that is counting not just searches on Ask.com, but also on sites like MyWay and iWon, which became part of Ask’s network when the company acquired Interactive Search Holdings in 2004. Even analysts bullish about Ask’s prospects are more circumspect. “My view is that people use Ask as a secondary engine,” said Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Company. But Mr. Rashtchy said that if Ask did nothing more than increase the frequency with which existing Ask users turned to the service, it could pay off. “Search is a very lucrative and large market,” Mr. Rashtchy said. “For them to increase the number of queries that users do on their site could result in a meaningful increase in profits.” Mr. Lanzone said there was another way that Ask could become an increasingly valuable property. The alliance with Google, which still serves up about 60 percent of all the ads on Ask, will end next year. Given that Google has paid huge sums to deliver ads on sites like MySpace and AOL, Ask should be in a good position to negotiate, Mr. Lanzone said. “When that deal is up, we need to look for what’s best for us,” Mr. Lanzone said.

1352-> Bill Would Sell Part of New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway to Investors
TRENTON, March 23 - For years, people who did their insurance business with Prudential, one of New Jersey's signature companies, were told that they owned "a piece of the rock." Now, people may have an opportunity to own a piece of other prominent state symbols: the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. Under a bill introduced this week by State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak, a Democrat from Union County, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority would set up a new corporation and sell a 49 percent stake of the turnpike and the parkway to investors. And while the bill would limit any toll increases to the rate of inflation, Mr. Lesniak said the sale would raise $6 billion and help pay down the state's pension liabilities. In recent years, a few governments have sold or leased their toll roads. Chicago sold the Skyway last year for $1.8 billion. But what Mr. Lesniak is proposing is a partial privatization, and would be tantamount to selling preferred stock. Outside the United States, that arrangement is not unusual, according to fiscal experts. For instance, France in 2004 began selling shares in its Autoroutes Paris-Rhin-Rhône, then Europe's third-biggest toll-road operator. It was not lost upon the political establishment in Trenton that Mr. Lesniak introduced his bill on Tuesday, the same day that Gov. Jon S. Corzine proposed in his inaugural budget to raise the sales tax a penny and cut overall spending by $2 billion. So immediately, speculation followed as to whether the bill represented an alternative to the proposed sales tax increase, or anything else in Mr. Corzine's $30.9 billion budget. When asked about the bill, Mr. Corzine seemed lukewarm at best, saying that "if it's not used for paying down debt or investing in capital functions, I probably have difficulty" with it. That reasoning was echoed by Senator Leonard Lance, a Hunterdon County Republican and the minority leader. He said that the proposal seemed reminiscent of the kind of borrowing to cover operating expenses that was ruled unconstitutional by the State Supreme Court in 2004. But Mr. Lesniak found support from several legislators, with the most prominent voice being that of Richard J. Codey, the Senate president and former acting governor. According to a task force that Mr. Codey convened last year as governor, the pension and health benefits system is costing the state $2.4 billion this year, with most of it going for health benefits, out of a $28 billion state budget. In 2010, that figure is projected to climb to $6.4 billion, or 20 percent of the budget. So to ensure full funding of benefits in future years, the report recommended that the state sell a public asset to generate $12.1 billion. The only assets approaching that in value are the two toll roads, the 148-mile-long turnpike and the 173-mile-long parkway, run by the authority.

1353-> For the Love of Yakyu
What a game! Daisuke Matsuzaka gave up a leadoff homer to Eduardo Paret, but then retired 12 of 15 batters, easily outpitching Ormari Romero and Vicyohandry Odelin. Michihiro Ogasawara drove in three runs while Kosuke Fukudome, Hitoshi Tamura and Toshiaki Imae drove in two each. Akinori Otsuka struck out Yulieski Gourriel in the ninth to end the game, and the winners threw their caps, gloves and Sadaharu Oh into the air. The World Baseball Classic, which ended on Monday night with Japan's 10-6 victory over Cuba, should forever erase any idea that the United States has a monopoly on its national pastime. The United States team, covered in springtime rust and missing many star players, who had been sprinkled generously onto other countries' lineups, struggled before being finished off by Mexico. As Murray Chass of The Times noted, nearly a half-billion dollars' worth of major league talent was sidelined as the Cubans and Japanese fought for the closest thing baseball has to a genuine world title. But this is nothing to be upset about. Japan has had baseball, which it calls yakyu, for essentially as long as we have. It arrived there in the 1870's and has put down deep roots in Asia, as the gritty performance of South Korea demonstrated. Béisbol has been a pan-American pastime for many generations, and such was the World Baseball Classic's broad appeal that Italy, Australia, the Netherlands and even South Africa showed up eager to play. That baseball has not caught on among the French may only underscore the global superiority of a sport that has been a vibrant American export since the days of whale oil. Alexander Joy Cartwright, the father of modern baseball -- with its nine innings, three outs, nine-man teams and rule against beaning the runner -- must be smiling in his grave in Honolulu, which was the capital of a kingdom when he planted baseball there in the 1850's. Baseball has suffered on its home turf lately, with the Barry Bonds steroid accusations exemplifying an atmosphere of cynicism and greed that has tainted the sport from the minors to the major leagues. With the supply of homegrown talent in decline, it's possible that baseball could someday become one of those activities, like manual labor and voting, that Americans tackle a lot less enthusiastically than foreigners do. But enthusiasm is infectious, and the tournament could easily help Americans rediscover their own love of the game, simply by seeing it through the eyes of people from other lands.

1354-> Without Shifting Tactics, Giambi Hits Over Orioles
During a 7-1 Yankees victory against the Baltimore Orioles yesterday, Jason Giambi raised his batting average 40 points to .326 and drove in five runs to lift his total to 17 for the season. But his two most interesting swings might not have been his home runs against the left-hander Bruce Chen. The first home run, which tied the score at 1-1 in the second inning, dropped into the lower deck in right field of Yankee Stadium. The second one, with a man on base in the third, crashed off the front of the upper deck in right and put his team ahead, 4-1. He has seven home runs this season. In terms of nuance, however, the more intriguing swings were Giambi's lineout into a double play in the fifth and his two-run double in the seventh. He hit the double-play ball on a line against John Halama, but he did so against the exaggerated defensive shift most teams use against him. It landed in the glove of first baseman Kevin Millar, who was playing near the line because Gary Sheffield was on first. So Millar ended the inning by stepping on the bag to get Sheffield. "I hit that one hard," Giambi said. "When I'm on the ball, I try not to do too much, just square it up and hit it hard." Had the ball gotten by the infield, Giambi would have had at least one more run batted in because Derek Jeter was on third. The double, against the same shift, with Jim Brower on the mound, went to the opposite field, landing against the wall in the left-field corner. Can fans now expect Giambi to confuse the opposition by going with pitches and spraying the ball? Probably not. "I don't really care about the shift," Giambi said. "I don't want to hit the ball on the ground, anyway, to be honest with you. Over the long haul, the shift has gotten me a few more hits than it's taken away. I just try to get a pitch I can handle, and I'm driving the ball a little bit more to left-center." All this smoothed the route for Randy Johnson (3-2), who went eight innings and gave up three hits, all of them to Miguel Tejada. A home run by Tejada off the left-field foul pole to lead off the top of the second gave the Orioles their only lead, 1-0. Giambi's second home run came on a 3-2 pitch with Alex Rodriguez on first base. It could have been a bigger inning, but Jeter was picked off first base earlier in the inning after singling, and Sheffield was thrown out at second on a steal attempt after a single. Although there were many rows of empty seats, a crowd of 47,996 was announced on a day that was alternately overcast, drizzly, foggy, breezy and, finally, sunny. The start was delayed for 41 minutes because of rain. Andy Phillips, whose hold on a roster spot is tenuous, improved his standing by driving in the go-ahead run with a second-inning single against Chen (0-3). Because Phillips played first base, Giambi was the designated hitter. Giambi seems to have mixed feelings about the offense-only role. "I've always stunk at it," he said. But he added that "it's almost like an off day" because he did not have to play in the field. He has no routine in between at-bats, he said, and tries to keep busy by hitting balls off a tee and watching the game on television. "My mind wanders," he said. With a day off before Tampa Bay visits for a three-game series, Giambi will have to find ways to fill more idle time. "These off-days are killing me," he said. "There's too many. It almost feels like spring training." A year ago, coming off various ailments and illnesses and his testimony in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative investigation of steroids, Giambi got off to a terrible start. He was dropped to eighth in the lineup and resisted a suggestion for a minor league assignment. There was discussion that the Yankees might try to get out of the rest of his contract, which extends through the 2008 season. But Giambi responded with a strong second half and was named the comeback player of the year in the American League by finishing with 32 home runs and 87 R.B.I. "From where he came early last year, he's the story here, more than anyone else," Manager Joe Torre said yesterday. Johnson is also a story, particularly when his slider moves the way it did against the Orioles. He struck out five and walked none and left after eight innings and 94 pitches so that Mariano Rivera could get some work. Referring to Giambi, Johnson said, "It's a blessing to have someone like that in the lineup." When asked whether he ever lost faith in himself, Giambi said: "I'd like to say no. I earned a lot of respect from my teammates by how hard I worked. It wasn't a pity party. The hard work paid off." With his team above .500 again, at 9-8, and victorious in three of its past four games, Giambi said good things were ahead. "You want to get that big train rolling," he said. "All the off-days have sidetracked our pitching. This team's going to be really good."

1355-> Britain Tightens Scrutiny of Teachers Amid Pedophilia Furor
LONDON, Jan. 19 - One newspaper said six "known sex offenders" were teaching in Britain's state-run schools. Another put the figure at 20. A third said there could well be more than 100. After two weeks of feverish language in the news media and around Parliament, the government announced on Thursday that it would tighten its background checks for teachers and that anyone who had been convicted or even cautioned by the police for committing a sex offense involving children would be permanently barred from teaching. "We need a system where child protection comes first above all other considerations," Ruth Kelly, the education secretary, told the House of Commons. The notion that the British schools are riddled with pedophiles has consumed national attention since early this month, when The Observer reported that a registered sex offender had been allowed to work as a gym teacher at a school in Norfolk. The teacher, Paul Reeve, was visited by the police in 2003 on suspicion of accessing child pornography from the Internet in connection with Operation Ore, which has charged thousands of people across Britain with downloading child pornography onto their computers. People netted include judges, police officers, politicians and the rock star Pete Townshend of The Who. Mr. Reeve was released with a caution, meaning he was not charged but agreed to accept guilt. He was automatically placed on the Sex Offenders Register. The register, which contains 28,000 names, includes people convicted or cautioned for sex-related offenses. The revelation cost Mr. Reeve his job and unleashed disclosures about other school employees suspected of sex offenses as well as outrage from critics of Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor government. School change is a major piece of Mr. Blair's domestic agenda in this legislative term, which he has said will be his last as prime minister. But with a reduced parliamentary majority and a suddenly strong Conservative opposition, Mr. Blair is at a vulnerable moment, one his opponents have seized with glee. "Either Ruth Kelly does know how many sex offenders have been cleared to work in our schools, in which case she should tell anxious parents now," David Willetts, education spokesman for the Conservative opposition, said. "Or she does not know, in which case her department is shockingly incompetent." Meanwhile, an article in The Daily Star carried the headline "Pervs Now Rife in Our Schools." The Mirror reported that "at least 10 pedophiles have got jobs" in the school system. In The Daily Mail, the columnist Melanie Phillips warned that the disclosures so far were "merely the tip of an iceberg." Pedophilia preoccupies Britain like almost no other issue. This is a country where a doctor's house was once attacked because some of his neighbors confused the word "pediatrician" with the word "pedophile." "This is a level of hysteria that makes McCarthyism look benign," said Frank Furedi, a professor of sociology at the University of Kent and the author of "Paranoid Parenting." Ms. Kelly revealed Thursday that a search of school records in England and Wales since 1997 had turned up 10 registered sex offenders who had not been placed on List 99, a roll of some 4,045 people who are barred from teaching because of a range of offenses. (Scotland has an independent education system, and its own lists.) None is teaching now, she said. Under the government plans, lists of potentially unsuitable teachers will be more closely aligned, and schools would be required to run criminal record checks on prospective employees.

1356-> 'Spell "World" Backward'
The last place my increasingly forgetful 85-year-old father wanted to be was sitting beside me in the office of a geriatric specialist. The doctor leaned forward at her desk and locked eyes with my father. "Has it been difficult for you to remember things recently, Mr. Cooper?" "I'm fine," he said. "I'm sure you are," she said. "But if we test you today, we'll have a base line to compare against future tests." "Future tests?" He looked as if he'd tasted something sour. "I'm going to ask you several questions," she continued, "and I'd like you to answer them one at a time." "How else would I?" "How else would you what?" "Answer them, for Christ's sake!" The doctor jotted a note. "We'll be working from what's called the Mini-Mental State Examination," she explained, "and I'll score your answers as we go along." Dad adjusted his Miracle-Ear. "So test me, already." First she asked my father to tell her the date. I silently answered along. He got it right. I was off by a couple of days. I scooted my chair closer. Now I had something to prove. I felt as if my father and I were opponents on a quiz show. "What state are we in?" "City?" "Hospital?" "Floor?" Not until she whispered "Bernard" did I realize that I'd been muttering answers under my breath. But I was sure my father hadn't heard me. And anyway, I got them right. Dad, on the other hand, didn't know what floor we were on. But he probably would have known it was the third if he had been the one to push the elevator button instead of me. The mechanics of recall are delicate, so iffy and contingent. My father lowered his head and laced his fingers together in his lap. He had the shamed, inward look of a man who knows he has blundered but doesn't know how. "Mr. Cooper?" she asked. "Are you ready to continue?" My father nodded. His head seemed heavy, as if with answers that would soon elude him. "Spell 'world' backward," the doctor said. "Why 'world'?" Dad asked, peering over his glasses. Because the world is backward, I said to myself. Laws are repealed. Iron rusts. Logic unravels. "I suggest you don't overthink the questions, Mr. Cooper. Just try to relax and let the answers come." Dad deliberated on every letter. "D. . .L. . .O. . . R. . .W?" She recorded his score. "Now, please repeat the following list of items in the same order: Apple, penny, table." My father cocked his head. "Did I get it right?" "You haven't repeated the items yet." "Not those," he said. "'World.' Did I get it backward?" "Ask me at the end of the test." "Suppose I forget?" "We should move on to the next question," the doctor insisted. "Now, kindly repeat after me: Apple, penny, table." "Why can't you tell me now?" "Apple, penny, table," she persisted "Apple," he said at last. "The rest I forget." He dismissed his insufficient recall with a wave of his hand, but he looked at me to gauge how he was doing. I smiled noncommittally back. Next she held up her pen. "Can you tell me what this is?" "A ballpoint," he said. "Does it have your motto on it?" The doctor told him that men and women in her profession didn't, as a rule, have mottos. Then she noticed that there were, in fact, words printed on the side of the pen. She held it horizontally and squinted. "Hot Water Management Service," she read. "Where could this have come from?" Was the question part of the test? "Pens are everywhere these days," Dad said. "But what the hell is a Hot Water Management Service?" We hadn't a single answer among us, not a guess or a speculation. The doctor continued to gaze at the pen, turning it as if she might find other phrases. Beyond the hospital window, the sky above the city deepened into dusk. The office walls dimmed, our faces growing vague. A clock ticked on the desk, and I felt in my bones that the three of us, second by second, were being drawn toward a vast and eventual forgetting. Nothing we could do or say would stop it. One day this room wouldn't be remembered by anyone now sitting in it. Bernard Cooper is the author of the memoir "The Bill From My Father," to be published next month by Simon & Schuster and from which this essay is adapted.

1357-> Hazard Ahead: Preteen Fashions
MY daughter Clementine has always had a strong sense of personal style. True, it wasn’t always the style I would have chosen for her. When she was 4, for instance, she wore only princess dresses. And fur-trimmed gloves. And a tiara. As she climbed out of her car seat, she would take a moment to adjust the train on her velvet dress, with great dignity, before sailing majestically into nursery school. Like other little girls, her taste was influenced by popular culture. After seeing “The Wizard of Oz,” she went through what we called her Dorothy period, which involved ruby slippers. She segued into kimono-style dresses after discovering manga and, more recently, started to smooth her hair into a sleek bun after reading Noel Streatfeild’s “Ballet Shoes.” Now she is 9. And with two teenage sisters, Clementine has not been lucky enough to avoid exposure to Lindsay Lohan wearing trampy makeup in “Mean Girls” or episodes of “The O.C.,” on which Mischa Barton sports low-cut lacy camisoles. As a result, Clementine stands on a fashion precipice that I, as her mother, find terrifying. To put it bluntly, she wants clothes that make her look older. I want clothes that don’t. Ours is not one of those households that has embraced the current trend of high-fashion designer clothes for those still attending the primary grades. No mini Rock & Republic jeans at $154 a pair; the item’s description at eluxury.com (“for the mini style goddess”) does not move me. So as fourth grade began this fall, we made a pact. Any new clothing for Clementine would have to serve the dual purpose of making her feel sophisticated without making me wonder if a pierced belly button is next. Pickings were slim at local stores. Online, where selections were better, we found a handful of items we both could endorse. At Bodenusa.com, for example, the polka-dot girls’ skating skirt ($36) qualified. At Target.com, we bought the long-sleeved Mossimo hooded henley ($9.99) in multiple colors. At Nordstrom.com, the Steve Madden “tweet” flat dress shoes ($34.95) earned our respective seals of approval. But a few articles of clothing do not a complete wardrobe make, at least not for a person who grows two inches a year. With chafing winter winds just around the corner, we were starting to despair of finding a pair of sweatpants long enough to cover her exposed ankles until one day last week when we wandered into a J. Crew store at the mall. There, in the back, was a display of a new pint-size collection for kids — called Crewcuts — that the company introduced nationwide this year. We loved miniature versions of the company’s signature cable sweaters, herringbone miniskirts and argyle sweaters. What appealed immediately to Clementine was the possibility of wearing grown-up styles — like a striped broadcloth shirt with a ruffled collar ($38), a raisin-colored velveteen blazer ($68) and a gray wool kilt ($62) — in the sorts of mix-without-matching color combinations that come naturally to children who dress themselves. What appealed to me was the prospect of well-made clothes that avoid midriff exposure, all available in sizes 2 to 8. Well, at least in theory the clothes came in sizes 2 to 8. Seconds after both Clementine and I fell hard for the shrunken Fair Isle cardigan with rhinestones ($58) and started rooting around for one that would fit her, we realized that everything bigger than a toddler was sold out. Alas, no lambswool argyle sparkle cardigan ($58) for us. Had Clementine been young enough to wear size 4 or smaller, we could have had our choice of color in the stripe pleated tuxedo shirt ($38). Or any number of “critters” embroidered on 14-wale cords ($49.50). But the selection was so picked-over in larger sizes that the best we could do was to snag a short-sleeve cotton argyle sweater ($29.99) and a sale-price navy-and-white polka-dot cotton skirt that has since disappeared from both the store and company’s Web site. The reason for the scarcity, in the opinion of Margot Brunelle, a J. Crew spokeswoman I phoned after I got home, is that the children’s collection embodies elements that adults have been requesting for years. “Our customers told us repeatedly that for their kids they wanted J. Crew quality and J. Crew DNA classics with a quirky twist, like bright colors or mixing a kilt with wellies,” Ms. Brunelle said. “There was a void in the market for ages 2 to 8.” But as a shopper with 17 years of experience in buying clothes for daughters, I think the void is much narrower. Companies like Hanna Andersson have been successfully meeting the needs of the younger end of the market, with classic little-girl dresses with matching leggings, since before I discovered the brand more than 15 years ago. And trendier styles at Gap.com (where the Baby Gap selection currently includes a particularly cute heather gray sparkle wrap sweater, $29.50) long ago made the idea of toddler fashion a mainstream concept. It is only after the toddlers stop toddling and start spouting opinions about what they want to wear that the selection wanes. Gap Kids, for instance, has never had a collection one-tenth as quirky or cute as Baby Gap. And despite the recent arrival of luxury brands like Burberry and high-fashion designers like Juicy Couture to the under-12 market, there aren’t a lot of styles that manage to arrive at the intersection of what girls like and parents can tolerate. The success of Crewcuts, so far, is that it easily passes muster with both generations. But one drawback is availability. J. Crew has two free-standing Crewcuts stores in Dallas and White Plains, with a third planned; the collection also has display space in 11 traditional J. Crew stores, with expansion plans for 4 more stores. My best bet to find bigger sizes of the cuter styles was to go online. At Jcrew.com, I found both the argyle and Fair Isle cardigans still in stock. A pair of classic slim-cut black sweatpants ($29.50) I hadn’t seen at the store also were available. “In retail stores, there’s only so much space for merchandise,” Ms. Brunelle said. “But online, we have more flexibility to offer a wider assortment, maybe even a couple of pieces not in the stores, like flower-girl dresses available in two to four colors, instead of just one.” A bigger problem, I told her, is that my daughter is going to grow out of size 8 by spring. Ms. Brunelle said, “We’re adding sizes 9 and 10.” Good, because Hilary Duff’s movie “Material Girls” will be out on DVD by then, and in my house we’ll be looking for a fashion antidote.

1358-> A Gonzo Candle, Burned at Both Ends
It probably seemed like a great idea to hire Nick Nolte as narrator for a documentary about Hunter S. Thompson. Mr. Thompson, the author of “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,” “Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail” and “Hell’s Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga,” invented gonzo journalism. Mr. Nolte has a reputation for living gonzo. But alas, when Mr. Nolte’s voice begins in “Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride: Hunter S. Thompson on Film,” which has its premiere tonight on Starz, he sounds less like an outlaw than a slightly slow student who doesn’t understand the words he is reading. Tom Marksbury’s sometimes-pedestrian script doesn’t help. The only time Mr. Nolte is frighteningly right for the part is at the end, when he reads Mr. Thompson’s typically brilliant suicide note. Mr. Thompson shot himself at his Colorado home in February 2005. He was 67, which was probably an indignity to a man who was professionally young and reckless. How ya gonna inspire the next generation to anarchy when you look like a retired hardware salesman? Despite the Hollywood star power (Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, Bill Murray) in “Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride,” the best parts are those in which somebody (anybody) reads Mr. Thompson’s work. For instance, he once described Richard M. Nixon as “a foul caricature of himself, a man with no soul, no inner convictions, with the integrity of a hyena and the style of a poison toad.” Sadly, the rest of the time the talking heads rattle on, and even interviews with Mr. Thompson are relatively uninformative. His message, as they say, was in his work. It seems that the director, Tom Thurman, couldn’t bring himself to edit out any celebrity comment, even if that person’s point had been made several times before. (A peculiar exchange with Gary Busey belongs in another film.) This might be all right if the people at least said it in fresh ways. But many of the comments are as unsurprising as George McGovern’s: “He shook up the establishment.” One likable exception is William F. Buckley’s likening Mr. Thompson to “a streaker in Queen Victoria’s drawing room.” And Tom Wolfe does pay Mr. Thompson a lavish compliment, calling him “the century’s greatest comic writer in the English language.” “Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride” offers a bit of biographical background. Mr. Thompson was born and grew up in Kentucky, where he was a self-described juvenile delinquent. After high school he joined the Air Force. He was married twice and had one son. His widow, Anita, calls him “a supreme Southern gentleman.” A welcome possible side effect of the documentary, which could have easily been a half-hour shorter, is that it will inspire viewers to read Mr. Thompson’s work, perhaps starting with his early magazine article “The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved.” Directed by Tom Thurman; written by Tom Marksbury; narrated by Nick Nolte; produced by Christopher Black and Mr. Thurman; Michael Ruggiero and Stephan Shelanski, executive producers; Jim Piston, director of photography and editor; lighting by Sean Anderson; original music by Frank Schapp and Otto Helmuth.

1359-> Ex-CA Executive Pleads Guilty
A former executive with CA, the software maker, pleaded guilty yesterday to obstructing justice by trying to buy the silence of potential witnesses in a stock scandal, prosecutors said. The former executive, Thomas Bennett, 50, faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced Oct. 12. A call to his lawyer was not immediately returned. Mr. Bennett was senior vice president in charge of business development for CA, formerly Computer Associates International, based in Islandia, N.Y. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have accused Mr. Bennett of conspiring with other executives to manipulate more than $2 billion in revenue in 1999-2000 to prop up the company's share price. When the plan began to unravel, the chief executive, Sanjay Kumar, authorized Mr. Bennett to pay millions of dollars to clients to stop them from reporting the accounting fraud to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission, prosecutors said. In April, Mr. Kumar and the company's former head of worldwide sales, Stephen Richards, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges. Their sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 12.

1365-> Double Standards And Official Leaks
To the Editor: I found "Loose Lips Sink Spies," by Porter Goss (Op-Ed, Feb. 10), rather vague. Obviously Mr. Goss wants someone to feel guilty, but I can't tell exactly whom. Mr. Goss is director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Perhaps vagueness is a side effect of his line of work. Mr. Goss condemns those who leak classified information when it is not in the public interest, but he could be referring to anything. He could be criticizing I. Lewis Libby Jr. for leaking the name of a C.I.A. agent, or the "superiors" Mr. Libby has said authorized that leak. He could be arguing that it was inappropriate for the public and Congress to be informed about potentially illegal wiretapping by the National Security Agency. Perhaps he was blasting President Bush for mentioning an alleged foiled plot by Al Qaeda to attack Los Angeles. Or is he just angry with the press? There is a growing need among average citizens to be assured that the government is not abusing or frittering away its power. When it seems that entirely too many documents are classified, we are left with few options to check our leaders. Gregory Linkowski Chicago, Feb. 10, 2006

1366-> Stretching the Preschool Day
It is a great concept: Take the 34,000 or so children in New York who are now in half-day pre-kindergarten classes, and extend their program to a full day. The benefits of expanded early childhood education have been widely affirmed. This is especially true for children from disadvantaged homes who, without early intervention, are most likely to lag behind their classmates in vocabulary and other ways when they begin their regular schooling. The City Council Speaker, Christine Quinn, wants to spend nearly $300 million in city money to extend prekindergarten hours over the next three years. Mayor Michael Bloomberg agrees on the need for more and better preschool programs and has spoken eloquently about it; indeed, he has made it a centerpiece of his fight to get the state to cough up the billions of dollars in education money it owes the city. But the money is tied up in court and there's no telling when it will appear. Mr. Bloomberg is justified in asking the state to pay for universal prekindergarten. For starters, Gov. George Pataki promised to pay for such a program in a deal he struck with State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver in 1997. The state sends the city about $150 million a year for prekindergarten programs, but that is not enough to underwrite full-day sessions. Children now spend only two and a half hours in the program. That forces their working parents to find day care for the afternoon, with the result that many do not register their children. This in turn leads to inefficiencies; at the end of the year, the city winds up spending less than it could have simply because there were not enough children to fill the available places. Such waste has recurring ramifications. Children in pre-kindergarten are less likely to repeat grades or need special assistance. They drop out less often. It costs less in the long run -- far less -- to begin to educate these children when they are three and four years old. Last month, Mr. Bloomberg played a high-stakes game of chicken with Albany when he threatened to stop school construction in the districts of key legislators. The chastened lawmakers eventually approved more than $11 billion to build city schools. But that's just part of the obligation the state incurred in a lawsuit brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity. Albany still owes the city operating funds amounting to as much as $5.6 billion in the next four years. Mr. Bloomberg plans to use some of that money for preschool and has called for doubling the number of enrolled children. But because the money may be slow in arriving, Ms. Quinn wants to make changes right away, working with communities to find space to accommodate full-day sessions while the city spends some of its capital windfall to increase preschool space. The city should not have to go it alone on something that should be a state obligation. But a stand on principle may be less important than not wasting another minute to educate at-risk children at the earliest opportunity.

1367-> World Bank Failed in Fight Against Malaria, Health Experts Say
The World Bank failed to follow through on its pledges to spend up to $500 million to combat malaria, let its staff working on the disease shrink to zero, used false statistical data to claim success and wasted money on ineffective medicines, according to a group of public health experts writing in the British medical journal The Lancet. The experts, in an article to be published online today, argue that the bank should relinquish the money it has to fight malaria, which kills an African child every 30 seconds, and instead let the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria distribute the bank's malaria funds. The World Bank conceded in a written reply to the article that its malaria programs were understaffed and underfinanced, but denied using false statistics or paying for obsolete medicines. It said that in the past year it had revitalized its malaria program. Bank officials said in an interview on Monday that the number of staff members working on malaria had grown from none to more than 40 in the past year, while $62 million in new spending had recently been approved, an amount expected to rise to $190 million by June. The Global Fund does not have staff on the ground in Africa to monitor how the money is spent, while the World Bank does, bank officials said in their written reply. "The story captures a lot of the bank's shortcomings from a year ago," Suprotik Basu, a public health specialist in the bank's malaria program, said yesterday. "But now we've had a year of progress." In 1998, when the bank began the Roll Back Malaria campaign, it promised to spend $300 million to $500 million to help halve the number of malaria deaths in a decade. More than a million people die of malaria each year, mostly African children. But just four years after its commitment, the number of bank staff working on malaria fell to zero from seven, a fact Mr. Basu acknowledged. Bank employees, sensing the lack of commitment, left the program and were not replaced, he said. The bank's own estimates of its spending since 1998 have ranged from $100 million to $450 million, according to Amir Attaran, a biologist and constitutional lawyer at the University of Ottawa who is the article's lead author. He and his co-authors found it disturbing that the bank did not know how much it had given or lent for malaria programs. "That the bank's management tolerates such vague accounting when serving its clients, the African states to whom it pledged an increase in malaria control funds, is extraordinary," they wrote. In its reply, the bank said it and other donors often provided money as general support to public health services, making it difficult to track how much of the bank's money went to malaria. Under its new president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, the bank has instituted a new system for closely monitoring spending, Mr. Basu said. The authors also accused the bank of medical malpractice for spending about $1.8 million to buy more than 100 million tablets of chloroquine for India, even though a deadly species of the malaria parasite had developed a resistance to the medicine at levels that exceeded the acceptable failure rate of 15 percent set by the World Health Organization. The bank replied that about half the confirmed cases of malaria in India were caused by a different malaria parasite that generally responded to chloroquine, which it said was one-tenth to one-twentieth cheaper than combination drug therapies. "On the basis of available information, India stood to get good value for money by spending scarce resources wisely in accordance with local realities," bank officials wrote.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police commissioner, Giuliano Zaccardelli, publicly apologized to Maher Arar, the Canadian man deported to Syria by the United States after the Mounties mistakenly reported him as a terrorist, "for the terrible injustices that you experienced and the pain that you and your family endured." At a news conference in Ottawa, Mr. Zaccardelli also said that the force had decided that because no officers had acted maliciously, none had been punished and that he did not intend to resign.

1369-> Tipping Is Part of Travel, So What About the Maid?
OH, I'm a regular Daddy Warbucks when it comes to tipping. Unless I spot a waiter deliberately putting his or her foot in the soup, I'm probably going to leave 20 percent or more. That bartender who spends 30 seconds pouring a cold beer into a glass and sliding it over at the airline lounge? Two dollars for you, my good fellow. Yet not too long ago, I resembled another comic strip legend, Scrooge McDuck, when it came to tipping the hotel maid. You know, the woman (and it is virtually always a female worker) who makes the bed, takes out the trash, changes the towels and generally leaves the room looking like something a real estate agent would want to show off. Perhaps because they were unseen, working in the room when the guest was gone, hotel maids were generally overlooked by many travelers until fairly recently. A seasoned business traveler would always make sure to have a bunch of singles on hand to take care of the parking valet, the bellhop, the doorman and the cabby. But the maid? "It really hadn't occurred to me until fairly recently that I should be tipping the maid," said Jim Dougans of Indianapolis. Mr. Dougans, 53, runs a company called New Church Development Consultants that evaluates demographics and scouts locations for the development of new churches. Business is booming, and Mr. Dougans says the pace of his business travel has picked up to the point that he is on the road one week of every month. "So the issue came to prominence in my mind as I spent more time I hotels," he said. He began thinking and reading about the circumstances of hotel workers, many of whom are immigrants in the ranks of the working poor, "I pretty much assumed if you're working you're able to get by." Mr. Dougans said he usually stays in Hampton Inns, a midlevel brand of Hilton Hotels, where he presumes (correctly) that "the maids are better off than those at some little roadside motel." Still, he said: "This job is really low status and low-paying no matter where it's done. So I figure it's no big deal to me leaving a few dollars a day, and for them it might make a difference. At least it makes a connection." Here are some practical tips on tipping: First of all, ignore the laughable advice from the American Society of Travel Agents, frequently reprinted on Internet sites about travel and tipping, that $1 a day is standard for the maid. Big spenders, those travel agents. Actually, $3 to $5 a day is more like it. And keep in mind that hotel maids worry about being accused of stealing loose cash, and sometimes will not pick up a tip if they aren't sure it is a tip. So leave the tip on the pillow with a note that clearly indicates what it is. I usually write, "For the housekeeper." Mr. Dougans says he merely writes, "Thanks." He said he marveled at the physicality of the housekeeping job. It has become more intense in recent years, especially as hotels in the upscale and luxury niches have added luxurious new beds and bedding. Take a look at those swanky beds. They have duvets. They have half a dozen pillows and heavy 300-thread-count sheets -- usually three sheets, rather than two, per bed. Now think about the extra work involved in making those swell beds. Yet in most hotels, the maids are still expected to do the same number of rooms a shift, usually 14 to 16. This is not a column meant to examine the brewing battle between labor and the currently robust domestic hotel business. But let's acknowledge Unite, the union that represents more than 200,000 workers, including 60,000 housekeepers, among the estimated 1.3 million employees of the hotel industry. We will be hearing more from Unite in coming months as the union mobilizes to take on major hotel chains in big cities. (For business travelers looking ahead to spring and summer, information on that campaign is at www.hotelworkersrising.com.) Tipping the housekeeper is a considerate practice, said Amanda Cooper, a union spokeswoman who says she always leaves something. "Some people leave, say, $5 a day, which can make a significant impact," she said. She went on: "I wouldn't say as a union we don't encourage people to tip, but we also believe that housekeeping jobs should be decent jobs, and a tip isn't going to get them health care or a decent retirement." The occasional tips, she said, "don't make the difference between that being a good job or a bad job. So we also think that business travelers can do a lot by staying at hotels that do right by their workers." ON THE ROAD E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

1371-> World Briefing | Europe: Georgia: Russia Recalls Envoy Over Spy Dispute
Simmering diplomatic tensions between Russia and Georgia increased significantly a day after Georgian authorities arrested at least five Russian military officers and at least 10 Georgians and accused them of spying. Russia's foreign and defense ministers demanded their immediate release, while lawmakers and others denounced Georgia with war-like rhetoric, saying the government should free the detainees by force, if necessary. Russia announced that it would withdraw its ambassador and evacuate some Russians living in Georgia. The Russian Embassy in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, announced it had stopped issuing visas to Georgians hoping to visit Russia. The Georgian police, meantime, maintained a cordon around a building in Tbilisi used by the Russian military, which is slowly withdrawing forces it has stationed there since the collapse of the Soviet Union.

1372-> Habits: Frequent Tanners Can Quit Anytime, or Can They?
Tanning, besides its other dangers, may be addictive. A small study suggests that frequent tanners, deprived of ultraviolet light, can experience symptoms similar to opioid withdrawal. The scientists compared 8 people who used tanning salons 8 to 15 times a month with 8 who visited no more than 12 times a year. Their findings appear this month in The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. At each of four visits, participants took increasingly larger doses of either a placebo or Naltrexone, which blocks opioid receptors and induces withdrawal symptoms in those addicted to opioids. Each was randomly assigned to tan for 10 minutes under either an ultraviolet light or an identical-looking nonultraviolet light. Frequent tanners who received a placebo exhibited greater preference for the ultraviolet light compared with nonfrequent tanners. No adverse effects were reported among the infrequent tanners at any dose of Naltrexone, but at a 15-milligram dose, four of the eight frequent tanners began to experience nausea or jitteriness, consistent with opiate withdrawal. Ultraviolet radiation, the authors suggest, may produce endorphins, which have properties like opioids. The results suggest a physiological explanation for previous reports, including one last year in Archives of Dermatology, that some people are obsessive sunbathers. "I don't think we've proven that tanning is addictive," said Dr. Steven R. Feldman, senior author of the paper and a professor of dermatology at Wake Forest. "But people aren't tanning just to look good. Anyone who goes to the beach and lies out in the sun knows how pleasant and relaxing it is."

1373-> Mel Schneeberger and Christopher Robbins
WHEN Mel Schneeberger and Christopher Robbins married on Aug. 24, 1996, they were living a perfect Manhattan life. Mr. Robbins, the founder of a marketing company, skated to work in beautiful unwrinkled suits. Ms. Schneeberger, who loved margaritas and fly-fishing, was a lawyer. They said, however, that they were much more interested in creating an imperfect life together, one full of risks, wrinkles, challenges, even crises. Their idea of a great vacation was to be dropped off by a pilot in the backcountry of Alaska and picked up three weeks later. "I am not at all interested in being comfortable," Ms. Schneeberger said at the time. "I always want to think, what's next? When you're comfortable, I think you stop living life with velocity." They got their wish. A year after their wedding, they left Manhattan and bought the most uncomfortable home they could find, a ramshackle, raccoon-infested Victorian-style farmhouse in Sherborn, Mass., 20 miles outside Boston. "A cross between 'Amityville Horror' and 'The Money Pit,' " Ms. Schneeberger said with delight. While renovating, they lived in a tent in the backyard. They put a refrigerator, a camping stove and a crippled old couch on the front porch, which served as their kitchen. To add to her discomfort she was pregnant with their first child and working full time as a family lawyer in Boston. "I would go in to work having just slept in a tent, and I would shower in the gym downstairs in my office," Ms. Schneeberger, 37, recalled. When their daughter, Sawyer Laurel, was born in March 1999, Ms. Schneeberger envisioned days of blissful breastfeeding in their one renovated room. Instead she experienced real discomfort, going through such bad postpartum depression that she was afraid to be alone with the baby. "It was the most foreign and unsettling experience of my life," she said. "Chris did round-the-clock bottle feedings with Sawyer. Meanwhile I was in such rough shape he was taking care of me." For him having their first child was like living in a cramped apartment and finding a ballroom on the other side of the closet, only instead of space he found emotion. "I have a deep, profound love for Mel, but when you have children there's still more there you hadn't seen or felt before," he said. Once her mood lightened, they came up with a style of being parents that was purposely imperfect. "We decided it was typically the third child that was the most well adjusted and the coolest, so we took a third child approach to parenting," she said. "If she's the third and she drops her binky, you blow it off and hand it to her. If you have a dog, you teach the dog to pick it up and hand it to her." Today they have two more children, Kendall Iris, 5, and their son Oakley, 11 months old. They still live in the farmhouse, but it looks like a Manhattan loft inside, open and white, with a high tech stereo system that's often playing Dire Straits, the family's favorite band. And their life is as they dreamed: intense, turbulent, happy. Oakley has a serious bowel disorder known as Hirschsprungs disease. "He spent from 6 days old to about a month old in the neonatal intensive care unit," Ms. Schneeberger said. "You want to talk about stress? Holy moley. We were there around the clock. We had kids at home. They're doing surgery on our baby, who weighs eight pounds. It was hairy. It was earth-shattering traumatic." During that time their neighbors and friends in Sherborn cooked dinners for Sawyer and Kendall, baby-sat and made margaritas for the couple when they returned home. "It's a really interesting, fun, unpretentious community of people who live here," Ms. Schneeberger said. "It's not the manicured lawn scene." She added, "No matter how far you fall, someone is going to be there to catch you." Ms. Schneeberger and Mr. Robbins still describe their lives as adventurous, though they no longer have time to bushwhack in Alaska. Instead they bring an exploratory spirit to their conversations around the kitchen table. "One way we're adventurous is we tell the truth regardless of the consequences," she said. They examine and discuss their relationship, as if they were reading a map in the wilderness. "My deal with Chris and his deal with me is 'no barnacles,' " she said. "You don't get to have anything that you're holding on to about the other person." In the spring of 2004, Ms. Schneeberger started her own business as a life coach, encouraging people and businesses to take risks, to be decisive and to avoid gray areas as if they were quicksand. Shortly afterward, Mr. Robbins was laid off from his job as a vice president for business development at a high tech company. He, too, decided to open his own business, only he hadn't decided what kind of business. "My feet for all intents and purposes had left the dock," he said, "but it wasn't clear in which direction I was swimming." Until then he had paid all of the bills. "We had the model where he made most of the money, and then I contributed," she said. "My money was for the extras. It was like, 'His money is our money, and my money is my money.' " She did not respond gracefully to the change. "I was mad," she recalled. "I said: 'I don't care if you're unhappy, I want you to get a job. Make some income while you're figuring out what you want to do.' " Or, as she explained it: "My mother and grandmother made it clear to me you need to work because that's how you have power as a woman, if you have your own source of money. It never occurred to me I wouldn't work. But as soon as it became a 'have to,' my whole model got flipped around. I consider myself extremely liberal, but all of a sudden I had an extremely conservative view of marriage." Nevertheless, while he brainstormed, she became the reluctant breadwinner, occasionally panicking and putting up a For Sale sign outside their house. Her mantra became, Change Is Good. And eventually she began to believe it. Last August, Mr. Robbins opened the Stone Hearth Pizza Company in Belmont, Mass., a hip but child-friendly pizzeria, which uses organic and mostly locally grown ingredients. The restaurant is doing so well, Mr. Robbins said, that he is opening another in May in Sudbury, Mass. And Ms. Schneeberger can spend more time at home, dancing to Dire Straits with the kids. "Really has been a wild ride with exciting and heart-wrenching times," Mr. Robbins wrote in an e-mail message. "Can't deny that I'm often overwhelmed by the challenge of raising kids, pursuing a profession, paying the bills, keeping mind, body, health in check and having a passionate relationship with Mel. One thing is for sure, you can't imagine any of this when standing at the altar, and it's certainly not something you can prepare for. And, yes, it's an adventure every day."

1374-> Britten's Song Cycles Revisited
BRITTEN wrote his 1939 orchestral song cycle "Les Illuminations" for the Swiss soprano Sophie Wyss. But later, when his tenor colleague and romantic partner Peter Pears took up the work, Britten wrote in a letter, "Peter has shown people now how it really goes." Though his comment was not so kind to Wyss, an honorable singer, you can understand Britten's enthusiasm. Pears's light, ethereal tenor was ideally suited to this haunting and sensual score, settings of prose poems by Rimbaud for high voice and strings. Before long, Pears was the singer of choice for almost all Britten's vocal music, especially the operas. After Pears appropriated "Les Illuminations," Britten followed with two other major orchestral song cycles written with his distinctive voice in mind: the 1943 Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings, and the 1958 Nocturne, for tenor, seven obbligato instruments and strings. The recordings Pears made of these scores with Britten conducting would seem as definitive as any could be. None of which has stopped subsequent tenors from performing these remarkable scores, and if there are three greater works for voice and orchestra from the mid-20th century I don't know what they are. The latest tenor to perform them is Ian Bostridge, whose recording with Simon Rattle conducting the Berlin Philharmonic has just been released by EMI Classics. The performances, while true to the Pears model, represent boldly reconsidered and bracingly fresh takes. For all its plaintiveness and expressivity, Pears's voice on his recordings of these works has an otherworldly, ageless, almost spectral quality. Mr. Bostridge, in his way, sings the ethereal passages in these scores with boyish lightness and shapes the phrases with cool elegance. Then, when the music heats up and turns sensual, he exudes a husky, almost adolescent virility. Paradoxically, the homoerotic undercurrents in "Les Illuminations" seem closer to the surface in these dynamic performances than in the recordings by Pears and Britten. Additionally, Sir Simon and the Berlin players treat these works like audacious contemporary scores. Naturally, Britten was a powerfully authoritative conductor of his own music. Yet in his recordings, I sometimes feel that he took for granted how extraordinarily innovative his harmonic language was. Not Sir Simon. There is something rough-hewn and dangerous in his accounts of these works, and Mr. Bostridge is his temperamental soul mate. In "Phrase," the third song of "Les Illuminations," the voicing of the strings and Mr. Bostridge's alluringly thin-toned singing make the music seem neo-medieval and disorienting. In the great Serenade, a cycle of settings of poems by Tennyson, Blake, Keats and others, the performance captures the Mahlerian mysticism of the music, especially in "Elegy," and the phantasmagorical strangeness of the "Dirge." The horn player, Radek Baborak, conveys the feeling Britten seemingly intended: the instrument becomes a pensive, all-knowing and wordless commentator. Mr. Bostridge's insightful and vividly written liner notes are an added bonus. The years he spent studying history and philosophy at Oxford and Cambridge were clearly not wasted. ANTHONY TOMMASINI

To the Editors: You mention brokers' "hefty fees," but in fairness you should commend brokers for enabling people to view apartments free of charge ("It's Spring.

You pay nothing for this service and incur a (negotiable) fee only when you are approved for an apartment you decide to take, a successful conclusion of your search that is in large part due to the broker's time, effort and expertise.

1377-> WORLD HERITAGE MISSION
To the Editor: I applaud and appreciate Seth Kugel's in-depth and well-researched feature, "Preservation: Sure, It's a Good Thing, but " (Journeys, Jan. 15), which accurately captured many of the site-level complexities of dealing with tourism in and around World Heritage Sites. His description of the World Heritage Center as "nearly all carrot, and hardly any stick," however, is not entirely fair, nor does it reflect the true mission of the World Heritage Convention and the center. The convention was designed as an international framework -- a way to set a gold standard -- for habitat and cultural-site preservation. It is meant to guide and encourage national governments in their own efforts to preserve the places of "outstanding universal value" that fall within their national territory -- not as a way to allow an international body to oversee all sites inscribed. The center was never intended to monitor the activities of all World Heritage sites. As Mr. Kugel points out, this would be nearly impossible, with the large number of sites and limited resources in the center's annual operating budget and the World Heritage Fund. Instead, the center advises governments on the best practices for dealing with issues like tourism around their sites. Recognizing this, the United Nations Foundation works with the center and country partners to develop tools. The new tourism plan for Sian Ka'an, Mexico, for example, can be used to advise other countries and serve as a model for wider implementation. Moreover, the World Heritage center serves as a catalyst for public-private partnerships. The tourism industry has a special role to play, and leaders like Expedia have paved the way to promote sustainable tourism. We encourage new corporate partners to work with the center by joining the World Heritage Alliance (www.worldheritagealliance.org). Individuals can get involved through the Friends of World Heritage (www.friendsofworldheritage.org). Timothy E. Wirth, President, United Nations Foundation Washington

1378-> HELP; Truth in Advertising?
I'm inundated by advertisements for education programs online, in the mail and on the subway. How can I tell if it is a legitimate operation or a "diploma mill"? Name Withheld, Brooklyn THE Department of Education has a Web site (ope.ed.gov/accreditation) that offers a searchable list of the nearly 7,000 accredited institutions in the United States. But a disclaimer says that inclusion on the list "does not constitute an endorsement," and that colleges that are not included can still provide a "quality" postsecondary education. Some colleges choose not to seek accreditation, or are awaiting it. Advice on warning signs is posted at a Federal Trade Commission Web site, ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/diplomamills.htm. Among the suggestions: beware of colleges where tuition is charged on a per-degree basis rather than per credit, course or semester; there are few or unspecified degree requirements; the emphasis is on degrees for work or life experience; the institution is new or has recently changed its name.

1380-> From the Armory of Middle Earth
A LAVISH theatrical version of "The Lord of the Rings," which opened last month in Toronto, has been savaged by critics who say it has insipid dialogue and campy songs. True devotees of the fantasy trilogy, however, may be judging the spectacle on different criteria. Sticklers for accuracy, they will have opinions that depend largely on how faithful each prop and costume is to the original story; woe to the show if the aficionados decide that Gandalf's beard isn't quite long enough. Kit Rae is well versed in such "Lord of the Rings" nitpicking. As a product designer at United Cutlery of Sevierville, Tenn., Mr. Rae was in charge of developing a line of souvenir weapons inspired by Peter Jackson's film version of the trilogy. For one of those products, a pair of Elvish weapons known as the Fighting Knives of Legolas, he selected a yellowish hue for the handles. The online protests were legion, as many fans insisted that the handles should be white. "With something like that, where there's a specific color people feel it's supposed to be, you're just not going to make some people happy," Mr. Rae said. Despite the complaining, the Fighting Knives of Legolas, priced at $163.49 a set, remain a top seller for United Cutlery -- a testament to the staying power of the "Lord of the Rings" brand. Though the last installment of Mr. Jackson's trilogy hit movie theaters nearly two and a half years ago, licensees are still selling affiliated products with aplomb; Mr. Rae, for example, estimates that his company has sold approximately 20,000 Legolas sets in the last two years. Not every product bearing the "Lord of the Rings" label is guaranteed to be a runaway success, as United Cutlery has discovered. Consumers have proved much more receptive to weapons wielded by the films' heroic elves than by its villainous orcs, a trend that Mr. Rae credited to the relative beauty of the Elvish aesthetic, which he characterized as having a "sweeping, organic, serpentine look." The development of the knives took 10 months. It began in 2001, when Mr. Jackson's staff sent United Cutlery a prop version of the knives that Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom, would be using in "The Two Towers," the second installment in the trilogy. Mr. Rae was initially baffled by how to replicate the vinelike design on the handles; the company usually etches such patterns with acid, but that process was too clumsy for replicating the prop's intricacies. So Mr. Rae enlisted the services of a company that fabricates circuit boards, and thus had the equipment needed to burn minute swirls into wood. United Cutlery released the Legolas knives, crisscrossed on a plaque, in 2002, and was quickly taken aback by the demand. Waiting lists extended for a year until the company could arrange for its factory in Taiwan to increase production. The early buyers, meanwhile, debated the handle color on "Lord of the Rings" message boards. While sensitive to the argument that the handles should be white, Mr. Rae points out that the Legolas knives do appear slightly jaundiced in some scenes from "The Two Towers," thanks to post-production color processing. Though Mr. Jackson has moved on to new projects, including his version of "King Kong" last year, United Cutlery is still committed to riding the "Lord of the Rings" brand until the end. "There's enough swords from the films for another five years," Mr. Rae said. The plan, he added, is to abandon many of the poor sellers in favor of focusing on what he termed "core swords" -- particularly those favored by the trilogy's elves. Mr. Rae is also holding out a glimmer of hope that Mr. Jackson will help reinvigorate the brand someday. "If Peter comes back and directs 'The Hobbit,' " he said, "it will be great for sword makers."

1381-> Bryant Scores 81, Second-Highest Total
Kobe Bryant kept shooting, from all over the court and from every angle. By halftime, he had 26 points -- not a bad number for most players. By the end of the game, he put up the second-highest total in N.B.A. history. Bryant scored a staggering 81 points last night against the visiting Toronto Raptors in a 122-104 Lakers victory. Only Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game stands ahead of him. "It just happened," Bryant said. "It's tough to explain. It's just one of those things." "It really hasn't set in. To sit here and say I grasp what happened tonight, I'd be lying." Bryant, the N.B.A.'s leading scorer, left to a standing ovation with 4.2 seconds remaining, having shot 28 of 46 from the floor and 18 of 20 from the foul line. He was 7 of 13 from 3-point range. With the fans at Staples Center chanting "MVP! MVP!" Bryant made two free throws with 43.4 seconds remaining for his final points. He scored 28 in the fourth quarter, 27 in the third. "It feels great to put on a great show here," he said. Chamberlain scored 100 points for Philadelphia against the Knicks in 1962. His second-highest total was 78 against the Lakers in three overtimes on Dec. 8, 1961. Elgin Baylor held the previous franchise record of 71 points, at New York on Nov. 15, 1960. The Lakers assistant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the league's career leading scorer, saw that game, too. "Elgin's game was an incredible performance, also," he said. "I don't think there's any comparison. Elgin did it without 3-point lines. "His game was attacking the hoop and hitting jumpers inside 20 feet. Kobe's range is unreal, and he does it his way. "It was a real treat. His ability to shoot from long range and also attack the hoop, split the defense and get in close for opportunities near the basket is unique. He's made a niche for himself and he deserves it." Michael Jordan's career high was 69 points, and only four players had ever scored more than 70 -- Chamberlain, Baylor, David Thompson and David Robinson. The 27-year-old Bryant made it five. His previous career high was 62 points, during a 112-90 victory over Dallas last month -- he sat out the fourth quarter because of the one-sided nature of the game. "I was just determined; I was just locked in, tuned into what was going on out there," Bryant said. Bryant is averaging 35.9 points this season. "We definitely wanted to get it to him tonight," the Lakers' Smush Parker said. "He had the hot hand. "We knew he had it in him." So did Raptors Coach Sam Mitchell. "I saw that game he had against Dallas where he scored 62, what more can you say?" he said. "The thing about him that is most amazing is that he is relentless. We played man-to-man, box-and-one and zone. We tried to put smaller guys on him to deny him the ball." Bryant played nearly 42 minutes, going the entire second half until being lifted by Coach Phil Jackson. "You're sitting and watching, and it's like a miracle unfolding in front of your eyes and you can't accept it," the Lakers' owner, Jerry Buss, said. "Somehow, the brain won't work. The easiest way to look at it is everybody remembers every 50-point game they ever saw. He had 55 in the second half." Bryant scored all but 15 of the Lakers' 42 points in the third quarter, shooting 11 of 15 including 4 of 5 from 3-point range. Six of his points came during a 12-0 run to finish the period, giving Los Angeles a 91-85 lead. The Lakers outscored the Raptors, 38-14, to finish the third period to go ahead for good. Toronto shot 15 of 22, including 4 of 6 from 3-point range, in the first quarter for a 36-29 lead. The Raptors led by as many as 16 points in the period before settling for a 63-49 halftime lead. Parker was second on the Lakers with 13 points and Chris Mihm added 12 points and 8 rebounds. Mike James had 26 points and 10 assists for Toronto. Chris Bosh added 18 points and 8 rebounds, and Jalen Rose scored 17 points. Bryant scored a season-low 11 points in the Lakers' 102-91 victory over the Raptors in Toronto last month. MORE RECORDS SET -- Ray Allen made a 30-footer at the buzzer of the second overtime period and the teams combined to break the record for 3-pointers in a game as the visiting Seattle SuperSonics earned a 152-149 victory over the Phoenix Suns. The teams combined for 32 3-pointers, breaking the mark of 31 set last season by Toronto and Philadelphia on March 13. The 301 points were the most in a game since Dallas beat Houston, 156-147, in two overtimes in 1995. Allen scored 42, making 8 of 16 from 3-point range, and Luke Ridnour had a career-high 30 as Seattle snapped a four-game losing streak.

1383-> Figuring Out the Razr's Phone Book
More on the Razr phone: In my review last week, I wrote: The stratospherically stupid address book can handle only one phone number for each person. You must create separate entries for Mom home, Mom work, Mom cell and so on. Dozens of you wrote to say that you can, in fact, add additional numbers to somebodys name. When editing Moms address book entry, for example, I can scroll down to a menu item called MORE, which will let me add a second or third phone number. Unfortunately, on the Cingular phone that I reviewed, the address book still winds up displaying Mom Home, Mom Work, Mom Cell, Mom Fax, etc., as individual entries that you have to scroll through. I even confirmed with Cingulars Motorola liaison by phone that this is how it works. She agreed that its a little silly. But one or two readers noted a poorly documented trick that I think will change the lives of a lot of Razr owners. In the address book, hit the Menu key. Scroll to Setup. Change the View by option to List, and change the View option to Primary Contacts. The result: the Motorola address book now works as it should, listing each person only once. When you highlight a name and press Talk, you call the main (first) phone number; if you highlight a name and press the right-arrow button, you cycle among the other numbers (indicated by changing icons). Why Motorola requires you to slog through a 22-button preferences-changing sequence just to make the phone book work properly, Ill never know. But Im grateful that at least a workaround is available.

1384-> TiVo to Offer Tighter Rein on Children's Viewing
In a new twist on helping parents control what children watch on television, TiVo will announce today a service that lets its video recorders limit children to watching shows approved by one of two groups promoting family programming. Parental controls have been built into most television and cable set-top boxes for the last decade, allowing parents to limit their children's viewing to shows that have certain ratings as assigned by the networks. TiVo as well had a parental control system based on these ratings. Many digital cable boxes offer even more options, letting parents select individual programs to block. But Tom Rogers, TiVo's chief executive, said existing technology and ratings had been rarely used because both the software and the ratings were too difficult to understand. "Ratings have had a marginal effect because parents don't fully understand how to use them," Mr. Rogers said. "Nor do they bring forward what they want their kids to watch." TiVo has been hard hit by cable and satellite companies that are selling set-top boxes with video recorders built in, and its share price is off about 30 percent since last July. So the company is focusing on software that will differentiate its offering from generic alternatives. Another feature under development will let users share lists of their favorite shows with their friends. The move on children's viewing comes at a time of increasing focus on giving parents more control. Several large cable companies have said they will offer a "family tier" or bundle of channels deemed appropriate for children. Under the TiVo plan, parents will be able to designate ratings issued by one of two groups -- Common Sense Media or the Parents Television Council. Common Sense Media was formed in 2003 with backers including Charles R. Schwab, the brokerage company executive, and Philip F. Anschutz, the billionaire investor; the Parents Television Council, formed in 1995, is headed by L. Brent Bozell III, a conservative commentator. The new TiVo service will let children watch only programs the designated group deems appropriate for the age range specified by the parent. In addition, parents can automatically record programs designated by the groups as especially worthwhile. Parents can overrule the groups' choices or make their own list of approved and banned programs from scratch. They will also be able to type in a password to view programs denied to their children. TiVo's software, called KidZone, will be made available without additional charge in June to the 1.4 million users of TiVo's stand-alone set-top boxes. It will not be offered to the 2.6 million users of DirecTV boxes that also include TiVo recorders, because DirecTV has largely stopped selling them. TiVo has typically charged $200 and up for its recorders, depending on capacity, and $12.95 for the service required to make the box work. It has recently been experimenting with deep discounts on the boxes or even giving the boxes free to customers who pay a higher monthly fee. Even with its new feature, one issue that children's groups have been concerned about -- advertising aimed at the young-- will have to be addressed manually. The new service does not automatically edit out commercials. Mr. Rogers said the company did not want to alienate the television networks.

1385-> From Craig Ferguson, a Novel Born of Literary Rambles
LOS ANGELES - Back in 2003, after he finished directing and starring in a movie he'd written, called "I'll Be There," Craig Ferguson sat down in his hotel room and began scribbling on a notepad. The experience of making the film, he says, had entailed so much meddling from the big studio that produced it and so many artistic compromises that Mr. Ferguson, who was not yet the host of "The Late Late Show" on CBS, felt the need to embark on a creative odyssey entirely within his control: he began to write a book. Those scraps of paper have yielded not a Hollywood tell-all, but a novel, "Between the Bridge and the River," which is to be published by Chronicle Books on Monday. It is a sprawling, often allegorical tale that ranges from Mr. Ferguson's native Scotland to Los Angeles, where he lives now, and includes a rambunctious, sometimes violent road trip through the American South. Its main characters include two old friends from Scotland, one of them a television evangelist whose program is derailed by a sex scandal; a femme fatale who has killed off six husbands; and a pair of half brothers sired by Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford in their Rat Pack days. ("Ring-a-ding-ding," Mr. Ferguson writes, appropriating one of Sinatra's signature lines.) Among the other figures who make cameos, as Mr. Ferguson sends up Las Vegas and Hollywood, to say nothing of Christianity, Scientology, television news and the escort industry, are Carl Jung (wearing a Cossack's uniform in one dream sequence), Larry King and Socrates. The book, which tops off at 329 pages, is filled with many surprises. Chief among them is probably this: unlike other television stars who have moonlighted as authors, including Jay Leno (the children's book "If Roast Beef Could Fly" in 2004) and Drew Carey ("Dirty Jokes and Beer: Stories of the Unrefined," in 1997) Mr. Ferguson has written a work of literary fiction, one that periodically tips its cap to Mikhail Bulgakov, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Campbell, Jung, Mark Twain and Herman Melville, among many others. In other words, it's a book that may not necessarily sit well with many of the two million viewers who, on a typical night, stay up after David Letterman's "Late Show" to hear Mr. Ferguson refer to them endearingly as "cheeky wee monkeys" or "naughty little donkeys," as he aims barbs from his monologue at favorite targets like President Bush and Starbucks. It may also jolt those who know him best from his previous job, playing the officious boss, Mr. Wick, on Mr. Carey's sitcom. "This book could scare them," Mr. Ferguson said in a recent interview, at ease in sweatpants and a T-shirt behind the desk of his office here at CBS Television City. "The sex, the violence, the dream sequences and the iconoclasm. I think a lot of people are uncomfortable with that. I understand that. It was very uncomfortable to write some of it." Which is not to say that Mr. Ferguson, 43, is unlikely to find an audience for his book. In a starred advance review in February, Publishers Weekly said that Mr. Ferguson had produced "a tour de force of cynical humor and poignant reverie, a caustic yet ebullient picaresque that approaches the sacred by way of the profane." Even setting aside Mr. Ferguson's career as a comedian and comic actor in Hollywood, his route to becoming a published author was a circuitous, unconventional one. He grew up outside Glasgow in a large family that cherished reading: his father, a postal worker, favored "quasi-erotic, devil-worshipping spy novels," he said, and his mother preferred Lillian Beckwith, who wrote "folksy and beautiful tales about the Outer Hebrides." His own early reading ("Animal Farm," "Lord of the Rings") ground to a halt when he quit high school, at 16, "mainly to drink." Mr. Ferguson never returned to the classroom, but he eventually began to design a syllabus of "Great Books" for himself to read, partly to plug the gaps in his education but also to ward off loneliness, particularly during long stretches on television and movie sets. His life as a reader has been, he says a "meandering" journey, in which a reference in one book to another book would send him running to the library. He recently read one of Mark Twain's less famous works, a travelogue of the American West titled "Roughing It," after learning of it from a mention in Jon Krakauer's "Under the Banner of Heaven." "A friend of mine that I was in a band with started me on Kafka, which in turn led to Camus and Sartre," Mr. Ferguson said. "And not long ago, maybe 10, 15 years ago, I did Gogol's last play, 'The Gamblers,' at the Tron Theater in Glasgow. That got me into the Russians, and from there I started reading Ostrovsky, then Dostoyevsky and eventually Bulgakov, 'The Master and Margarita.' " While "Between the Bridge and the River" includes homages, both veiled and overt, to works by those authors and others -- a chapter involving snake handlers mirrors a scene in "Moby-Dick" -- Mr. Ferguson has also imbued the story with anecdotes that, he said, happened to either him or his friends and relatives. "This book is kind of 'A Million Little Pieces' in reverse," he said. "I'm claiming it's a novel. I'm probably going to be outed in a while, when people find out a lot of this is true." Among the most painful passages in the book is a scene at the very outset, when one of the main characters, George, distracts a school-age bully from an attempt to molest a drunken friend, Fraser, who has passed out on a dirty canal bank. "Willie bent over Fraser and started to unbuckle his belt," Mr. Ferguson writes. "He was salivating, his face near the unconscious boy's crotch. He yelled in agony and surprise as he felt George's fishing rod strike the back of his neck like a cat-o'-nine tails." In the interview, Mr. Ferguson said: "That is a fairly accurate accounting of what happened to me one day. I was Fraser, in that circumstance." Chronicle has given Mr. Ferguson's book a first printing -- 30,000 copies -- that would be considered quite large for a first-time author who was not a Hollywood celebrity. But Mr. Ferguson said that far more important than the modest advance he received -- probably less than he would earn for a night of stand-up comedy -- was the freedom the publishing house gave him to tell his story with minimal editorial interference. He is already mapping out two sequels, one of which begins a half-hour after the first book ends, and another that centers on his femme fatale, Claudette, who ends "Between the Bridge and the River" pregnant by a lover who may or may not cheat death. And though he says he has had offers to make his debut novel into a movie, he says he won't do it. "It's a book," Mr. Ferguson said. "It's mine. And it's done."

1386-> Bonds Blocks Out Controversy and Focuses on Hitting
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 24 - On this spring morning splashed with sunshine, Barry Bonds, in uniform but hatless, shaved head aglow, emerged from the dugout and onto the sparkling grass at Scottsdale Stadium. Like a true hitter, he immediately sized up the situation. "Wind's blowing in," he said, checking the flapping flags in center field. "I might have to swing harder." He smiled. It was, and was not, a little joke. Then he walked to the batting cage under the right-field stands to commence his daily labors. Amid all the devastating distractions going on in the life of Barry Bonds, it may be surprising to learn that, this spring, at 41, he is once again thriving at the plate. He has 10 hits, including 4 home runs, in his first 16 at-bats for the San Francisco Giants. That translates into a .625 batting average for a player with a surgically repaired right knee and a reputation that has taken still another battering, this time from a new book that links him ever tighter to the use of steroids. "I try to stay real," Bonds said Friday, when he was asked about his surprising start. He was sitting in his familiar leather chair in the corner of the Giants' clubhouse here, and he was asked what he meant by the word "real." "It means staying focused, in good times and bad," he said. "It means doing what you've learned to do in this business all your life. It means when you get in the batter's box that it's just you and the pitcher and the ball. Your mind is clear for the job at hand. "It means that you don't give up," he went on, in a conversation that was limited to baseball. "You take what comes and you deal with it. It's like you hit a line drive right at the second baseman. You're out. That's real. But you also did your job. Some guys might throw up their hands and bemoan what happened. That's turning a positive into a negative. I've learned not to do that." Bonds is a seven-time National League Most Valuable Player, the holder of the single-season home run record of 73, and, with 708 career home runs, in striking distance of Babe Ruth's mark of 714 homers and Henry Aaron's record of 755. But beyond this, he is a symbol, more or less, of an often-reviled generation of suspected steroid users. On Friday, the capacity crowd of some 12,000 at the Giants' home ballpark in Arizona seemed generally unconcerned with Bonds's continuing problems. Nearly 800 miles away, in San Francisco, lawyers representing Bonds failed in an effort to obtain a temporary restraining order against the new book, "Game of Shadows" (Gotham Books). Here, people cheered him when he came to bat, with only a smattering of boos mixed in. And on a day when he lined softly to second, lined a single to center, walked and flied to left, no other batter received such lavish attention. "I've been mechanically right," Bonds said of his at-bats. "Everything has been perfect. But it's only temporary." Still, it was something for him to savor, a reminder of the skills Bonds always possessed before everything became tainted by steroids. Others still notice those skills, too. "I see the guy do things that other people can't," said Giants catcher Mike Matheny, a player who used to scheme against Bonds when he caught for the Cardinals. "I don't care what you're taking -- and I'm not saying he is, or has, taken anything. But he has that amazing discipline at the plate, how quick and short and compact his swing is." Bond had several arthroscopic operations on his right knee last season and did not play until September; he hit 5 home runs in 14 games. He wears a large brace on the knee and does little running now. Yet in the very first inning Friday, he moved easily in left field to chase down two fly balls. "I feel good," he said. "I feel I'll be ready to go." For how long? "I'll know by July, by the All-Star break, how much more, if any more, I can go on." Bonds was asked if the ball indeed looked like a grapefruit to him, that he is seeing it so well. "No," he said. "The ball never changes size." Matheny disagreed. "He has to see the ball differently." he said. "I've heard about Ted Williams seeing the ball so well. In my time, I thought Paul Molitor did, too. And everyone in the major leagues has gone through periods of seeing the ball great. I know I have. But those periods don't last very long. With Barry, it's every at-bat." Willie Upshaw, one of the Giants' hitting coaches, said: "His wrist work, his hips, his hands, even his feet work in perfect unison. Everything in your body is fighting for control when you swing. You drive off the back foot into the front foot. And your front foot has to be planted solid. If you have that, you don't lose bat speed, no matter your age. Barry has that." And, in a season in which many difficulties may still await Bonds, on and off the field, he also has a philosophy that he says he will attempt to live by. "What you can't do is take failure to heart," he said. "There's going to be a lot of failure. No one bats 1.000. Or even .500. You have to think, next time, I'll get 'em."

1387-> Moving for the Food
MY new fourth-floor co-op in Queens measures about 800 square feet, pretty good for one person. It’s in a well-preserved apartment at the graceful Hampton Court, built in 1921 in what is now the Jackson Heights Historic District. Its eight windows all overlook the stately trees and manicured shrubs of a one-acre courtyard, not visible from the street and accessible only to residents. There’s a light-flooded room perfect for a work-from-home journalist like myself. And then there is the great storage space in the basement, friendly neighbors, low monthly maintenance, and a five-minute walk to the E and F express trains that reach Midtown Manhattan in 15 minutes. Whatever. I moved here for the food. Sure, some people would do anything to have a view of Central Park or to live in a great school district, but I wanted the cheese bread called pandebono and the $6.50 meat-and-rice-and-soup lunch special at my local Colombian diner, Seba Seba. And I wanted Little India and its famous Jackson Diner five blocks away, not to mention the Patel Brothers supermarket, which snarls traffic on weekends as South Asian immigrants from across the metropolitan area shop for imported ingredients (while double-parked). And Tacos Guicho, a street cart a five-minute walk away on Roosevelt Avenue that in its wildest dreams would never consider posting a menu in English. And the Uruguayan bakery on 37th Street, and the competing empanada shops on Northern Boulevard and the Peruvian ceviche. When your local lingerie store sells homemade passion fruit popsicles for $1, you know you’ve hit a culinary artery. Should the takeout scene play such a huge role in determining where you buy a New York City apartment? If you’re the chef Mario Batali, perhaps not. But I’m a single guy who works at home and generally refuses to cook without an audience. So whether or not the food scene play a role, I didn’t consider any apartment farther than five blocks from Seba Seba. Coincidence? Food didn’t only attract me to Jackson Heights, which I had grown to love while visiting friends and writing about the area. It also drove me out of my old neighborhood, around 181st Street and Fort Washington in Washington Heights, in Upper Manhattan, where I had rented for nine years. Not that there’s anything wrong with the dining options there. In addition to the Dominican places serving up roast chicken, savory stews and sweet plantains, there are a few cafes, a sushi shop and the upscale Pan-Latin spot, Hispaniola. And of course, you have your pizza, your Chinese takeout, your local McDonald’s on the corner. The problem was, I had been eating there for too long: 3,277 days, to be precise. During the final 1,000 or so, I would often emerge from the A train in the evening, and stand nearly catatonic on the southeast corner of 181st and Fort Washington, at a loss for someplace appealing to pick up dinner. The idea of yet another chicken roll from George’s Pizza, or shredded pork with garlic sauce from Great Wall, both pretty tasty the first 200 times around, made me ill. Restaurants like Jesse’s Place, Bleu Evolution and Hispaniola, all of which came to the neighborhood after I did, were too expensive for takeout food. The 181st Street sidewalks were my prison cafeteria line, offering up the same old gruel again and again. Arriving here in Jackson Heights in October was like being pardoned by the governor. The first time I was home at lunchtime, I nearly bounded around the corner to Seba Seba for stewed beef, meat-and-potato soup and a shake made from the South American fruit the Colombians call lulo. I got it to go and ate it as I sat on a wooden bench in the courtyard, basking in the October sun and my own good fortune. I’m also thrilled to be near my favorite taco stand, although it does raise a philosophical question. Years ago, I officially declared the place my own choice for best taco in New York, and I made a vow: whenever I found myself in Jackson Heights, I would get a carnitas taco from Tacos Guicho. That leaves two choices now that I’m here every day: break my vow, or go on an all-taco diet. The latter was tempting, especially because the women who work at the little cart, poking at the crumbled chorizo and chunks of tongue and sizzling pork pieces called carnitas, always smile and the crowd is always friendly. My move to a one-bedroom co-op in Jackson Heights — at 35-36 79th Street, and at a cost of $284,000 — perplexed some of my friends, even those who realize Queens is not outside our solar system. They always ask: Why buy now, in this market? I look at them quizzically. Earth-stopping tacos for $2, a Thai place with a Gourmet Magazine article in the window and an entire menu for under $10, Peruvian chicken dinners for $4 — if Jackson Heights isn’t a bargain, then I don’t know what is. But not everything worked out exactly as expected. Within days, I replaced the dinerlike Seba Seba, a block east of my apartment, on 37th Avenue, with the Aires del Sur bakery, a block and a half west. It has the same Colombian breads and lunch specials, but also sells Argentine-style empanadas and sweets and has more of a relaxed cafe vibe with friendly, never-changing staff. By the second visit, I was granted the greeting of a regular, and by now, I’d feel comfortable just stopping in to chat. Later I had a huarache, essentially an open-faced Mexican sandwich on a thick tortilla, at Tacolandia on Roosevelt Avenue, and a cholado, a cross between a fruit salad, a snow cone and an ice cream sundae popular in Cali, Colombia, at El Palacio de los Cholados on Northern Boulevard, as I hopped around the neighborhood checking out gyms. I was stuffed. But on my walk back, on 85th Street, I spotted a Hispanic couple pushing a stroller and munching on corn-on-the-cob-on-a-stick. It was slathered with mayo, rolled in powdery cotija cheese and splattered, Jackson Pollock-style, with chili powder. A vacancy opened up in my stomach. Somewhere around here lurked a mobile corn vendor. And there he was, right around the corner on Roosevelt, dipping a spatula into an army-surplus-style vat of mayo. “How much?” I asked. “Two dollars,” he said in Spanish, and added, to laughter from the other customers: “No tax.” Deductible interest on my mortgage tax-free corn? Take that, Internal Revenue Service. After about a week of gorging on the South American and South Asian gustatory hit parade, I suddenly wondered how George’s Pizza was doing back on 181st Street, and searched for a local pizza shop. That turned out to be Tomas Pizza, on 37th Avenue, where I was initially disoriented by the un-George’s setup. (Self-serve soda cans?) I warily tried a chicken roll, to stay. It was a shock: the chicken wasn’t soggy, the cheese wasn’t gloopy, and the sauce was baked right in instead of served on the side and only by special request. Turns out good ol’ George had been bamboozling me for years with his sad excuse for a chicken roll. (His slice is still better, though.) And just when I thought I knew my new neighborhood, a vendor cart named Sammy’s Halal won the citywide Vendy Award for street vendors. I heard about it, of all places, on a BBC news program. Disappointed by my own ignorance, I found the place, just past the subway stop, beyond which it had never occurred to me to explore. It turned out there was another restaurant universe over there. While I had been trapped, albeit happily, in my little five-block world, there were still dozens of Jackson Heights restaurants waiting for me with big stacks of delivery menus. After I had been here about a month, I got the oddest craving: a home-cooked meal. In retrospect I suppose it makes sense. You can only eat so much great food before it strikes you that someone actually made it, and that you could probably do the same. I ventured into the local supermarket for the first time. My purchases that first day included a license-plate-shaped brick of frozen guanabana pulp for milkshakes; pandebono mix for cheese bread; chops, not carnitas, as the pork of choice for the next few nights; and a little pouch of Café Bustelo espresso grind so I could learn how to make my own café con leche. Producing dishes instead of simply consuming them? What a novelty. And guess what I unearthed behind still unpacked boxes in the far end of my apartment. Tons of cabinets, an expanse of counter space, and a cool Kohler sink that beat the socks of the ancient, decrepit one I had back in Washington Heights. My place actually had a great kitchen. Who knew?

1389-> 'Thief' on FX Stars Andre Braugher; 'Teachers' Sends NBC to School
A caper is essentially a victimless crime: money is stolen, jauntily and ingeniously, and nobody really gets hurt. On "Thief," a new drama on FX, everybody gets hurt. Wives interrupt bank robberies to complain about the kids, hired assassins get the shakes, and random car accidents that have nothing to do with the larceny at hand suddenly change everything. "Thief" is the third series this season centered on a gang of high-stakes professional crooks. But "Heist" on NBC and "Hustle" on AMC take their cues from "Ocean's Eleven." FX's six-part series reaches for the brutality and emotional complexity of "Oz" and "The Sopranos." It may never get there, but the pilot alone comes a lot closer than any of its rivals. The series is inspired, but only loosely, by a 1981 film, "Thief," directed by Michael Mann and starring James Caan. Here, the setting is a post-Katrina New Orleans, where whole city blocks are flattened and boarded up storefronts carry the hand-scrawled parting warning "looters will be shot." These crimes are organized, but the culprits are not old-style mafiosi. Bodies are left to rot in the bayou, not city dumps. Andre Braugher ("Homicide: Life on the Street") is Nick, a cool-headed, seasoned professional who runs a vintage car business and also leads a gang of hardened criminals and ex-cons, black, Hispanic and white. They mistrust one another, and they are on the run not just from the police, but also from corrupt detectives and elected officials who have links to the most ruthless of Chinese tongs. In most crime series, the line between work and home is sharply drawn: safecrackers and jewel thieves are not interrupted by wives, children or telemarketers. In real life, baby sitters cancel, the cellphone goes uncharged and then dead, and in-laws expect to be picked up at airports. Nick has to keep a handle on his volatile, paranoid crew, and also see to his trusting wife, Wanda (Dina Meyer), and his resentful teenage stepdaughter, Tammi (Mae Whitman). Those responsibilities keep interrupting his day job. At one point, when Wanda calls him mid-robbery demanding that he speak to the police officer who took Tammi down to the station, Nick politely reasons with the officer over his cellphone as his crew breaks into the vault. That elaborately planned robbery goes off without too many hitches, but when Nick's men take bags of cash that turn out to belong to Chinese mobsters, everything turns complicated and dangerous. Nick's fence, a longtime partner, Roz (Linda Hamilton), wants to give the money back, warning that these San Francisco-based gangsters will hunt down the robbers and their families. Nick's men have the kind of crushing financial obligations  pregnant wives, a crack habit, debts to loan sharks  that make them reluctant to surrender the swag. Some characters have good intentions, or at least remorse, but nobody seems able to go straight in this murky world. "Thief" has a moody tone, graphic violence and unexpected plot twists, but those elements are not all that distinguish the series. The characters stand out, including the Chinese hit man, Vincent (Will Yun Lee), who has a hard time keeping a lid on his insecurities and the occasional tremor in his gun hand. But it is Mr. Braugher who turns the series into more than just a well-made crime drama. Nick is scary, until he isn't; he is likable, until he is just the opposite. The character is hard to pin down but impossible to resist. And Nick's dealings with his stepdaughter are complex, testy and, on rare occasions, tender. Theirs is one of the more difficult and compelling relationships on television. "Thief" pays homage to all the conventions of a traditional thriller and weaves into it complicated issues of guilt, race and family. It's a little like some of the better dramas on HBO, but finds its own unorthodox way. Back to School "Teachers" is just the opposite: a conventional sitcom on NBC about young single people in search of love  and a better chalkboard. But it has been a while since a school served as a setting for a television show  "Room 222" and "Saved by the Bell" are ancient history; Fox canceled "Boston Public" in 2004. "Teachers" has appealing moments. For all the predictable one-liners, pratfalls and canned laughter clotting the pilot, there are some funny riffs down the line. Jeff (Justin Bartha) is an incorrigibly irreverent English teacher who makes constant wisecracks but has a serious crush on a fellow teacher, Alice (Sarah Alexander), a pretty but cold and prim British woman. His best friend, Calvin (Deon Richmond), is more inhibited, but Jeff always manages to entangle him in his schemes. Their only other ally in the teachers' lounge is Dick (Phil Hendrie), an older, burned-out misanthrope. ("When a well-meaning do-gooder gets a job like that, you know who suffers?" he warns when he learns that Alice is running for faculty chairwoman. "Work-dodgers and apathetics like us.") In its better moments, the sitcom is a little like "Wings," but it will need more spark to hold an audience. Meanwhile, "Teachers" does confirm former Education Secretary William J. Bennett's harshest criticisms of the public school system: the series is all about the teachers; students barely make an appearance. FX, tonight at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.

1394-> Bloggers at the Gates: What Was Good for EBay Should Be Good for Politics
After the disastrous 2004 election, prominent Democrats gathered in Monterey, Calif., to discuss what to do next. The organizers scheduled a session on coalition building, but each special interest complained that its issue was being slighted. In the end, the coalition-building session broke up into five separate groups, each focusing on its own issue. This comically depressing glimpse of today's Democratic Party is recounted in "Crashing the Gate," a smart new book by two leading bloggers. Democrats have complained about their national leadership at least since Will Rogers wisecracked, "I am not a member of any organized political party -- I am a Democrat." But in their book, Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, founder of the liberal blog dailykos.com, and Jerome Armstrong, founder of myDD.com, give these complaints a 21st-century spin. The authors argue for the importance of the "netroots," or Internet grass roots, which have been a growing political force since Moveon.org, which now has more than three million members, formed in 1998. The netroots came of age in 2004, providing much of the money and energy behind Howard Dean's campaign. The netroots' power comes from the same network effect that made eBay a retailing phenomenon. Far-flung political activists now join together on sites like dailykos.com, and inject themselves into matters that used to be settled behind closed doors. The netroots helped make Mr. Dean head of the Democratic National Committee, over several establishment candidates. Now, they are backing Ned Lamont in a primary challenge to Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who is about as popular among liberal bloggers as a computer virus. Much of the authors' criticism of the party establishment is dead-on. They rail against political consultants who take 15 percent commissions on media buys while giving bad advice. They are especially incensed by what they see as the self-defeating role of special interests, notably Naral Pro-Choice America's decision to endorse Senator Lincoln Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, over two pro-abortion-rights Democrats. If Mr. Chafee wins, he could ensure that the Republican Party, which has an aggressive anti-abortion agenda, keeps control of the Senate. To solve the consultant problem, the authors urge more hires from outside the Washington Beltway and lower fees. To rein in special interests, they point to two successful models. In Colorado, a few wealthy donors called in the groups before the 2004 election and prodded them to cooperate. Ken Salazar was elected senator, one of only two Democratic pick-ups. In Montana, Brian Schweitzer threw out the interest groups' questionnaires and spoke directly to Montana voters. The same day that Montanans gave President Bush 59 percent of their votes, they elected Mr. Schweitzer governor. For all the talk about having to crash gates, the netroots are well on their way to becoming insiders. Mr. Armstrong is an adviser to the political action committee of Mark Warner, a leading candidate for president in 2008. When dailykos holds an offline convention this June in Las Vegas, Harry Reid, the Senate minority leader, will be a speaker. The Democratic establishment could not hold the netroots back even if it wanted to. Their ability to raise money, recruit volunteers and shape the debate will make them indispensable. What "Crashing the Gates" is short on is policy: ideas for providing health care, improving education, and all the other things that make it important which party wins. As the gates swing open, that should be the next item on the agenda.

1396-> Protections Proposed for Channel Islands
LOS ANGELES, Aug. 13 (AP)  Federal officials unveiled a proposal on Friday to double the size of no-fishing zones around the Channel Islands off Southern California to protect marine life. About 20 percent of the waters surrounding five islands off Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties would be closed to harvesting under the plan. No-fishing zones would grow to 309 square miles, and an additional 12 square miles would be set aside as a marine conservation area. The marine reserves would be established in deep water to complement shallower refuges that California created around the islands three years ago. The strategy seeks to protect a variety of species, including lobsters, rockfish and abalone. “When you close areas, the data is clear that the fish and lobster are bigger and more abundant,” said Chris Mobley, superintendent of the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary. Joel Greenberg, chairman of the Southern California chapter of the Recreational Fishing Alliance, said he was not convinced. “I am highly skeptical about the effectiveness of marine reserves, but not unwilling to look at it and try some to see if they do what they’re purported to do,” Mr. Greenberg said.

1397-> McNamara and Orange Run Out of Gas
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 16 - It was no way for Gerry McNamara to end his collegiate career, not after his weekend-long star turn in the Big East tournament, or in his stellar four-year career, which included a national championship in 2003. But there was McNamara, on the bench, a towel draped over his legs, then around his neck, for the final five minutes of Syracuse's 66-58 loss to Texas A&M on Thursday night in an N.C.A.A. tournament first-round game. Bothered by a sore groin toward the end of the season, McNamara had nothing to offer Syracuse offensively Thursday night. He missed all 6 of his field-goal attempts. He scored 2 points, on free throws, in the first half. It was the first time in his career, 135 games, that he did not score a field goal in a game. "I feel great about it," McNamara said in a postgame interview, his words dripping with sarcasm. "Because of me, we lost. Fantastic. Great feeling." Terrence Roberts scored 15 points for fifth-seeded Syracuse, which ended its season at 23-12. A&M, seeded 12th, advanced to the second round, to play Louisiana State. McNamara seemed to be able to exert himself on some plays, but there were other times when he did not seem to have his legs under him as he launched shots. "We don't make excuses," said Coach Jim Boeheim, who said McNamara was all right. Asked why McNamara did not play the final five minutes if he was all right, he said, "That's for me to know." From the start, it looked as if Syracuse would have been better off starting the N.C.A.A. tournament immediately after the Big East tournament. Syracuse was seeded ninth in the conference tournament, but surprising victories on four consecutive days gave the Orange the league's automatic N.C.A.A. berth. Eight Big East teams wound up in the N.C.A.A. tournament, the most of any conference. But the three that played Thursday -- Syracuse, Seton Hall and Marquette -- all lost. McNamara looked flat in the first half. He took two shots and missed both. The Orange made 7 of 20 shots in the first half and trailed, 33-24, at the break. A&M's Chris Walker chased McNamara hard off screens and from side to side, and A&M forwards also stuck a hip into McNamara to slow him down. What hurt Syracuse more was its defensive rebounding. Texas A&M outrebounded the Orange, 19-14, in the first half. The Aggies grabbed 8 offensive rebounds and scored 8 second-chance points. A&M looked comfortable against Syracuse' trademark 2-3 zone. The Aggies scored 70 points against Texas last week in a 74-70 defeat in the Big 12 tournament, and the Longhorns played a lot of zone defense. On some plays, A&M worked the ball from the key to the wings and hit post men sliding down the lane. The Aggies also had set plays against the zone where they would enter the ball to the high post and then find the 6-foot-9 Joseph Jones inside. Texas A&M built its second half lead to 44-33 with 12 minutes 31 seconds to play, and Syracuse looked as if it might be ready to finally fade for the season. But Syracuse is not a team to be judged on one half, not after what happened last weekend in the Big East tournament, when the Orange won four stunning games, three because of last-second shots. Eric Devendorf fed Roberts for a dunk on a fast break, which ignited an 8-1 run that cut the deficit to 45-41. McNamara was on the bench when Devendorf twice drove the lane for baskets in the rally. The Orange also slapped on a full-court press, which stopped A&M's momentum. When Devendorf was asked if McNamara was injured, he said: "Yeah, definitely. It's tough when you have an injury like that." After Walker's 3-pointer gave the Aggies that 44-33 lead, they scored only one more field goal in the next eight minutes as Syracuse pulled within 49-45. McNamara got back in the game briefly, missed a 3-point field goal attempt, and went to the bench again with 5:05 remaining.

1398-> Driving Along, Less Gas in the Car
To the Editor: Re "Oilman Plays Ozone Man," by Maureen Dowd (column, Feb. 4): The Bush administration argues against levying higher gas taxes at the pump to encourage conservation by asserting its belief, as expressed by Vice President Dick Cheney, in letting the market work. This makes no sense. The true cost of gasoline is hidden from the consumer in higher income taxes because of our support for costly military and foreign policy activities to secure foreign oil and the cost of environmental remediation related to our profligate use of oil. A reasonable estimate is that these two issues add a hidden tax of several dollars a gallon to gasoline. Paying the tax at the pump instead of to the I.R.S. would make all of us realize the true cost of gasoline use and thereby encourage conservation. Barry M. Klein Davis, Calif., Feb. 4, 2006

1400-> This Essay Breaks the Law
 The Earth revolves around the Sun.  The speed of light is a constant.  Apples fall to earth because of gravity.  Elevated blood sugar is linked to diabetes.  Elevated uric acid is linked to gout.  Elevated homocysteine is linked to heart disease.  Elevated homocysteine is linked to B-12 deficiency, so doctors should test homocysteine levels to see whether the patient needs vitamins. ACTUALLY, I can't make that last statement. A corporation has patented that fact, and demands a royalty for its use. Anyone who makes the fact public and encourages doctors to test for the condition and treat it can be sued for royalty fees. Any doctor who reads a patient's test results and even thinks of vitamin deficiency infringes the patent. A federal circuit court held that mere thinking violates the patent. All this may sound absurd, but it is the heart of a case that will be argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday. In 1986 researchers filed a patent application for a method of testing the levels of homocysteine, an amino acid, in the blood. They went one step further and asked for a patent on the basic biological relationship between homocysteine and vitamin deficiency. A patent was granted that covered both the test and the scientific fact. Eventually, a company called Metabolite took over the license for the patent. Although Metabolite does not have a monopoly on test methods  other companies make homocysteine tests, too  they assert licensing rights on the correlation of elevated homocysteine with vitamin deficiency. A company called LabCorp used a different test but published an article mentioning the patented fact. Metabolite sued on a number of grounds, and has won in court so far. But what the Supreme Court will focus on is the nature of the claimed correlation. On the one hand, courts have repeatedly held that basic bodily processes and "products of nature" are not patentable. That's why no one owns gravity, or the speed of light. But at the same time, courts have granted so-called correlation patents for many years. Powerful forces are arrayed on both sides of the issue. In addition, there is the rather bizarre question of whether simply thinking about a patented fact infringes the patent. The idea smacks of thought control, to say nothing of unenforceability. It seems like something out of a novel by Philip K. Dick  or Kafka. But it highlights the uncomfortable truth that the Patent Office and the courts have in recent decades ruled themselves into a corner from which they must somehow extricate themselves. For example, the human genome exists in every one of us, and is therefore our shared heritage and an undoubted fact of nature. Nevertheless 20 percent of the genome is now privately owned. The gene for diabetes is owned, and its owner has something to say about any research you do, and what it will cost you. The entire genome of the hepatitis C virus is owned by a biotech company. Royalty costs now influence the direction of research in basic diseases, and often even the testing for diseases. Such barriers to medical testing and research are not in the public interest. Do you want to be told by your doctor, "Oh, nobody studies your disease any more because the owner of the gene/enzyme/correlation has made it too expensive to do research?" The question of whether basic truths of nature can be owned ought not to be confused with concerns about how we pay for biotech development, whether we will have drugs in the future, and so on. If you invent a new test, you may patent it and sell it for as much as you can, if that's your goal. Companies can certainly own a test they have invented. But they should not own the disease itself, or the gene that causes the disease, or essential underlying facts about the disease. The distinction is not difficult, even though patent lawyers attempt to blur it. And even if correlation patents have been granted, the overwhelming majority of medical correlations, including those listed above, are not owned. And shouldn't be. Unfortunately for the public, the Metabolite case is only one example of a much broader patent problem in this country. We grant patents at a level of abstraction that is unwise, and it's gotten us into trouble in the past. Some years back, doctors were allowed to patent surgical procedures and sue other doctors who used their methods without paying a fee. A blizzard of lawsuits followed. This unhealthy circumstance was halted in 1996 by the American Medical Association and Congress, which decided that doctors couldn't sue other doctors for using patented surgical procedures. But the beat goes on. Companies have patented their method of hiring, and real estate agents have patented the way they sell houses. Lawyers now advise athletes to patent their sports moves, and screenwriters to patent their movie plots. (My screenplay for "Jurassic Park" was cited as a good candidate.) Where does all this lead? It means that if a real estate agent lists a house for sale, he can be sued because an existing patent for selling houses includes item No. 7, "List the house." It means that Kobe Bryant may serve as an inspiration but not a model, because nobody can imitate him without fines. It means nobody can write a dinosaur story because my patent includes 257 items covering all aspects of behavior, like item No. 13, "Dinosaurs attack humans and other dinosaurs." Such a situation is idiotic, of course. Yet elements of it already exist. And unless we begin to turn this around, there will be worse to come. I wanted to end this essay by telling a story about how current rulings hurt us, but the patent for "ending an essay with an anecdote" is owned. So I thought to end with a quotation from a famous person, but that strategy is patented, too. I then decided to end abruptly, but "abrupt ending for dramatic effect" is also patented. Finally, I decided to pay the "end with summary" patent fee, since it was the least expensive. The Supreme Court should rule against Metabolite, and the Patent Office should begin to reverse its strategy of patenting strategies. Basic truths of nature can't be owned. Oh, and by the way: I own the patent for "essay or letter criticizing a previous publication." So anyone who criticizes what I have said here had better pay a royalty first, or I'll see you in court.

TRENTON, March 6 - The president of Rutgers University will suggest on Tuesday the merger of the university's women's college into a larger school, according to two faculty members who have been involved in discussions of the president's plan. The proposal would consolidate Douglass College and the university's four other undergraduate liberal arts schools into one college of arts and sciences. The idea has been debated on campus since last summer, when an independent task force recommended the move as a way to streamline what critics have said is the university's cumbersome academic and administrative structure. Each of the university's five colleges has its own budget and administration, though students from all five take classes together. Supporters of the merger plan said the moves would make the university operate more efficiently. Critics, including members of the New Jersey Assembly -- which passed a nonbinding resolution two weeks ago that opposes the plan -- said it would undermine the legacy and tradition of the nation's largest publicly financed all-women's college. Rutgers officials scheduled a news conference for Tuesday morning to announce the college reorganization plan. In a telephone interview on Monday, the university's president, Richard L. McCormick, declined to discuss the particulars of his plan, which he is expected to recommend formally to the university's board of governors on Friday. Dr. McCormick acknowledged that he was following some of the recommendations set forth by the task force. "But I'm not slavishly following them," he said. Under the plan, women at Rutgers would still have the option of living in all-women's dormitories on campus, according to the faculty members, who were granted anonymity because of the confidential nature of internal university discussions. Douglass College's 3,000 students could also continue coursework centered on women's issues. But the school would no longer grant degrees bearing the imprint of Douglass College. Separate academic requirements would also be eliminated for Douglass and its fellow colleges -- Livingston, University, Rutgers and Cook -- which accommodate the 27,000 undergraduate students at the university's New Brunswick campus. Plans to merge Douglass College into a larger college of arts and sciences sparked protests on campus over the past few months, and a demonstration last week at the State House. Legislators who opposed the consolidation plan were disappointed that Dr. McCormick had endorsed it. "It would be a disgrace," Assemblywoman Linda Stender, a Democrat from Union County, said of the prospect of closing Douglass. "There's a collective resentment at doors closing for women," Ms. Stender said. "We've made some wonderful strides the last 15 years, but ask most women and they'll say that the glass ceiling is still there. It's just harder to see." Correction: March 9, 2006, Thursday An article on Tuesday about a proposed reorganization of the New Brunswick, N.J., campus of Rutgers University misstated the number of its schools of liberal arts that would be combined into one college of arts and sciences. Four of the five schools -- not all of them -- would be consolidated; the fifth, Cook College, would become a school of environmental and biological sciences.

1403-> They've Got Spirit! But It Isn't All Cheers
It could have been called "Top Cheerleader" or "Project Cheerleader," but this is Lifetime, where things are always a little off, so the reality show that starts tomorrow night is called "Cheerleader Nation," employing a titling tic that is well past its heyday. The channel's out-of-stepness has led to some good things: Lifetime has managed, against the odds, to distinguish itself with openly philanthropic and activist projects, and it has even become a noteworthy lobbying force on urgent women's issues like sex slavery and domestic abuse. But those good deeds seem to have compromised its credibility with guilty-pleasure programming, which is what "Cheerleader Nation," a reality series in the vérité mode, ought by rights to be. Nope  there's no guilt here, and only a little pleasure. Don't look for beauty, catfights or even short skirts. (On tomorrow night's episode, at least, the girls mostly wear gym shorts.) Instead, "Cheerleader Nation" is a set of stylized encounters between mothers and daughters. Rarely has a reality show  even "The Simple Life"  had dialogue that seems both so scripted and so mundane. The girls, already under pressure to perform as athletes, seem doubly pressured to shine as reality stars, and there is something moving and even a little sad in their willingness to divine and advance the plot of "Cheerleader Nation." When, amid their exertions on behalf of this feminist channel, did these girls do any schoolwork? The eight-part series chronicles a season in the life of the country's best cheerleading squad as it tries for a third year running to win the national championship  though the drama of the incumbent intrinsically lacks real excitement. The squad is at Dunbar High School in Lexington, Ky., and the cheerleaders are plainly impressive. All of them can do handsprings and strenuous tumbling; they can also dance. These are not lithe coeds, either. They are superb, eye-of-the-tiger athletes with massive quadriceps. The way they're presented here, they seem to think of nothing but competition and popularity. The mothers come in two varieties: they push their daughters too hard, or they fear that they are not as close as they should be. On tomorrow's episode, the team's coach, Donna, worries that her own daughter, Ryan, is keeping secrets from her, though Ryan is mostly seen practicing cheerleading and playing something that looks like Yahtzee or Boggle. (In her online profile, she does admit to being "addicted to 'WWE Raw.' ") Ryan is typical. These are supremely good girls. At one point, we see a cheerleader having her hair put into foam rollers by her mother. The relationships are so sweet as to seem antiquated. The anxiety in the girls' lives, we're led to believe, comes entirely from cheerleading. The scenes in which they discuss the pressure they are under seem especially coaxed; perhaps producers supply the girls with topics before they shoot their conversations. In any case, these wholesome girls, accustomed to their coach's remonstrations, know far too well what's expected of them, and they can be seen struggling to play their parts. One tells the camera: "Making the squad's really important because that's all I do  I'm a cheerleader." it's as if she even knows she's supposed to supply an epigram for the program's promos. Such agreeableness is just not fair to ask of a teenage girl, who should be sulking or acting defiant. A feminist lobbyist might even intervene to free these girls from the reality-television trap. Lifetime, tomorrow night at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time. Laurie Girion, executive producer; produced by Fox Television Studios for Lifetime Television.

1405-> China Tests Bird Flu Case
HONG KONG, June 29 — China's Health Ministry is running tests to verify findings by eight Chinese scientists that a 24-year-old man had the A(H5N1) avian flu virus when he died in late 2003, two years before China admitted having any cases, the World Health Organization said Thursday. The researchers signed a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine last week that said the man's condition had been misdiagnosed as SARS. The W.H.O. has asked China for more details of those tests and whether labs were testing samples taken from other Chinese who might have died of unknown causes.

1406-> Drug Tests Are Clean, but Case Is Hardly Over
TURIN, Italy, Feb. 24 - The International Olympic Committee said Friday that doping tests on 10 Austrian skiers had come back negative for performance-enhancing drugs. But Italian and Olympic officials said the case would still go forward, both with longer-term tests of the athletes' blood and on items seized by the police under Italy's stringent antidoping laws. Those materials included syringes, glucose drips and, one official said, at least one bag of blood, suggesting a possible blood transfusion. "It's just as much a violation to be in possession of forbidden doping substances or to have attempted to use them or distributed them to others," Arne Ljungqvist, the chairman of the Olympic committee's medical commission, said at a news conference here. "All of those are doping violations of the same significance as a positive test." It is unusual for the I.O.C. to announce negative results of drug tests, but the committee chose to do so Friday because the case involving the Austrians was being so closely scrutinized. In these Games, more than 400 out-of-competition tests have been administered, but the only drug test to come back positive was an in-competition test. But the circumstances in this case are equally unusual. Urine samples were taken Saturday night from the 10 athletes in the first police raid of Olympic athletes suspected of doping. At the news conference, Ljungqvist said that blood was also being drawn from the athletes over the past few days to determine whether they were transfusing other people's blood to boost their red blood cell counts. Transfusions of that sort, he said, can be detected for several weeks. He noted, however, that no test could detect whether a person had withdrawn his own blood, separated out oxygen-boosting red blood cells and re-injected it later. The suspicions of the I.O.C. were first raised by the presence at the Games of Walter Mayer, the Austrian ski coach who was barred from taking part in the Olympics for 10 years after a doping scandal at the 2002 Salt Lake Games. Just before the police raid Saturday on five houses in the mountains where Austrian cross-country skiers and biathletes were staying, Mayer fled, crossed into Austria and smashed his car into a police roadblock. He said later that he intended to kill himself after the police moved in against his country's athletes. After the test results were released Friday, leaders of the Austrian ski team, who have been under fire here and in Austria, said the tests vindicated the team. They continued to criticize the I.O.C. for what they called heavy-handed tactics. "Of course, the I.O.C. wanted somebody to be guilty, but there is no way I feel guilty," Markus Gandler, the Austrian team's sports director, told reporters in Sestriere, the site of the Alpine skiing events. Gandler also corrected a statement he made earlier this week that two biathletes who left Italy had been "scared of Italian law" and admitted to possibly doing something illegal. On Friday, he said they had panicked and done nothing wrong. The biathletes, Wolfgang Perner and Wolfgang Rottmann, were among the 10 tested. Still, Italian prosecutors continued to gather evidence for a possible criminal case. Prosecutors traveled to Sestriere on Friday and interviewed Gandler; Klaus Leistner, the Austrian Ski Federation's general secretary; Johann Vierthaler, the federation's driver and a friend of Mayer's; and the compound's cook, Monika Melazzi, the Austrian team said. The day before, Peter Schröcksnadel, the president of the federation, was questioned for about three hours, his lawyer said. The raid Saturday raised the stakes considerably in Olympics officials' efforts to eradicate doping. Before the Games, the I.O.C. tried to persuade Italy not to enforce its antidoping law fully to avoid the possibility of athletes being charged with crimes. But now, the involvement of the police is essential to the proceedings against the Austrians. Even though the tests on the athletes' urine samples came back negative for stimulants, steroids and the blood-boosting hormone erythropoietin, known as EPO, the materials seized in the raid still remain. The Italian police will test whether there are banned substances in the items seized. Beyond that, the police and experts say that drug testers could take residue from the syringes, tubes, blood bags and needles, then cross-check it with the blood supplied by the Austrian athletes. DNA testing could also be used to determine whether the athletes had used the transfusion equipment. The Italian police have said it will probably take a week for testing on the medical equipment to be complete. Ljungqvist said tests on athletes' blood could take several weeks. Still, if a disciplinary board establishes guilt in the case, Olympics organizers will have to wrestle with whom to punish: athletes, coaches, officials with the ski federation or even the Austrian Olympic committee. An I.O.C. official, who was granted anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said the negative results of the urine tests made it more likely that any sanctions would fall on people other than the athletes.

1408-> Review of Port Deal Will Leave Decision to Bush
WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 - The Dubai company seeking to take over some terminal operations at six American ports formally asked the Bush administration on Sunday to conduct a deeper investigation into security concerns surrounding the deal. The request will leave President Bush in the politically delicate position of having to personally approve or disapprove the takeover. The company, Dubai Ports World, which is controlled by the emir of Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, asked the government to conduct "the full 45-day investigation authorized under U.S. law," an investigation that Mr. Bush and his advisers said last week was unnecessary. In a statement, the company said it was confident that the review of the American aspects of the $6.85 billion deal would reach the same conclusions that a lower-level study did in January, and that "the security of the U.S. will not be harmed as a result of this acquisition." In a statement on Sunday, Edward H. Bilkey, the American-born chief operating officer of Dubai Ports World, also provided more details about his promise on Thursday to "segregate" the operations of the company in the United States. Mr. Bilkey said the company would create an American subsidiary to operate independently of executives in Dubai or in London until May 1, or until the new federal investigation concludes. The port terminals affected by the deal are in New York, Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Miami and New Orleans. The company's decision was prompted by discussions on Friday and Saturday with administration officials and Congressional leaders, who were seeking to quell the political storm over approval of the deal by the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign investments that could affect national security. In a statement on Sunday evening, the Treasury Department, which oversees the review process, said it "welcomed" the company's decision. It cited the fact that the deal was "restructured" as a reason for looking at it a second time. But in fact, very little has changed in the structure of the deal, as the company's own executives acknowledged on Friday. The announcement by the company created an opening for Republican leaders, who had sharply criticized the White House as paying insufficient attention to the deal. The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, and the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, John W. Warner of Virginia, said they were satisfied that the issue was now being handled properly. "We cannot mess this deal up," said Mr. Warner, who spent hours with executives from the company over the weekend. He emerged to praise them on the quality of their port operations and said on the NBC program "Meet the Press," "We as the United States are dependent on countries like the U.A.E., Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, all of them there, to give us the support to fight this war on terrorism." In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Frist said he would recommend that the Senate await the outcome of the more extensive review before deciding on any legislative action. But Democrats balked, insisting on their original demand that Congress should have the final say over the deal. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who joined a bipartisan group of senators on Friday in calling for a quick vote on legislation requiring a 45-day review, said Congress, not the White House, should make the final determination. "We still believe that the report also has to go to Congress, that as much of it as possible ought to be public and that we would have the right of disapproval," Mr. Schumer said in an interview. "That is part of our legislation. That is constitutionally valid; you can have the right of disapproval." Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, another New York Democrat who was part of the bipartisan group, expressed qualified support for the company's offer, saying that the investigation should "be carried out in a rigorous and independent manner with a report to the Congress giving us the opportunity to exercise our independent judgment." Similar sentiments were expressed by Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, who appeared with his New York colleagues on Sunday at a news conference in Manhattan. Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, said he had supported Congressional approval of the deal to force Mr. Bush's hand. Now, Mr. King said, "I'm keeping that in reserve. I'm certainly not ruling it out." Mr. Bush has vowed to veto any bill giving authority over the deal to Congress, rather than to the executive branch. The White House had said Mr. Bush was unaware of the initial decision by his administration to approve the deal and was told by his chief of staff only over Presidents' Day weekend, after Republicans and Democrats began attacking it. The new review, a 45-day formal investigation into potential national security threats, cannot be kept at arm's length by the president. Under the law, the committee will have to report its conclusions -- and any dissents -- to Mr. Bush, who will have 15 days to decide whether to approve the deal or to require the company to divest itself of some of the operations. That has happened only once, in 1990, when the first President Bush required a Chinese aerospace firm to sell its stake in an aircraft parts manufacturer that was judged a strategic supplier to the United States. On Sunday, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Stephen J. Hadley, suggested that the new investigation was intended more to make Americans comfortable with the port deal rather than to delve anew into security issues he believed were resolved. He said Mr. Bush "thinks there are no outstanding security concerns," but would back the review to increase pubic awareness, especially of the role of the United Arab Emirates as an ally. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush said, "This is a company that has played by the rules, that has been cooperative with the United States, a country that's an ally in the war on terror, and it would send a terrible signal to friends and allies not to let this transaction go through." Mr. Bush also said he suspected anti-Arab sentiment was the subtext of some of the objections to the Dubai company taking over management of the port terminals from the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which is British. His domestic security adviser, Frances Fragos Townsend, returned to that argument on "Fox News Sunday." "I think we have to be honest that it's awfully concerning," Ms. Townsend said, "and to the extent that we're treating one company different than we would treat the British company, I think we have to be very honest and ask ourselves, 'Why is that?' " She added, "Allies in the war on terror all need to be treated equally, no matter where they come from." Democrats and some Republicans have disagreed, saying there was far greater risk that a company like Dubai Ports World could be infiltrated by Al Qaeda or other terrorist groups that could gain access to confidential information about shipments. Word of the new investigation began to leak on Saturday, and the result was that behind-the-scenes lobbying efforts were playing out in real time. On Sunday on "Meet the Press," Mr. Warner, who has been a supporter of the deal, held up a copy of the Dubai company's offer and said he had received it Saturday night while meeting with Dubai Ports executives. Mr. Warner rattled off talking points that the company offered in recent days, including an award that Dubai Ports won recently for port management. He noted that American warships dock in Dubai and that warplanes were flying support missions for Afghanistan and Iraq from Dubai airfields. "If the U.A.E. felt that they're being mistreated, and were to pull back that support, where would it shift?" Mr. Warner said. "We know not."

1409-> Wal-Mart to Expand Health Plan
Wal-Mart Stores, facing a raft of state bills that would require it to increase spending on employee health insurance, plans to ease several longstanding -- and heavily criticized -- restrictions on who is eligible for benefits, the company said yesterday. Wal-Mart said that for the first time it would permit part-time employees to enroll their children in the health insurance plan, and it pledged to reduce significantly the waiting period before a new part-time employee is eligible for benefits, though it declined to specify the reduction. The new eligibility rules are intended to increase the number of employees who can participate in the insurance plan, but it is unclear how significant the impact will be because Wal-Mart gave little detailed information about its plans. Even with the expanded plan, Wal-Mart's workers, whose average pay is less than $20,000 a year, will still pay monthly premiums and hefty annual deductibles. The changes, which Wal-Mart's chief executive, H. Lee Scott Jr., plans to announce formally on Sunday before a meeting of the nation's governors, underscore how big a political and public relations threat the health care issue has become for the company, the nation's largest private employer. Wal-Mart insures fewer than half of its 1.3 million employees in the United States, and it has come under fierce criticism from those who say its benefits are skimpy and result in the cost of health care being shifted to state governments. In the last two months, the Maryland Legislature has passed a law that would force Wal-Mart to expand its benefits, and a dozen other states, including California, Colorado and Rhode Island, are considering similar bills. Wal-Mart originally planned to announce the new benefit rules later this year, but it rushed the news out this week before the governors' meeting in Washington. The new eligibility requirements are notable because currently only full-time workers can have health coverage for their children, and part-time workers were required to wait two years before enrolling. Full-time workers must wait six months. Wal-Mart also said it would expand the use of in-store clinics to treat employees and nonemployees. Such clinics, which the company set up in Arkansas, Oklahoma and Indiana as a test six months ago, are intended to provide routine, nonemergency care for conditions like strep throat or an earache. So far, Wal-Mart has nine clinics. They are operated by third-party medical providers who rent space from the company, much like hair salons or banks do. By the end of the year, there will be 59 clinics, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Mona Williams, said. On average, she said, visits to the clinics cost about $45, with some clinics acceptinginsurance. Wal-Mart said it would make a new health care plan, with premiums as low as $11 a month for an individual, available to half of its employees by next year. Under the plan, which was introduced this year in several regions, the premiums are $9 more a month for children. Wal-Mart said it had to go through tough negotiations with doctor networks to get such low premiums, making it impossible to roll out the program to all of its American workers in one year. That low-cost benefit, known as the Value Plan, allows for three generic prescriptions and three doctor visits before a deductible kicks in -- $1,000 for a individual employee and up to $3,000 for a family. It is unlikely to cover a complicated illness or expensive hospital stay during the first year, when there is a $25,000 insurance cap. In addition, out-of-pocket payments range from $300 for prescriptions to $1,000 for hospital stays. Ms. Williams said Wal-Mart was "trying to make our plans more relevant, accessible and affordable." Asked how many workers were expected to enroll in the health insurance plan after the changes in eligibility, she said, "We think these enhancements are a step in the right direction for associates, but don't yet know how they affect" enrollment. Wal-Mart has said its new Value Plan has encouraged more workers to sign up for health care. But its records show that the percentage of workers who have enrolled in a company health insurance plan has increased only slightly in the last year. As of January 2005, Wal-Mart insured 45.8 percent of its workers. Today, it insures 46.2 percent, or about 615,000 out of 1.3 million. Over all, Wal-Mart said, 75 percent of its workers have some form of health insurance, either through Wal-Mart, a spouse or a previous job. The remaining 25 percent have no insurance. Wal-Mart has never said how many of its employees' children rely on company insurance, but an internal memo written by M. Susan Chambers, Wal-Mart's executive vice president for benefits, disclosed that 46 percent of them were uninsured or on Medicaid. Wal-Mart declined to say how much the changes would cost, a number that investors will be eager to learn, given Wal-Mart's no-frills business model, which emphasizes low labor costs. Ms. Williams said the plan was factored into Wal-Mart's profit forecast for 2006, which the company announced this week. Without such details, it is unclear whether the latest changes will move Wal-Mart employees off state Medicaid rolls and onto Wal-Mart's insurance plans, a change state legislators have pushed for with their proposed legislation. It is also unclear if these changes will increase the percentage of Wal-Mart's payroll devoted to health care, another focus of the proposed state laws. News of the changes drew carefully parsed praise from leaders of health care groups like the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan foundation in Washington. Paul B. Ginsburg, the center's president, credited Wal-Mart for trying to expand health care offerings at a time when many employers are pulling back on spending. But he added that Wal-Mart was "clearly focused on what it can do to look better without it costing them a lot more money." Helen Darling, president of the National Business Group on Health, a nonprofit organization that represents large employers, said Wal-Mart's investment in retail health clinics, a relatively new concept, "is a very big development.' "If this takes off, it will have an impact on everyone. A lot of other organizations will jump into it." The changes to Wal-Mart's health insurance plan represent a victory for the retailer's critics, particularly organized labor and the two groups that have pushed it to raise wages and benefits, Wal-Mart Watch and Wake Up Wal-Mart, both formed in 2005. The groups have tried, with apparent success, to turn Wal-Mart into a symbol of what is wrong with American health care, leading to the legislation in numerous states, which is directed squarely at Wal-Mart. Several of those bills have already suffered setbacks and only a handful have a chance of becoming law, state leaders say, but the bills have touched off a discussion about the future of employer health care plans. "That debate," said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families U.S.A., a health care consumer-advocacy group, "is long overdue."

1410-> Warning: Pregame Develops Bloating
The Super Bowl pregame show is no mere show but a symbol of the rampant gigantism endemic to the event. It was once a fairly ordinary presentation, a couple of hours long, back in a prehistoric era when TV executives had a sense of proportion and Terry Bradshaw wore a hair system. Then they learned that the bigger they grew the program, the more advertising they could sell, and they said that was very, very good. The Super Bowl pregames were XL long before time caught up to the game itself. Now the ESPN empire, which has swallowed ABC Sports but has not yet spit it out, has taken a giant leap beyond the annually enormous pregame load. As befitting its ever-growing size, the empire of all media has (to use a phrase we will hear at least three dozen times today) stepped up with the largest one-day buffet of pregame programming ever attempted. At 11 a.m., ESPN will start its six-hour pregame extravaganza. Then, at 2:30 p.m., ABC's three-and-half-hour production will start, preceding the Steelers-Seahawks match. With the pregame festivities lasting nine and a half hours, the game that made this bloating necessary will be one-third the size of what preceded it. (The NFL Network is carrying a five-hour pregame extravaganza.) No other sport's final game can boast of this, and let us be thankful for that. Only three years ago, when ABC last carried the Super Bowl, ESPN's "NFL Countdown" went from 11 to 2, and ABC followed with four hours. They didn't overlap, but then, that was before ESPN ate ABC Sports. The man in charge of ESPN's and ABC's pregame activities disagrees with my theory of the radical distending of the pregame. Norby Williamson, an executive vice president of ESPN, said last week during a conference call: "I don't think it's a bit much at all. Our goal is to serve the sports fan." He added: "There's an insatiable thirst for news, information and stories about the Super Bowl. It's the biggest event there is." In recent years, the Super Bowl networks have given increasing detail to the news media about what they will show in their pregame. What they promise sometimes sounds dandy, but the execution is lousy, especially in the delivery of behind-the-scenes, all-access, in-your-nose-hairs footage. For today, the ESPN and ABC rundowns sound lovely enough. New England Coach Bill Belichick's analysis of Super Bowl defenses will be seen on ABC at 4:43 p.m. A report on a Pop Warner league for disabled children will be on ESPN at 12:46, then repeated, at a shorter length, on ABC, at 4:20. Each show will feature profiles of Steelers Coach BIll Cowher (by Al Michaels on ABC and by Greg Garber on ESPN). Jerome Bettis and Ben Roethlisberger will be the subjects of separate features on ABC, but ESPN will squeeze them into a single segment. ESPN will examine Seattle Coach Mike Holmgren's influence on quarterbacks, while ABC will focus on the medical work of his wife, Kathy, in Africa. And, for some reason, Kenny Mayne, who got a quick hook recently on "Dancing with the Stars," will make nachos on ESPN with Martha Stewart. One danger of the two networks airing separate, overlapping programs is the overload of personnel; they may resemble the number of extras when Charlton Heston parted the Red Sea. On ABC, the cast will be Chris Berman, Michael Irvin, Tom Jackson, Steve Young, Mike Tirico and Belichick. The ESPN roster includes Stuart Scott, Trey Wingo, Mike Ditka, Sean Salisbury, Joe Theismann, Mark Schlereth and Darren Woodson. There is no evidence at this writing that Nick Lachey, who was inexplicably hired last season for "College Gameday," will be there for some sports-entertainment fusion. How much entertainment Belichick brings may depend on whether he's being tickled underneath the studio desk in Detroit. Perhaps without game pressure, and in a suit and tie, Belichick will be wittier and chattier than he is in his gray sideline hoodie. Berman insisted that Belichick was "a very interesting person, although you don't know that from his pre- and postgame press conferences." (Yes, we've heard that.) He added, "He wasn't invented for the sound bite, but he's interesting, and my God, he breaks down stuff." The nine and a half hours will eventually end, followed by an actual game. It will be ABC's final N.F.L. game for the foreseeable future, after the end of its 36-season "Monday Night Football" run. John Madden will complete his ABC tenure and make his move to NBC, his fourth broadcast network, for Sunday night games. Al Michaels will wrap up his 20th season as ABC's play-by-play voice of football. At that moment, he will morph into ESPN's "Monday Night" voice, but that gig may last as little as a few days before the ever-likelier announcement that he has been freed from his eight-year deal to join Madden on NBC for the next six years.

1411-> Fight Grows in New Orleans on Demolition and Rebuilding
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 5 - With activists, planners and residents squaring off over which neighborhoods will be demolished and which will be rebuilt, state officials are warning that some low-lying neighborhoods may not be eligible for federal rebuilding assistance. Sean Reilly, a member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, the state body formed partly to manage the flow of federal money to the state, castigated city officials on Wednesday for assuring residents that every neighborhood flooded after Hurricane Katrina would be rebuilt. Mr. Reilly made it clear that federal money, at least in some forms, was unlikely to go to those areas. "The L.R.A. will not fund an irrational and unsafe rebuilding plan," Mr. Reilly said in Baton Rouge. "Someone has to be tough, to stand up, and to tell the truth. Every neighborhood in New Orleans will not be able to come back safe and viable. The L.R.A. is speaking the truth with the money it controls." Until now, political leaders in New Orleans have been reluctant to tell residents that some areas may be too damaged or too vulnerable to flooding to be rebuilt at the same pace as others less damaged. The City Council recently rejected a proposal by the Urban Land Institute, a planning group that advises the city, to focus rebuilding on higher ground and urge residents not to return immediately to heavily damaged areas like the impoverished Lower Ninth Ward. In a vote last month, the Council promised that all neighborhoods would be rebuilt. "Resources should be disbursed to all areas in a consistent and uniform fashion," the Council said in a resolution. To protest the idea that some areas should not be rebuilt, some neighborhood activists have been fighting the city plan to begin demolishing ruined houses in some low-lying neighborhoods. On the streets of the Lower Ninth Ward on Thursday, one group was able, at least temporarily, to stop the city from clearing streets littered with debris from ruined houses. The group of residents and activists rushed to Reynes Street in the Lower Ninth Ward when they heard that a backhoe was moving debris. After angry calls to City Hall, the group persuaded officials to stop the work. Many houses on Reynes Street, near the levee break on the Industrial Canal, are no more than immense piles of rubble. In some cases, the piles spill out into what remains of the street. Nonetheless, the group said the city's action violated a court agreement that no demolitions proceed until hearings are held. City officials insist that they simply want to clear away 100 of the most damaged houses. Activists, pointing to earlier official statements, say up to 2,500 damaged houses are threatened with demolition and have criticized the city for failing to contact their owners. "They were scraping people's homes, trying to clear the roads," Ishmael Muhammad, a lawyer, said at the protest. "You have to do your work and contact the owners. They have value in there. We know the city has a need, as well. But don't just go willy-nilly demolishing people's homes." Officials did not respond to telephone calls for comment. Activists and lawyers for the city are to meet with a federal judge on Friday to decide on the course of a suit over the demolitions. Mayor C. Ray Nagin's rebuilding commission is scheduled to issue its planning blueprint for the city next week. In the meantime, the state recovery authority, which controls the spending of billions of dollars in federal aid, has quietly begun taking action to ensure that the money will not be spent randomly around the city. In a little-noticed vote last month, the authority agreed not to spend money on rebuilding that does not conform to federal flood maps, which experts expect the Federal Emergency Management Agency to issue shortly. Under those rules, all houses built in the lowest-lying areas would have to be elevated, a requirement that would add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost for each house and probably make it impossible for low-income families to rebuild. The most damaged neighborhoods, including the Lower Ninth Ward, Gentilly and Lakeview, would be the most directly affected. "At some point, tough decisions have to be made," Mr. Reilly emphasized in an interview on Thursday. "We can ensure that federal dollars sent our way are spent to build stronger and keep people out of harm's way. I think the implications are real. Development will have to be in conformity with those new flood advisory maps."

1413-> Bush and Hu Vow New Cooperation
WASHINGTON, April 20 - President Bush and China's president, Hu Jintao, pledged to cooperate more closely on fighting nuclear proliferation and reducing trade imbalances on Thursday, but broke no new ground on the most delicate issues that divide the two nations. The meeting, the first at the White House between the men since Mr. Hu became China's top leader in 2002, was plagued by gaffes that upended months of painstaking diplomacy over protocol and staging. Though administration officials said significant progress was made, especially on the economic front, the session also underscored the intractable nature of a long list of grievances between the world's richest country and its fastest rising rival. No new agreements were announced after Oval Office negotiations and a working lunch. The occasion was disrupted when a member of the Falun Gong spiritual sect, accredited as a reporter for a sect-run publication to cover the ceremony at the White House, interrupted Mr. Hu's address and upset the elaborate choreography the Chinese delegation had regarded as the most important trophy of Mr. Hu's visit. Screaming, "President Bush, make him stop persecuting Falun Gong," the ethnic Chinese woman, Wenyi Wang, partly drowned out Mr. Hu. She continued shouting for more than a minute before security officers removed her. Mr. Bush later apologized to Mr. Hu for the incident, White House officials said. But Chinese Foreign Ministry officials traveling with Mr. Hu canceled an afternoon briefing. One delegation member, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the subject publicly, described his superiors as outraged by the breach. Compounding the gaffe, a White House announcer introducing the national anthems at the same ceremony mistakenly referred to China as the Republic of China, which is the formal name of its archrival, Taiwan. Mainland China is the People's Republic of China. China treats American support for Taiwan, a separately governed island that China claims as its sovereign territory, as the biggest irritant in bilateral relations. Even minuscule changes in the wording of diplomatic statements on the subject are often viewed as transformative on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. While it is unclear whether the Chinese will interpret the two incidents as simple mistakes or as overt efforts to embarrass Mr. Hu, there was no indication that they derailed the private discussions between the presidents that followed. The two men emerged from the Oval Office and agreed to accept several questions from the news media, a rarity for Mr. Hu, an aloof leader who almost never interacts with the press. Mr. Bush said the countries would "deepen our cooperation in addressing threats to global security, including the nuclear ambitions of Iran, the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, the violence unleashed by terrorists and extremists and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction." He acknowledged that the two men "do not agree on everything" but said, "We're able to discuss our disagreements in a spirit of friendship and cooperation." Mr. Hu also acknowledged that "different opinions or even frictions" had complicated the relationship. But he emphasized that China believed that the areas of agreement outweighed the differences. "China and the United States share extensive common interests, and there is a broad prospect for the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries," he said. Mr. Bush said he discussed with Mr. Hu the possibility of passing a United Nations Security Council motion against Iran that would permit imposing sanctions ranging from economic penalties to military strikes. China has repeatedly rejected the idea as an unnecessary escalation of the nuclear standoff. Mr. Hu emphasized that China would only support steps that enhanced dialogue and did not suggest any inclination to embrace Mr. Bush's idea. Mr. Hu said multinational talks to end North Korea's nuclear program had run into difficulties, but he did not outline new steps that China would take to bring North Korea back to the bargaining table. Mr. Bush urged him to do more to use China's "considerable influence" to get results after years of inconclusive diplomacy. Bush administration officials were more upbeat about the discussion on economic issues, including China's incipient steps to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate and efforts by Mr. Hu to reduce China's reliance on exports and stimulate domestic demand as a source of growth. As it has many times before, China has promised to buy more American goods and to crack down on industrial-scale piracy of American copyrights and trademarks. But after announcing a broad commitment to those goals earlier this month, China presented no new measures. Mr. Hu did emphasize China's intention to undertake a structural shift in its economy, which has tended to favor investment- and export-driven growth during its heady rise over the past quarter century. Citing steps China has taken as part of its five-year economic plan, Mr. Hu said Beijing would seek to stimulate more consumer-led growth, in part by improving the social safety net so that consumers felt comfortable spending money rather than saving it at record high levels for health, education and retirement. "China is pursuing a policy of boosting domestic demand, which means that we'll mainly rely on domestic demand to further promote economic growth," Mr. Hu said. On human rights, Mr. Hu refused to make concessions on any cases on a list that Mr. Bush presented to him last September, when they met during a session at the United Nations. Dennis Wilder, the acting senior director for East Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said Mr. Bush presented the same list to Mr. Hu again this time. Mr. Hu did get a big part of what Chinese analysts said he came for: images of him with the American president on the White House lawn, as Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin, his predecessors, had posed for. The pomp included an elaborate honor guard, a military band, a fife and drum corps and the full 21-gun salute given visiting heads of state. But the protocol for the meeting was already a sore point for the Chinese, who argued for months that Mr. Hu's first trip here as president must be a full state visit. The White House declined to offer him a state dinner, however, and has called the session a "working visit." The heckling by the protester is likely to exacerbate the spat over protocol. Chinese television viewers will now almost certainly get a censored view of the event. Mr. Wilder said he did not expect the incident to have significant repercussions. But, he said, "I'm not going to stand here and say they are not upset."

1414-> Fiction Chronicle
AT FIRST SIGHT. By Nicholas Sparks. (Warner Books, $24.95.) Sparks's latest romance revisits two characters he introduced in an earlier novel, "True Believer." Jeremy, a divorced magazine writer from New York, fell in love with Lexie, a young librarian, while doing research in her hometown in North Carolina. Now he has decided to move down South to marry her -- despite the fact that, as a friend points out, he's "only spent a week with her." Sure enough, Jeremy soon discovers that while the air in Boone Creek may be "scented with perfume and pine and salted mist," there's very little for a transplanted city boy to do -- except fall into a fugue state of paranoid jealousy. Sparks's prose has the amiable, folksy rhythm of a rocking chair on a wraparound porch, but beware: his dialogue can be knuckle-bitingly bad ("Now, dat dere's a purty ring," one yokel tells Lexie). He also has an incurable weakness for corny characters (like the meddlesome Mayor Gherkin) and Hallmark-card aphorisms ("Life has a tendency to throw curveballs when you least expect them"). Yet even though his book is hokey to the core, Sparks gives it an ending that manages to surprise. SEX WARS. By Marge Piercy. (Morrow/HarperCollins, $24.95.) Piercy's 16th novel weaves together the real-life stories of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Victoria Woodhull and Anthony Comstock to create a vibrant portrait of post-Civil War America. While Stanton and Susan B. Anthony agitate for women's suffrage, Woodhull becomes the first woman to run for president and Comstock wages a fundamentalist holy war against sexual expression of any kind. Full of historical trivia (Cornelius Vanderbilt could barely read; in the 1870's, the legal age of consent in New York was 10), the novel's chapters rotate among the characters until the various story lines converge with an operatic intensity. Piercy has chosen a fascinating period to explore, and as her narrative leaps between the social tiers it becomes clear just how brutally hard life was for all but the wealthiest Americans. Occasionally, the action is slowed by chunks of not entirely digested research, but Piercy works hard to make her characters come alive -- and mostly succeeds. Still, it's a fictitious character who captures the reader's imagination: a determined young Jewish immigrant from Russia who goes into the homemade condom business. THE PRISONER PEAR: Stories From the Lake. By Elissa Minor Rust. (Swallow/Ohio University, $28.95; paper, $16.95.) Set in the swanky Portland suburb of Lake Oswego, Ore., the 12 stories in Rust's debut collection evoke a world of material privilege and emotional bankruptcy. Each story begins with a fairly innocuous item taken from the local newspaper's police blotter: a dead bird found in a mailbox, a naked man running in the park, a vicious cat, an "unknown hairy thing" stuffed in a garbage can. These cryptic, sometimes bizarre little items provide a fitting point of departure for Rust's fertile imagination. Forget about borrowing a cup of sugar from the neighbors; ever wonder what might happen if an infertile couple asked for some sperm? If a woman walked out on her husband and their 2-year-old daughter but took the dog? Eating disorders, divorce, cancer, class envy, postpartum depression, suburban anomie, Volvos with seat warmers: they're all here in lovely, privileged, unsettling Lake Oswego. THE NEW WOMAN. By Jon Hassler. (Viking, $23.95.) At 87, Agatha McGee is no spring chicken, but she's not one to sit and brood about her age. A former sixth-grade teacher and all-around busybody, Agatha jumps eagerly into any situation that snares her interest. So when she leaves her house for the Sunset Senior Apartments, the retirement community will never be the same. Hassler wrote his first novel set in the gossipy small town of Staggerford, Minn., in 1977, and this latest installment in the series contains enough references to past volumes that first-time readers may feel like guests at somebody else's reunion. The plot features a lot of contrived business involving a missing brooch, a shoebox full of valuables, an exhumed corpse and a kidnapped 5-year-old girl, but underneath there's something simpler and stronger: an elderly woman's search for respect and a sense of purpose. Even though she's lived her whole life in Staggerford, Agatha doesn't know everyone in town the way she used to, but over time she realizes she still has a great deal to offer. "I believe 'range of motion' applies to our psyches as well as our bodies," she counsels her grandnephew Frederick. "If we shut down parts of our thinking, we'll never get them back." DOGS OF TRUTH: New and Uncollected Stories. By Kit Reed. (Tor/Tom Doherty, paper, $14.95.) When a short story collection starts with a 90-year-old Salman Rushdie being attacked by an ancient assassin as he throws out a ceremonial opening ball at Yankee Stadium (now a monstroplex shopping mall owned by the Sultan of Brunei), you know you're dealing with a feverishly creative mind. The author of the well-received short fiction collection "Weird Women, Wired Women," Reed has a prose style that's pure dry ice, displayed in dystopian stories that specialize in bitterness and dislocation. "Into the Jungle" follows a housewife as she trades her family for a fresh start in the South American rainforest. "Escape from Shark Island," told from the point of view of a 16-year-old who still shares a bed with her three siblings and her parents, examines the extremely dark side of certain aspects of child rearing. "High Rise High," details a high school riot "worse than Attica," punctuated by a "monster prom that puts the arm on Armageddon." In other stories, residents of a gated community drive around in the night searching for their houses, a demented soap opera fan becomes psychotically attached to one of the show's stars and a senile old soldier spends years shouting from his nursing home bed. It's enough to make you want to move to Lake Oswego. Sarah Ferguson has written for Vogue, Elle and New York magazine.

1415-> Rumbling Trucks, Followed by Fretting Residents
BREAKFAST in Greg Bellows and Miriam Weiner's open, sunlit kitchen on 20th Street in South Slope, Brooklyn, features perfectly browned toast, tiny cups of frothy coffee, and, every few minutes, a rumbling noise. It starts quietly, builds within seconds, and ends in the clatter of truck parts and heavy cargo just outside the front door. Sometimes the floor vibrates. Mr. Bellows, a computer consultant, and Ms. Weiner, a theater director, moved to their narrow, residential block south of Park Slope a year and a half ago, and they soon discovered that their house sat along one of the city's designated truck routes. None of the residents of this traditionally working-class neighborhood were pleased with the situation, the couple said, but they had not complained, either. "They don't even report it, because they don't think there's anything they can do," Ms. Weiner said. "The response is always: 'What are you going to do? It's the only two-way street.' " Early last year, Mr. Bellows circulated a petition asking the city's Department of Transportation to reroute the trucks, or at least study the possibility. Two trends may have helped his campaign. His neighborhood has gentrified in recent years, and new residents are less shy than older ones about seeking redress. At the same time, according to Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7, local truck traffic has increased, in part because of development along the waterfront. In any event, Mr. Bellows collected about 70 signatures, enough to get the attention of local officials. In November, he learned that the Transportation Department and the local representatives were planning a meeting. But that meeting has not taken place, the apparent victim of busy schedules all around. "This is a quiet day on this street," Ms. Weiner said on her stoop shortly before 8 one morning last week, raising her voice over the din of a truck that was powering up the hill between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. As the truck blasted its air horn at a slow-moving van, Ms. Weiner noted how some residents fold in their side mirrors and park halfway on the sidewalk to avoid scratches on their cars. Kay Sarlin, a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department, said that 20th Street, along with McDonald Avenue, was part of an important local shipping corridor for moving goods from east to west within the borough, unlike the Prospect Expressway, three blocks to the north, which is a state highway. She said her office was still working to schedule the meeting. JAKE MOONEY

1416-> INSIDE THE N.H.L.; Brodeur Sets Sights On Another Gold Medal
In his 12-plus seasons with the Devils, Martin Brodeur has won three Stanley Cups and the last two Vezina Trophies, awarded to the league's best goaltender. Last month, Brodeur signed a five-year, $31.2 million contract extension, and he will again be the No. 1 goaltender for Canada at the Turin Games. Earlier this month, Brodeur, 33, joined Terry Sawchuk and George Hainsworth as the only goalies in N.H.L. history to record 100 career shutouts in the regular season and playoffs. "But I have a lot more to accomplish," Brodeur said Friday at the Devils' practice rink in West Orange, N.J. Like winning a second consecutive gold medal at the Winter Olympics? "Yeah, for sure," Brodeur said. "I think there's not too many guys that could say that. This is my third Olympics. I'll still be under contract for the fourth one, if I have a chance. So these are the things you look ahead and say, 'Maybe, maybe.' "I don't want to feel that I accomplished everything and now I'm just going to cruise the last five years. Because when I'm going to be done, I want to look back and have no regret about what I've put into my life. I'm just excited to have the opportunity to be able to stay here. That, for me, I think is going to give me the chance to be successful, and participating in events like the Olympics and the World Cups and all that is just a plus. I'm just fortunate that people in my country think I'm the guy for them." Brodeur led Canada to its first Olympic gold in 50 years at the 2002 Salt Lake Games and to the 2004 World Cup title. But after the lockout that wiped out the 2004-5 season, Brodeur struggled at the start of this season. For the first time in his career, he missed significant time with an injury (sprained ligaments in his right knee). On Jan. 1, the Devils were floundering at 16-18-5. What a difference the new year has made. Brodeur, who was named the N.H.L.'s defensive player of the month for January, was 14-3-1 in 2006 with five shutouts heading into yesterday's game against the Islanders on the last day before the Olympic break. Before he is done, Brodeur could surpass his boyhood idol, Patrick Roy, for most career victories and Sawchuk for most career shutouts. "It's overwhelming to hear these things because I don't see myself as one of the best or as one of the great goalies in history," Brodeur said. "I'm proud of it. But I still feel I'm like 21 years old."

1419-> Bomber Kills 3 Israelis as Hamas Takes Power
JERUSALEM, March 30 - A Palestinian suicide bomber, possibly disguised as an observant Jew, blew himself up at a gas station in the West Bank on Thursday evening, turning a car into a fireball and killing three Israelis inside the vehicle, Israeli news reports said. Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades claimed responsibility for the blast, which came hours after the newly installed Palestinian cabinet, led by Hamas, took up its duties in the Palestinian Authority government offices. The new Palestinian interior minister, Said Siam, who is in charge of the police, announced that Palestinian militants would no longer be arrested by the Palestinian security forces. The bomber apparently used his disguise to approach an Israeli car and ask for a ride, Israeli Army radio reported. He then detonated his explosive next to or inside the vehicle, which was stopped at a gas station outside the entrance to the Jewish settlement of Kedumim, in the northern West Bank, according to the media reports. Several hours after the blast, the Israeli military confirmed that at least three people had been killed, but said that their identities had not been established. The military said a number of details were sketchy and an investigation was still under way. Thursday's attack was the first deadly bombing since Dec. 29, when an Islamic Jihad suicide bomber killed an Israeli soldier and two Palestinians at a military checkpoint in the West Bank. Most Palestinian suicide bombings over the past five years have been inside Israeli cities. But in response to the bombings, Israel has imposed a web of travel restrictions that have made it much more difficult for Palestinian bombers to enter Israel and reach the cities. Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades identified the bomber as Mahmoud Masharka, 24. The group has carried out many attacks against Israel in recent years. It is linked to the Fatah movement, which dominated Palestinian politics for decades until it was defeated by Hamas, the militant Islamic movement, in parliamentary elections in January. There has been speculation by political analysts that Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades may try to step up its attacks to show that the group, and by extension Fatah, is still a force to be reckoned with. Hamas has carried out the largest number of suicide bombings over the past five years, but has largely observed an informal truce for more than a year and has not carried out a suicide bombing or other major attack against Israel during this time. However, Hamas says it will not lay down its weapons or force other Palestinian factions to do so. Hours before the bombing, Mr. Siam, the interior minister, said his officers would not arrest militants, as had occasionally happened in the past. "We will not put our sons in prison for political membership or resisting occupation, because occupation is the reason for the problem," Mr. Siam said at his office in Gaza City. He did, however, suggest that the government might try to persuade the armed factions not to attack. "We will reach an understanding" with the militants, he said. "Resistance is a legitimate right, but how should one resist?" The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, and the rest of his cabinet, which is dominated by Hamas, were sworn in Wednesday and began working at government ministries on Thursday. In a related development, the so-called quartet of international peace mediators -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- issued a statement saying that assistance to the Palestinian Authority is likely to suffer because Hamas has not been willing to recognize Israel, renounce violence and accept previous agreements.

1420-> State Checking Dozens of Sites for Hidden Contaminants
WITH satellite photographs all over the Internet, images of Long Island as seen from above are only a few mouse clicks away. Views beneath the Island's surface and a clear picture of what may be seeping up and down are not so easy to come by. The need for a better view of what is going on below ground has assumed new urgency in New York as environmental officials move to evaluate the threat of volatile chemical vapors rising into homes and businesses from contaminated soil and water -- some at sites the state said had already been cleaned up. The potential for contamination is far worse than state environmental officials previously believed, and homes could be at risk from vapors that can migrate from industrial and commercial sites where contaminants were dumped or spilled years or even decades ago. The chemicals most commonly found in the volatile vapors have been linked to health problems that include cancer, organ damage and birth defects, a state assemblyman's report says. In an effort that has received little attention on Long Island, the State Department of Environmental Conservation is making plans and setting priorities for investigating 400 hazardous waste sites, including more than 80 on Long Island. The department wants to determine whether vapors are moving -- a process called vapor intrusion -- and tainting indoor air in buildings on or near the sites. Authorities had deemed many of the sites sufficiently cleaned up but will now take a second look. The sites are scattered across the Island but are predominantly in Nassau County and western Suffolk. There are no estimates for the cost of their cleanup. "Historically, we thought that vapor intrusion was only an issue where the source of contaminants was very shallow and the magnitude of contamination was very great," Carl Johnson, the conservation department's deputy commissioner for air and waste management, said in testimony at a State Assembly hearing last April. "We now know that our previous assumptions about the mechanisms that could lead to exposure to vapor intrusion were not complete." The environmental conservation department and the State Health Department have devised a strategy to look at the sites for what are called vapor intrusion pathways -- essentially, the paths that the vapors from chemical contaminants like industrial solvents can follow from the soil and groundwater to the surface and, in the worst cases, into buildings. Sites ranked most likely to have problems will be dealt with first. The rankings are due by December. Cleanup costs would be borne by business owners and past owners identified as responsible for contaminants; they would be assumed by the state as a last resort. Additional cleanup efforts could include the excavation of contaminated soil and groundwater treatments generally referred to as air stripping, in which volatile organic compounds in groundwater are exposed to the air and evaporate. At sites where problems are suspected or found, soil and basements, crawl spaces and lower-level living areas in commercial buildings and nearby homes could be tested. Indoor air samples are usually collected during the heating season. Steps to evaluate the risks of vapor intrusion are part of current cleanups, including brownfield sites, the former commercial or industrial sites that have been cleaned up for reuse. In some cases, demolition and excavation can provide paths for vapors. The state environmental conservation and health departments said their comprehensive approach would make New York a national leader in addressing vapor intrusion. But critics said the problem only underscored how much contamination was allowed to remain even after state-approved cleanups. Walter Hang, the president of Toxics Targeting in Ithaca, N.Y., a company that compiles government information on 500,000 toxic sites in New York for clients ranging from water districts to home buyers, said the state was reaping the results of inadequate cleanup of contaminated sites. "The state should have cleaned up these sites decades ago, given that everyone knew the sole source of Long Island drinking water had to be protected," Mr. Hang said. Now, he said, the vapor problem was compounding the risks residents already faced from contaminants that are seeping farther down toward public water supplies. "The question is, are these solvents penetrating into nearby homes and buildings as a soil gas vapor?" Mr. Hang said. He said Long Island's sandy and highly permeable soils were "an ideal environment for allowing contaminated water and soil vapor to spread to the maximum degree." "These chemicals are very persistent, particularly when they are underground and there is no breakdown of the compounds," he said. "They can migrate slowly but surely through the groundwater and cause continuing contamination hazards." The new view of soil vapor intrusion began emerging in the late 1990's when the federal Environmental Protection Agency found a far wider problem at a Colorado cleanup site than agency officials had anticipated or computer models had predicted. The findings set off alarms among environmental agencies across the country, but nowhere more than in New York, where solvent dumping associated with heavy industry and manufacturing is well documented. In 2001, the State Department of Environmental Conservation investigated soil vapor at an industrial plant in Endicott where I.B.M., the former owner, had reported a 4,100-gallon solvent spill in 1979. By the summer of 2004, I.B.M. had discovered measurable levels of vapors in 470 homes and buildings in the vicinity of the plant in the Village of Endicott and the Town of Union. It has spent about $40 million so far to clean up the site. Among Long Island sites where vapors have become an issue is a large industrial park in Plainview near residential areas south of the Long Island Expressway. An engineering consultant hired by the environmental conservation department, O'Brien & Gere of Syracuse, asked property owners in December for access to test groundwater and poke underground with heated probes that draw out vapors. The industrial park, like many of the other Long Island sites on the state list for evaluation, has a long history of contamination. Reports supplied by Toxics Targeting, compiled from Department of Environmental Conservation records, show that one tenant in the Plainview industrial park, a lithography company, disposed of unknown quantities of contaminants in four leaching pools for about 25 years, ending in 1990. Some contaminated soil was removed and some groundwater monitoring was performed under the direction of the Nassau County Health Department, the reports said. The contaminant that worries state officials most is trichloroethylene, which is also known as trichloroethene or TCE. It is found in solvents used to clean machine parts, strip paint, make adhesives and mix in paints and varnishes, among other applications. The state health department says long-term exposure to high levels of TCE in the air can cause nausea, headaches, dizziness, reduced coordination and in some studies, increased risks for certain cancers. Other contaminants, which like TCE are also volatile organic compounds, include xylene, toluene, tetrachlorethylene (a common dry-cleaning solvent, also known as perchloroethylene, PCE or perc), and trichloroethane (TCA). Another manufacturer at the industrial park dumped unknown quantities of perc and TCA into a leaching pool over an unknown length of time, contaminating soil and groundwater, the reports said. The documents say that a voluntary cleanup of soil and groundwater at the site met objectives, but that contaminated soil was left in place, because it was "primarily subsurface" and "direct exposures are not likely to occur." The records show that employees of a manufacturer of paint and industrial coatings dumped solvents on the ground and into storm drains, a situation that came to light in the late 1980's. In 1993, a cleanup ordered by the Department of Environmental Conservation removed contaminated soil as well as hazardous wastes from leaking underground tanks. The site is within 500 yards of a public well. In all cases, the conservation department eventually "delisted" the sites, meaning they were deemed sufficiently cleaned up. Carol Meschkow, the president of the Concerned Citizens of the Plainview-Old Bethpage Community, said she was unaware of state-ordered testing for vapor intrusion at the industrial park and did not know of the state's concern about vapors. She added that she had never heard a complaint from any area resident about confirmed or suspected vapors in a home. Paul Granger, the superintendent of the Plainview Water District, also had not heard of the testing. "I am surprised I am not hearing more about this, and I'm surprised there is not more information for the public," he said. Mr. Granger, a former chairman of the Long Island Water Conference, an association of water companies, has tried for years to compel the conservation department to do more to clean up the industrial park. "We are very concerned with that facility," he said. "But these spills are decades-old, and it appears the horse is out of the barn. Here we are in 2006, and it seems like things are only getting worse." He said that a water district pumping station drawing water at a depth of 700 feet about a half mile northeast of the industrial park began picking up traces of TCE in 2001. He said the amount had steadily increased since then, requiring the district to spend $1 million to build a stripping tower to remove the contaminant. Mr. Hang of Toxics Targeting said that the Plainview park was not unique. "It is one of dozens of sites that will require further investigation and probably further cleanup," he said. "Long Island had so many companies that used these solvents." Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, a Democrat from Great Neck and the chairman of the Assembly's Committee on Environmental Conservation, called on the State Health Department on Tuesday to enact stricter standards for exposure to TCE in indoor air. Mr. DiNapoli said the recommendation came out of hearings the committee held in Endicott in November 2004, in Ithaca last April and in Hopewell Junction last May. All three communities have had major problems with vapor intrusion from contaminated industrial sites. He urged the environmental conservation and health departments to "adopt the strictest guidelines that are out there" and to agree to any requests for tests of indoor air by any resident living near a contaminated site with possible vapor intrusion. A report Mr. DiNapoli scheduled for release on Thursday also said that once vapors had been blocked or diverted from homes, an aggressive cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination should begin as soon as possible. The report noted that the current State Health Department air guidelines for TCE were half as stringent as those in California, Colorado and New Jersey. The report said the stricter standards in those states were warranted in New York because of uncertainties about the toxicity of TCE. Mr. DiNapoli said that the contamination of indoor air by volatile chemicals like TCE was "the most significant public health threat from contaminated Superfund and brownfield sites." His report said that TCE, PCE and TCA, chemicals commonly found in vapors, were linked to the serious health effects including cancer, organ damage and birth defects. At the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency's regional office for New York and New Jersey is appraising vapor intrusion at Superfund sites in both states. "Even on sites we have completed active remediation of, we feel there is a need to go back and look," said Michael Sivak, a risk assessment specialist for the agency. There are 15 Superfund sites in Nassau County and 11 in Suffolk. Mr. Sivak said that the risks from vapor intrusion varied from site to site depending on local geology and other factors the agency is still learning about. He said the agency had done recent testing for indoor vapors at a groundwater contamination site in Smithtown but found little or no sign of problems inside homes there. In 1998, the agency found PCE in water from private wells in contaminated areas in Nissequogue, Head of the Harbor and St. James. The agency plans more indoor air sampling near Lawrence Aviation Industries in Port Jefferson Station, a former titanium plant that is on the federal Superfund list. The testing is proposed for about 25 homes and Earl L. Vandermeulen High School in Port Jefferson.

1423-> Marilyn and Me: Dealing With Illusions (or Life on a Parkinson's Drug)
I was drinking coffee in the kitchen one night a few years ago when I heard, emanating from our stereo system two rooms away, the unmistakable voice of Marilyn Monroe singing "Happy Birthday, Mr. President." Startled, I asked my wife, Gina, what that recording was doing on our stereo. "You're hallucinating," she said. "That's the Grateful Dead. It's not even close to 'Happy Birthday,' much less Marilyn Monroe." I think I have seen one Marilyn Monroe movie in its entirety, and I don't recall its title. Many years ago, I saw a film clip of her performance at Madison Square Garden in celebration of President John F. Kennedy's birthday. Despite Gina's assurances, I continued to hear Marilyn singing until I walked into the next room and met the familiar sound of Jerry Garcia and the Grateful Dead. We concluded that I had somehow conflated the Dead's song "Uncle John's Band" with some faint music from the next-door neighbor's house and transformed the two streams of sound into something completely different. The dopamine agonist I had started taking a few months earlier for Parkinson's disease carried a warning that hallucinations were a possible side effect. It had already caused sleep attacks, so, I thought, why not hallucinations? On the theory that once is an aberration -- a curiosity, no matter how bizarre -- I decided to wait before calling the doctor. A few months later we were having dinner at a popular Indian restaurant in Vancouver, British Columbia, when I clearly heard a circus ringmaster barking up business through an amplified megaphone. No, Gina assured me, there was no ringmaster or other maestro with a bullhorn outside or inside. There was a man at the next table, speaking loudly, but not in the rich baritone I was hearing. Fine, I said, but it was several minutes before I could disassemble the voice I was hearing and trace it through the din in the room to the man next to us and some tabla music playing in a bar in an alcove at the back of the restaurant. If once is an oddity, I thought, twice is the beginning of a pattern. But what exactly does that mean? Virtually all the drugs used to increase dopamine levels in people with Parkinson's can apparently bring on hallucinations, severe enough in some cases to require discontinuation or treatment with antipsychotic drugs. Each choice has complications. The alternatives to a drug reaction were not pleasant to contemplate -- chief among them schizophrenia, Lewy body dementias and a particularly aggressive form of Parkinson's disease. My "auditory hallucinations," as I called them for lack of a better name, were, if incongruous, intermittent and benign enough that I decided to wait until my next regular visit to the neurologist, unless they intensified. I was granted a temporary reprieve from my dithering by Dr. Alvin C. Burstein, a psychiatrist in Scottsdale, Ariz. A friend of nearly 40 years, he explained that technically they were "illusions," because they were shaped from external stimuli. "Hallucinations," on the other hand, are generated within a person's mind, independent of what's going on around him, he said. My neurologist later agreed: I was experiencing "auditory illusions," and as long as they didn't rise to the level of hallucination or increase in frequency or become associated with mental impairment, the only thing to do was to keep an eye on them. That said, the mystery of my "auditory illusions" remains unsolved. By most commonly accepted estimates, 25 to 30 percent of Parkinson's sufferers have "hallucinations," usually linked with the long-term course of Parkinson's, daytime somnolence, severe cognitive disorder or dopaminergic drugs. A vast majority of hallucinations are visual. Of the 10 to 12 percent of patients who have auditory hallucinations, only about 2 percent hear sound alone. Tactile and taste hallucinations are more rare but not unknown. In a widely cited paper in the April 2000 issue of the journal Brain, a group of neurologists, led by Dr. Gilles Fénelon of the Léopold Bellan Hospital in Paris, suggested that about 40 percent of Parkinson's patients suffered hallucinations. Fully a quarter of them experienced minor forms of hallucination, which Dr. Fénelon and his colleagues defined as the sensation of presence, commonly of a person; sideways passage, usually of an animal; and illusion, in which one thing is transformed into another. These minor forms have been little studied, the researchers wrote, in part because people who experience them don't report them, for fear of being called psychotic or because they have accepted them as more or less normal. The French neurologists also argued that minor hallucinations might be caused by Parkinson's disease itself, not the medication used to treat it. They cited various theories that Parkinson's interferes with the perceptual representation system, especially the ability to screen out irrelevant stimuli. But no one is certain, just as no one is certain what minor hallucinations might presage for the development of Parkinson's. For now, we watch and enjoy a few laughs, knowing they could turn bitter. A few nights ago, at a dinner with friends marking my 56th birthday, I heard a horse neighing. Gina observed that it was a woman with a loud laugh and then told the story of Marilyn Monroe and me.

1425-> Cops, Robbers and the Thrill of the Hunt
Opens today in Manhattan. Directed by Johnnie To Unrated, 90 minutes If the American Film Institute ever gets around to compiling a list of the greatest scenes filmed with a moving camera and without a single cut -- or, at least, any visible cuts -- it would do well to consider the bravura opening of "Breaking News." Directed by the prolific Hong Kong action master Johnnie To, this genre flick about the art and entertainment of violence opens with a scene that deserves mention alongside similarly famous choreographed scenes in "Touch of Evil" and "Goodfellas," films in which the relentlessly mobile camera represents the exalted aspirations of both the director and the medium itself. Clocking in at less than 10 minutes, Mr. To's contribution to moving-camera immortality opens the film with a bird's-eye view of a city. Like a remote-guided balloon, the camera glides down to a street abuzz with commercial activity, noses about a bit and then, as if unmoored by the laws of gravity, drifts up and into a second-story window. After a scan of a shadowy room filled with men, it drifts back down to the street, trailing after a newspaper that flutters into a parked car in which two more men are listening to a police radio. The camera travels behind the car, pausing briefly to gaze through the back windshield, before executing a 360-degree pan. It continues this restless scrutiny, albeit with increased urgency, even as the bullets and bodies begin flying. It's a slam-dunk of an opener in a film filled with terrifically choreographed action and very little on its mind. The story, such as it is, involves an extended cat-and-mouse chase between troops of police and a clutch of bank robbers who, along with Mr. To, have made an obvious study of Michael Mann's cops-and-robbers opera "Heat." Although "Breaking News" features a few standard action tropes -- in some respects, including a fondness for sweet potatoes, the good guys are not all that different from the bad -- the title specifically refers to the media circus that builds around the hunt. "Image matters most," says one ambitious young detective (Kelly Chen). "We have to put on a great show." Aided and abetted by the actors Richie Jen, Nick Cheung and Simon Yam, and his director of photography Cheung Siu-Keung, Mr. To does just that. MANOHLA DARGIS

1428-> With Greenies Banned, Up for a Cup of Coffee?
For perhaps half a century, amphetamines have been accessible to major league baseball players. If players were weary after a late night out, a long trip or a streak of tiring games, they could find the pep pills almost as readily as they could sip coffee or swig soda. The use of amphetamines to increase energy levels throughout a draining season has, over the decades, been one of baseball's dirty little secrets, although gradually it was not much of a secret anymore. Many owners, managers and reporters knew that some players were using "greenies" or "beans," the common names for these stimulants in clubhouses. But a practice that was essentially winked at will no longer go unpunished now that Major League Baseball has rules banning the use of amphetamines. For the first time, baseball will test for them, meaning that any number of players will have to adjust. Amid the uproar over baseball's tangled relationship with steroids, greenies have been tossed out of the game. Those who try to keep using them could soon find themselves facing suspensions. "Anybody who thinks you can go through the season normally and your body can just respond normally, after what we go through, is unreasonable," said Eric Chavez, the third baseman for the Oakland Athletics. "I'm not saying taking away greenies isn't a good thing, but guys are definitely going to look for something as a replacement." What will those replacements be? Anything that comes close to doing what greenies did, so anything with caffeine. Several players said they thought coffee, lots of it and no decaf, please, could become as standard as water in dugouts. Others said energy drinks, which are already baseball staples, would grow in popularity. Some teams are also offering energizing jellybeans, with emphasis on the jelly. Observing players this spring was a sign of what to expect. Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants held a coffee cup an hour before a game. Derek Jeter of the Yankees favored Red Bull, the energy drink. Ron Villone, another Yankee, brewed green tea. Jay Payton of the Athletics drank soda, even though it was 9:30 in the morning. "I guarantee guys are trying to find something simply because it's a grind going out there every single night," said Tom Glavine, a pitcher for the Mets. "Someone needs to put a Starbucks or a Dunkin' Donuts, or both, right by Shea." Chavez echoed Glavine's theme, with an investor's twist. "I know they put in a new Starbucks near here," Chavez said, referring to Phoenix Municipal Stadium, the Athletics' spring-training home. "Everybody was saying, 'Go buy stock in Starbucks.' " Since 1970, using amphetamines without a prescription has been a federal crime. Still, that never deterred certain players, who used them to fight fatigue and to sharpen their focus. One reason amphetamines are popular is because they arouse the central nervous system, making users feel more alert. Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a New York University medical professor who is a steroid expert, said amphetamines could cause heart attacks, hypertension, heat illness and convulsions. Wadler said amphetamines were particularly effective in fatigued people because they camouflage their discomfort and help their concentration. "Do they work?" Wadler said. "Yes, they work. Do they work differently than steroids? Yes, they work differently. But we're not talking about degrees of cheating. We're talking about cheating." Rather than seeking replacements for amphetamines, some baseball people have prescribed increased rest. "You can't be out in those bars with any regularity anymore because you ain't got help now," said Ron Washington, the third-base coach for the Athletics. Payton said, "Guys who are 25 are going to have to treat themselves like they're 35." Omar Vizquel, the Giants' shortstop, was adamant about his disdain for something others around him have apparently used. "I don't believe a simple drug or a simple pill can get you through 162 games," Vizquel said. "I never believe in stuff like that." It is impossible to know the percentage of major leaguers who were using amphetamines. Players and team executives speculated that anywhere from a few to more than half of the players on a given 25-man roster have been users. Phil Garner, the manager of the Houston Astros, said that he used greenies as a player and was disturbed by the side effects. Garner said he was irritable, experienced weight loss and slept unevenly. While the greenies sometimes worked, Garner said his body built up a tolerance, and he quit using them. "It becomes a psychological addiction," Garner said. "You think you can't play through it." How players will adapt without amphetamines is one of the more intriguing questions surrounding this season. Will there be a difference in the total games played by individual players? Will players be listless without a greenie boost? Will there be a drop-off in the quality of play? Frank Thomas, Oakland's designated hitter, said some players might drag in the steamy days of August and estimated that players who used to start 150 games might start 135. Jason Grimsley, a pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks, said it might be sensible to boost rosters to 30 from 25. Thomas was one of several players who said the teams with the most depth would benefit from a world without amphetamines world because players are going to need more games off. Glavine and Al Leiter, who recently retired from the Yankees, said they did not condone using greenies, but both gave lengthy discourses on why players reached for them: Players tried to combat difficult hours, handle the endless travel and make a weary body come to life. Grimsley said that greenies have "been part of the game" at least since Jim Bouton wrote about them in "Ball Four," his landmark book in 1970. Commissioner Bud Selig has said he first heard about greenies in the Milwaukee Braves' clubhouse in 1958. All these years later, he is adamant about eradicating them in baseball, citing the health risk. Others, like Grimsley, do not seem quite as concerned. "There are some things that don't need to be in the game, but there are things that have been in it for a long time," Grimsley said. "It's almost like they're trying to change everything about baseball. It's become sterilized." Or clean, which, Wadler stressed, is how it is supposed to be. "They are against the law," Wadler said. "Their use violates federal law. I've maintained they should have violated baseball law, too." Players have often had the choice of two types of coffee at the ballpark, one regular and one with stimulants. That will no longer be the case. Mickey Hatcher, the batting coach for the Los Angeles Angels, said he never noticed two variations of coffee while he played. "There were a couple of times where I was good and wired," Hatcher said, laughing. "I might have gotten the wrong coffee." Unlike steroid use, which carries a 50-game ban for the first offense and leads to a lifetime suspension for the third offense, amphetamine use is not being punished as severely. Every player will be tested at least twice for amphetamines during 2006. Players whose urine test includes evidence of amphetamines will face mandatory evaluation and follow-up testing after the first offense. The second positive test will lead to a 25-game suspension and the third will be 80 games. Selig will decide the penalty for a fourth offense. Chavez said he was happy that the Athletics have an espresso machine. Miguel Batista said some players on the Diamondbacks wondered if cola will be banished next. Leiter said that some players would keep searching for a boost and, since greenies are forbidden, they would choose the next best option. "Guys will always find something," Leiter said. "Even if they have to go to the local truck stop to get some No-Doz, they'll find something to get them through."

1431-> Leave Us Alone
Charles Fried is a bit of a political relic. Those who remember him from his days as solicitor general in the Reagan administration, where his tag-team partner was Attorney General Edwin Meese, may mistake him for a social conservative, an impression left by his repeated efforts to persuade the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade. But Fried, a professor of law at Harvard on and off since 1961, was never at home among the culture warriors and Moral Majoritarians of the New Right. His own passions were Goldwaterite and, even under Reagan, represented a fading remnant in the Republican Party. Two decades later, he remains what he’s always been: an erudite, sharp-tongued libertarian, eager to do battle with censors, regulators, social engineers and sanctimonious busybodies of every stripe. Most of Fried’s writings — a classic text on the theory of contract, a memoir of the Reagan revolution, a primer on constitutional law — have made the case in one way or another for his credo of laissez-faire individualism, and his new book is no exception. But “Modern Liberty” is more personal and idiosyncratic than his previous work, and deals only in passing with the sort of legal questions that have preoccupied him. Here Fried dons the robe of social philosopher, setting out first principles, considering rival views and venturing real-world applications. The result is a spirited, sophisticated manifesto, though one compromised at times by its academic excesses. His achievement is to show both the reach of his libertarian ideals and, in a spirit of self-scrutiny, their necessary limits. Born in 1935 in Prague, to a family displaced first by the Nazis and then by Communist rule, Fried developed his “hot blooded” devotion to liberty in America, where, more than any other place, a man could “live his own life as he thought best.” As an ideological outsider at Harvard, he bristled at his students’ Mao T-shirts and his colleagues’ casual, third-world-inflected Marxism. But over the years Fried also opened himself to other views. He found worthy interlocutors, thinkers “who value equality and community as I love liberty, who also want to make a decent, better world.” The book is dedicated to several of these philosophical friends, including (surprisingly) such famed liberal theorists as Ronald Dworkin and John Rawls. As Fried sees it, the free development of individuals, choosing and judging by their own lights, must “come first” as a social and political priority. Much as we might talk about other public goals — virtue, equality, national glory — they all amount in the end to mere metaphors, especially as compared with the “rock-bottom, indigestible fact” of our “lonely individuality.” To capture this idea of personal liberty, and to give it some normative force, Fried asks us to imagine ourselves surrounded by a protective “bubble” of rights, carefully negotiating the terms of every relationship and attachment. This, he writes, is the “moral space” we inhabit, and no one may “trespass upon it” without wronging us. The bulk of “Modern Liberty” is devoted to the practical consequences of these principles. Fried’s cases range widely. In chapters on sex and self-expression, he covers familiar libertarian ground, registering his objections to such things as compulsory recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, laws against prostitution and restrictions on biotechnology imposed by moral traditionalists, in whose arguments he detects “the chill breath of the Inquisition.” He also discusses more “plausible impositions” by the state, like Quebec’s ban on private insurance that covers services already provided by the public health system and Vermont’s effort to keep out Wal-Mart and other big-box retailers. Such policies, though not direct invasions of individual liberty, still rankle Fried. They are objectionable for the “enlistment” they demand of dissenters. Both involve, he writes, “the cramming of a way of life down people’s throats.” More interesting, because less predictable, is Fried’s discussion of property. In echoes of Rawls, the great philosophical advocate of welfare-style redistribution, he concedes that many people, for reasons largely beyond their control, lack the most basic material resources. “Humiliated” and “dependent,” they deserve public support, Fried believes, in the name of their unrealized individuality. In what qualifies as heresy at libertarian redoubts like the Cato Institute, Fried also insists that taxation and regulation are not “an insult to liberty on a level with thought control and invasion of the bedroom.” Indeed, because property stands apart from the sanctum of our bodies and minds, its preservation in any particular form, he argues, does not rise to the level of a “natural right.” Despite its modest length, “Modern Liberty” can be tough going. Only readers who have spent too much time in a seminar room will be pleased to encounter a sentence declaring, for instance, that the “many-dimensional contours of my bubble (not just space-time, but what we might call moral or liberty space) trace the extent of my rights.” Nor is the problem with such abstractions just stylistic. Fried tends to press his philosophical claims too far, especially in asserting the autonomy and self-sufficiency of the sovereign individual. His hyperrational Mr. Bubble is a theorist’s fiction. No one’s life really takes shape so antiseptically, without unchosen attachments and the habits of mind imprinted by family, friends and nation. This would seem confirmed by nothing so much as the autobiographical facts supplied by Fried himself. Fried’s most valuable contribution is to highlight the abiding tension between personal liberty and the “welfare administrative state.” Though he exaggerates in suggesting that policies like Quebec’s enforced egalitarianism in health care or Vermont’s small-town zoning preferences amount to full-blown regimes of oppression, “crammed down the throats” of dissenters, they are real infringements on individuals and cannot to be dismissed simply by invoking the will of the majority. Modern democracy, as Fried knows, inevitably involves a degree of paternalism; his hope is that we will choose its less intrusive forms, preserving options and, where possible, opportunities for escape. In education, this means voucher plans. More generally, it means trying to solve problems with money — that is, taxes and subsidies — rather than through endless regulation. Can the “spirit of liberty,” as Fried calls it, be reconciled with his Reagan-era advocacy against Roe v. Wade? It is a question that he dodges here, proudly noting that the book includes “not one word about abortion,” but he has addressed it before. Though an unabashed enthusiast for the right of privacy, Fried has found nothing in the Constitution that would deprive democratic institutions of their authority to decide the status of a fetus. His position on gay rights, which he does briefly discuss in these pages, is similar. Using the law to punish gay adults for the way they have sex is, he writes, an “obvious” and “cruel” violation of liberty, and should be struck down. But gay marriage? It is “a kind of civil blessing asked of the population as a whole,” an issue that should be decided by voters and legislators, not by a court of law. As Fried emphasizes, to his great credit, constitutional liberty in America is a matter not just of individual rights but of self-government too.

1432-> Book on Leprosy Settlement Draws Fire
HONOLULU, March 23 - A new book about a dark chapter in Hawaiian history, when thousands of people with leprosy were forced to live on a remote outcropping of the island of Molokai, has upset some former patients of the settlement and raised delicate questions about how much deference should be paid to them. "The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai," by John Tayman, has garnered critical praise. But complaints by former patients and people close to them about how the book treats their stories, as well as claims of inaccuracies and sensationalism, has led to a loose campaign to discredit the book by the former patients, some Hawaii historians and the state's lawmakers and governor. "The tacit understanding we have here in Hawaii is the former patients of Kalaupapa" -- the name for the settlement -- "are entitled to a higher degree of respect and privacy and deference than the rest of us," said Representative Ed Case, Democrat of Hawaii, who criticized the book's narrative style and what he called an "abbreviated, subjective treatment." Mr. Tayman, 44, of New York City, spent more than three years researching and writing "The Colony," his first book. He said he was surprised, and saddened, to see the support of the very people the book seeks to elevate disappear, but that the readers who experience the human triumphs within the settlement far outnumber the detractors. "I never saw it as a story that belonged to a specific culture, any more than I saw it as a Hawaiian story," Mr. Tayman said in an interview. "I just sort of saw it as an American story more than anything else, or a human story. I never really encountered that -- 'What's a mainlander doing here, telling this story?' -- until the book was published." The detractors have included three of the four former patients profiled in the book, including Olivia Breitha, 89, an author who still lives on the island, and who stopped cooperating with Mr. Tayman before the book was published. "My opinion of the book?" Mrs. Breitha said in a telephone interview. "It's unprintable. It's disgusting to me." On the mainland, Mr. Tayman is receiving enviable reviews, with many critics praising the very sensitivity his subjects say the book lacks. In a review in The New York Times Book Review on Jan. 22, Mary Roach wrote: "Tayman's narrative pulls the reader beyond the superficial, medical horrors of leprosy to the more devastating human horrors that lie beneath. In doing so, he has brought to light the profound dignity of his subjects." She continued: "Tayman's noble account makes you want to stand and applaud. It makes you want to walk up to these people and shake their hands." The opponents' complaints begin with the book's cover. The image of rough seas and a steep, imposing cliff beneath angry skies, is not of Hawaii at all, but rather depicts a section of the Amalfi Coast in Italy, according to the Web site of Corbis, the company credited, along with the photographer Todd Gipstein, on the jacket. "That flips people out who know anything about Kalaupapa," Representative Case said. Katie Monaghan, a publicist for Scribner, the book's publisher, said that the cover "was designed by Scribner with the author's input, and both Scribner and John Tayman believe the cover design works well for the book." The director of publicity, Suzanne L. Balaban, declined to discuss the cover further. Mr. Tayman said the art decisions were not his. "There were various covers that were under consideration," he said. "Some of them were illustrations and paintings, some were photographs. This is a representative cliff. I think it's an arresting and beautiful image." Anwei Law, 53, is a coordinator for IDEA (Integration, Dignity and Economic Advancement), an international advocacy organization for people who have had leprosy, or Hansen's disease, as it is also known. "He's missed the point," she said. "The cliffs of Molokai are very important to the people there. When things were bad, they would look at those cliffs and get strength from them. When you've changed that, you've missed something very significant. It's like, 'Oh, well, any cliffs will work.' " Mr. Tayman's opponents also take issue with the title, which they say reinforces stereotypes. " 'The Colony' is bull," Mrs. Breitha said. "It never was called the colony. It's always been called 'hospital' and 'settlement.' " Mr. Tayman said that was simply not true, that it had long been referred to as a colony. "The book always had as its working title, 'The Colony,' and the people I was dealing with on the book knew that," he said. In his notes section, Mr. Tayman recounts the split over those and other "editorial decisions connected with the book," and the withdrawal of Mrs. Breitha and another former patient, Makia Malo, from further participation. Others say the book leaves too much out. "A story as deep and complex and tragic and difficult as Kalaupapa is very hard to tell in a historical narrative at 300 pages," Representative Case said. "I would say even impossible to tell." Mr. Malo, 71, lost his vision and sensitivity of his hands and feet to leprosy. He is a professional storyteller who visits classrooms and attends national performances, discussing his life openly. He dropped that baggage "about us having the disease a long time ago," the large, jovial man said on Wednesday behind dark glasses, in an interview in a car on the way home from the airport after an event in Phoenix. "I shucked that burden of them knowing where I came from." In the interview, Mr. Malo spoke about his experiences at the settlement, but not about Mr. Tayman or "The Colony." Mr. Malo originally was interviewed at length by Mr. Tayman, but was so unhappy with the end result that he has refused to speak of the book or its author, and his physician has asked that it not be mentioned around him because of the stress, said his wife, Ann Malo. "He said, 'I'm so sad for John,' " she said, recalling Mr. Malo's reaction to the book, referring to the choices Mr. Tayman had made in writing "The Colony." Mrs. Malo said a scene in the book in which the young Makia witnesses the attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, was amplified in writing, with warplanes howling over his home neighborhood on the neighboring island of Oahu where there were none on the actual day. "There were no planes, none," she said. "That's rewriting history." Mr. Tayman said he had not been told of any errors since publication of "The Colony" in January. "If a legitimate error exists in the book, of course it will be corrected," he said in an e-mail message. Mrs. Law is working on her own book, which she described as an oral history of Kalaupapa. She has a running list of what she calls misspellings and wrong dates -- Mr. Tayman wrote in the book's notes section that some names and dates vary in historical documents -- and said the book should have been more sensitive to its subjects. "They let their opinions be known before publication of the book," Mrs. Law said. "As soon as they heard the title, they wanted out. If people tell you this is going to be a problem, do you listen? There has been a certain arrogance all along with this book." Mrs. Law is among those who say that the word leper is as offensive as a racial slur, and should almost never be used, not even in direct quotes, a stance Mr. Tayman has likened to revisionist history. He explains in his book that he uses the word in the context of the time he is writing about. Mrs. Law and others have said the 80 pages of notes on sources are insufficient, and that more detailed footnotes would have helped identify Mr. Tayman's sources for some of his narrative recreations of past events. Mr. Tayman, in the book, invites readers to e-mail him with questions about sources. Representative Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat from Hawaii, last year, like others in the Hawaiian congressional and Senate delegation, wrote to the publisher asking that complaints from his constituents be heard. "They are very, very sensitive to how they are portrayed," he said. "They feel a very strong and deep and abiding responsibility to all those who came before them, to make sure that whatever they say or do or however they appear, they represent completely the life of someone who has contracted leprosy. They are almost tribal." The last living patients are household names in Hawaii, and their wishes are not, as a rule, ignored. For evidence of this, one need only try to purchase "The Colony" in the bookstore at the settlement site itself, on Molokai, run by the National Park Service. It is not for sale. "We service the patients in Kalaupapa, and they're not happy with the book," said Edean Saito, the business manager for the stores run by the Arizona Memorial Museum Association at Pearl Harbor, including the Kalaupapa store. "So out of courtesy to them, I don't want to upset them."

1434-> Tripping Over Lobbyists at City Hall
NOW that the term limits question has returned because the City Council wants four more years, the focus is on method and whether the public should get to vote in another referendum or the Council should vote itself an extension. A good subject for debate. Here's another -- over substance, not method, and a nettlesome matter of unintended consequences. When term limits went into effect 12 years ago, critics made dire predictions that Council staff members would take over the city's legislature while lawmakers, relegated to the revolving door of term limits, would be turned into bystanders. That didn't happen. But something else did. The influence of players in another segment of the permanent government grew so great that they are riding high today: lobbyists. Their number and power have grown so noticeably that when Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn became speaker eight days ago, the Council chamber couldn't hold all the lobbyists who turned up. "It's problematic, something we need to be vigilant about, to make sure that the familiarity does not cross over the line," Ms. Quinn said in an interview. Unions and cultural and civic organizations that never turned to lobbyists before hire them routinely now, convinced they need help dealing with the Council. Lobbyists are nothing new in city government, but consider the recent numbers. In 2000, 148 lobbyists registered with the city and earned just over $14.5 million from clients, the city clerk's lobbying report shows. In 2004, 225 lobbyists registered with the city and earned $22.6 million. In 2000, lobbyists represented 728 clients, most of them large institutions, including unions, universities, theaters, churches, museums and real estate development companies. In 2004, lobbyists represented 1,195 clients, and they ranged from the familiar, larger institutions to small cultural and nonprofit groups, even small charities. Some say it's because of more competition for fewer city dollars. But there's clearly something else going on. "It's increasingly necessary because the people keep changing," said Peter H. Kostmayer, president of Citizens for NYC, a nonprofit organization that makes grants to community organizations for several programs. "We need a sherpa to show us around. Before, you got to know people, they stayed in the same roles. Now you get to know people and they change." Mr. Kostmayer hired James F. Capalino, a lobbyist and former Koch administration official who made sure Mr. Kostmayer attended the Quinn installation, and arranged for him to meet with lawmakers about one of his organization's initiatives -- helping New Yorkers determine their eligibility for earned income tax credits. The Council turnover, said Mr. Kostmayer, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, means that "you have to go in year after year to explain your program." THERE is another reason for the lobbyist explosion. In four years, 37 members of the Council will leave because of term limits, and 37 new members will come in. Lobbyists know more about city government than most newcomers do. "Say it's budget time. Millions for education has no meaning outside of the context of what did we do last year, what's happened with that money?" said Eric Lane, a Hofstra University law professor and adviser to Ms. Quinn's predecessor, Gifford Miller. "If you have all new people, who are new people going to ask?" They ask lobbyists, some of whom are fine folks who do fine work educating lawmakers. Some are not fine folks. But all have something in common. They serve their clients, not the public. And some play two roles -- as political consultants to council members and as lobbyists for clients with business before the Council. Proponents of modifying the term limits law note that lobbyists were not as prevalent 12 years ago and predict that they would lose some of their cachet if the limits were extended (from two four-year terms to three four-year terms). "When legislators serve long-term, you don't need to rely on lobbyists in the same way because you've developed expertise," said Councilman Bill de Blasio, who championed a term extension during his unsuccessful race for speaker. The argument is plausible but hasn't gotten much attention. One can hope it will. Otherwise, with so many lobbyists in and around City Hall these days, New York shouldn't be surprised if it finds itself some day with a local version of the Jack Abramoff problem, and who needs that?

1437-> For Shelton, Respectability Comes With Great Power
The bet would have been so unbelievable that no one would have listed odds on it. But what if someone had? Coming into the season, what would the odds have been that Chris Shelton of the Detroit Tigers would hit nine home runs before Barry Bonds would collect his first? Maybe it would have been 1,000 to 1 or 100,000 to 1. Obviously, it would have been the longest of long shots. Even after Shelton had done the unthinkable and been a far bigger power source than Bonds, the player with 709 homers, he would not guess what the odds of it happening might have been. "If you asked me that," Shelton said, "I would have told you that you were crazy." Shelton avoided speculating on how many zeros would have been in the odds by simply dismissing the comparison. He is uncomfortable being compared with any elite power hitters because he has only had one superb stretch, has played in only 153 major league games and does not think he is a home run hitter. Still, even after going 0 for his last 11, Shelton has been the closest thing to the Albert Pujols of the American League, with a .371 average, 9 home runs and 18 runs batted in. Shelton said that playing on a winning team was his primary goal this season, but that he also hoped to exceed the 18 home runs and 59 R.B.I. he managed last season. Those goals seem puny now. "Being noticed is fun," Shelton said in a telephone interview from Seattle, where the Tigers completed a three-game sweep yesterday. "But I try to make sure I remain grounded. I like to be pretty low key." The anonymity that Shelton had as a first baseman for the terrible Tigers last season has disappeared. That happened because Shelton went on a Bonds-like rampage by hitting 9 homers in his first 13 games this season, a pace surpassed by only Mike Schmidt, who drilled 11 in the first 13 games in 1976. Meanwhile, the Tigers, who were 71-91 last year, are off to a 12-7 start. Now Shelton receives the loudest ovations of any Tiger at Comerica Park. Now Shelton's hitting has forced Manager Jim Leyland to explain why Shelton is batting sixth. Now Shelton, who has not had a home run in six games, wonders how he sneaked into the same sentence as a Hall of Famer like Schmidt. "It's an honor to be mentioned with some of these guys and it's something I'll always cherish," Shelton said. "But, if you ask me if I deserve to be in there, I'd say no." There is a refreshing humility about Shelton, 25, who was not too cool to acknowledge that his confidence increased when Carlos Peña, another first baseman, was released last month. To Shelton, the decision to release Peña, a former first-round pick for the Texas Rangers, emphasized how strongly Detroit felt about him. With Peña gone, Shelton was no longer concerned about the possibility of losing at-bats or his job to Peña. The Tigers were committed to Shelton as their everyday first baseman. Shelton said that allowed him to relax and, clearly, it has allowed him to excel. "Unfortunately, Carlos got released, but that took a lot of pressure off me," Shelton, a 33rd-round draft choice in 2001, said. "It allowed me to go out play and have fun. It showed they had confidence in me." Shelton wound up with the Tigers only because the Pittsburgh Pirates lost confidence in him, or at least determined he could not help them. The Tigers picked Shelton in the 2003 Rule V minor league draft after the Pirates failed to protect him on their 40-man roster. It may be the best $50,000 investment the Tigers have ever made. What the Tigers saw in Shelton was a .332 average and 40 home runs in three minor league seasons and someone who they felt could become a decent defensive player. Dave Littlefield, the Pirates' general manager, has said he made a mistake and should have protected Shelton. "I don't want to say the Pirates gave up on me," Shelton said. "I don't think they did. I wasn't in their plans at the time. I just want to show them that they should have given me a chance. I did everything they asked." As Shelton analyzes himself, he sees several areas he needs to improve. He needs to decrease his strikeouts (20 in 70 at-bats), he wants to hit to the opposite field more frequently and he wants to be the kind of player a manager can write in the lineup card every day without blinking. Mostly, though, Shelton, who played catcher and first base with the Pirates, wants to become an exceptional first baseman. The Pirates seemed unsure where to play him. That contributed to their not protecting him, a development that still motivates Shelton. "I want to continue to improve defensively because it's something people said I can't do," he said. "It drives me to become a great player. I want to be known as a great player, not only a great hitter."

1440-> Riverton Seeks Historic Status
THE village of Riverton is seeking federal designation as a National Historic District at a time when it is facing the possible loss of the Hitchcock Chair Company, an important part of its history. The town historical society is working on an application for the National Parks Service that is focusing on about 20 buildings that are a short distance from two 19th-century buildings owned by Hitchcock, which was put up for sale in December, 180 years after its founding. Walter Landgraf, president of the Barkhamsted Historical Society, which is preparing the application, said that receiving district status should help attract visitors and could even help Hitchcock find a buyer. Riverton, a village in the town of Barkhamsted in Litchfield County, is where Lambert Hitchcock first made his stenciled chairs in 1814, said Douglas Roberts, a local historian. "He then went to Charleston, S.C., where he assembled the chairs and sold them," he said. Hitchcock established the chair company in Barkhamsted around 1825, and in 1827 the residents of the village asked the postal department to change the name of their post office from Barkhamsted to Hitchcocksville. The first Hitchcock Chair Company went out of business after fires destroyed two factory buildings in the mid-19th century. The village's name was changed to Riverton in 1865, not because the Hitchcock company was gone but because the postmaster discovered that mail meant for Hitchcocksville was mistakenly delivered to Hotchkissville, a part of Woodbury, and mail for Hotchkissville was going to Hitchcocksville, according to "Barkhamsted Heritage," a history of the town. The company was re-established in Riverton by John Kenney of Colebrook in 1946, and since 1989 it has been owned by a British company, the Faccenda Group. In December, Hitchcock announced that it was for sale, and in January the company said its retail outlets in Riverton, Glastonbury, Wilton and Orange would be closed. The fate of the two historic Hitchcock buildings in Riverton depends on the company's success in finding a buyer. Barbara Carpenter of the Kochen Group in West Hartford, the public relations firm for Hitchcock, said the company had received some interest from buyers. The historical society has set out to prove that the village is worthy of being designated a National Historic District. There are already 42 historic districts in Litchfield County, including the center of Pleasant Valley, Barkhamsted's other village, as well as the centers of Colebrook and Norfolk. Historic districts in the state range from villages like Collinsville in the town of Canton, to the site of the Bigelow-Hartford Carpet Mill in Enfield and the Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, the burial place for Samuel Colt, J. P. Morgan and Katharine Hepburn. Mr. Landgraf said the society received $2,200 from the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, $1,750 from the Farmington River Coordinating Committee, an environmental group, and $450 from Hitchcock to pay to research property records and photograph historic Riverton buildings for the application. The buildings include homes, the Hitchcock store and showroom, the Riverton General Store, the Riverton Inn, the Congregational Church and the former Union Episcopal Church, which was later a museum for Hitchcock antiques and is now a glass blower's studio. "Most of the buildings date from the 1830 to 1850 era when the chair company was operating," Mr. Landgraf said. Unlike National Landmark designations, there are no zoning or other structural or decorative restrictions on buildings in National Historic Districts, Mr. Landgraf said. He hopes to have the application approved by the fall.

1441-> Medusa Wears a Sweeter Smile
MUCH of our pop-culture diet depends on the cadre of characters who in their skimpy outfits populate the tabloids with their tireless bad behavior. What would a week be to Star readers without a Tara Reid wardrobe malfunction? In the case of Donatella Versace, her Bikini Atoll tan, ever-present cigarettes and Cousin Itt hair extensions have been awful, dependable and totally irresistible. She has been the walking id to the rest of humanity's superego. Last year Ms. Versace corralled her id a bit, seeking treatment (successfully) for a 10-year cocaine addiction. Now her recent runway collections have been lavishly praised by critics for their restraint, subtlety and use of earth tones. Ms. Versace has even said she was inspired by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Hey, I think it's great to select powerful female role models, but the German chancellor is, well, the German chancellor. Hardly someone you pick to inspire a clothing line. It all makes me wonder. Will Ms. Versace, who used to design short shorts in white patent leather, start driving a minivan? Revert to her natural skin color? To borrow a phrase from the rapper Mase, can Donatella Versace live La Vida without the Loca? Ms. Versace's newfound restraint has been passed on to the Versace stores, beginning with a reopening party last month at the New York flagship after a six-month renovation. I had stopped in the store once before in its previous incarnation, and there was an oppressive baroque feeling to it, a Medusa glowering at every turn. The Medusa herself is a heavy symbol; she was the mythic Gorgon sister once celebrated for her beauty, but her hair was transformed into serpents and her skin into scales after, according to some scholars, she was raped by Neptune. What a mascot. This five-story mansion is hardly a model of restraint but is now, literally, lighter; the windows, newly broadened and lengthened, reach a full story and a half. Most of the Medusas can now be found not in the interior of the store but on the clothes and accessories. The ceilings are painted a glossy white that ricochets light like a giant set of photographer's umbrellas. The interior decoration of the previous space was so overbearing that I wouldn't have noticed the building. Here the vaulted ceilings and gleaming Carrera marble surfaces suggest a home of tremendous wealth, formality and discipline. The Beaux Arts building was half of a pair known as "the Marble Twins," built for George W. Vanderbilt in 1904. The Versace building is a historical landmark; the other twin, next door, no longer survives. The sheer grandiosity of the space would suggest an equally forbidding staff, but the sales staff appears to have taken a handful of Friendly pills. Believe me, I tested the boundaries. I arrived with a friend who was wearing a velvet hat with a long tassel that flipped from side to side. It made her look, truth be told, like a Shriner. We were not the most chic pair of shoppers on Fifth Avenue that day. But the sales clerk could not have been nicer, seizing us as we walked in the front door and giving us a rundown of all the new accessories on the first floor. He was especially proud of the new Canyon purse, which is broad and eerily snoutlike. He cheerfully demonstrated how it opens up flat, so a woman can see everything in it at once. This makes very practical sense, but the purse is unwieldy. I hoisted it on my arm, and I felt like I was carrying a very expensive ($4,600 for the snakeskin version) toolbox. He was, of course, selling the purse to the wrong woman. I have a constitutional aversion to handbags that cost as much as the average Panamanian makes in a year. Call me crazy. Upstairs we found few signs of the much remarked-upon restraint; instead, there were racks of embellished jeans, evening gowns in aquas and corals with elaborate Greek-key straps, patterned hot pants paired with midriff-baring halter tops. There was evidence of some subtle design work, like a relatively simple black cocktail dress with a draped neckline and a crossed back. But if you can't bear the idea of wearing a gold disc bearing the head of Medusa right at your belly button, as part of the sash adornment, then even this sense of Versace subtlety is not for you. The home collection reminds me mostly of a college theatrical department. Where else could you buy what looks like a copy of Louis Quatorze parlor chair upholstered in metallic silver leather? A teapot and teacups bear gold wings instead of handles. At the back of the home collection, a row of hangers held unruffled swatches of flocked velvet. I could hardly imagine anyone arriving at this store with the notion of buying a sofa and picking out fabric. The Versace store focuses on selling its first-floor accessories, and so few shoppers venture upstairs. I found the men's collection utterly deserted, a pair of clerks dressing a gleaming black pantless mannequin, and a lonely-looking woman tending the hot pants. But the staff throughout the store is good-natured, as if Versace's director of human resources lowered a net into America's heartland and brought back a school of sweet-natured kids, ready to string up some lights and put on a show in the barn. Versace 647 Fifth Avenue (near 52nd Street); (212) 317-0224 ATMOSPHERE -- Hospital-ward bright. SERVICE -- Shockingly, unexpectedly pleasant. KEY LOOKS -- Hot pants for ladies; torso-hugging leather jackets for men; rhinestone-studded sunglasses. PRICES -- Expensive. Fringed leather tote bag, $4,327; metallic leather evening sandals, $995; abstract-print men's shirt, $1,415.

1442-> Stephanie Fleischman and Andrei Cherny
Stephanie Leigh Fleischman and Andrei Hugo Cherny were married last evening at the El Conquistador Golf and Tennis Resort in Tucson. Rabbi Thomas Louchheim officiated. The bride, 29, is a litigation associate in the Washington office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the New York law firm. She graduated from the University of California, San Diego, and received a law degree from the University of Southern California. She is the daughter of Shelley Fleischman and Lawrence Fleischman, both of Tucson. Her father, who retired as a Superior Court judge in Pima County, Ariz., is principal of the Fleischman law firm in Tucson. Her mother is a travel consultant at the Bon Voyage travel agency, also in Tucson. The bridegroom, 30, is an editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas, a quarterly journal of progressive thought that is to begin publishing in June. He graduated cum laude from Harvard and received a law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. At 21, the bridegroom was a senior speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore. He went on to be the 2000 Democratic platform director. He is the author of "The Next Deal: The Future of Public Life in the Information Age" (Basic Books, 2000). Mr. Cherny, who changed his name, is a son of Helena Cerny and Pavel Cerny of Valley Village, Calif. His mother, a psychologist in Los Angeles, is also the clinical director at the Dubnoff Center for Child Development in North Hollywood, Calif., which works with children with developmental, emotional or behavioral problems. His father is the president of the East European Film Office in North Hollywood, which serves as a link between Hollywood and the Czech film industry. Ms. Fleischman, working in Los Angeles as a legal intern for the 2000 Democratic National Convention, had reviewed Mr. Cherny's employment contract after he was hired to be the Democratic platform director, but had never met him. They did not meet until July 2001, at a political event for Steve Westly, who was then a candidate for California state controller, a post he later won. "We must have walked past each other 100 times in that big office and never met," Mr. Cherny said. "But from the moment I first met her, I had this feeling that she would be someone very special in my life." For Ms. Fleischman, the attraction was equally immediate. "He had an unbelievably warm smile," she recalled. "It felt like I already knew him." They were friends for months, and began dating in the spring of 2002. "When I began realizing how much Andrei had accomplished at such a young age, it really elevated my interest in him," Ms. Fleischman said. So much so that by June 2004, she left the job she held as a litigation associate for a Los Angeles law firm and relocated to Washington to be with him. Mr. Cherny had moved to Washington to work on Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign. For his part, Mr. Cherny said, "I feel a kind of comfort around her that I have never felt with anyone else." Six months later, they became engaged.

1445-> March Madness Comes Early to Italy
Turin, Italy - MARTIN GERBER woke up yesterday and didn't quite feel like the Swiss Jim Craig. He wasn't even the starting goalie as Switzerland, suddenly the Cinderella of the Olympic hockey tournament, qualified for the quarterfinals with a 2-2 tie against Germany, the day after Gerber shut out Canada, 2-0. He seemed embarrassed, more than humored, by the comparison to Craig, the goaltender of Lake Placid fame. There have been no miracles in Turin that Gerber knows of, not even consecutive victories by the Swiss over the powerful Czechs and the aforementioned Team Gretzky, which somehow went scoreless again last night, losing to Finland, 2-0. This tournament has, in February, developed the unmistakable air of March Madness. "We had a meeting this morning and talked about the situation, tried to keep from getting too emotional, especially having to play Germany, our biggest rival here," Gerber said. "Now we'll remind ourselves that we haven't done anything, only made the quarterfinal." No trifling development, mind you, for a country whose entire hockey medal history is a couple of bronzes (1928 and 1948) and whose best recent finish was eighth place in the 1988 Calgary Games -- before the soldiers of fortune from the National Hockey League were summoned in the ongoing pursuit of commercialization. Switzerland has three N.H.L. players --goalies Gerber (Carolina) and David Aebischer (Colorado) and defenseman Mark Streit of the Montreal Canadiens. Everyone else, except for one Swedish league player, earns in the vicinity of $200,000, tax free, in the top Swiss league. "Switzerland beating Canada, it can happen only on the perfect day," Gerber said, sounding like a coach of a small Division I team after a first-round N.C.A.A. takeout of Duke. With all the parity and "Vitale-lity" of the first week, all the woe in Canada today after those mind-blowing shutouts, let's be mindful that there will be no eliminations of consequence before the quarterfinals. Even the United States is sitting pretty on the bubble despite a second straight one-goal defeat last night, to Sweden, 2-1, and the real possibility of a 1-3-1 preliminary round. Before they play tomorrow night, the punchless Americans should pound their sticks against the boards in salute of the Russians for their 9-2 waylaying of Latvia. That practically guaranteed the United States' advancement into the quarterfinals on goal differential, at the expense of Latvia and Kazakhstan. Being an Atlantic Coast Conference power and surviving a regional with Wagner and Winthrop is nothing to brag about, but as the Americans' Mike Knuble put it, "Once we get into the quarterfinal, we could be a team to be reckoned with." Before that happens, they'll need to juice their offense, after failing to score on a couple of five-on-three chances last night and then, looking almost Princetonian, failing to take a shot for nearly 11 minutes to start the third period. The Americans have been playing spirited hockey, though. Why can't they dream, just like the Swiss, the Kent State of the Final Eight? "In the games against the Czechs and Canada, I don't think they took us for real," Streit said. "They underestimated us. No matter how good you are, you can't switch the button on in the middle of the game." Nor is it easy to padlock the N.H.L. season for a couple of weeks and expect what are essentially All-Star pickup teams to be, on command, even equal to the sum of their parts. By comparison, the N.B.A. Dream Teams that have gone to the Summer Olympics have had an eternity -- two or three weeks -- to prepare. Does that explain why the Gonzagas of this tournament, the most muscular midmajors like Finland and Slovakia, are the only remaining unbeaten and untied teams? They are also laden with professionals dispersed around the globe, many in North America. But their smaller pools of players grew up together in international competitions; they undoubtedly have a familiarity advantage when they reconnect, just like our Division I programs that don't automatically lose upperclassmen to the pros. In Switzerland's case, the ability to play nine pre-Olympic games -- albeit without Streit, its captain, and the two N.H.L. goalies -- has been apparent. "It makes a big difference," Streit said. "The ice surface over here is different, the referees are a little different, everything feels different and, you know, it's a tournament now where almost anything can happen." Isn't that the claim every year in the buildup to the N.C.A.A.'s, which are next up on the American Big Event calendar after the Olympics? Ultimate parity is a story line that works for the first week, anyway. "Right now it's some pretty weird results," the Swedish forward Jorgen Jonsson said. "It's fun." The provincial N.H.L. crowd -- never fully convinced that the Olympics is worth shutting down for -- can't be too amused, watching the league's signature teams and homegrown North American stars flummoxed this way, but that's the price of doing business abroad. Don't be alarmed, at least not yet. The first week here is only the Olympic equivalent of the N.H.L. regular season. Nobody of note misses the playoffs. The inevitable will prevail the way it does in the N.C.A.A. tournament, where the big boys hold court at the Final Four. North Carolina plays Illinois. One difference here. In international hockey, Gonzaga can go all the way. Sports of The Times E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

1446-> It's My Pension, And I Earned It
To the Editor: Re "Roadblock to Reform" (editorial, Dec. 17): The pensions of state workers are part of the social contract between the government and the people. It is not fair to renege on this obligation, especially when many New Jersey workers are making huge salaries. The fair way to fix the tax revenue shortfall is to raise the state income tax on those most able to pay. Public-sector workers are not the problem. Do not make them the scapegoat for legislators and governors who took the easy way in the past by under-funding the pension fund. I have been a teacher for 36 years and will retire this June. For most of my career, I have taught in a poor district with children who suffered all the ills that poverty can bestow. I have given all I could to make them successful. If I have not earned my pension, no one has. And yet, teachers and other public-sector workers are singled out to solve the fiscal problems of New Jersey. Is that fair? Reon Swaim Belford

1448-> Leaps and Combinations, to Mozart and Glass
American Ballet Theater’s fall season at City Center got under way with a gala on Wednesday. On Thursday the company settled down to business, business being the mixed bills of three or four ballets, mostly from the last century. The newest was the only world premiere of the season, Jorma Elo’s “Glow - Stop.” Mr. Elo is the resident choreographer at the Boston Ballet, which is run by a fellow Finn, Mikko Nissinen. His “Slice to Sharp” was the popular hit of last spring’s Diamond Project at the New York City Ballet, and from the standing ovation he received on Thursday, he has another hit. I liked “Slice to Sharp” for its kinetic energy and physical invention. City Ballet’s dancers clearly loved the combinations he gave them and responded with a nearly uninterrupted burst of energy. Some critics had their reservations, however, dismissing “Slice to Sharp” as trivial and vulgar. We’ll see what the consensus will be about “Glow - Stop.” This is a calmer ballet but still highly physical; it plumbs no depths. Mr. Elo may or may not be able to tell stories with movement, and his abstractions carry little emotional charge, but he does give the dancers danceable material. The 12 Ballet Theater dancers, dressed by Zack Brown in handsome, velvet-colored ballet attire, combined and recombined to the buoyant last movement of Mozart’s Symphony No. 28 and the appealing if protracted slow movement from Philip Glass’s “Tirol” Piano Concerto. The music was nicely played by the company’s string-shy orchestra, conducted by Ormsby Wilkins; Barbara Bilach was the uncredited pianist. Mr. Elo makes busy ballets; dreamy adagios are not his game. When the music was lively, he had the dancers running and spinning off kilter and leaping into lifts and pinwheeling their arms, and they pretty much did that to the slow music, too, but less insistently. It was pleasing to watch, and clearly fun to dance. The Ballet Theater dozen included some of its brighter stars — Julie Kent, Gillian Murphy, Marcelo Gomes and Herman Cornejo — yet they meshed together like a real ensemble. The middle portion of the program was a Twyla Tharp two-fer. Ms. Tharp is prominently featured by Ballet Theater this fall, and why not? On Thursday there were “Sinatra Suite” and “Known by Heart (‘Junk’) Duet.” “Sinatra Suite” had been on the gala bill with Mr. Cornejo and Sarah Lane. On Thursday this ballet-ballroom duet to five Sinatra recordings was danced by José Manuel Carreño and Luciana Paris, like Ms. Lane a member of the corps. Mr. Carreño was superb, especially in his big solo at the end to Sinatra’s indelible version of “One for My Baby (and One More for the Road).” The suite was made for Mikhail Baryshnikov and Elaine Kudo, and staged here by Ms. Kudo. Mr. Carreño hardly supplanted memories of Mr. Baryshnikov’s sexy, elegant ease, but he brought something strong, haunted and powerfully individual of his own. Ms. Paris was not so good, a little stiff and stolid, and the partnering looked tentative. After a short pause came the “Junk Duet,” so named because it is set to selections from a good-natured percussion piece by Donald Knaack called “Junk Music.” Here Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Beloserkovsky were delightful. This kind of repertory lets dancers transcend their normal roles in the classics, and these two evinced a kooky charm they could profitably exploit more often. The program ended with Kurt Jooss’s “Green Table.” This is a long-established classic, and the young David Hallberg’s incarnation of Death, new last year, is fast becoming a classic of its own. The rest of the performance was pretty good, too.

1449-> Bronx Teenager Beaten to Death Hoped to Be a Veterinarian
Relatives and friends of a Bronx teenager beaten to death Friday as he walked home from a store struggled yesterday to make sense of the attack, as the police said that a 15-year-old with whom he had had a continuing dispute was in custody. The teenager, Michael Steven Cancel, 17, was walking home shortly after 7 p.m. Friday after buying a carton of orange juice at a bodega at Intervale Avenue and East 163rd Street, in the Longwood section of the Bronx. An investigator said that a group of teenagers pulled up in a car, and one of them confronted Mr. Cancel. A fight broke out and the other teens in the car joined in, punching and kicking Mr. Cancel before fleeing, the authorities said. Mr. Cancel collapsed outside a bakery a few doors from the store, about a block from his home. He was pronounced dead at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center. His mother, Lydia Garcia, 39, ran to the scene and fainted. The police said that they had made no arrests, and the motive remained unclear yesterday. Still, they said, a teenager who had a dispute with Mr. Cancel was in custody, though he had not been charged. Mr. Cancel was a senior at Christopher Columbus High School. Family members and friends said his fondness for animals -- particularly his dog, Patches, a pit bull and Dalmatian mix -- inspired him to want to become a veterinarian. "That kid, he didn't do nothing wrong," said Raheem Simon, 16, a friend. "He wasn't living the fast life." Mr. Cancel's father, Michael, of Springfield, Mass., said that he spoke regularly on the phone with his son, and that his son never mentioned being in any danger at school or in the neighborhood. "I'm a shy guy, I'm a quiet guy," said the father, who arrived in New York yesterday afternoon. "I always do my thing." Referring to his son, he said: "He was like that." He said Mr. Cancel is of Puerto Rican heritage, and the family is considering burying his body in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico.

1450-> ‘For Sale’ Sign on Complex Complicates Housing Policy
With rising housing costs squeezing middle-class New Yorkers and with the Bloomberg administration struggling to slow the loss of homes that people like teachers and nurses can afford, the news that Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village could be sold and turned eventually into luxury apartments illustrates vividly the uphill battle the administration and the city are facing. Nearly three-quarters of the 11,200 apartments in the two complexes, which Metropolitan Life is offering for sale, currently fall under the state’s rent regulation system and rent for as little as half the open-market rate. But a new owner who pays the $4 billion to $5 billion that MetLife is said to want may have a powerful financial incentive to try to remove many or most of those units from the rent regulation system. While state law would prevent a new owner from charging market-rate rents to existing residents as long as they remain in their current apartments, an owner could in many cases have the unit deregulated when the current tenants die or move. Over the next decade or so, the best-known bastion of middle-class housing in Manhattan could become largely unaffordable to the middle class. “We’re losing more at one end than we’re gaining in affordable housing at the other end through the mayor’s plan,” said Victor Bach, a senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society, an organization that studies and tries to alleviate poverty in the city. “This just tips the balance even worse. It’s more difficult to make the argument that the efforts of the city in affordable housing, which deserve a lot of praise, are going to compensate for the market losses that occur through sales.” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has vowed to create and preserve 165,000 units of low- and moderate-income housing by 2013; administration officials say they have produced more than 17,000 units in the last fiscal year alone. But housing experts say thousands of other moderately priced apartments are disappearing from the rent regulation system and from state and city subsidy programs that had kept rents low. The administration has worked to preserve low-priced apartments in older buildings whose owners received government subsidies in return for keeping rents low under programs like the state’s Mitchell-Lama program. The administration has offered owners incentives to remain in those programs, with some success. But it has less leverage in a strictly private sale like that of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village. The city and state are not, however, powerless. City officials said they would be willing to work with any buyers who are interested in keeping Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village affordable to the middle class, and could offer incentives. For example, they might help a buyer with getting financing for a co-op conversion plan under which current tenants at certain income levels could buy their apartments at a reduced price. Emily A. Youssouf, president of the city’s Housing Development Corporation, which encourages private investment in low- and moderately priced housing through things like low-interest mortgages and the issuance of bonds, said her agency could, for example, use its reserves to make a loan to a buyer that would enable them in turn to offer the apartments to current residents at prices they could afford. “From the seller’s perspective, they can get the same price,” Ms. Youssouf said. “As long as they can make as much money, I think that’s probably their primary concern. Remember, MetLife built these properties with help from the city. Do they have any obligation to do something like this? I think the answer is no. But as long as they can still make a good return on it, why would they not want to do it?” Two years ago, the city helped persuade the owner of West Village Houses, a 420-unit apartment complex that had become eligible to leave the Mitchell-Lama program and begin charging market-rate rents, to convert the complex to a co-op and sell the apartments to the tenants at a discount rate. As part of the agreement, the administration agreed to forgive $19 million of interest accrued on a city mortgage loan and to recommend a tax exemption for 12 years. Earlier this year, the tenants of two large working-class apartment complexes, Lafayette-Morrison and Lafayette-Boynton, near Soundview Park in the Bronx, said they had arranged for a group of real estate investors to buy the buildings and sell the units to tenants. In that case, the city extended the existing real estate tax abatement on the buildings to help make the deal possible and keep the price of the units low. In another case, the city helped arrange tax breaks and other incentives that enabled CPC Resources Inc., which develops moderately priced housing, to buy Parkchester, a 12,000-unit apartment complex in the Bronx also built by MetLife. “Clearly, the potential sale of Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village is of significant concern to the administration and the mayor and we would very much want to work with any potential buyer to preserve affordable housing in these properties,” Shaun Donovan, commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said yesterday.

1451-> 'Krrish' Tells the Further Adventures of a Bollywood Superhero
The outlandish yet hugely endearing "Koi ... Mil Gaya" (2003) introduced Rohit, a learning-disabled young man given superhuman powers by a friendly alien summoned to earth by his father. In "Krrish," a rare Bollywood sequel, those powers — and the spotlight — are passed on to Rohit's beefy son Krishna (played by Hrithik Roshan; his father, Rakesh, directed), in even larger doses. Krishna can outrun wild horses and glide across water and treetops, but his talents are being squandered while living in isolation with his overly protective grandmother. The film shifts gears from carefree romance to superhero extravaganza, crammed with show-stopping fight sequences choreographed by Ching Siu-Tung ("Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers"). This happens shortly after Krishna is lured to Singapore by a conniving career woman, Priya (Priyanka Chopra). She is a thoroughly undeserving and insipid love interest and, of course, the last to figure out that Krishna is doubling for Krrish, the masked man of mystery who saves the lives of children and eventually comes face to face with the archvillain Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah). He is a major figure in Rohit's life, and his appearance brings the story full circle, with a little sci-fi throwback to its predecessor. "Krrish" is overlong, schmaltzy, wholly derivative and sprinkled with underwhelming song-and-dance numbers. Coming from anywhere else, these elements might be considered glaring flaws. In Bollywood they are not only expected, but often, as in this film, they also appear as virtues. Produced and directed by Rakesh Roshan; written (in Hindi, with English subtitles) by Robin Bhatt, Sachin Bhowmick, Honey Irani, Mr. Roshan and Akash Khurana, based on a story by Mr. Roshan; director of photography, Santosh Thundiyil; edited by Amitabh Shukla; music by Mr. Roshan, with lyrics by Ibrahim Ashq, Nasir Faraaz and Vijay Akela; dance choreography by Farah Khan; action choreographer, Ching Siu-Tung; art director, Samir Chanda; released by AdLabs. Running time: 154 minutes. This film is not rated. WITH: Hrithik Roshan (Krishna Mehra/Krrish), Priyanka Chopra (Priya), Rekha (Sonia Mehra), Naseeruddin Shah (Dr. Siddhant Arya), Manini De (Honey) and Archana Puran Singh (Boss).

1452-> Reporter Freed From Captivity in Iraq Speaks to Colleagues
BOSTON, April 3 - Jill Carroll, a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor who was held hostage for 82 days in Iraq, visited the paper's newsroom on Monday, addressing colleagues in what the paper's Washington editor called "an emotional lovefest." "I just want to say how much I'm overwhelmed by how wonderful the paper has been to my family," Ms. Carroll, 28, said through tears to clapping colleagues. The Monitor posted a video of her address on its Web site. Ms. Carroll, a freelance writer whom the paper made an employee a week after she was abducted, said she was touched by the paper's efforts to free her and to help her family and the family of her translator, Allan Enwiya, who was killed during her kidnapping. "I discovered it's like a humanitarian organization," said Ms. Carroll, who smiled through much of her short statement as her family looked on. "It's overwhelming. The work that went into this and the trouble that everyone went to for me, a lowly freelancer. I mean, who am I?" In a statement, Richard Bergenheim, editor of The Monitor, said the United States government made an "extensive" effort to secure Ms. Carroll's release, something the paper did not reveal for fear it would endanger the endeavor. "U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad in Iraq and all the services of the United States that come under the embassy's umbrella worked on Jill's case with a passion," Mr. Bergenheim said. He also thanked the F.B.I., which has a "special responsibility" for American citizens in danger, and the military for its "compassionate" care of Ms. Carroll after her release. A law enforcement official said the American hostage working group in Baghdad assisted with Ms. Carroll's case but would not give specifics of what it did for fear of jeopardizing future hostage cases. David Cook, the paper's Washington editor, said the paper had also worked to free Ms. Carroll. "We tried to contact every possible branch of our government, and we also contacted governments overseas. It's a fascinating and complex story," Mr. Cook said, adding that it would come out in the pages of The Monitor. "I'm not commenting about who was contacted." Ms. Carroll was abducted Jan. 7 in western Baghdad as she left the offices of a Sunni politician. Mr. Enwiya was killed, and Ms. Carroll's driver escaped. The group that abducted her called itself the Revenge Brigades and demanded that all Iraqi female prisoners be freed. Ms. Carroll was released Thursday, and she returned to the United States on Sunday. Mr. Cook said the paper did not know what brought about her release. Ms. Carroll has been staying at an undisclosed location in the Boston area with her parents and twin sister. Mr. Cook, who along with Mr. Bergenheim accompanied Ms. Carroll from the airport to the reunion with her family, said the moment they met was "indescribable." The Monitor released video of Ms. Carroll's reunion with her family on Sunday. While hugging her mother and sister, Ms. Carroll briefly wept and said, "I'm sorry." "We are so proud of you," said her sister, Katie. Her mother, Mary Beth, said, "I knew you would never give up."

1453-> Mayor Tries to Pressure Albany on School Aid
In another salvo in the city's simmering dispute with Albany over education financing, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has dispatched a host of city officials and political supporters, from Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein to former Mayor Edward I. Koch, to urge community boards around the city to lobby Albany for increases in school-construction aid. Mr. Bloomberg said last month that 21 school-construction projects would be scrapped if the state did not provide $1.8 billion in additional aid. Mayoral aides have suggested that Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, would consider lending support to Democrats trying to trim the slim Republican majority in the State Senate if that aid is not forthcoming. Yesterday, Senate Republicans from the city were promoting a plan to break the impasse, acting after Mr. Bloomberg met with the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, on Thursday to discuss the issue. "We're going to fight for what's right for this city," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday. "And as a separate thing, I personally am going to support those people who help this city, and I've said that for a long time." The mayor's decision to send representatives to community boards where the 21 school projects are located is unusual because the 59 boards are not considered bastions of political activism. Their members -- unpaid volunteers appointed by the borough presidents -- advise the city on zoning, planning and land use, as well as the city budget and the coordination of municipal services. Stu Loeser, the mayor's press secretary, said the effort was intended "to get the most effective neighborhood leaders to hold Albany's feet to the fire at home." Guillermo Linares, the commissioner of immigrant affairs, is scheduled to visit Community Board 4 in Queens today.

1454-> BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK; Matsui Slides Out Of the Mix For Now
The Mets spent the better part of the off-season formulating ways to upgrade at second base, and only after failing did they, begrudgingly, offer a full endorsement of Kazuo Matsui. It was, Mets officials repeated, Matsui's job to lose. And now he has lost it, all because of -- surprise -- another freakish injury. A magnetic resonance imaging exam taken yesterday confirmed that Matsui sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee while sliding awkwardly into second base in the first inning of Thursday's game against the Atlanta Braves. He cannot participate in baseball-related activity for at least three weeks and then will probably need another week of fielding and batting practice before being available. The injury should not require surgery, Manager Willie Randolph said. "It's disappointing on my part," Matsui said. "I feel like I'm letting my teammates and the team down, but there isn't much I can do except concentrate on getting back on the field as soon as I can." Matsui, who was walking around the clubhouse yesterday afternoon without a brace or a limp, said through an interpreter that he was surprised he will miss that much time. The best-case scenario is that he will be able to return to the lineup in mid-April. But by that time, the job may not be available anymore. Randolph says he plans to rotate Anderson Hernandez, Jeff Keppinger, Jose Valentin and Chris Woodward, but Hernandez is clearly the favorite. Because of their versatility, Valentin and Woodward are far more useful as utility players, and Keppinger, who hit a bases-loaded triple in last night's 7-7 tie against the Dodgers in Vero Beach, Fla., will receive an opportunity, but he is not part of the Mets' long-term plans. That distinction belongs to Hernandez, a 23-year-old converted shortstop who is demonstrating that his hitting is catching up to his reputation as an outstanding defender. Hernandez returned last night from the Dominican Republic, where he was mourning the death of his grandmother, and will probably play in a split-squad game today. Hernandez has played mostly shortstop this spring because of the absence of José Reyes, who is playing for the Dominican Republic in the World Baseball Classic. Since joining the Mets, Matsui, who played 1,143 consecutive games in Japan, has missed 123 games.

1455-> Anne Roche and Brooks Watson
Anne Roche, a daughter of Nancy and George A. Roche of Baltimore, was married at her parents' house last evening to Brooks Alexander Watson, the son of Eileen Azzinaro of Huntington, N.Y., and Raymond Watson of Middle Village, Queens. The Rev. Thomas Mulcrone, a Roman Catholic priest and a chaplain of the Chicago Fire Department, officiated. The bride, 31, will continue to use her name professionally. She is an actress who has appeared in television commercials and onstage in Chicago, most recently in April in "Stick Fly" at the Congo Square Theater Company. She graduated from Northwestern. The bride's father is the chairman and president of the T. Rowe Price Group, the investment management firm in Baltimore. He is on the board of the Greater Baltimore Committee and the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore, nonprofit civic organizations. Her mother is on the board of Centerstage, a theater company in Baltimore. The bridegroom, 33, is a firefighter in Truck Company 44 in Chicago. Until February he was the director of administrative services of the Fire Rescue Development Program, a nonprofit organization, now based in Rome, which helps firefighters in developing countries and places affected by war. Mr. Watson was previously its executive director. He is studying for a bachelor's degree at Southern Illinois University. His mother, who is retired, was a national account service manager in White Plains at Lucent Technologies. His father oversees fire and other safety matters at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn. The bridegroom is the stepson of Gerald Azzinaro.

1456-> Students on the Spectrum
VALERIE KAPLAN has an aptitude for math, and scored a perfect 1600 on her SAT. When her high school classmates applauded the announcement at lunch, she was pleased. But less obvious signals — a raised eyebrow or impatient glance at a watch — elude her. In an advanced course at Carnegie Mellon called “Building Virtual Worlds,” that problem caused classmates to sideline her in group projects. And during a critical meeting to win approval for her customized major, electronic art, she intently circled the freckles on her arm with a marker. Miss Kaplan’s behavioral quirks are agonizingly familiar to students with an autism spectrum disorder. Simply put, their brains are wired differently. Children with classic autism have language delays or deficits and difficulty relating to others; they display rigid, often obsessive behaviors; deviation from routine disturbs them. Some are mentally retarded. Those with milder conditions on the spectrum — Asperger’s is one of them — exhibit some or all of these characteristics to lesser degrees. But Asperger’s is also distinguished by average or aboveaverage intelligence, an early acuity with language and singular passions — Miss Kaplan, for example, has absorbed every detail of an animated 90’s television series called “ReBoot.” People like Miss Kaplan have a disability, but to others they can seem merely gifted, or difficult, or odd. Of course, high-functioning people on the spectrum have long attended college. Tony Attwood , a psychologist and author of “The Complete Guide to Asperger’s Syndrome,” tells of trying to spot the professor with Asperger’s when he’s on the lecture circuit. That is, unless Dr. Attwood is at an engineering school, in which case he tries to spot the professors who don’t have Asperger’s. A top expert estimates that one in every 150 children has some level of spectrum disorder, a proportion believed to be rising steeply. With earlier and better intervention, more of these children are considering college, and parents, who have advanced them through each grade with intensive therapies and unrelenting advocacy, are clamoring for the support services to make that possible. Finding suitable colleges for such students was a topic at the national conference of the National Association for College Admission Counseling in October. Last March, 89 college administrators from across the country gathered to learn about support strategies at a conference sponsored by the University of Connecticut School of Law and the Yale Child Study Center. The director of the center, Dr. Fred Volkmar, helped define autism and Asperger’s for the American Psychiatric Association in the early 90’s. “Twenty- five years ago,” he says, “I would have been stunned to learn that I was going to put together a conference on col leges for these kids. Twenty-five years ago, the stereotype view was that they were not very bright and not college material.” His conference is further evidence of changes already rippling across campuses as colleges scramble to figure out how to accommodate this new, growing population of disabled students. Community colleges are particularly unsettled. Scores of students are turning up, hesitant about their ability to handle four years of college. “Colleges call us all the time in a panic, and the calls are increasing,” says Lorraine E. Wolf, clinical director of disability services at Boston University and a consultant on the topic. “One college had 20 students coming. It was a technical college in New Mexico.” Unable to navigate social intricacies, many such students once decided to forego college; or, isolated and depressed, they left before graduating. They bring a host of tricky issues to classrooms, dorms and the dating scene. “I can’t emphasize how difficult college is for these kids,” says Dania Jekel , executive director of the Asperger’s Association of New England. “Many are going to college and they really aren’t ready. We’ve had cases where a parent hasn’t known for an entire semester that the kid hasn’t attended class and is flunking every class.” Ms. Jekel worries about exposing inherently naïve students, who are as sexual as the next college student, to the complexities of dating. Women on the spectrum are especially vulnerable sexually and emotionally, since they have problems deciphering intentions. Men are at risk, too, misreading clear signals of rejection (“I’m busy”); instead, they might pursue a romance until a confrontation results. Some assume conventional learning-disability programs will do for such students. But that’s a mistake, experts say. Students on the spectrum need help chopping course loads into manageable bites. They need to learn how to act appropriately in class — correcting professors or asking too many questions are common gaffes. They also need support with ticklish social issues like roommates who complain they are too messy or who lock them out when a date stays overnight. “That’s a little bit different from what administrators normally do,” says Richard Allegra , director of professional development for the Association on Higher Education and Disability. “If a blind student needs books in Braille, they know how to do that.” Most advisers just don’t have the training or the time to shepherd students with cognitive disabilities. One student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tells of being assigned, because of a family connection, to a freshman adviser whose son had Asperger’s. “He met with me weekly,” says the student, Richard, who describes his Asperger’s as mild and asked that his last name be omitted for fear of being stigmatized. “It helped keep me on track,” he says. “He would just light a fire under you once in a while.” Sophomore year he had a different adviser, one who was not personally invested. Meetings dwindled to monthly or less. Richard’s grades dropped as he stayed up late into the night roaming the Internet and procrastinating. “I was just not getting the work done,” he says. Colleges are devising programs that try to integrate students on the spectrum into the academic and social fabric of the campus. The Essex campus of the Community College of Baltimore County, in a joint program with a state agency and a local school, has hired a special-education teacher to help students organize their time and assignments and improve the skills that are second nature to most, like how much space goes between two people in a conversation or how to make gentle eye contact. At Keene State College, in New Hampshire, fellow students act as “social navigators.” Their assignment: change their charges’ “outsider” status by introducing them to their friends. The mentors get $10 an hour (and sometimes course credit in psychology) by helping students on the spectrum make small talk, date and get consent at every level of romantic advancement. For example, says Larry Welkowitz , who helped create the program: “Would it be O.K. if I asked you out on a date?” “Would it be O.K. if I kissed you?” Some 50 undergraduates have participated in the program, which Professor Welkowitz calls “the single best intervention _ I just know it because of how I have seen their lives change.” In turn, he says, the mentors develop new understanding. “We’re learning about ourselves,” Professor Welkowitz says. “A lot of us have a dash of autism.” At Marshall University, the West Virginia Autism Training Center operates a program in which graduate students work daily with students with Asperger’s, reviewing assignments, helping with time management and teaching classroom etiquette. They take the students on field trips to Wal-Mart, to restaurants and to the movie theater to let them practice social skills. Bottom line for parents: $6,200 a year. Colleges are legally required to ensure equal opportunity for academically qualified students. Accepted adjustments include note-takers, extra time for tests (often in distraction-free settings), and single dorm rooms for students for whom normal noise or the flicker of a fluorescent light amounts to sensory overload. Social skills training, however, is assistance of a personal nature. “It’s very much parallel to what we’ve seen happen with attention deficit disorder and some learning disabilities,” says Ruth Bork , dean of the Disability Resource Center at Northeastern University in Boston. “It’s above and beyond what’s considered to be appropriate support at the college level.” Complicating the situation is a scarcity of data on best practices in a college environment. Jane Thierfeld Brown , director of student support services at the University of Connecticut School of Law, is helping to create a pilot program for the University of Minnesota and Boston University that will assess its own success rate. “Once we can prove the program increases the students’ graduation and retention rates,” she says, “it can be replicated at other colleges.” Lisa King , a disability specialist with the Minnesota program, is working now with eight students. She recalls one who was so unnerved by the crowds of strangers at the dining halls that he subsisted largely on junk food from vending machines. Though hungry and sick of chips and pop, he didn’t change his behavior. Eventually his mother called Mrs. King, who walked the boy through a series of trips to the university food court. The first foray was over spring break. “There was not a lot of activity and it felt nice,” he says now. “It was good to eat an actual good meal.” Successful trips followed during busier times. He also got help figuring out the bus route from home and around campus. “It was a matter of knowing where it stops and how often it comes,” he says. “Now I do it myself. It makes me feel independent. All I need is a run-through.” Mrs. King sees these interventions as “the minimum that we can do” for academically qualified students. Musing, she takes it a step further: “We would provide an interpreter to a hard-of-hearing person. Why don’t we provide an interpreter for somebody with Asperger’s?” And that’s not far from what some parents are seeking. One mother wanted her son to have 24/7 access to all staff and faculty, says Barbara Roberts, manager of M.I.T.’s disability services; the request was denied. Families of more capable students hire coaches — psychologists, speech therapists, specialed teachers and graduate students — for fees ranging from $30 to $100 an hour. Because of her mother’s perseverance, Miss Kaplan spent her last two years at Carnegie Mellon living near campus with a coach, who helped her organize her work, buy groceries, keep her room clean. “It was the answer to a prayer,” says her mother, Jan Kaplan, who watched her daughter flounder during sophomore year, trying to pick a major. Miss Kaplan eventually came home for a year. Testing led to a diagnosis of Asperger’s. The coach, Carolyn K. Hare, a former special-education teacher for autistic students, went on to create Aheadd (Achieving in Higher Education With Autism/ Developmental Disabilities), which provides services at the University of Pittsburgh and, beginning in the spring, at George Mason in Arlington, Va. This fall at Carnegie Mellon, Ms. Hare is working with seven students. Aheadd charges $7,000 a year, with some need-based scholarships available through Carnegie Mellon. “The Asperger’s population is much bigger than we think it is,” according to Larry Powell, manager of disability services at Carnegie Mellon. “But students aren’t disclosing that. It’s kind of like, if you build it they will come. If we could put together systems that would adequately support these students, word would get around and more students would disclose it and would come. One of my issues is that I am an office of one with 264 students.” Miss Kaplan graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2005. Her experience with “Building Virtual Worlds” led her to a new strategy for social interactions. Randy Pausch, the course’s teacher, noticed what Miss Kaplan did not: that her classmates were working around her instead of with her on group assignments. When he found out why, he encouraged her to explain her cognitive difficulties to her teammates and ask them to be direct about what they wanted her to do. Dr. Pausch says the results were beneficial not just to Miss Kaplan but to the others. “They found a way to work with someone who opened up to them about something that was very embarrassing,” he says. “Once she puts that on the table, what else can anyone feel embarrassed about having to divulge?” Now managing a Games Unlimited store in Pittsburgh, Miss Kaplan still uses his method. “Tell me flat out if I need to do something different,” she says to her supervisor. Her career goal is to make video games or work for DreamWorks (but only after “Shrek 3” is released — she wants to be surprised). Though no longer a student, Miss Kaplan belongs to a student organization called the K.G.B., a swipe at the Cold War secret police. The acronym does not, she says, stand for “Keep Geeks Busy.” An on-campus variation of capture the flag is one of its signature activities. Surrounded by a self-described “eccentric bunch of nerds, geeks, freaks, visionaries, outcasts,” Miss Kaplan says, she feels perfectly comfortable.

1457-> Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: Group Charged In Violent Robberies
The authorities yesterday announced the arrest of 14 people who they say are responsible for a six-month spate of violent push-in robberies and kidnappings across the city last year. The ring, which called itself the Untouchables, largely went after drug dealers but often mistakenly robbed households with no involvement in the drug trade, investigators said. Bridget G. Brennan, the New York special prosecutor, said the group often gained access to apartments by using one member, a middle-aged woman posing as a kindly neighbor, to knock on the victim's door.

1460-> Foxwoods Teams Up With MGM
THE $700 million hotel and casino being built on the Foxwoods property in Ledyard will carry the name MGM Grand, under an agreement announced Tuesday by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and MGM Mirage Inc. As part of the deal, MGM Mirage will act as a consultant on what type of attractions will be included in the new hotel and casino, such as restaurants and nightclubs. But the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation will be the sole owner and operator. "MGM has excellent affiliations with celebrity chefs and nightclub operators," said Robert J. DeSalvio, the executive vice president for marketing for Foxwoods Resort and Casino. "They also have excellent contacts in the meeting and convention business. If we can also become affiliated with some of those people, we can bring a new level of excitement to the property." The 825-room hotel and the 50,000-square-foot casino is scheduled to open in the spring of 2008. The companies also said they planned to become partners in new projects outside of the state in places like Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Mississippi, and would share customer databases for marketing purposes. "MGM Mirage has an extensive database of over 20 million names that they have collected through their 23 properties across the country," Mr. DeSalvio said. "We also have millions of names in ours. There will be great cross-marketing opportunities." Neither company would release the financial terms of the agreement or how long it was for. Richard Blumenthal, the state attorney general, said that the deal needed to be closely scrutinized. On Wednesday, Mr. Blumenthal said that he sent letters to the companies requesting more information. "It potentially means a new era in tribal gaming, a new and different kind of relationship," he said. "We need to know the details to be sure what it is. We need to know what MGM will be doing." Mr. Blumenthal said that MGM Mirage would have to be approved by federal and state authorities to operate a gaming facility or assist in operating one. Mr. DeSalvio said that the agreement did not have an impact on the gaming compact between the tribe and the state. "Foxwoods will continue to operate and own all of the facilities on the reservation, and is in total control of all the gaming operations here," he said. "We don't feel there are any issues."

1461-> Richard Kuklinski, 70, a Killer of Many People and Many Ways, Dies
Richard Kuklinski, whose lust for publicity nearly matched the blood lust he displayed in claiming to have killed more than 100 people as a Mafia hit man, died on Sunday in the prison wing of St. Francis Hospital in Trenton. He was 70. In announcing his death to The Associated Press, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of Corrections, Deirdre Fedkenheuer, did not disclose the cause or the reason he was hospitalized. Mr. Kuklinski promoted his own notoriety by appearing in two HBO documentaries as well as meeting with writers, psychiatrists and criminologists. He became known as the Iceman because he sometimes froze corpses to disguise the time of death. He often listed the many ways he killed: firearms, including a miniature derringer; ice picks; hand grenades; crossbows; chain saws; and a bomb attached to a remote-control toy car. His favorite weapon, he said, was cyanide solution administered with a nasal-spray bottle in the victim's face. Sometimes Mr. Kuklinski -- a 6-foot-5, 300-pound, tattooed, bearded man -- took his public act a step too far and told specious stories, like the dramatic role he claimed in the killing of the Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa. The authorities also impugned his claim of storing a corpse in the freezer of a Mister Softee truck for two years. But enough of the truth emerged in a New Jersey courtroom in 1988 to convict him of five murders, for which he was serving consecutive life sentences. In 2003, his guilty plea in the 1980 slaying of Peter Calabro, a New York City police detective, added a meaningless 30 years: he was already ineligible for parole until the age of 110. Mr. Kuklinski disclosed the killing of Detective Calabro on the second HBO documentary on his life, in 2001. In the first documentary, in 1992, he said he had killed up to 100 people. In an interview for "The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer" (1993) written by Anthony Bruno, he said he had killed Roy DeMeo, a particularly murderous member of the Gambino crime family, but Jerry Capeci, a well-known authority on the Mafia who has written extensively about it, doubted this. Richard Kuklinski was born on April 11, 1935, in Jersey City. He killed neighborhood cats as a youth and said he committed his first murder at 14, after which, he said, he felt "empowered." He was an altar boy and dropped out of school in eighth grade. His crime career began after he took a job at a film lab and sold pornographic movies to the Gambinos. He longed to translate his love of killing into a living, he said, but Mafia kingpins, suspicious of his zeal, first limited him to lesser crimes. He married his wife, Barbara, in 1961. They lived a suburban, relatively affluent life of backyard barbecuing in Dumont, N.J. In the second documentary, Mrs. Kuklinski called them "the all-American family." The Bruno book quoted her as disclosing that Mr. Kuklinski tried to smother her with a pillow, pointed a gun at her, tried to run her over with a car and three times hit her so hard that he broke her nose. Mr. Kuklinski's wife and three children survive him. In a 1992 column in The Washington Post about the first documentary, Tom Shales called Mr. Kuklinski "the ultimate misanthrope, unapologetic and irredeemable," then mentioned a promise in the prologue to penetrate his mind. "After watching, you may feel some minds are better left unpenetrated," Mr. Shales wrote.

1462-> Linking a Device to a Gadget That's Wired to a Gizmo
THE average American household now owns some 25 consumer electronics products -- televisions and stereos and high-tech gimcracks of every imaginable flavor. That statistic brings that industry's annual convention in Las Vegas last week into stark relief. Some 130,000 people moved around a noisy, pulsing display space, with thousands of products covering a land mass that seemed roughly equivalent to Norway's. If a company wants its products to be among that 25, it is going to have to hustle. And, face it, even getting an order from the retailers' buyers trawling the floor is far from a guarantee of success in stores. Notably absent from the party, as always, is the iPod purveyor Apple Computer. It holds its exclusive annual gathering for the faithful, Macworld, beginning Monday in San Francisco. Which is why it was striking that of the five keynote speeches at the Las Vegas conference -- the ones where visionary chief executives tell you where the industry is headed -- only one was delivered by an executive who could argue that his company's main business is good old consumer gizmos. That was Sir Howard Stringer of Sony, and more on him in a moment. Bill Gates of Microsoft, Paul Otelini of Intel, Terry Semel of Yahoo and Larry Page of Google rounded out the list, underscoring that a gadget is only as good as what you can do with it. And all five of these titans are pursuing a singular goal of media domination: to be all things to all people, in a world where the people have all the control over how they communicate and consume media. That battleground for things like who makes the biggest flat-screen TV with the highest-definition picture was, of course, in full force at the show. But it is now only one of two battlegrounds. The other -- call it branded ubiquity -- is about who controls the interaction between the consumer and that gadget and, more and more, all the other gadgets in the house as they become interconnected. Increasingly, multiple gizmos live in a single box. Just as iPods can show videos and photographs, new generations of mobile telephones can store hundreds of songs but also take a heck of a photo or get access to a video and Web content. And there are, of course, Microsoft's Windows Media Centers and other "digital lifestyle" devices that will be powered by its software, or Intel's new Viiv technology platform. Now there are also nascent efforts by Google and Yahoo to extend their pole positions as gatekeepers to the Internet onto any kind of screen -- mobile phones and televisions in particular -- where they want to be for video what they are already for text, images and audio. Victory on this branded-ubiquity battlefield can be far more subtle than having the year's top-selling cellphone. For example, one of last week's endless announcements concerned a deal between Panasonic and Comcast for a new set-top box that will be included by Panasonic with purchases of its new line of TV's by Comcast customers. The box will come with Comcast's on-screen programming guide already built in and ready to go. The big difference between this and past cable guides, Comcast's chief executive, Brian Roberts, explained to me, is that the Comcast-Panasonic viewer will be able to switch to any device or service hooked up to the TV through the Comcast guide -- even things like DVD players or access to the Internet that may have nothing to do with Comcast. The point is that after decades of push-and-pull between consumer electronics makers and distributors like cable companies, progress is being made around the notion that giving consumers a smooth way to navigate their media and reduce the number of remote controls and set-top boxes might help sell more TV's and cable service. "Finally, there is détente," Mr. Roberts said. When it came time to snap some photos beside the mesmerizing 103-inch plasma screen that Panasonic was introducing, Mr. Roberts hopped up on stage and made sure that the images included the most breathtaking one he knows: Comcast's interactive guide. AMID the growing drumbeat of digital upheaval, Sir Howard Stringer had what was really his coming-out party after being put in charge last March of turning around a slumping Sony. In a presentation that included some of the razzle-dazzle he honed in his days running the CBS television network, Sir Howard had some stars (the actor Tom Hanks, the "Da Vinci Code" author Dan Brown) onstage with him, along with the latest products he hopes will be Sony's stars (Bravia flat-screen TV's, PlayStation Portables, Blu-Ray DVD players). But most notable was Sir Howard's confident effort to show that Sony's vast product line, as well as its media assets, including Sony Pictures and the Sony/BMG music joint venture, have a unifying logic. To that end, not only has Sir Howard appointed the company's first chief marketing officer, but last month he quietly poached a senior executive from Apple Computer, Tim Schaaff, to be Sony's first companywide software chief. This week in Hawaii, Sir Howard is gathering the company's 120 top software engineers to talk about ways to coordinate efforts among the variety of media players the company has, including the PSP, a new Sony Reader for electronic books, and the next iteration of the Walkman due out later this year -- its latest attempt to take back some of the thunder the iPod has stolen. Mr. Stringer argued that Sony's content assets uniquely position it to drive new digital products and content, but he has also learned that the pursuit of branded ubiquity can be a double-edged sword. When Sony-BMG had to recall 5.7 million CD's loaded with a flawed anti-piracy technology, Mr. Stringer said he was worried that other divisions would suffer. "We took quite a beating," he said, adding that the whole point of the effort was to protect artists' rights, not to limit consumers'. "We'll just have to tread very, very carefully," he said. "We have to walk the line at Sony between the needs of technology and the consumer, and the rights of the artist, which we feel very strongly about." Sony was right to move swiftly to limit potential harm from the episode: if there was one thing abundantly clear amid all the techno-wizardry of the consumer electronics show, it is that the way people choose to organize and tap into their media is becoming as important as -- and will have a bearing on -- the machines they buy.

1463-> BASEBALL; Martínez on Hill, But Not in Shape
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., Feb. 28 - Pedro Martínez finally threw from hallowed ground Tuesday -- the rubber on a mound -- but he said he needed to work much more before deeming himself ready to pitch competitively. "I'm out of shape," he said as he walked off the field after his workout. "My arm is not at full strength. I still have a lot of work to do." Martínez threw 39 pitches to Bobby Estalella, with the pitching coach Rick Peterson, the bullpen coach Guy Conti and the trainer Ray Ramirez watching behind him. Martínez said he threw with half his usual effort. He said he felt some slight discomfort in his injured right toe while making his first few pitches, but added that he sensed an overall improvement. He will rest Wednesday, then assess when he will throw next. Mets Manager Willie Randolph said he expected him to pitch on opening day. Martínez said, "I'm not going to stop until something goes wrong."

1466-> Storm Evacuees Strain Texas Hosts
HOUSTON, April 15 - To the long list of adjectives used to describe Texans since last summer's hurricanes -- munificent, intrepid, scrappy -- add one more: fed up. Seven months after two powerful hurricanes blew through the Gulf Coast, elected officials, law enforcement agencies and many residents say Texas is nearing the end of its ability to play good neighbor without compensation. Houston is straining along its municipal seams from the 150,000 new residents from New Orleans, officials say. Crime was already on the rise there before the hurricane, but the Houston police say that evacuees were victims or suspects in two-thirds of the 30 percent increase in murders since September. The schools are also struggling to educate thousands of new children. To the east of here, Texans argue that Hurricane Rita, which took an unexpected turn away from Houston shortly after Hurricane Katrina last fall to wreak havoc from Jasper to the northeast to Sabine Pass near the Louisiana border, has been forgotten in the swirl of attention given to the devastation in New Orleans. In fact, they say, the nation never really took notice of the 77,000 homes made uninhabitable by Hurricane Rita's force, 40,000 of which were not insured, or the piles of debris and garbage that still fester along the roads. "Personally I am sick of hearing about Katrina," said Ronda Authement, standing outside her trailer in Sabine Pass, where she will live until she can get the money and the workers to put her three-bedroom house back on its foundation. "I would like to throw up, frankly, hearing about Katrina." In its frustration, Texas has thrown its hat in the great Congressional money game, arguing vociferously for federal money to help pay for new police officers in Houston, where the force has dwindled in recent years, and to repair homes in East Texas, where many poor residents lack the means and the insurance to do it on their own. Though the state has requested $2 billion in federal aid to pay for law enforcement, education and housing, state officials say they have received only $22 million so far. "We were told we would be taken care of by everybody on the federal level," said Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas, who recently helped get $380 million in aid added to President Bush's latest supplemental request for Texas. "But clearly that isn't the case. Texas opened its doors and hearts, and that is something we will continue to do today. However, we need to be reimbursed." Houston's relationship with its added population is subtle and at times ambivalent. Residents, atomized over a broad swath of land with few interneighborhood connections, seem at one level to be dedicated to helping their neighbors, and are quick to cite numerous examples of continued volunteerism and the improved lives of children who they say are getting a better education than they received in New Orleans. But they are also keenly aware of spikes in crime, especially in Southwest Houston, where the majority of the poorest New Orleanians settled. "The city of Houston bent over backwards for these people, and I am glad we did it," said Scott Wilson, 43, who lives in the Montrose section. "But now we are absorbing some of their problems." Evacuees have been victims of or accused of committing 39 of the 235 murders in Houston since last September, said Houston's police chief, Harold Hurtt. In January alone, there was a 34 percent rise in felonies over the previous year in the city. "I can't tell you what percentage of that group is evacuees," Chief Hurtt said. "But I am sure they are really represented in that group." Chief Hurtt said that some of the gangs that once operated in New Orleans housing projects had relocated to Houston, a city plagued with its own gang problems. In response, the city moved 100 officers working in city jails to high-crime areas, and greatly increased overtime, a tall order for a department that has lost 800 officers to retirement over the last two years. The city has asked the federal government for $77 million to hire 560 officers over five years. At Senator Hutchison's request, the Department of Justice recently sent the Police Department $20 million to help pay for patrolling high-crime areas. The Houston public school system, with about 208,000 students, also wants money to pay for more teachers, additional facilities and tutoring help for its roughly 30,000 evacuee children. The New Orleans schools, surrounded by far greater poverty than Houston, are among the nation's most troubled. Houston's school system has also experienced fighting between local and New Orleans students in its schools -- 27 students from the two sides were arrested in one melee -- but school crime is down over all. "It has been a challenge," said Terry Abbott, a spokesman for Houston Independent School District, "but generally the vast majority of the children are well behaved and many are grateful to be here." But results on standardized tests suggest that "the students from Louisiana were substantially behind the Texas kids," Mr. Abbott said. "We have asked the state government for resources to get them up to speed," said Mr. Abbott, with an eye toward regulations of the federal No Child Left Behind law. "That will be a concern, but these children are ours now, and we don't look at them in any other way." In East Texas, state officials are seeking roughly $1 billion in new federal block-grant money to house people whose homes were destroyed by Hurricane Rita. Texas officials concede that their coast was not pummeled nearly as badly as their neighbors in Louisiana, but they argue that their residents did not evacuate and were now trying to live in squalid, mold-infested conditions. "I have been to the Ninth Ward," said Mark Viator, chairman of the Recovery Coalition of Southeast Texas, speaking of the most devastated neighborhood in New Orleans. "There is debris in the Ninth Ward, but you don't have people. We say, send the money where the people are." Henry Bowie, who lives in Port Arthur, a city with high unemployment and many poor residents, is the sort of person Mr. Viator thinks should get federal housing money. His house is a patchwork of broken roofing, and light is visible through the floorboards because the house is off its foundation. Black mold grows up the sides of the walls, but Mr. Bowie, who undergoes dialysis three times a week, remains there with his wife and teenage son. Not everyone is sympathetic to the needs of Texas, where oil refinery businesses continue to take in millions of dollars in profits monthly, even though state officials say they do not have enough workers because of a housing shortage. In testimony at a recent appropriations hearing, Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said he did not believe Texans needed housing money. "Texas, in the best role of traditional Judeo-Christian charity, provided benefits," Mr. Bond said. "I think it's time we get back to being a good neighbor and not a paid companion." Senator Hutchison, who spoke next, was not amused. Mayor Guy N. Goodson of Beaumont, where thousands of homes were damaged, said he would like to see federal reimbursements for debris removal there rise to 90 percent of costs from 75 percent, equaling what it was in Louisiana. Mayor Goodson said his area suffered inattention because its residents had done the right thing: evacuating and rebuilding without complaint after Hurricane Rita cut its path. "There is a great disjoinder in people's minds about disaster," he said. "You see wildfires, you see a tornado, and who can forget the pictures of the Ninth Ward. A vast majority of our area is wind damage. And unfortunately from a sensory standpoint, people just don't coordinate these two very similar disasters." Correction: April 22, 2006, Saturday A front-page article on Thursday about strain on government services in Texas caused by hurricane evacuees misstated the number of evacuee children in Houston public schools and the amount of Federal aid the state has received. The most recent count, in late February, showed 5,475 students, not 30,000. The aid is $222 million, not $22 million.

1468-> Ramapough Tribe Sues Ford Over Sludge Dumping in New Jersey
Lawyers representing the Ramapough Mountain Indian Tribe and other residents of Ringwood, N.J., sued the Ford Motor Company yesterday over the dumping of thousands of tons of paint sludge and other toxic material from the company's former assembly plant in nearby Mahwah, N.J. The lawsuit, filed in State Superior Court in Passaic County, claims that Ford caused widespread contamination of the soil and groundwater in a mountainous 900-acre part of Ringwood, near the New York State line, during the 25 years that the Mahwah plant was open. The site includes two abandoned iron mines. Ford closed the Mahwah plant in 1980. Ford has admitted that a contractor it hired dumped wastes in Ringwood. But the company claims that the dumping went on for only four years, and that parts of Ringwood had been used as an illegal landfill for decades. Ford has cleaned the area several times and removed tons of hazardous material. But residents keep finding more. The company has just completed a more comprehensive survey of the area in preparation for yet another cleanup. Kevin J. Madonna, one of the lawyers representing the 717 current and former residents in the suit, said Ford's failure to adequately remove all the toxic material had caused serious illnesses and diseases among residents of the area. They include certain cancers and skin diseases, and leukemia rates that are twice the statewide average, he said. No direct link between the diseases and paint sludge has been scientifically proved. Mr. Madonna, whose law partner is Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the environmental advocate, said the residents were also seeking compensation for losses in the value of their homes caused by the stigma of contamination and Ford's ineffective previous efforts at cleaning up the wastes. "Everybody in Northern New Jersey should be extremely concerned about what has happened, or hasn't happened, at this site over the last two decades," Mr. Madonna said. "The contamination threatens the largest drinking water supply of 2.5 million New Jersey residents." Environmental officials have monitored the site and the nearby Wanaque Reservoir. While groundwater supplies have been contaminated, the toxic material has not been detected in the reservoir. Jon Holt, a Ford spokesman, said the company had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it. The area of Ringwood where the dumping took place is still quite rural and somewhat isolated. Many residents are Ramapough Indians, a tribe that is recognized by the State of New Jersey but not the federal government. The area was added to the federal Superfund list in 1983. The federal Environmental Protection Agency gave the site a clean bill of health in 1994 and removed it from the list. But as additional contamination has been found, the company has had to return to the site several times. In September, Ford signed a settlement agreement with the federal agency to test the site again and devise a comprehensive cleanup plan. Mr. Holt, the Ford spokesman, said the company met recently with residents to review an overall plan for cleaning up the remaining pollution, work that is expected to begin later this year.

1469-> Bottoms Up, Groundlings
In Shakespeare's day, oranges, hazelnuts and mead were the refreshments of choice at the Globe Theater. Four centuries later, at "Twelfth Night, or What You Will: The Drinking Game," it's whiskey and beer and plenty of it. The conceptual and comestible riff on Shakespeare's comedy is the brainchild of the Legitimate Theater Company, which is staging the revelry at the Slipper Room on the Lower East Side every Friday night through Feb. 10. The $5 fee includes a program, a set of drinking rules and team membership, but not liquor. (Sorry, that has to be bought separately at the bar.) The crowd is divided into three parts: the Blue Team, the Red Team and, perversely, Team 3. Blue teammates imbibe whenever the lovelorn Duke Orsino enters and whenever any character's romantic overture is rejected. The Red Team salutes each appearance of the supercilious Malvolio and swigs whenever someone's sexuality is threatened. And woe betide your liver if you're on Team 3. Its members not only toast every glimpse of the hapless Sir Andrew Aguecheek and all mentions of Olivia's beauty, but they also join in whenever the Red or Blue teams bend an elbow. "Team 3 is kind of abused, but in a very loving way," admitted Megan Kingery, who plays Viola and is also the Legitimate's general manager. If the rules sound a bit confusing, fix those dilated peepers on the stage manager, who is plainly visible to the audience. "She'll be waving flags for when the audience can drink," Ms. Kingery said. "Red flags, blue flags." And for Team 3? "She actually flips them off." The idea arose in a group brainstorming session, according to Richard Lovejoy, who plays Sebastian, and is a founder of the company, which has performed plays for the lines at the TKTS booth in Duffy Square and for straphangers on the F train. "We've long wanted to do a Shakespeare, but we needed to find the right one for this company's vibe," Mr. Lovejoy said. "Eventually, we came up with the idea of a drinking game, and 'Twelfth Night' made perfect sense because the Twelfth Night festival involves drinking traditionally." The game has no object beyond "fun," and there are no winners or losers. Still, Mr. Lovejoy defends the notion as something more than a louche gimmick: "The drinking game helps people to understand what's going on. The things that cue you to drink are events. You begin to understand relationships a little more clearly. And by the time the audience starts to fog out, the play ends." ROBERT SIMONSON

1470-> Boys Choir of Harlem Vows That Eviction Will Not Be Its Finale
With their burgundy uniforms and studied poise, the young singers have become a familiar presence on the streets of Harlem, venerated like celebrities and cherished for their determination to surmount daunting odds. But come Jan. 31, the Boys Choir of Harlem will become a globe-trotting chorale without a home. After more than a decade based at a public school at Madison Avenue and 127th Street, where it helps run the Choir Academy of Harlem, the Boys Choir and its lesser-known sister chorale are being evicted by the city's Department of Education for what the agency describes as a host of financial and managerial improprieties. Although it has always had difficulty raising funds, the choir now faces its most serious crisis since it was founded in the basement of a Harlem church nearly four decades ago. In addition to a lack of money, which has led to almost all of the organization's staff members being laid off, the choir has yet to fully recover from a scandal involving the molestation of a 14-year-old student by a guidance counselor. The counselor, Frank Jones Jr., was sentenced to two years in prison in 2002, but the organization and its founder, Dr. Walter J. Turnbull, have been unable to put the episode behind them. "We feel like we're under siege," said Keira Busher, a member of the choir's board of directors, whose son sings alto in the choir. "All this turmoil is very frustrating for us but even more so for the kids." In the two weeks since the eviction notice, was made public, there have been signs of hope. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins raised the possibility last week that he might take a leadership role with the organization, and the Department of Education relented slightly by proposing that the choir provide after-school instruction to students who attend the Choir Academy of Harlem, the school that had been jointly run by the city and the choir. In an interview, Mr. Dinkins said that his role would most likely be temporary, but that he was awaiting a full accounting of the choir's problems. "All I know is I want to be able to see these kids to continue to be able to perform," he said. Representative Charles B. Rangel of Harlem, one of the group's most prominent backers, has also vowed to do whatever he can to make sure the choir survives. "We're trying hard to help them pick up the pieces," he said. "I love these kids. They are an inspiration to their peers and to the entire world." Despite a series of meetings between Mr. Rangel and education officials, and a spirited City Hall protest last week by choir supporters, Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein appears to be committed to ending the city's 13-year-old collaboration with the organization. The academy's 600 students will continue using the building in East Harlem, but it remains unclear whether the curriculum will include the strong musical focus that had long been provided by the choir's staff. In severing its links to the group, education officials blame Dr. Turnbull for violating an agreement between the city and the choir that was supposed to help guide the fabled institution through its recent spate of troubles. The choir's free use of city property, including utilities, is valued at more than $550,000 a year. In his first public comments since the eviction was announced, Dr. Turnbull accused education officials of manipulating the facts to punish him and his choir for refusing to fully conform to the education agency's bureaucracy. He also said racism played a role in the city's campaign against him. "These charges are without basis," Dr. Turnbull said. "They want to marginalize me as a black man." Although he insisted that the choir would ultimately survive, he said that the agency's decision would hurt hundreds of students who had made it through auditions to gain a coveted spot in the academy. Keith Kalb, a spokesman for the department, denied that racism played any role. He said that the chancellor stood by the reasons in a five-page letter sent to the choir's board of directors late last month. "We're going to let the letter speak for itself," he said. Among other things, the letter said that Dr. Turnbull had failed to hire a new executive director and that he was essentially running the choir, a violation of the year-old agreement that allowed him to stay on as artistic director in exchange for changes at his organization. Additionally, it claimed that his staff was inadequately supervising students and that the choir had failed to communicate with school administrators about its finances, staff changes and concert tours. Education officials painted a picture of a formerly robust music program that had been all but eviscerated by budget woes. The final eight members of what was once a staff of 25 accompanists, choreographers and vocal coaches were let go in September. The organization remains $5 million in debt. The Boys Choir of Harlem "has been unable to provide any assurance that it will be able to solve its problems and be a partner upon which the D.O.E. can rely in educating our children," wrote Michael Best, a lawyer for the Department of Education. "The Department needs to ensure that the school serves the needs of its students, not the needs of the B.C.H." Dr. Turnbull denied the claim that he still had a hand in the choir's operations, and insisted that students were well taught and well supervised. "They make us sound like a bunch of bumpkins, that we don't know what we're doing," said Dr. Turnbull, 61, who started the choir in 1968 with a group of 20 boys. Still, he acknowledged that the choir, long beset by financial troubles, had suffered a steep drop in donations after the sex-abuse scandal. A report released in 2004 by city investigators blamed Dr. Turnbull and his brother, Horace, for mishandling the abuse allegations. As part of the agreement that allowed Dr. Turnbull to stay on as artistic director, Horace, the choir's vice president, agreed to leave the choir. "It's never been easy to raise money, but it makes it that much harder when people are talking negatively about the choir," Dr. Turnbull said. In interviews, parents, students and staff members described a school that has been plagued by an atmosphere of uncertainty and frustration marked by book shortages, overcrowded music classes and the instability of having had four principals in three years. Ms. Busher, the choir board member who is also the president of the academy's PTA, blamed education officials for trying to force too many changes. "They want to take their boxed system and impose it on a unique kind of school," she said. Mr. Rangel said he was particularly upset by when and how the eviction was announced, just a few days before Christmas and through the press. "Whatever problem the mayor has with the choir's management, it seems to me that the children should not be kicked into the street," he said. Although many parents and teachers have rallied behind Dr. Turnbull, some staff members said he deserved a fair amount of blame for the choir's current troubles. Keith Burton, who was music director for 14 years, said that even when the choir was months behind in paying its staff, Dr. Turnbull would hire new conductors and administrators at generous salaries. "We could never do direct deposit because you could never be sure of your paycheck," said Mr. Burton, 39, who was let go with the remaining staff in September. "It had been so stressful there for a long time." Many students and their parents, however, enthusiastically support Dr. Turnbull and the model he has created, even if it is imperfect. Emily Sheppard, whose son, Moussa Sy, is a 10th grader at the academy, said the choir had turned his life around. His confidence level has soared and the frequent concert tours have taught him independence and discipline, she said. "When you walk around this neighborhood, you see a lot of unsuccessful stories, but at this school you hear a lot of success stories," said Ms. Sheppard, whose son commutes from Brooklyn. "If you cut out the choir, you cut out the heart of this school. Sure my son could go to another school, but then the dream would die."

1474-> With City on Edge, Duke Students Retreat
DURHAM, N.C., April 1 - The freshman Adam Weiss and his friends canceled plans to see a movie downtown here late Friday night, deciding it would be unsafe to venture beyond the Duke University campus. They made their choice after receiving a universitywide e-mail message from Larry Moneta, the vice president for student affairs at Duke, at about 10 p.m. Friday. Moneta wrote that, according to an unsubstantiated rumor, someone might be planning a drive-by shooting of the house rented by several members of the Duke men's lacrosse team. He also mentioned reports that students living in the surrounding houses had been yelled at by people driving by and that some students in those houses had opted to relocate for the night. Durham Police Department officials did not return phone calls to comment on the rumors Saturday. "Most students I saw last night stayed around here, and right now that's probably a smart idea," said Weiss, 19, from Arlington, Tex., who said he felt uneasy even walking to his car, which is parked near North Buchanan Boulevard, the street where the lacrosse players lived. "People here are really concerned about their safety because of the unrest in town after what happened with the lacrosse team," Weiss said. The now-infamous lacrosse house, which players vacated last week, is where a party was held March 13 at which an exotic dancer said that players used racial slurs and sexually assaulted her. The dancer is black and attends nearby North Carolina Central University, a historically black college. All but one player on the Duke lacrosse team are white. The players have denied that the assault took place, and 46 of the 47 players submitted DNA samples last week. The woman said her attackers were white, so the black player was not tested. No charges have been filed, and District Attorney Mike Nifong said none would be filed at least until the week of April 10, according to The News and Observer of Raleigh, N.C. Although the DNA test results might come back sooner, Nifong said, he did not plan to make them public. If charges are filed, the results would be divulged at a trial. Still, the incident has exposed racial tension in this town, where the divide between the Duke students and the rest of the Durham community is now glaring, and perhaps growing. "The situation is mushrooming way beyond the central issue of just the lacrosse players," said Stacy Murphy, who earned her teaching degree at Duke's graduate school and lives in Trinity Park, the neighborhood where the party took place. "When you have this kind of incident, and the public outrage that goes with it, people on the fringe might do something rash," she said. "I'm afraid for the students, because it's clear that tensions are at a crazy level." On Saturday, most of the university-owned houses on a stretch of North Buchanan Boulevard were quiet. Normally, students would be on the porches drinking beer or people would be milling about, Murphy said. The yards also were cleaner than usual, she said. On this day, only a roll of toilet paper and a roll of poster paper sat on the lawn of the lacrosse house. At another house, an empty Duke University security car sat in the parking lot. "If she was a white woman raped by black students, the whites would be in an uproar and things would be much more out of hand," said Felita Judd, who lives across town, near the woman who reported the attack. "But now we're mad because this woman is being treated as a low-class person. The players? They are treated like high class, and they are being protected because they have money." Back on Duke's main campus, students seemed sheltered from the goings-on in town. Couples walked hand-in-hand on the lush lawns amid blooming flowers. Students in bikinis sunbathed on lawns near their dormitories. At the lacrosse stadium, about three dozen Duke seniors tailgated in the parking lot as the women's lacrosse team began its game against Virginia. Some of those students had read the e-mail message from Moneta. Others said they had not yet opened it or had deleted it. "I think being proactive and maybe scaring people with an e-mail warning like that is beneficial to everyone," said Emily Aviki, 22, the senior class president. "It makes us more aware of our surroundings, and that's good because it's a very stressful time for everyone." In his e-mail message, Moneta wrote that the tensions "may not abate for a while." He was unavailable to comment Saturday. Weiss, the freshman, said he simply hoped that the lives of Duke students would soon return to normal. "The people in town are mad about what the lacrosse players supposedly did, and rightfully so, but they shouldn't take it out on regular students," he said. "It's not fair that we all are suffering because of what a few guys may have done."

1475-> Score Is Too Small a Matter to Matter to Woods
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla., March 23 - There is much that Tiger Woods can control: the trajectory of his shots, the access to his inner circle, the image he shows to the public. But Thursday, during the first round of the Players Championship, his mask of placidity slipped. For all the magic he can summon with a golf club in his hands, Woods cannot block out one of life's greatest hazards. The failing health of his father, Earl, was weighing heavily on Woods as he stepped to the first tee Thursday afternoon. He was dressed in gray and black, colors that matched his mood and the weather perfectly. Weary from worrying about his father, after he traveled from Florida to California and back in a little over 24 hours, Woods shot an even-par 72. The best thing he could say about the round is that he never gave up. After watching how hard his father is fighting, how could he? "At least he's trying to hang in there," Woods said, "which is a very positive sign." Earl Woods, 74, was found to have prostate cancer in 1998. In the fall of 2004, the cancer returned and spread throughout his body, producing lesions on his back and a tumor behind his left eye. At the end of last year, Woods, 30, took three weeks off so he could dote on the man who has been his guiding light. The light seemed to flicker Tuesday, which gave Woods a fright. "He just wasn't doing all that well," Woods said. "That's why I went back." Woods left Florida on Tuesday, traveling in his private jet to Orange County, Calif. He missed a practice round and a pretournament media session Wednesday to spend the day at his father's bedside. Earl Woods did not expect to see his son this week except on television. When Woods walked through the door of his father's house in Cypress, Earl Woods, according to his son, said as a way of greeting him, "What the hell are you doing here?" Smiling, Woods said, "It was nice to hear that." Woods returned to Florida late Wednesday night and teed off Thursday at 12:30 p.m. That he is seven shots behind the leaders, Jim Furyk and Davis Love III, who are at seven-under-par 65, seemed like too small a matter to, well, matter. "You hit a bad shot and you want to get upset with yourself because you know you can hit better shots," Woods said. "But you know what, in the whole scheme of things, it's just a golf shot." If anybody could begin to understand what it was like to walk in Woods's shoes Thursday, it was Darren Clarke, the golfer who escorted him around the T.P.C. Stadium course and managed to coax a few smiles out of Woods during their four-and-a-half-hour reality break. Clarke's wife, Heather, is battling breast cancer that has metastasized, creating, in Clarke's words, "a pretty tough thing that we're having to deal with at the moment." Similarly, Earl Woods's cancer has dislodged Woods's world from its axis. Asked if he considered not playing this week, Woods, who won here in 2001, said, "Oh, yeah." He said being paired with Clarke was "a blessing in disguise, because everyone knows Darren is kind of struggling with the same thing." Woods added, "We were talking about it all day." When Woods was a child and he played casual rounds with his father, Earl Woods would jangle coins in his pocket on Woods's backswing or toss golf balls at his feet as a way of preparing Woods for distractions. Woods's trance-like focus on the golf course has made him a fierce front-runner. Once he has his eyes on the prize, he is hard to knock off, as evidenced by his 34-3 record on the PGA Tour when he holds or shares a 54-hole lead. But ignoring cameras clicking during his backswing is one thing; tuning out the indelible images of his father is something altogether different. "I don't think you'd be human if you didn't think about it," Woods said. "Hopefully, you let it go quickly and focus on the shot." Woods's focus improved as the afternoon wore on. He made four bogeys on the first 10 holes, then played the last eight in two under par. On the front nine, he said, "I'd hit two good shots and then hit one out of the planet somewhere, hit two good putts and all of a sudden blast one four or five feet past the hole." On the back nine, Woods said, "I hit some good shots, which is nice." If he can hit more good shots Friday, that would be a real shot in the arm for his father. "Hopefully I'll get on TV and hit some good golf shots, and he can watch it and give him something to look forward to every day," Woods said. "That's always a positive thing."

1476-> Einstein’s Man in Beijing: A Rebel With a Cause
BEIJING — The first time he was purged, Xu Liangying was 37, an up-and-coming physicist, philosopher and historian and a veteran of the Communist underground. He had to divorce his wife, leave his sons and go live on his mother’s farm in the country. Three decades later, only a heart attack saved him from imprisonment or worse during the massacre that ended the democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989. During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards stole the Einstein translations that Dr. Xu had labored over during his farm exile. Armed guards once surrounded his apartment to keep him away from Secretary of State Warren Christopher. For seven decades, Xu Liangying has been Albert Einstein’s man in China, intertwining revolution and physics to speak up for political freedom and the value of scientific curiosity in a land where the rulers have often had a different agenda. His Einstein translations, retrieved and published, helped inspire a rebirth of interest in Einstein and in science in China. Chinese leaders say today that science is the key to the country’s modernization and growth, but Dr. Xu finds no pleasure in that. “They are just using it to serve themselves,” he said recently. His phone, he says, is still bugged. Today, at 86, his hair is white, and history, in the form of scholars, human rights activists and journalists, comes to him, in his book-lined apartment overlooking the university district in Beijing. If he is not the oldest living Chinese dissident, he is easily one of the most intellectually distinguished, the author of some 200 papers and editor of a half-dozen books. The historian H. Lyman Miller called him an “archetypal figure” in his book “Science and Dissent in Post-Mao China.” The adjective “venerable” seems to attach itself to him the way snow is attracted to the mountains, but he does not seem to have lost an ounce of rebelliousness. A dozen years ago in this newspaper he referred to would-be Communist reformers as “boot lickers.” On a recent morning, Dr. Xu held forth from an armchair on his adventures as an Einsteinian democrat, jabbing the air, waving his arms and laughing often. Albert Einstein stared down sternly from above a file cabinet. “Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds,” the inscription read. Clad in a blue shirt, slippers and thick glasses, Dr. Xu got up from his easy chair to stand beneath the poster. “Those are some of his best words,” he said. The love affair between Dr. Xu, who was born in Linhai, Zhejiang, in 1920, and Einstein began when Dr. Xu was in secondary school and read a collection of Einstein’s essays called “The World as I See It.” The book had as much politics as science. In one passage that the young Xu underlined, Einstein wrote: “The state is made for man, not man for the state. I regard the chief duty of the state to protect the individual and give him the opportunity to develop into a creative personality.” Dr. Xu said, “I wanted to be such a person.” In 1939, he entered Zhejiang University, intending, as he wrote on his entrance form, to become “the authority of modern physics.” But politics intruded. To evade the Japanese Army, which had invaded China in 1937, the university repeatedly had to move and sometimes during bombings students had to take shelter in caves. This provided Dr. Xu a revealing and disturbing tour of the Chinese countryside. Some people were living in caves with ragged clothes, while their landlords lived well. “This difference was unreasonable,” he recalled thinking. Concluding that China needed “total revolution,” he resolved to join the Communists underground. In the meantime, he was excelling at his studies, and when he graduated, his mentor Wang Ganchang, the architect of China’s first atomic bomb, wanted him as a research assistant to study the mysterious subatomic particles known as neutrinos. Instead, the young Xu went off in search of the revolution, teaching in five schools over the next two years. When the Japanese Army overran the province where he was teaching, his old mentor put an advertisement in the local newspaper pleading with him to return to research. Dr. Xu did return to the university, but he took his politics with him and the physics department became the center of Communist activity at the university, with Dr. Xu as the party secretary. When the Communists finally prevailed in 1949, Dr. Xu and Dr. Wang moved to Beijing and joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where in what he refers to now as “a bad deed,” Dr. Xu became for a while the chief censor, inspecting scientific writings for antirevolutionary sentiment or threats to national security. But it turned out that he could not serve both Einstein and Mao. In 1957, Mao announced the “100 flowers” campaign, encouraging people to speak up and criticize, only to decide later that things had gone too far and to instigate a new campaign to weed out “rightists.” Dr. Xu spoke out against the new campaign and was himself denounced in The Chinese People’s Daily, not just as a rightist, but an “extreme rightist.” The academy ordered him to go work on a farm in northeastern China, but Dr. Xu argued that he had arthritis and that it was too cold there. Told then that he was on his own, Dr. Xu went back to his apartment in Beijing. His wife, Wang Laili, a historian and mother of their 7- and 14-year-old children, was pregnant. She cried so hard for three days, he said, that she lost the baby. For sheltering her husband, Dr. Wang was kicked out of the party, and under “ big pressure,” Dr. Xu said, she asked him for a divorce. Dr. Xu was banished to his family farm in Linhai. Eventually, the rightist label was lifted, and in 1962, the academy asked him to do the translation for a new collection of Einstein’s philosophical essays and speeches. The decision to publish Einstein was not made wholly out of admiration. “Mao Zedong wanted to be the revolutionary leader of the whole world,” Dr. Xu explained. As part of that plan, he said, “Mao planned to identify and criticize all the world’s scientists whose political or philosophical positions were anti-Marxist.” Einstein was on the list courtesy of Andrei Zhdanov, an assistant to Stalin, who argued in 1947 that Einstein’s cosmological theories were reactionary and bourgeois. Marxist philosophy postulated an endless and unlimited universe, but according to general relativity, space-time could be curved around on itself like a sphere, and thus be finite even if it lacked boundaries. Moreover, it promoted theology by implying that the universe had a beginning. Mr. Zhdanov’s argument resonated with Mao’s view that the universe should be in a state of eternal revolution. And for a brief while it resonated with Dr. Xu, who referred to the Soviet criticism as “a vibration on my mind.” Scientifically, he said, “I affirmed Einstein’s theory because in science there are no classes.” But, he said, “Influenced by Marxism, I thought that the philosophy part of Einstein’s theory is some capitalism theory.’’ It took him two years, working mostly by himself, to translate 197 of Einstein’s articles. But publication was suspended because the workers at his printer had been dispersed to the countryside in another of Mao’s campaigns. Then came the Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards confiscated Dr. Xu’s translations, as well as a manuscript he had written on Einstein’s philosophy. In 1969, Dr. Xu learned that the papers were in the hands of a group of Shanghai radicals known as the Shanghai Science Criticism Group, a collective that had been set up to attack Einstein and relativity. Dr. Xu demanded his papers back and appealed to the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee to prevent the group from publishing the translations themselves. Then he wrote to Premier Zhou Enlai. His courage unnerved the Shanghai group, according to Danian Hu, a historian at the City College of New York, who tells the story in a new book, “China and Albert Einstein.” (Harvard University Press, 2005). In the end Dr. Xu got back his translations and the publications rights, but the other manuscript was lost. The Einstein volumes were published, beginning in 1975, just as the Cultural Revolution was winding down. Mao died and the members of the infamous “Gang of Four” were arrested in 1976. On March 14, 1978, the 99th anniversary of Einstein’s birth, the foreword to Dr. Xu’s book, calling Einstein “a giant bright star in human history,” was reprinted in The People’s Daily. A year later a thousand Chinese scientists gathered in Beijing to celebrate the old sage. New leaders like Deng Xiaoping began emphasizing science as the key to uplifting China, and urging the people to “seek the truth through facts.” Dr. Xu rejoined the academy in Beijing, remarried Wang Laili and became the editor of a new journal, The Bulletin of Natural Dialectics. But Einstein proved a truer beacon than the party. In a paper in 1981, Dr. Xu cited Einstein on the necessity of freedom, particularly of speech, as a prerequisite for scientific progress. Many scientists, including Dr. Xu, soon became disillusioned as the government put resources into technological development, starving basic research institutions. This, Dr. Xu said, was a symptom of closed societies. “In this respect we have much to learn from the experience of the developed Western countries,” he wrote in 1986, “where academic freedom is recognized as a necessary condition for human progress.” By the end of the decade, he said, “I gave up Marxism totally and returned to Einstein.” In January 1989, Dr. Xu’s friend Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, wrote an open letter calling for the release of political prisoners. That was too limited, Dr. Xu concluded. He and an old friend, Shi Yafeng, a geographer at the academy, then in February drafted their own letter calling for democracy. “We agreed that actually China needs political reform,” Dr. Xu said. “They need political democracy and need to protect the rights of citizens, and there should be freedom of thinking, speaking and publishing,” he said, “and they need to end the long history of punishing people because of their words. China has such a history, which has lasted for thousands of years.” Asked if he had worried when he wrote the letter, Dr. Xu laughed, explaining that he had risked his life long before when he first joined the Communist underground. “There was nothing to dare,” he said. His letter was signed by 42 people, including many scientists. It and Dr. Fang’s letter helped provide inspiration for students and others who swarmed Tiananmen Square in April 1989 to mourn the death of Hu Yaobang, a purged political activist, and then stayed to protest corruption and the lack of human rights. Many of them were wearing T-shirts that said “Science and Democracy,” watchwords of Chinese politics and aspirations since the early 20th century. On June 4, Chinese troops invaded the square with tanks and killed hundreds of people. The massacre, Dr. Xu said, will live as Deng Xiaoping’s one historical event. “Mr. Deng used tanks and plane to kill people; he killed them with bullets without blinking his eyes,” he said. “Even the Japanese never did that.” In the aftermath, Dr. Xu was not arrested, perhaps, he says, because he had had a heart attack a couple of months earlier and had thus never gone down to the demonstrations. (Dr. Fang had to take refuge in the United States Embassy and later left the country.) When it was suggested to him that he leave the city, Dr. Xu refused. He was 69 and weakened. “If I get arrested, then I’m ready to be dead in prison,” he said. In 1994, Dr. Xu and six others, including the parents of one of the slain Tiananmen protesters, published a new appeal for human rights in China. “To talk about modernization without mentioning human rights is like climbing a tree to catch a fish,” it said. The letter coincided with a planned visit to Beijing by Secretary of State Christopher, and occasioned a temporary house arrest to prevent a meeting. In 1995, Dr. Xu was given the Heinz R. Pagels award by the New York Academy of Sciences for his work for freedom, but after another letter and another house arrest, the president of the American Physical Society wrote to the Chinese government asking about his safety. Dr. Xu is now retired. In 2001 his book “My Views: Xu Liangying’s Collection of Essays on Science, Democracy and Reason” was published by Mirror Books in Hong Kong. He and his wife, who works at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, are working together on a book about the history and theory of democracy. “Science and democracy are separate concepts,” he said. “They are mutually supportive, but democracy is more fundamental.” Despite their showy embrace of science, China’s present leaders have not won over Dr. Xu. Jiang Zemin, who inherited power from Mr. Deng, earned Dr. Xu’s scorn in 1997 when he invoked Einsteinian relativity to justify China’s human rights record, saying democracy was a relative concept. “It’s just nonsense because, first, Einstein’s relativity principle is actually essentially emphasizing the absolute,” Dr. Xu said, referring to the notion that the laws of physics and speed of light are the same for all observers. “And the other part is democracy and freedom are also absolute because human nature is universal and needs to pursue freedom and equality.” Dr. Xu said he was optimistic that China’s future would embrace those qualities. He pointed out that when the student leader Wang Dan first tried to start a democracy salon in 1989, only 20 people showed up. But only half a year later, more than 3,000 people joined a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. “So I never doubt the power of the youth,” Dr. Xu said.

1478-> Doctors Take Note: Even the Whiners Sometimes Get Sick
A colleague in the medical practice where I work asked me about a patient she was seeing. "I'm concerned about Mrs. B's abdominal pain," she said. "She looks very uncomfortable, and she's usually so stoic." This is a code phrase in medicine. The stoic patient rarely complains. The stoic patient never makes office visits for trivial matters. The stoic patient's symptoms are to be taken seriously. And so, Mrs. B. was sent for an urgent CT scan of the abdomen and had her inflamed appendix taken out later that day. After years of stoicism, Mrs. B. earned her reward: her doctor didn't question the severity of her symptoms and her illness was diagnosed and treated promptly. But what of the less-than-stoic patient? What about the people who come to the doctor for every ache, sniffle or bump? Healthy people with charts thick from frequent visits for minor symptoms they believe to be fatal? These are the people who can tolerate a bit less discomfort or uncertainty than the average person. These are the patients who cry wolf. The only trouble is, sometimes there really is a wolf. The challenge for the doctor is knowing when. I learned this first hand when I took care of Robert. Robert was a young man who first came to me complaining of a sore throat. A pleasant man in his 30's, he was very distressed about his symptoms. To me it seemed he was healthy but suffering from a mild viral illness; there were no signs or symptoms of anything serious. I told him his sore throat would resolve. Sure enough, in two days he was much better. Robert was my patient over the next several years. Once or twice a year he would come in with a sore throat, and he often complained dramatically about it. I would prescribe Tylenol and gargles and it would get better. During the time I took care of him, he also developed diabetes, which he never took as seriously as his sore throats, despite my nagging at him to diet, exercise and take his medication. One winter day I got a message to call him regarding "a severe sore throat." As usual, there was much moaning and groaning from him over the phone. Despite my advice to wait it out a few days he called again the following day. "This guy is such a wimp," I thought. More advice from me regarding tea, honey, gargles and the like. On the third morning, Robert's girlfriend called me. "Robert had a terrible night. He looks awful," she said. I sighed. "O.K., throw him in a cab, and I'll look at him in the office now." How annoying to have to overbook my busy morning with this nonsense. Or so I thought. The minute I saw him in the exam room I realized that this was not the usual sore throat. He flopped on the exam table and lay there, lethargic, breathing rapidly and hardly able to speak. One look in his mouth told the whole story. His entire throat and oral cavity were covered with a thick yellow coat. It was thrush, the fungal infection that can be a sign of out-of-control diabetes. This, along with his altered mental status and rapid breathing were signs of diabetic ketoacidosis, a potentially fatal complication of diabetes. Robert's wolf was finally here. I had him admitted to the hospital, where he stayed for a week, including several days in the intensive care unit. If he had not come to see me when he did he might have died. Thankfully, he made a full recovery. And he taught me a lesson I'll never forget: even the wimps get sick.

1482-> Australia’s New Threat to Riesling Royalty
WITH the fervor of the vinously disenfranchised, riesling lovers have long worshiped the trinity of Germany, Austria and Alsace. Each produces wines that are distinctive expressions of a grape that is both the most versatile and the most undervalued in the world. Germany has its vast reach of riesling styles, from dry and stony to delicately sweet to gloriously syrupy. Austria’s rieslings are dry, focused and minerally, while Alsace’s are dramatic, sometimes unpredictable. It’s a shorthand formulation with the virtues of neatness and accuracy, yet it sometimes feels smug, as if these riesling powers are unassailable. It practically begs for an interloper, one that will stir things around, win a few friends and influence some people. Behold Australia, land of fruit bombs and salesmanship and industrial wines with cute critter names. Australia, yes that Australia, has stepped into the sacred circle and poured its rieslings into the chalice for judgment. Oceans of riesling are gushing forth from Australia. Much of what was grown there over the years was of poor quality; it was sold cheaply and consumed locally. In the last few decades, though, Australia has pulled many acres of riesling from hot areas unsuited to the grape, and replanted in cooler spots, primarily in the Clare and Eden Valleys in South Australia, with some also in Western Australia, around the Margaret and Frankland Rivers near the continent’s southwestern tip. Nowadays, much more of the wine is exported. Figures from the Australia Wine and Brandy Corporation, a trade bureau, show that almost 1.1 million liters of riesling were exported to the United States in the 2004-’05 fiscal year, an astounding increase from 2000-’01, when just about 17,000 liters were exported. But is that wine worthy? Such was the assignment facing the Dining section’s wine panel. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests: Fred Dexheimer, wine director of the BLT restaurants in New York, has an excellent riesling selection at BLT Fish, while Rebecca Foster, a wine consultant formerly of Cookshop in Chelsea, is a professed riesling lover. We tasted 25 rieslings from all over Australia. Not everyone was as pleased as I was. First let me give you the dissenting voices. “These are not the most exciting wines, but they are crisp and clean and will go with food,” Fred said. Florence echoed him, saying, “They’re not going to blow you out of the water, but they are reliable.” Both felt the wines displayed a narrow spectrum of aromas and flavors. Now let me explain how to interpret their findings, which I think deserve a more positive spin than either Fred or Florence seemed willing to offer. These wines were not so much narrow as consistent, gloriously consistent. The best showed a wonderful minerality, which, after all, is a hallmark of riesling and not to be taken for granted. Many had floral and lime aromas, but few had the sort of peach or apricot aromas that you find in German rieslings. And while the best were fresh and refreshing, they did not offer the bracing acidity that you find in superb European rieslings. Almost all were dry, and few showed much complexity. Granted, these were young wines, mostly from the 2004 and 2005 vintages. Perhaps they will become more complex over time. As Florence said, they are not going to blow you out of the water. And yet that is part of their charm, and part of the reason the panel agreed that these wines belong on the dinner table with food. They are nuanced rather than extravagant, subtle rather than loud. These are not qualities you necessarily expect from Australian wines, but here they were, offering quiet, stony testimony. “There were some lovely surprises,” Rebecca said, and I was happy to agree with her. One surprise was the prices. Of the 25 wines, 22 were $25 and under, with 10 of them $15 and under, including our No. 1 wine, the 2005 Stonehaven Winemaker’s Selection, for $13. Only two of the wines were $30 or more. But it’s to be expected that riesling will be a good deal. It’s one of the benefits of not being made from chardonnay grapes, which produce wines that are more popular and more expensive. Still, the Stonehaven is an excellent value. It was one of the few wines in the tasting that displayed both minerality and abundant fruit, yet it was balanced and refreshing, unlike some of the other inexpensive bottles, which were a little flabby. Grosset, which produced the 2005 Polish Hill, our No. 4 wine, is perhaps the most famous name in Australian riesling. It was also the most expensive wine in the tasting at $35. While it might not offer the value of a similarly priced Austrian or German riesling, I found plenty to like, especially its anise and slate aromas. I also was very pleased with the No. 5 wine, the 2004 Art Series from Leeuwin in the Margaret River region. I have liked this wine over the last few years for its intensity, stony minerality and tightly coiled acidity. While our panel was divided over this wine, I won’t mind a bit if you take my word for it. Our No. 2 wine, the 2005 Betts & Scholl, is an unusual collaboration between Richard Betts, the sommelier at the Little Nell resort in Aspen, Colo., and Dennis Scholl, a collector of contemporary art. They procured grapes from the Eden Valley and produced a small quantity of delicate yet substantial wine, with an appealing spicy element. Two other wines worth mentioning are the 2004 Mitchell from the Clare Valley, a refreshingly dry, invigorating wine, and the 2004 Pikes, also from the Clare Valley, an intensely minerally wine and perhaps the most frequently seen label among Australian rieslings in the United States. Small amounts of good riesling also come from the Finger Lakes of New York, from Washington and California, and from Ontario. I’ve had a few decent glasses from New Zealand, too. But no place outside of the celebrated big three is making riesling of the quantity, quality or potential of Australia. It might be time to make some room at the table.  $13 *** Peach and mineral aromas; balanced and expressive. (Importer: Excelsior Wine and Spirits, Old Brookville, N.Y.) $30 **½ Balanced and substantial with mineral, lime and spice flavors. (Polaner Selections, Mount Kisco, N.Y.) $17 ??½ Zesty and appealing with lingering citrus, floral and mineral flavors. (Click Imports, Seattle) $35 **½ Floral aromas with mineral and anise flavors; improves in the glass. (U.S.A.

1483-> Costly, Sure, but It’s Nirvana for TiVo Fans
As any technophile can tell you, the best technology doesn’t always become the dominant one. Just ask fans of the Macintosh, Minidisc or Betamax. So imagine how fans of the TiVo must feel. Here’s a machine that can time-shift, pause, and slice and dice TV broadcasts, simplifying lives and family schedules all over the country. It’s an elegant, refined device whose name, à la Google, has become a verb (“I’ll TiVo it”). And yet most people considering a digital video recorder (DVR) these days don’t get TiVo’s. They rent generic boxes from cable companies. Now, these boxes are to TiVo as an oxcart is to a Maserati; their creators, it’s painfully clear, do not share TiVo Inc.’s obsession with polish and elegant simplicity. But a cable company’s DVR costs about $5 a month, versus $13 a month for the TiVo — not including the purchase price. TiVo has chosen not to fight the cable companies on their own lowball turf. The long-awaited, high-definition TiVo Series 3, released last week, aims for the high end. It’s meant to be the ultimate DVR, the cream of the cream. The question is, How many people are willing to pay $800, plus $13 a month, to bask in its glory? The biggest-ticket TiVo Series 3 feature is, of course, its high-definition tuner. Two, actually, so that you can record two shows at once — and even play back a third simultaneously. Those tuners let you do everything earlier TiVo’s do, like choosing shows to record from a list (without having to know their broadcast time or channel), pausing or rewinding live TV, zipping past commercials, recording the same show every week automatically, and generally bending the broadcasters’ schedules to your whim. But this TiVo can also record both regular TV shows and gorgeous wide-screen high-definition shows. The 250-gigabyte hard drive inside can hold 32 hours of high-def video or 200 hours of standard-definition recordings (at medium quality). The other big change, however, may not come as good news to everyone. The Series 3 has no video inputs. (I’ll wait while you read that again.) In other words, you can’t connect a cable box, satellite receiver or any other video source. So how are you supposed to get all your channels? Either by connecting an antenna, attaching the cable without a box (fine if you don’t get premium channels) or by renting a CableCard — or two, for dual simultaneous recordings. CableCard is a terrific technology. It’s a metal card, like the PC cards for laptops, that stores the account information previously monitored by your cable box, like which movie channels you get. All cable companies offer CableCard, although few promote it; a cable-guy appointment is generally required. By replacing the cable box, you eliminate one remote control, reclaim a power outlet, reduce home-theater clutter and save money every month (the CableCard rental is around $1.50, instead of $5 to $7 for the cable box). But today’s CableCard is a one-way device. It can’t send signals back to the cable company, which means that you can’t order pay-per-view movies. If you consider that a sacrifice, skip the new TiVo — or else keep a cable box on hand for pay-per-view use, connected to a different TV input. Satellite customers, too, are out of luck with this machine, although DirecTV offers both a combination high-def TiVo/satellite receiver and its own homegrown DVR. Even if the CableCard thing isn’t an obstacle, you may still be scratching your head. Who’d pay $800 plus $13 a month when the cable company’s DVR costs $5 a month? Members of the Cult of TiVo wouldn’t even consider contaminating their entertainment systems with a cable-company-provided box. Here are just a few reasons — features that, in general, are available only on the TiVo: You can program your TiVo from the Web — a great trick when you hear about a great show but you’re not home to set up the recording. The smoky-dark front panel identifies the name of the show(s) the Series 3 is recording, even when the TV itself is turned off. And the remote, which can also operate your TV, is illuminated. A TiVo can play the music (unprotected formats only) or slide shows of the photos that reside on a Mac or PC elsewhere on the network. Later this year, a software upgrade will permit the Series 3 to display those photos in high definition. You can set up a Wish List, which makes the TiVo auto-record every show with a certain title, actor, director or keyword. When you hear about a great movie that’s in theaters now, plug it into the Wish List; you’ll get it as soon as it’s shown on TV. You can program one of your TiVo remote’s buttons to skip 30 seconds — a much quicker, more precise way to skip ads. (Search Google for “tivo 30-second skip” for instructions.) With two tuners, recording overlapping shows is rarely a problem. But even if you have only one tuner, the TiVo doesn’t consider it a conflict when one requested show starts at 8 p.m. and another ends at 8:03 (a sneaky network audience-retention tactic); it just records as much of the overlapping show as it can. When you can’t find a show you requested, the TiVo can show you exactly why. It will tell you that your hard drive was full, for example, or that the show get recorded, but someone in your house deleted it. Now, all of this juicy goodness still doesn’t come cheap. There are, however, a few ways to soften the blow. First, that $800 figure is the early-adopter price. It will soon fall, guaranteed, especially online. Second, there are several ways to trim the monthly bill. For example, you can pay $300 upfront for three years of the service, which works out to $8.33 a month. (No expiration date has been set for this promotion.) Or, if you have one TiVo already, you can add another for only $7 a month. Best of all, if you bought product-lifetime service for an older TiVo — a one-time-fee deal that’s no longer offered — you can transfer it to the new Series 3 for $200, and never pay another penny on that machine. That price includes one year of service for the older TiVo. (This deal expires at the end of January 2007, and you have to buy the Series 3 by the end of 2006.) That’s only one way in which a recurring Series 3 theme is “coming soon.” For the moment, it lacks two great features of the Series 2. One is TiVo To Go, which automatically transfers specified recordings to a laptop, iPod, Treo and so on, for watching on the road. The other is multiroom playback, which lets you watch a show recorded on the downstairs TiVo on the TiVo in the bedroom. TiVo says that it will eventually restore these features in a free software upgrade. Already the machine taps the Internet in clever ways; for example, you can call up today’s weather or local movie listings with a couple of button taps. Later this year, the Series 3 will offer TiVoCast, which means video clips from the Web (including CNET, the National Basketball Association and The New York Times). One coming software upgrade will let you schedule recordings from a Verizon cellphone; another will activate the connector on the back where you can plug in an external hard drive to expand the Series 3’s storage (yes!). All of this is future icing on an already delicious cake. But $800? Wow. That price has, understandably, caused much derisive snorting online. Clearly, at that price, this machine will not be the choice for the masses. It will be precisely what the company claims it to be: a premium machine, with the most features, the most effortless software and the highest video quality. (TV geeks will be thrilled to note that the Series 3 is the only THX-certified DVR — meaning it meets certain technical standards for picture and sound quality — and that high-def recordings are stored uncompressed and untouched for maximum picture quality.) So, yes, the TiVo Series 3 is the Lexus of video recorders, exactly as its manufacturer promises. Here’s to anyone who can afford to drive one home.

1484-> Neroli Fairhall, Champion Archer, Dies at 61
WELLINGTON, New Zealand, June 12 (AP)  Neroli Fairhall, a gold medalist in archery at the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the first wheelchair athlete to compete at an Olympics, died here Sunday. She was 61. Her death was announced by the New Zealand Olympic Committee. Fairhall, who was paralyzed from the waist down in a motorcycle accident, won a gold medal for New Zealand at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games and placed 35th when she broke ground for disabled competitors at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. She was also a gold medalist at the Paralympics, and a national champion and record-holder throughout her competitive career. Fairhall's appearance at the Olympics was questioned when some rivals suggested she had an advantage in shooting from a sitting position. The controversy waned when, asked if that were so, she replied: "I don't know. I've never shot standing up."

1485-> Does Surveillance Make Us Safer?
To the Editor: Surveillance with a broader focus than individuals misses an important problem: translation. Everyone acknowledges the vast number of messages each and every day. If 1 percent of just one billion messages are in another language, that is still 10 million messages. Even 1 percent of 1 percent presents a formidable, perhaps insurmountable, translation task. And the shortage of government translators, particularly for Arabic, has been widely reported. The only conclusion one can draw is that the National Security Agency surveillance program is designed to spy primarily on English speakers.

1487-> Does Surveillance Make Us Safer?
To the Editor: I was relieved that Philip Bobbitt concluded with an acknowledgment that a president who "secretly decides a measure is unconstitutional and neglects to say so" will undermine "the very system of public consent for which we are fighting." The president's oath of office says he is to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." By blatantly undermining the checks and balances in the Constitution, this president is violating his oath. Even if I thought (which I do not) that President Bush and his advisers are so trustworthy that my phone calls would never be intercepted just because I wrote a critical, and therefore an "unpatriotic," letter like this one, could we really count on all future presidents to be trustworthy, once the precedent of the imperial presidency was established? The Constitution has served us well in the past. I hope that professors of law everywhere will work to instill in their students a respect for its inherent wisdom.

Could it be that Michael W. Ramsey, the lead lawyer for Kenneth L. Lay, the former Enron chief executive, was watching "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" during his recovery from heart surgery? "There may be a jury that yields to unpopularity, but it's not this jury!" Mr. Ramsey said in his closing argument on Tuesday at the Enron trial, after missing more than a month because of health problems. "There may come a day when an American jury yields to a media mob, but it's not this date!" Aragorn of Arathorn, before leading the men of Gondor and Rohan into a mighty battle in the final film of the trilogy, entreated them this way: "A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship, but it's not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields, when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day, we fight!" Mr. Ramsey said on Thursday that "Rings" might have provided the inspiration. "I steal liberally from quotations from everywhere," he said. ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

He led Verizon’s initial entry into the cellphone and high-speed Internet businesses and was responsible for integrating MCI after its acquisition, the chief executive, Ivan G. Seidenberg, said in a statement. After starting in 1966 at New Jersey Bell Telephone, Mr. Babbio worked in engineering and network construction there and at AT&T before the phone monopoly was broken up. He also served as chairman of the global wireless group at Bell Atlantic.

Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, trying to end the biggest crisis of his nine years in power, apologized for accepting money from friends in the early 1990's, which he has characterized as loans.

1494-> Bolivia Indians Hail the Swearing In of One of Their Own as President
LA PAZ, Bolivia, Jan. 22 - Evo Morales, a Socialist protest leader and steadfast critic of American policies in the region, was sworn in Sunday as president of Bolivia, the first Indian to hold the position in this landlocked country whose indigenous majority had long felt oppressed and cut off from political power. With tears welling in his eyes, his left fist raised and his right hand over his heart, Mr. Morales, 46, an Aymara Indian, took the oath of office as the leaders of 11 countries, American diplomats and the crown prince of Spain watched from the gallery of the country's ornate 19th-century Congress. The son of a shepherd who grew up in an adobe home in the frigid highlands, Mr. Morales was dressed true to his anti-establishment roots, in a wool jacket featuring white pre-Hispanic motifs on the lapels and an open-neck shirt, but no tie. Outside, tens of thousands of people celebrated, many of them Aymara and Quechua Indians, tin and silver miners, coca farmers and leftists from around the world. They blew cow horns, danced to brass bands and waved the seven-colored wipala flag of the Andean Indian nation. By evening, Mr. Morales and his vice president, Álvaro García, a former guerrilla leader who spent five years in jail for rebellion, had joined them. "This is a historic day," said Gregorio Mamani, 43, like Mr. Morales an Aymara. "I am so happy that after so many years, we have an indigenous president, one we can be proud of before the whole world." In the Congress, Mr. Morales asked for a moment of silence for Inca martyrs, for the Argentine guerrilla Che Guevara, who died in a failed effort to start a revolution here in 1967, and "the millions of humans who have fallen in all of Latin America." In a rambling, passionate speech that mixed Spanish and Aymara, Mr. Morales did not veer from the populist themes that enthralled his followers and gave him a landslide win in the election on Dec. 18. He criticized "neoliberal reforms," the American-backed free-market prescriptions that are now being tested throughout the continent, for failing to pull Bolivians out of poverty. He lamented that there were no high-ranking Indians in the army, and he railed against the corruption of past governments. Mr. Morales promised to "change our history" and give voice to the downtrodden. "I want to say to you, my Indian brothers concentrated here in Bolivia, that the 500-year campaign of resistance has not been in vain," Mr. Morales said moments after being sworn in. "This democratic, cultural fight is part of the fight of our ancestors, it is the continuity of the fight of Tupac Katari, it is a continuity of the fight of Che Guevara." But while Mr. Morales is clearly among the more anti-establishment in a crop of leftist leaders who have recently swept to power in Latin America, he has tempered his tone since his victory and has spoken of the need for Bolivia to trade and build ties with other countries. "I have learned that the president of a government has to do good business deals for his country," Mr. Morales said Sunday. Unlike his predecessors, Mr. Morales enters the presidency with overwhelming good will from inside Bolivia and beyond. The economy is solid, having grown at 4 percent in 2005, the best measure in years. The International Monetary Fund in December wrote off the country's $231 million debt, while the deficit has shrunk significantly, thanks to higher tax revenues and spending constraints. Political analysts say the sound economic picture, coupled with the mandate that propelled Mr. Morales to power, should give his government time to maneuver. Still, he has to keep in mind supporters in the crowd like Gregorio Machicado Quispe, 48, who said, "We expect a complete change." "The government needs to favor the poor, suffering classes," he said. "We have to control the wealth here in Bolivia." Gustavo Torrico Landa, 46, a congressman from Mr. Morales's Movement Toward Socialism Party, said: "The government has to show that it has begun to function But it's not like Evo on the 22nd becomes president and this becomes Switzerland on the 24th." Indeed, Bolivian officials close to Mr. Morales, including his top economic adviser, Carlos Villegas, said in interviews that the government was carefully considering what economic path to take. That means determining everything from how to attend to poor farmers, a priority for Mr. Morales, to how much foreign aid to receive from the United States and other countries, which officials say cannot come with tough conditions. Mr. Morales and other officials have also said trade is important, but have not decided what kind of agreements should be signed. In the meantime, Bolivia plans to ask Washington for an extension on a preferential trade deal that ends in December, Mr. Villegas said. "The only path for Bolivia is to open itself to the world, but under better conditions than in the past," said Juan Ramón Quintana, another adviser to the president. The policies that will be most closely watched, especially by multinational oil companies like Petrobras of Brazil and Repsol of Spain, will be in Bolivia's huge natural gas industry. Mr. Morales plans greater control, increasing taxes on the companies, but on Sunday he also said his government needed help from energy experts in formulating a policy. Mr. Morales's history as leader of the country's coca farmers, and his campaign pledge to become a "nightmare" for the United States, has worried American officials concerned that his presidency could lead to instability and increased drug trafficking. On Sunday, he praised one of his closest allies, Fidel Castro of Cuba, and he warned that the United States could not use the fight against drugs "as an excuse" to "dominate and submit other peoples." Yet, in his speech after the swearing in, he also welcomed Thomas Shannon, the assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, who was at the inauguration. Mr. Morales had a cordial meeting on Saturday night with Mr. Shannon and David Greenlee, the American ambassador, which will probably lead to more talks. "We have international support," Mr. Morales said. "There is international solidarity."

1495-> Martínez and Floyd in Better Health
PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla., March 15 - Manager Willie Randolph likes to say his mood can be measured by how long Ray Ramirez, the head trainer, spends in his office every morning. A few weeks ago, when Pedro Martínez's troublesome toe represented the Mets' only major injury concern, Ramirez could drop off a report and be in and out in less than a minute. Recently, however, the duration of his visits has increased to the point that he may consider eating breakfast in Randolph's office. Carlos Delgado revealed his elbow tendinitis, Cliff Floyd disclosed a potential kidney problem and Juan Padilla had season-ending ligament-replacement surgery on his right elbow. But within a 90-minute span Wednesday, Martínez and Floyd each had good news regarding their health. Martínez forged ahead in his recovery, throwing batting practice for the first time this season. Afterward he said that he felt great and that he intended to throw another session before pitching in a game toward the end of next week. Floyd returned from a consultation with a kidney specialist, who told him his kidneys were functioning at 65 percent efficiency -- an improvement of nearly 20 percent since the Mets' initial physical in mid-February, but still not an ideal number. The specialist also told him that his creatinine and blood-urea-nitrogen levels had returned to normal. In other words, Floyd said, he is no longer in danger of kidney failure, as was previously feared. "When she walked in, the first thing she said was that she had good news," Floyd said. "I thought that was sweet. Now, it's over and I can get back to playing ball." The 33-year-old Floyd, who has a family history of kidney problems, was told a week ago that his kidneys were functioning at 48 percent efficiency. He had several tests, including an ultrasound, last Thursday to assess his condition. Dr. Barbara Murphy, chief of the division of nephrology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said that it was not unusual for kidney function to improve that drastically in a few weeks. "The results sound as if he has an underlying problem and that something triggered this latest episode," Murphy said in a telephone interview. "Sixty-five percent is not normal for a man of his age, but it may be normal for him. He can still function very well with his kidneys functioning at that level." Floyd said that his doctor had prescribed medication to lower his blood pressure and told him to limit his salt intake and drink more water. But, he said, he is not at a point where he needs to take medication to counter the effects of kidney damage. Earlier, Martínez threw 61 pitches to the minor-league hitters Corey Coles and Rafael Arroyo, trying a few breaking balls and changeups toward the end. He said it took a few pitches to adjust to seeing a hitter. Over all, he and Rick Peterson, the Mets' pitching coach, were pleased. "I felt good, a little stiff, but that was expected," Martínez said. "After I threw a few pitches and I let it go, everything went back to normal." The toe injury still prevents Martínez from running, so he tries to increase his stamina by using an exercise bike or an elliptical trainer. His plan is to make his first start next week, probably against Florida on Thursday, when he would presumably pitch two or three innings. At most, Martínez would have two more starts before camp breaks April 1. Tom Glavine will probably pitch opening day, with Martínez going about five innings in a start during that first week. Martínez would not speculate on how many games he would need to pitch to deem himself ready for the regular season. INSIDE PITCH Aaron Heilman responded to Brian Bannister's outstanding performance Tuesday by throwing four scoreless innings Wednesday in the Mets' 8-5 victory against the Washington Nationals in Viera, Fla. Heilman struck out three and allowed three hits. Victor Diaz hit a solo homer, and Sandy Martinez added a two-run homer. Four players were reassigned to minor league camp, most notably the left-handed reliever Mike Venafro and the right-handed pitcher Alay Soler.

1496-> World Business Briefing | Asia: Japan: Nintendo Raises Outlook
The Nintendo Company raised its profit outlook for the fiscal year ending in March as a result of robust sales of its Nintendo DS hand-held game machine and software. Nintendo, which makes game machines and Mario and Pokémon video games, also expects its new console, Wii, to drive earnings higher in the second half of the year, it said. Nintendo's group net profit for the fiscal year was expected to jump to 100 billion yen ($847 million) from its previous outlook of 83 billion yen ($703 million). Sales were expected to hit 740 billion yen ($6.27 billion), up from the previously forecast of 640 billion yen ($5.42 billion). The company, which is based in Kyoto, said it was confident its new Wii console, the successor to the GameCube, would also help profits when it is released later this year.

1497-> Aging, and Producing, Well
To the Sports Editor: Re "No Record, No Foul: No Need for a Salute," (May 9) on Barry Bonds: Murray Chass makes a great point about Major League Baseball's decision not to salute Bonds for passing Babe Ruth, who is No. 2, not No. 1, in career home runs. But when you dig deep into the numbers to try to prove that Barry Bonds is chemically enhanced because he hit so many home runs at an advanced stage of his career, pitchers should be examined as well. Take a look at Nolan Ryan's numbers and his strikeout totals from the ages of 40 to 43. Take a look at Randy Johnson's strikeout totals from 36 to 39. Even take a look at Roger Clemens. Were all three of these players chemically enhanced or could it possibly be that they were, or are, superior athletes? Should their statistics be questioned as critically as those of Barry Bonds? Not every baseball player has to deteriorate from 36 to 40, or even to 43 in Ryan's case. Baseball does not have the physical wear and tear on the body like football or basketball.
