174-> At the Rialto
There is something faintly reminiscent of J. C. Furnas's treatise about dismemberment on the highways in the first reel or two of "And Sudden Death." But once the new film at the Rialto takes up the screen play concocted by Joseph Moncure March, it becomes enmeshed in hackneyed melodramatic situations. A certain heavy handedness of direction causes several of the film's more violent scenes, such as the one in which a scatter-brained juvenile sends his car crashing into the guard rail of a bridge and hurtling down the embankment into the river, to lose much of their effectiveness.As a crusade against reckless driving the film lacks conviction, chiefly because it broaches a vital subject with typical Hollywood timidity. Lieutenant James Knox, the crusading traffic officer, never should have become acquainted socially with Betty Winslow — young, beautiful and wealthy, but a potential murderess when seated behind the wheel of her high-powered roadster. But meet they do, and the impetuous Betty is, by the power of romance, transformed into a speed-conscious motorist. Her irresponsible brother, Jackie, continues to mix Scotch and soda with gasoline, however. The result is, of course, that on one of his escapades. Jackie's car crashes into a bus loaded with children. And following in the self-sacrificing footsteps of Ann Harding, Betty assumes responsibility for the accident.Betty's is a noble gesture, but there ought to be a law prohibiting heroines from shielding juveniles like Jackie, who frankly admits, "I have a yellow streak a mile wide down my back," after his sister is sentenced to prison. Tom Brown succeeds admirably in making Jackie a thoroughly disagreeable character. There also are competent performances by Randolph Scott as Lieutenant Knox, Frances Drake as Betty and Joseph Sawyer as the motorcycle officer whose son is killed in the bus crash. But the real acting honors must go to Porter Hall as the District Attorney and to Jimmy Conlin, who appears briefly as a disgruntled owner of a suburban cottage. AND SUDDEN DEATH, from a story by Theodore Reeves and Madeleine Ruthven; screen play by Joseph Moncure March; directed by Charles Barton, produced by A. M. Botsford for Paramount.Lieut.

214-> At the Palace
A moderately entertaining melodrama from the Twentieth Century-Fox studios, "36 Hours to Live," is sharing the double-feature bill at the Palace this week with Warners' reverent transcription of "The Green Pastures." The new film, another of many dealing with the G-men, is at its best during its first half when it discusses the dilemma of a gangster who, rather unwillingly, is promoted from Public Enemy No. 5 to Public Enemy No. 1.Fearing that he will share the same fate as his upper-rankers, Duke Benson, the gangster, is further tricked by fortune when he finds himself the holder of the winning ticket in the sweepstakes. On his way to claim the prize—the first honest money ever to come his way—he meets a girl reporter and Frank Evers, a G-man assigned to capture him, and, from that point, the picture veers from its quasi-humorous path into the more familiar melodramatic channels, ending with the usual climactic gun duel in the gangster's hide-away.The episodes aboard a train, where a considerable part of the action takes place, are made all the more pleasant by the presence of Stepin Fetchit, that streak of brown lightning, as a blundering porter. The principal roles are engagingly played by Brian Donlevy as the G-man, Gloria Stuart as the girl reporter, Douglas Fowley as Benson and Isabel Jewell as the gangster's wife. 36 HOURS TO LIVE, from a story by W. R. Burnett; screen play by Lou Breslow and John Patrick; directed by Eugene Forde; a Twentieth Century-Fox production.Frank Evers . . . . . Brian DonlevyAnne Marvis . . . . .

THE TALL MAN" is a first book. And with one long and easy bound it jumps to the first rank among books of its kind. It is, moreover, a genuine novelty among mystery stories.

242-> 'Love Begins at 20' Opens at the Palace -- 'Traumulus' at the 86th Street Casino.
Martin Flavin's play, "Broken Dishes," Broadway, '29, and the instrument by which a promising newcomer, one Bette Davis, was introduced, has popped up at the Palace under the nom du cinema of "Love Begins at 20." First National's camouflage experts have disguised it further by changing the Flavin Bumpsteds into the Warner Gillingrwaters and by expanding homespun comedy into the furiouser and furiouser stuff of domestic farce. The alterations are not important; it still is lightweight entertainment dealing with the hen-pecked husband who finds courage in a bottle, coincidence his ally, and ultimately struts around wearing the pants in his family.Hugh Herbert has the Donald Meek rôle, which is about the best selling argument for the picture. Dorothy Vaughan is properly dictatorial as his spouse, Evalina. Patricia Ellis, as the rebellious daughter, and Warren Hull as her grocery-cerk suitor carry the minor romantic motif competently, and Robert Gleckler is in character as the gangster who used to be Evalina's wooer in the long ago and who had, for all those years, been held up to the hectored Horatio as the embodiment of everything he was not. The film has its moments of slight amusement, but the theme was far from original when Mr. Flavin treated it and it has whiskers down to here now.The other picture on the Palace's bill is "Girls' Dormitory," with Simone Simon. LOVE BEGINS AT 20, from Martin Flavin's play, "Broken Dishes"; adapted by Tom Reed and Dalton Trumbo; directed by Frank McDonald; a First National production. At the Palace.Jerry Wayne . . . . .

THE present-day English novel (when it goes far enough), like the present-day House of Commons, seems to be afflicted with the jitters.

On more than one occasion Presidential candidates have used the medium of the acceptance speech as a means of elaborating or illuminating party policies.

262-> At the Strand
Without taking sides in a controversy of such titanic proportions, it is no more than gallantry to observe that if Bette Davis had not effectually espoused her own cause against the Warners recently by quitting her job, the Federal Government eventually would have had to step in and do something about her. After viewing "Satan Met a Lady," at the Strand, all thinking people must acknowledge that a "Bette Davis Reclamation Project" (BDRP) to prevent the waste of this gifted lady's talents would not be a too-drastic addition to our various programs for the conservation of natural resources.A cynical farce of elaborate and sustained cheapness, it causes still other intelligent actors and actresses—including Warren William, Arthur Treacher and Alison Skipworth — to behave like numskulls, and deserves to be quoted as a classic of dullness, in future press notices, as often as "The Thin Man" —also based on a Dashiell Hammett theme—has been quoted as a classic of scintillating wit. As Mr. William's blonde and nit-wit secretary remarks, about midway of the action :"I've got a cousin who specializes in brain diseases. Maybe we'd better turn the case over to him." The suggestion is tempting but probably wouldn't work for the good reason that this particular case would defy the diagnostic technique of a Crile.So disconnected and lunatic are the picture's incidents, so irrelevant and monstrous its people, that one lives through it in constant expectation of seeing a group of uniformed individuals appear suddenly from behind the furniture and take the entire cast into protective custody. There is no story, merely a farrago of nonsense representing a series of practical studio compromises with an unworkable script. It is the kind of mistake over which the considerate and discreet thing is to draw the veil of silence, even if it takes three paragraphs.

"La Kermesse Heroique," which bears the subtitle "Carnival in Flanders," is an outstanding picture by any standards save those of strict moralists and stricter religionists.A sly, gay and impious farce, typically Gallic in its conception and execution, it whipped its way past the State Board of Censors before that august body had time to recover from the news that the photoplay had received the Grand Prix du Cinema Français and some sort of a gold medal award of the Venice International Exposition of Cinematography. At first, we are reliably informed, the State Board had banned it outright. But then, hearing about its international honors, it reconsidered and leaned so far backward in its charity that the de Maupassant flavor of the piece has miraculously, been preserved. Which is all to the good and will, no doubt, reflect undeserved credit upon New York's guides to filmic morals.Jacques Feyder, its director, and a completely heroic cast which includes Alerme, the Frank Morgan of France; Françoise Rosay of the Théâtre National, Jean Murat and Louis Jouvet, have worked comic marvels with the story. The place is Boom, a Belgian village, and the time is 1616, after Philip of Spain has conquered Flanders. The Burgomaster and his Aldermen are posing for their portrait in the Town Hall; the Burgomaster's daughter is pining for the Flemish painter; the butcher, and honored Alderman, has obtained the Burgomaster's consent to his marriage with the daughter in exchange for a beef contract; the Burgomaster's wife has promised to protect the lovely Siska from so unwelcome a husband.Then come the Spaniards! An insolent courier brings word that a battalion, led by their noble Duke, will spend the night in Boom. The Flemish burghers are panic-stricken: there will be murder, arson, the rack and dishonor to their women. So the stout but shaking Burgomaster conceives a stratagem: he will pretend he is newly deceased, Boom will go into mourning, the men-folk into hiding and the Spaniards, out of respect for the dead, will go their way in peace. But the women of Boom decide otherwise. Their husbands out of sight, they welcome the Duke and his men with true Flemish—or would it be Gallic—hospitality and the invaders are cheered as they resume their journey while the men come out of hiding to take full credit for Boom's heroic defense.A delightfully satirical libel upon the city of Boom and its masculine inhabitants, the film has achieved a delicate balance between broad farce and subtle humor which makes it one of the most refreshing and witty pictures of the year. Technically, it is equal, if not superior, to anything Hollywood has turned out this season. On a performance basis, Alerme's mock heroic portrait of the Burgomaster is superb, Louis Jouvet's sardonic characterization of the friar a model of comic implication, Mile. Rosay's lively sketch of the Burgomaster's wife thoroughly delightful and Jean Murat's gallant Spanish grandee suavely perfect. The minor rôles are excellently served by an appreciative cast. And do not, we beg you, be dissuaded from seeing it because the dialogue is in French. Even without the many English subtitles, "La Kermesse Heroique" would be clearly understood; like all great comedies, it speaks a universal language.Also on view at the Filmarte is the first of that anonymously produced series of pro-labor films which are being bootlegged out of Hollywood. "Millions of Us" is its name and, like most propaganda pictures, it reduces the questions of capital and labor, production and distribution, strike and lookout to their simplest terms. Still, it has been well made and may serve as an instructive, if one-sided, primer of labor thought.

590-> THE SCREEN; At the Teatro Campoamor
While the last reels of the Spanish-made film based on the familiar theme of amnesia, now at the Teatro Campoamor under the title of "El Desaparecido" ("He Who Disappeared"), furnish a fairly exciting climax, they hardly make up for the surplus of conversation and the paucity of action in the major part of the picture.The popular actor Ricardo Rambal does excellent work in the double rôle of the Spanish officer reported missing during the campaign in Morocco in 1921 and of the wealthy philanthropist suffering from loss of memory who arrives in the captain's native city of Zaragoza thirteen years later. Señorita Trini also acquits herself well as the girl who has been waiting and hoping all the time and who assures the new arrival that he is the missing officer, despite his uncertainty of recollection.A dramatic and complicated conclusion follows the marriage.

619-> At the Palace
Twentieth Century-Fox has not done right by little Jane Withers and the genial Irvin S. Cobb in the new film at the Palace. In "Pepper" she is still yearning for that machine-gun which she requested from Santa Claus about two years ago. But the only weapons placed at her disposal here are a couple of overripe tomatoes which she tosses at Mr. Cobb, who proves himself to be an obliging target.Although tomato-tossing may not be regarded as the proper pastime for little girls, Jane might be pardoned had she taken careful aim at the scenario writers who concocted "Pepper." The story is a sentimental description of the means by which an urchin saves a poor widow with twins from being evicted by a cruel landlord from her flat on New York's lower East Side, not to mention how this same little urchin worms her way into the heart of a crotchety old millionaire and prevents his daughter from marrying a spurious nobleman.The players do all that they possibly can with the material at their disposal.

THERE is, of course, no use in trying to change the persistent delusions about history.

993-> At the Palace
Ross Alexander, who has the part of super-promotion expert for Gasoline Substitute, Inc., persuades his secretary, the rôle taken by the lovely Beverly Roberts, during the course of "Hot Money," at the Palace, to become a stockholder in the new company, which he organizes by selling watered stock to a gullible public. The product with which he hopes to drive all the oil companies out of business is a liquid concentrate which, when mixed with pure water, can be used as a substitute for gasoline. Of course, the formula and its eccentric discoverer disappear quite conveniently early in the film and do not return until the investors start clamoring for their money.Patterned somewhat along the lines of "Get Rich Quick Wallingford," the new film is neither particularly good nor conspicuously poor farce. Thanks to competent editing and direction, it falls quite gracefully into that niche reserved for "amiable entertainments."Paul Graetz, exiled German character actor, is excellent in the rôle of the eccentric inventor. Mr. Alexander is especially well suited to his part and is helpfully assisted by Miss Roberts, Joseph Cawthorn and Andrew Tombes.

MR. DE LA MARE'S delicate dream-world remains as evocative and still as evanescent as ever.

1026-> ' Suzy' at Capitol Clears Spelvin Mystery -- Alex Botts Produces Earthquake at Roxy.
For years we have been hearing about George Spelvin, who is to drama what Anon is to the dictionary of familiar quotations, but until yesterday we never had met him. Spelvin is no mystery to us now; the Capitol's "Suzy" presents him boldly: "Gaston. . . . George Spelvin," reads the cast sheet, and Gaston is a billygoat. A faintly symbolic billygoat, in fact, who lowers his head, butts his way through a cabaret and obligingly charges out again into the nothingness that is offstage.Suzy must have been born under the sign of Capricorn, too. With padded horns of dialogue and venerable plot whiskers, it plunges across the screen, creates some mild excitement and careens out again, leaving us with a few esthetic bruises and a feeling that a little fresh air would do no harm.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer describes its romantic masterpiece as being based on the novel by Herbert S. German. Based seems too strong a word; one suspects that the studio simply tore out a few chapters, distributed them among Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell, Horace Jackson, Lenore Coffee and a few George Spelvins on its writing staff, and suggested they proceed from there. The final script indicates they retreated instead. Miss Harlow has been returned to her unsophisticated "Hell's Angels" days; Franchot Tone is some one out of "The Key"; Cary Grant was revisited with "The Eagle and the Hawk"; they found a place by the fireside for Lewis Stone."Suzy," as they have conceived it, is the tale of a shapely (we'll concede that to Miss Harlow, anyway) chorus girl who lingers in pre-war London in the hope of winning a title and a husband to go with it. She succeeds only partially, netting merely an Irish inventor, and then loses him on their wedding night when a mysterious woman shoots him down for having stumbled on a spy ring. Believing her husband dead—and she hardly waits for the belief to jell—Suzy dashes off to Paris, arriving in time for the Serajevo festival of 1914, and with surprising emotional elasticity hurls herself into another romance and wedding, this time with the French ace, André Charville.It is only a matter of time, as you no doubt have guessed, until Suzy and her husbands have their unwanted reunion, but it is an uncommonly long and dull time as such things go, filled with dewy-eyed close-ups of Miss Harlow grieving because her André—the wretch—spends all his furloughs with other women and never even writes a letter home. Interest picks up when the dénouement is reached, with the old spy ring taking an active part in the plot again, and the war is permitted to step between Miss Harlow and a four-inch lens. But it is scarcely adequate compensation for the romantic balderdash that has gone before.Miss Harlow's performance may be numbered among her least, and we still insist she would be wiser not to stray beyond the green pastures (no adv.) of comedy Mr. Tone can be thanked for the few honest moments of drama that the film possesses. His young Irishman is about the only convincing and natural character in the piece—other, of course, than George Spelvin, the goat. SUZY, based on the novel by Herbert Gorman; screen play by Dorothy Parker, Alan Campbell, Horace Jackson and Lenore Coffee; music and lyrics for "Did I Remember" by Walter Donaldson and Harold Adamson; directed by George Fitzmaurice; produced by Maurice Revnes for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

1076-> Metro's Film of 'Romeo and Juliet' Opens at the Astor -- 'My American Wife' at the Music Hall
Metro the Magnificent has loosed its technical magic upon Will Shakespeare and has fashioned for his "Romeo and Juliet" a jeweled setting in which the deep beauty of his romance glows and sparkles and gleams with breathless radiance. Never before, in all its centuries, has the play received so handsome a production as that which was unveiled last night at the Astor Theatre. All that the camera's scope, superb photography and opulent costuming could give it has been given to it here. Ornate but not garish, extravagant but in perfect taste, expansive but never overwhelming, the picture reflects great credit upon its producers and upon the screen as a whole. It is a dignified, sensitive and entirely admirable Shakespearean—not Hollywoodean—production.That distinction is important. Heretofore the screen has placed an evil brand upon the Shakespearean plays it attempted to produce. Its Shakespearean tradition has been uncertain and largely one of failure. Twenty years ago Theda Bara played in one version of "Romeo and Juliet"; Beverly Bayne and Francis X. Bushman were the lovers in another. Ignoring these period pieces, relics of the early silent era, we come to the Pickford-Fairbanks "Taming of the Shrew" (with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor) and to the Warners' "A Midsummer Night's Dream," which impressed me, at least, as a pretentious and overstuffed fantasy.It is obviously impossible to discuss Metro's "Romeo" in terms of such predecessors. It would be equally unjust to treat it in the prescribed fashion of drama critics: virtually ignoring the production and estimating the play by the performances. Here the production is fully as important as the acting, and one's appraisal of the players must be an individual and personal opinion arrived at without application of the yardstick of stage tradition by which we measure our Romeos and Juliets. There is no precedent for this version, no stage or screen tradition to guide us in our consideration of the picture. Logically, if not chronologically, it is the first Shakespearean photoplay.Hastening, then, into our report: Metro has translated the play into sheerly cinematic terms. It has omitted about a fourth of the verse—sometimes at the behest of the Hays office, which disapproves Elizabethan English, more often because it was repetitious or in explanation of action which the stage cannot show, but which the screen can and does. The best known passages, however, have been spared: the balcony scene has lost a line or two, but Mercutio's ode to Queen Mab is intact. The Nurse once again is called a bawd and speaks like a female Rabelais. No "additional dialogue" has been added. So much for the mechanics of the script.In scene and motion, the screen has gloriously released the play from the limitations of the stage. The brawl in the Cathedral Square of Verona splashes over a few acres; the masque at the Capulets' home is brilliantly colorful; the balcony scene, no longer confined to a miniature window and painted garden, has a lush midnight beauty of physical things which merges graciously with the spoken rapture of the lovers' lines. Verona, in brief, and all the places within it have spread beyond painted canvas and stiffly standing props to come alive in their proper proportion, tone and hue. In such matters the screen is beyond the reach of the boards and footlights. Shakespeare would have gloried in the medium.But there is more to "Romeo" than mechanical perfection, and if we seem to have delayed unduly in reporting upon Leslie Howard's Romeo, Norma Shearer's Juliet and the others it is because the best news should be kept to the last. Considering the performances en masse, they are splendid. Here and there we can expect imperfections: Miss Shearer was not at her best in the balcony scene, Mr. Howard came a cropper in a few of his soliloquities—there must be some inherent antagonism between the screen and soliloquy—Conway Tearle was a bit on the declamatory side as the Prince of Verona.Fortunately we need not value a performance as the proverb instructs us to judge a chain. With more pleasure, and with a sense that this memory will endure the longer, do we recall Miss Shearer's tender and womanly perverse Juliet during her farewell scene with Romeo before his flight to Mantua. Bright, too, is the recollection of her surrender to uncertainty, fear and suspicion before swallowing the potion, and of that scene in which she finds her lover dead beside her in the tomb. Miss Shearer has played these, whatever her earlier mistakes, with sincerity and effect.Mr. Howard is a pliant and graceful Romeo, overly weak perhaps in those moments when his hot blood should have boiled and he shared some of Mercutio's fiery spirit. But as a wooer and whisperer of Shakespeare's silver-sweet lines, he is as romantic as any lady on a balcony might desire.And then, of course, there is John Barrymore, revelling—poseur that he is—in the rôle of flamboyant Mercutio and dying with dignity and a Shakespearean pun on his lips. And Basil Rathbone, a perfect devil of a Tybalt, fiery and quick to draw and an insolent flinger of challenges. No possible fault there. And Edna May Oliver, the very Nurse of the Bard's imagining; droll, wise, impish in her humor and such a practical romanticist at that. She is grand. And Andy Devine as Peter—"I do bite my thumb, Sir!"—and spoken like a true Elizabethan clown with a frog's voice and canary's heart. For the rest a blanket salute: to C. Aubrey Smith for an admirable Capulet, to Reginald Denny for a carelessly proper Benvolio, to Ralph Forbes as a gallant and fond Paris, to Violet Kemble Cooper for a brisk and matronly Lady Capulet, to Henry Kolker for a troubled Friar Laurence.Talbot Jennings has adapted the play wisely, and George Cukor has directed it as briskly as the quality of the tragedy permits and the pageantry of the picture will bear. We reach the end of the film with this realization: the screen is a perfect medium for Shakespeare; whether Shakespeare is the perfect scenarist for the screen remains uncertain. Metro's film of "Romeo and Juliet" is a lovely thing; if it should not be well received the fault will not be Hollywood's. It will mean only that Shakespeare has become a literary exercise or a matter for a drama cult's admiration. Somehow we cannot believe that.

That's the gist of "Nobody's Fool," which would probably make a compact three-reeler. But then, "Show Boat" is enough to justify a visit to the Albee.

1462-> Minor Notes on 'Hollywood Boulevard,' Now at the Rialto, and 'Trouble Ahead,' at the Globe.
There is, in "Hollywood Boulevard" at the Rialto, that sorry combination of cynicism and maudlinism which commonly drips through a newspaper man's novel about a newspaper, a seaman's story of the sea or a script writers screen play about Hollywood. For your memory book, Paramount has assembled a score of filmdom's once-greats—you will find Francis X. Bushman, Maurice Costello, Mae Marsh, Creighton Hale and Jack Mulhall among them—and has used them as the frame for a picture of their composite; a matinee idol on the skids.John Halliday has the thankless task of being the horrible example. His John Blakeford, forgotten but not yet gone, strolls down the Boulevard, loiters in the Brown Derby and the Trocadero, buttonholes directors, pleads with his agent and carries on an elaborate pretense, which fools nobody, that his star still sparkles brightly. Then a scandal-mongering publisher urges him to dictate his memoirs and prints them serially, after they have been doctored by a sensationalist ghost writer, as the Love Life of John Blakeford.You will not be surprised to hear that these flaming chronicles affect the lives of Blakeford's divorced wife and daughter and threaten, ultimately, to involve the publisher's wife, who, it seems, had shielded from her husband her former association, of whatever nature, with the actor. It is, as you may judge, a pretty hoary melodrama and slight enough excuse for a whole series of homilies upon the uncertainty of fame and fortune in the glamour city.And we felt pathetically embarrassed for the former stars and featured players who appeared as extras, bit players and background. Hollywood, having neglected them all these years, at least should have had the decency and good taste not to make them parade themselves as Exhibits A, B and C of the Forgotten Men and Women of filmdom.
