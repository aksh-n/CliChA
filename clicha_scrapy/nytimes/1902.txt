170-> FACTS WANTED ABOUT IRELAND

The interview published in THE TIMES of Friday last, in which Mr. Crimmins stated that Ireland is "prosperous" and "loyal" to the English throne, is a glaring sample.

--------
189-> SPECULATION AS TO THE FUTURE.
To The Editor of The New York Times: The striving to probe the mystery of the fate of earth will forever send men to seek the why and wherefore in the realms of the supernatural. The stimulus afforded by the quaint tales of Biblical times, the belief that the age of miracles is not past, nor that the number of God's prophets is limited, continues to extend the hope of spontaneous revelation.

--------
194-> MILLET'S CAREER.; The Story of His Life Told by Juila Cariwright.
MILLET'S life, simple as it was, affords golden opportunities for a biographer.

203-> THE LOOKER-ON.
IT HAS been long since so colossal a jest as this big, boisterous, Tartarized German, the Grand Duke Boris, was perpetrated upon a civilized people.

205-> DEVERY FLEES FROM MOB; Chief Boards a Car and then Jumps Into a Cab.

--------
216-> RUSKIN.; Frederic Harrison's New Life of The Great Critic.
MR. HARRISON'S apology for a new life of Rubkin is one that will prove generally acceptable.

--------
229-> Some Recent Verse.*
Ellen Glasgow's thin volume of verse, printed by the De Vinne Press, comes robed in elegant simplicity; or, one might almost say, in Quaker splendor. A single poem, no better nor longer than the others, gives the book its title, while its bold, black type seems grateful and inviting to the eye. In this cool and sober grayness we should suspect that serious thinking, at least, with fluent art, might find its fit environment. 
--------
230-> Article 13 -- No Title
II. The New York Times Saturday Review of Books: Apropos of Mr. Sprague's interesting contribution to the very rich (and unworked) field of translators' blunders, there is a curious one in a French version of one of J.F.

--------
231-> TRADING IN BALTIMORE.
BALTIMORE, Aug. 21. -- The local market to-day was less active and less aggressively bullish, though the general tone was satisfactory.

In a lively game of baseball Cincinnati defeated New York again at the Polo Grounds yesterday by the score of 4 to 3. The local men outbatted the visitors 13 to 6, but their hits were inopportune, and two runs went to Cincinnati through errors by O'Neill and Smith in the third inning.

--------
238-> ON UPPER ST. REGIS LAKE.; The Twombly Camp Being Made Ready for Fred W. Vanderbilt -- Unique Improvements to Other Camps.
PAUL SMITH'S, N.Y., June 7 -- The H. McK. Twombly camp on Upper St. Regis Lake, which Fred W. Vanderbilt purchased recently, is being made ready for the coming of Mr. Vanderbilt.

--------
239-> THE KAISER AND THE POLES.

363-> Prompt Aid to the Injured.*
All sensible people who believe "that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing" deprecate that class of books which has for title something like this, "Every One His Own Doctor."

WASHINGTON, Sept. 10. -- While M. Lessar's notice of the intention of the Russian Government to expel foreigners from Manchuria has not been formally brought to the attention of the State Department, it can be predicted safely that, for the present at least, the United States Government will look upon this matter as one involving Russia, China, and Great Britain, and as one in which it is not directly concerned.

752-> AN OCTOGENARIAN OPTIMIST.
"We judge of a man's wisdom by his hope," said EMERSON, most characteristically. In that case, said MATTHEW ARNOLD, how supremely wise was EMERSON himself.

Premier BOND of Newfoundland is likely to gauge the feeling and to estimate the interests of the Newfoundlanders better than the Canadians, and if, as appears probable, he has put fresh life into the negotiations of 1891 with the United States, it must be that interest as well as feeling prompt the islanders to draw closer the commercial connections between us and them.

793-> "EDUCATION" IN MUSICAL TASTE; Some of the Recent Work that Has Been Influencing Great Masses of People.
WHY is it that "education" is an idea that is supposed to be so distasteful to large masses of people when they think of music?

Mme. Wiel's little book on Verona well deserves a place in the excellent Mediaeval Town series.

The paramount consideration in the framing of a platform by the Republican State Convention will be the success of the ticket; questions of National policy will not be allowed to obtrude themselves. 
--------
802-> BROOK FARM AGAIN.
There seems a spring of perennial interest in the mere name of Brook Farm.

--------
803-> PHILADELPHIA PRICES.
PHILADELPHIA, June 30. -- The local stock market to-day displayed pronounced firmness, with a good demand for Union Traction, Reading, and Cambria Steel, but the trading signified nothing, the same interests operating at times on both sides.

--------
888-> "The Path to Rome."*
Mr. Belloc is really too unkind to the librarians. As though they had not already enough to do without worrying over a new problem of classification! The title suggests, of course, theology; we open the book and notice the pictures and quickly substitute travel; we begin to read -- anywhere -- and within ten pages we are tossed to and fro among fiction, philosophy, archaeology, and ethics.

895-> WOMEN AND MURDER TRIALS.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I do not know why women should be called morbid any more than men because they take an interest in the trial of a human being for his life, and why they should not attend such a trial and wish to understand the methods of the laws to which they are as amenable as men.

PARIS, Oct. 3. -- Zola's tragic death is the sole topic of interest in Paris, though in conversation many people seek to avoid it rather than reawaken the echoes of the terrible "affaire."

CHICAGO, Sept. 14 -- While Chicago bankers generally commend Secretary of the Treasury Shaw's plan to protect the country against a shortage of currency, they believe the demand for money will fall short of the mark estimated by Eastern financiers. They say that the rain and cold will retard the shipment of crops and that the call for money will extend over October and November, instead of coming all at once this month. 
--------
1048-> Through Science to Faith.
While in a general way the attitude or Dr. Smyth toward science is that of the new theology in its average implication, not many of his theological contemporaries sound a note so brave and confident. Not only has he put far behind him the antagonism with which theology met the Darwinian science and the Spencerian philosophy; the compromising spirit of the period succeeding that antagonism is equally foreign to his disposition. 
--------
1049-> W.T. DANNAT AGAIN HONORED.; Receives an Order from the King of Portugal -- Well-Known American Artist Now Occupied with Automobiling.
PARIS, July 12 -- W.T. Dannat, the American artist who was recently made Commander in the Legion of Honor, the highest distinction ever accorded by the French Government to any foreign painter, has just received the Commandership of the Portuguese Order of Notre Dame de la Conception from the King of Portgual, who is himself a painter and a great admirer of Dannat's talent.

1050-> WHAT IS DOING IN SOCIETY.
The week end with its house parties approaches. Already Friday is a species of clearing day, and before Saturday at noon the greater number of the men in society have departed for Newport and nearer resorts. Most of the club dances are arranged for Friday and Saturday evenings. And yet this Summer, more than any other for years passed, has seen many familiar faces in town during the dullest part of the season. 
--------
1051-> WAR DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE; Secretary Root's Reply to F.B. Thurber's Testimony. GEN. WOOD'S CUBAN FUNDS The Fact That Mr. Havemeyer Had Also Made Payments Signified Nothing, He Said.
WASHINGTON, June 12 -- Secretary Root, when his attention was drawn this evening to the testimony of F.B. Thurber before the Senate Sub-Committee on Relations with Cuba yesterday, said there is no occasion for him to do more than state that the payments alleged to have been made to Mr. Thurber had been made by the Cuban Government, with the full approval of the War Department. 
--------
1052-> LONDON LETTER.

--------
1056-> Indignation at Mascagni's Arrest.
ROME. Nov. 10. -- The arrest of Signor Mascagni at Boston has caused an unpleasant impression in Italy, and much indignant comment is heard. The papers ask if, in view of the personality of Mascagni, his arrest could not have been avoided, and inquire what would have been said in the United States if Mark Twain had been arrested in Rome for breaking the law through ignorance. 
--------
1057-> POUNDED A LOADED CARTRIDGE.; Boy May Not Recover from His Injuries and a Girl Is Hurt.
MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., Nov. 2 -- Charles Eggers, Jr., seven years of age, was badly injured this afternoon by an exploding cartridge while he was playing in a field close to his home.

"What is that strange-looking beast in there?" said a man yesterday morning, who had followed the crowd into the Aquarium, and joined the bigger crowd that stood around the tank in which a scaleless, finless, flatheaded, six-toot-long, snakelike fish was to be seen. 
--------
1061-> Eastern League Games.
NEWARK, Aug. 8. -- Jersey City's baseball team broke Newark's winning streak to-day by all-around better playing. Moriarty replaced Fox in the fourth Inning and did good work. Home runs by Carr and Schrall and the batting of Carr, Shindle, and Schrall were the features. Score:

--------
1063-> Princeton's Football Receipts.
PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 23. -- The attendance at the Yale-Princeton game on the 17th was much the largest that has ever been here. It exceeded the attendance at the Yale game two years ago by 4,000.

--------
1064-> TRACY, THE HUMAN EEL.
Outlaw TRACY'S press agent broke down Thursday morning from brain fag. The Seattle reporter who was engaged to take his place drove into Covington after midnight, but still in time to get his dispatch on the wires before the morning papers of the East went to press.

SARATOGA, N.Y., Sept. 30. -- The Democratic Convention, which was opened here at noon to-day, compared with the Republican Convention, held here a week ago, was almost as different in point of attendance and enthusiasm as an east side mass meeting is from a session of the Asiatic Association. 
--------
1066-> STORM SWEEPS CAPE MAY.; Bathers Leave Ocean's Edge, Clouds Meet, and Water Spouts Form Off Shore.
CAPE MAY, N.J., Aug. 24. -- The timid who were superstitious enough to believe that the tidal wave predicted by the Rev.

WHEN Miss Irene Vanbrugh, who had long been known in London as a competent but nowise extraordinary actress, became suddenly distinguished as Sophie Fullgarney in "The Gay Lord Quex," Mr. William Archer, in the happiest of phrases, described her as having "walked into fame on the arm of Mr. Pinero." 
--------
1070-> STRIKERS RESORT TO THE BOYCOTT; Non-Union Men and Their Families Refused Supplies. Strikers' Children Leave School Be- cause of Presence of Non-Union Men's Children -- Mines Are Flooding.
WILKESBARRE, Penn., June 4 -- There is very little change in the situation since yesterday. Perhaps there is more excitement in the settlements surrounding the collieries, but the breaker boys and women have been responsible for most of the disorder thus far reported. 
--------
1071-> SUBSIDY FOR CUNARD LINE.
LONDON, Sept. 30. -- The Directors of the Cunard Steamship Company sent a letter to the shareholders to-night setting forth the terms of the proposed subsidy.

--------
1072-> BROOKLYN, 6; ST. LOUIS, 3.

--------
1074-> The Blind Trotter Rhythmic; A Marvel of Speed Whose Performances Astonished Horsemen This Year -- Other Celebrated Blind Horses.
THE lovers of light-harness sport have looked long for something like a sensational performer aside from the pacers. At last they have been rewarded, for in the blind trotter Rythmic there has appeared a harness race horse who gives every promise of upsetting all the traditions of the trotting turf and one who, if he lives up to the expectations of his trainer, will crowd Cresceus close for the championship honors.

--------
1076-> BAR HARBOR HAPPENINGS.

--------

The man back of the suit is Francis D. Carley, whose meteoric financial career is a matter of familiar history it the Street. 
--------
1079-> FIRE IN CLOTHING FACTORIES.; Flames in Fairbanks Company's Broome Street Building Do Damage Amounting to $60,000.
A fire which caused $60,000 damage and for a time gave the firemen considerable hard work, was discovered shortly after 11 o'clock last night in the building at the northwest corner of Elm and Broome Streets. It is seven stories in height, built of brick and of modern construction, amd is owned by the Fairbanks Company, manufacturers of scales and gas engines. 
--------
1080-> An Elegy and Some Songs.*
Epicedial or elegiac poetry, which is common to every literature, ancient and modern, is prominent in all the periods of English verse. It is noticeable not only in the work of Chaucer and Spencer, but it appears early in that of the earliest Anglo-Saxon writers. It is not, of course, unnatural that so great and striking a mystery as Death should stir the soul to pictorial and strophed expressions of attachment and lament. 
--------
1081-> TRADING IN BALTIMORE.
BALTIMORE, Md., Oct. 1 -- There was some buying of Seaboacds at fractionally better figures, due to a growing conviction that the system is likely to occupy a position which may develop better ultimate results for it than if it were to go in the Louisville deal on proportionate terms. Holders of the stock claim it is a bull point, it matters not how the sequel may turn. 
--------
1082-> BOWERY CHEERS FOR TIMOTHY D. SULLIVAN; The London Theatre Packed from Pit to Dome.
State Senator Timothy D. Sullivan and his friends gathered last night in the London Theatre for a final campaign hurrah. There seldom has been a meeting where there was a more unanimous sentiment of affection for the chief speaker of the evening. The man who would have dared to suggest the possibility of the State Senator not being the next Congressman would have gotten in trouble in short order. 
--------
1083-> THE DISSOLVING COAL STRIKE.
When the anthracite strike began public opinion was largely with the miners. As it progressed, and the operators maintained an attitude of dogged silence, apparently well content with the prospect of long-continued idleness, the sympathy with the miners strengthened. Within the past few weeks the sentiment has changed radically. 
--------
1084-> A SENATOR SELF-DECEIVED.
It is easier for any camel to go through the eye of any needle than for a Republican Senator to see and admit the true reason for the failure of the Cuban reciprocity treaty. Senator O.H. PLATT of Connecticut begins an article in The North American Review in a spirit of candor and frankness that enlists the sympathetic interests of the reader. 
--------
1085-> FOOTBALL ON RAIN-SOAKED FIELDS; Low Scores the Rule on Account of the Uncertain Footing -- Columbia Barely Scratched Victory From Buffalo -- Indians Beaten By Bucknell -- Harvard Substitutes Show Well.
While all of the big college football elevens succeded in winning their games yesterday, the scores in nearly every instance were low. Yale made only 10 points in the game with Brown, while the navy succeeded in keeping Princeton from scoring more than 11 points. Cornell and Pennsylvania were scored upon, and the famous Carlisle Indians were badly beaten by Bucknell at Williamsport. 
--------
1086-> THE PROMISE OF THE SOUTH.
"Yours is an opportunity such as your fathers never knew." These were the words of Mr. RICHARD H. EDMONDS to the boys of the Georgia School of Technology at its recent commencement.

--------
1088-> IN THE REAL ESTATE FIELD; Interesting Deals on Sixth Avenue and Long Acre Square.
More than ordinary interest attached to much of last week's business and several purchases in regions of established activity promise well for the general resumption of large operations, when the deterrent influences now furnished by a tight money market and the coal strike shall have passed away. 
--------
1089-> CAVALRY REMOUNTS.
According to the cable, Gen. CORBIN was so much impressed with the Kaiser's charge, at the culmination of the German manoeuvres, at the head of a division of cavalry, and especially with the endurance of the horses, that he means to urge the formation of a Government stud to supply animals of equal capability for our army. 
--------
1090-> WILQUE'S FIVE-HEAT RACE; New York Trotter Took Woodruff Purse After a Long Contest. THE RAJAH WAS VICTORIOUS Driver of Sphinx S. Fined for "Laying Up" in Novelty Race for Pacers at Brighton Beach.
Two $5,000 stake races at the Brighton Beach track yesterday made an ambitious programme, and one that drew a fair attendance and also made good sport. The course was lighting fast with dust flying from the opening of the sport to the finish, in spite of the repeated efforts of the track managers to water it and keep down the dust. 
--------
1091-> SEEKS DOWER RIGHT IN REALTY WORTH $300,000; Walton's Alleged Widow Appears Long After His Death.
Title to property in the Bronx estimated to be worth more than $300,000 is in dispute because a woman has appeared who says that she is the widow of George Walton, who in selling the property swore that he was unmarried. He died suddenly in City Island on Feb. 25, 1901. Walton left no will, and it was not suspected that he had left a wife. 
--------

For more than a year thefts of fine underwear by the thousands of dollars' worth have continued from the establishment of Henry Lewis, a manufacturer, at 70 Wooster Street. He says he cannot estimate his loss, but puts if at at least $15,000. At Police Headquarters last night he identified goods worth $5,000 that had been recovered. 
--------
1094-> Favorable Weather Conditions Utilized by Bar Harbor Colony.; Outdoor Sports in Addition to Dinners and Other Indoor Functions Now Claim Their Share of Attention -- Prominent Society People Who Have Entertained During the Week.
BAR HARBOR, Me., Aug. 16. -- The wails and lamentations because of the inclement weather have given way to shouts at joy at the sun's reappearance. Society has straightway plunged hungrily into the vortex of gayety, as if to make up for the opportunities snatched from them by the fog and rain. 
--------
1095-> BAY SHORE'S HORSE SHOW.; Summer Society Made the First Day of Open-Air Exhibition a Big Success.
Long Island Summer society gathered in force at the second annual Bay Shore Horse Show, which began at the Oakwood Driving Park, Bay Shore, yesterday afternoon.

Tammany's Executive Committee will be called together by Chairman Daniel F. McMahon on Sept. 19 for the purpose of electing a new leader of the Wigwam. The plans for the meeting have been arranged. The present Advisory Committee of the organization, called the triumvirate, is to be abolished and in its place there will be a leader -- one man. 
--------
1097-> THE VATICAN AND THE FRIARS.
It is well for the pretensions of the Papacy that the question of the friars in the Philippines is not a question of faith and morals, upon which the Pope has delivered himself "ex cathedra." Because, if it were, his infallibility would at once be brought into question. The common sense of Europe is already arrayed against the Vatican upon this question. 
--------
1098-> A CHEAP GOVERNOR.
Has Gov. BENJAMIN B. ODELL any merit but cheapness? Is he efficient in anything but cheese-paring? These questions are fairly forced upon the attention by the Republican State Committee's multitudinous output of documents showing how many dollars, cents, and mills Gov. ODELL'S economies have saved for the people of New York. 
--------
1099-> WALL STREET TOPICS.
No change in the Bank of England's rate of discount. 
--------
1100-> CHICAGO QUOTATIONS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 11. -- A rise of nearly 10 points in Swift stock to-day, and dealings aggregating more than 1,000 shares, stimulated the general list. There was no news as regards the combination, in which the stock is evidently being bulled, but the identity of persons acquiring it suggest that progress is being made in the scheme. 
--------
1101-> GOVERNMENT COAL MINING.; Senator Mason's Bill for Federal Control, in Public Interest, in Case of Long Strikes.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28. -- Soon after the reassembling of Congress Senator Mason will introduce his bill empowering the Attorney General of the United States to go into court and ask for the appointment of a receiver to take possession of and operate any coal mine that may remain idle for any unreasonable length of time because of a strike.

Only six of the seventeen athletes who took part in the invitation cross-country run of the Brooklyn Athletic Club yesterday completed the course of eight and one-half mile.

--------
1104-> FATALLY SHOT HIS BROTHER.; Longshoreman Also Wounded His Sister-in-Law and Escaped Over House Roofs.

--------
1108-> Pittsburg Baseball Team Lost.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct. 11. -- The AllAmericans and Pittsburg baseball teams played another game to-day that was a pitcher's battle. But for Leach's error in the seventh it would have resulted in another scoreless game, as on Friday. The error in question allowed Lajoie to reach first whence he scored on hits by Wallace and Harley. 
--------
1109-> A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY.; Republican Candidates in Stamford, Conn., Beaten for the First Time in Ten Years.
STAMFORD, Conn., Oct. 7. -- For the first time in ten years the town election in Stamford went Democratic yesterday, and importance is attached to it, as the Democratic candidate for first Selectman was the avowed candidate of the local trades unions. This is in keeping with the action taken in Hartford, Ansonia, and Bridegport last Spring, in electing labor candidates for Mayor. 
--------
1110-> GOV. STONE'S ACTION.
The action of Gov. STONE in adequately garrisoning the anthracite district with State troops, to the end that disorder may be suppressed, life and property protected, and mining resumed if any considerable number of miners really want to return to work, is commendable from every point of view. 
--------
1111-> COLOMBIAN TROOPS ON VENEZUELAN FRONTIER.; The Two Countries Seemingly on the Verge of War -- Secretary Hay Likely to Offer the Good Services of the United States.
WASHINGTON, June 4 -- Venezuela and the United States of Colombia appear again to be on the verge of war. Colombian troops are massed on the Venezuelan frontier and are preparing to invade the neighboring republic.

--------
1113-> A Literary Agent.
William Morris Colles, one of the foremost of the English literary agents, who has been making a brief visit in New York, sailed for Liverpool on the Majestic last Wednesday.

--------
1114-> OFFICIAL CUBA USES AMERICAN DOLLARS; Efforts Making to Exile the Coins of Spain. Some Peculiarities of the Proposed Tariff -- The Souvenir Postal Card a Popular Hobby.
HAVANA, Cuba, Sept. 15. -- As Spanish gold and silver is constantly changing in value, and by law all coins bearing the likeness of Queen Isabella, issued in certain years, were reduced in value, there has come to be a general feeling that Cuba should have a certain monetary standard which should not be subject to fluctuations. 
--------
1115-> MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION'S PAMPHLET.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The Merchants' Association of New Torte has published and is distributing a pamphlet containing a protest against the demand for an eight-hour labor clause in the proposed Pennsylvania Railroad tunnel franchise. The booklet contains some sense and considerable nonsense. 
--------
1116-> THE OPERATORS AND THE COAL STRIKE.
It is much to be regretted that there is no summary and exemplary way of bringing the anthracite operators to a realizing sense of their obligations to the public.

--------

--------
1118-> OUTSIDE SECURITIES.
Prices were firm in the outside market yesterday, but there were few stocks in which the fluctuations were of sufficient importance to attract special attention. Trading was on a somewhat smaller scale than on the earlier days of the week, the Rock Island stocks and others which had beep very active showing relatively small totals yesterday. 
--------
1119-> PRESIDENT CALLS SENATORS TO CONFERENCE(2); Will Discuss the Question of Tariff Revision. It Is Said, MR. HANNA OPPOSED TO IT. He With Messrs. Spooner, Lodge, Aldrich, Allison and O. H. Platt Will Be Consult- ed by Mr. Roosevelt.

--------
1122-> PHILADELPHIA PRICES.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 5. -- The effect of the heavy dealings in Pennsylvania and Reading for the last two days in the Philadelphia market was seen to-day in a decided broadening of interest in this city, not in the stocks named, but in the wide diversity of securities dealt in. Pre-eminent, however, in the movement was Philadelphia Electric. 
--------
1123-> THE FINLAND READY TO SAIL; New Red Star Liner One of the Two Biggest Ships Ever Built in This Country.
The Finland, one of the two largest ships ever built in the United States, arrived in New York yesterday from the yards of the William Cramp  Sons' Ship and Engine Building Company, Philadelphia, and will be put into the New York Antwerp service of the Red Star Steamship Line. Her first trip will be made next month, sailing from this port on Oct. 4. 
--------
1124-> THE TAX ON SAVINGS.
The savings banks of this city are wise in contesting the rule of the State Controller in regard to taxing "dividends." It is their plain duty to ascertain by appeal to the highest tribunal whether the demand of the Controller is in accordance with law. Of course, if it is, the banks will comply with the law until it is changed. 
--------

--------
1205-> THE JAPANESE BLUEJACKET.; Interesting Character, Combining Pluck and Politeness, of Jack of the Far East.
He is adequate, knowing, sinewy, and agile, and behind his kindly smile is a bundle of qualities for which the heedless Western world, judging superficially, does not give him credit. He is the Jack of the Rising Sun, and his modesty of demeanor is merely the cloak that conceals from the gaze of every passer-by many stern, sterling qualities. 
--------

To the Editor of The New York Times: Your correspondent, Dr. Burton, may be right in his contention that dogs carry infection, but it is my very candid opinion -- with the doctor's pardon! -- that he would be unable, despite his forty years of the practice of medicine, to substantiate his opinion in a court of law.

ONE of the few old-time customs which still prevail among orthodox Jews in New York is the sacrifice of the Kippurah, or votive fowl.

The indecision of the London authorities in dealing with the problem of the rapid structural deterioration of St. Paul's Cathedral, and the apparent reluctance of the clerical magnates and Vestry to admit what is known to every engineer and expert who has had to do with the matter, are producing conditions which those concerned for the safety of this venerable structure are warranted in considering alarming. 
--------
1213-> OUR MINISTER TO ROUMANIA.
The new Minister to Greece may not find all of his duties as agreeable as that of representing his country at the Court in Athens. Part of those duties consists of attending in Bucharest to the affairs of the United States with respect to Roumania; since Mr. HAY dispatched his famous letter about Jewish immigrants hither from Roumania we are not exactly cherished in that part of the world with a warm attachment.

1362-> The Sacrifice.*
In laying out the plan for "The Just and the Unjust," Mr. Richard Bagot is most particular. Ton might deem the method of the romancer as somewhat prolix, but the situation requires it.

--------
1371-> CUNNING OF WOODPECKERS.
Real, genuine forethought is a thing with which birds are but seldom charged. Nature teaches her feathered children to build their nests in anticipation of the nesting time. But that a bird should think out several steps of a natural phenomenon and deliberately plan several weeks ahead for banquets of bird delicacies is almost too much for the most ready believer. 
--------
1372-> Notes on New Novels
There is some very good characterization in Ellen Thorneycroft Fowler's new story. "Fuel of Fire," (Dodd. Mead  Co.,) and the play of wit and epigram in her dialogue, though it may occasionally bewilder a plodding reader, never tires him. Miss Fowler preserves Her reputation for verbal smartness, and she tells her almost plotless story with sustained buoyancy.

1396-> CONDITIONS IN SARATOGA,

BALTIMORE, Dec. 29. -- The local market showed greater strength to-day with signs of a reviving activity which was prevented from becoming aggressive by the reactionary tendency in New York, aggravated by the continuance of tight money here.
