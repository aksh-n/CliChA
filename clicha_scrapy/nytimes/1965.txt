457-> Screen: 'Andy' at Beekman:Simple Tale Succeeds at Modest Level
THE level on which to take "Andy," a drama of a mentally deficient man, written and directed by Richard C. Sarafian, which opened at the Beekman yesterday, is that of the small, special picture that doesn't pretend to the large amenities, but aims to tell only a modest story and to do it sensitively and well. On that level, which might be compared to the theatrical category of Off Broadway, it admirably succeeds in its intentions — except at the very end.Its story, if story you may call it, is simply that of this 40 - year - old man, a massive moron, but harmless (except when he gets excited now and again and makes disturbing commotions in the slum apartment building where he lives with his elderly, foreign-born parents, whose only child he is).When the picture begins, the old folks are about to send him away—to an asylum, where they hope he will be safer and more comfortable than he is with them. But the move is a cruel and severe one because they love their poor son very much and the prospect of separation from him tugs at their sad and lonely hearts.The night before he's to leave, his anguished mother gives him $50 to "go out and have a good time." With this the sluggish, stolid fellow goes to the neighborhood bar. There he almost kills a shifty character who tries to take his money from him, and then, in a wild and jangled frenzy, he goes stumbling through the streets for the rest of the night.He passes the time with two seedy winos, he threatens a pimply-faced kid who is shooting at a toy bear in a shooting gallery, he goes up the river front and has a hallucinatory meeting with a neighborhood child he knows. Then he spends the rest of the night with a pathetic, played-out prostitute from the bar, before going home at daybreak to face his parents and the solution his father contrives.It is simply a forthright demonstration of the pathos and irony of a subnormal human condition in a poor environment, where the intellects and circumstances of people are not as presentable to the needs as are their hearts. And it is done by Mr. Sarafian in an interesting, old-fashioned style much favored by German directors back in the silent days when they used to make what were known as "street films," emphasizing the garish flow of life in the city streets.It is a style that is properly suited to the impressionistic content of this film, which drifts from stark realities into murky, tangled, grotesque mental realms. And through it all, Norman Alden, as the leading character, gropes his clumsy way, giving a throbbing sense of the great, gross energy and the pitiful childishness and inadequacy of the man.As the parents, Tamara Daykarhonova and Zvee Scooler are superb—genuinely wracked and struggling old folks. They are the crux of the human drama that occurs. Sudie Bond is hideously effective as the prostitute, and Murvyn Vye, Ann Wedge-worth and Al Nesor are vivid as barroom types.Mr. Sarafian made this picture on a sort of experimental grant or extension of financing from Universal to demonstrate his capacities. Obviously has has a talent and a feeling for humanity that should be encouraged.On the bill with "Andy" is a 31-minute featurette, called "Door in the Wall"—a romantic and supernatural tale adapted by Glenn H. Alvey Jr. from a short story by H. G. Wells.It has to do with the curious obsession of an eminent British gentleman who is haunted by the memory of an experience, possibly a psychic experience, he had as a child. Played by Stephen Murray and Ian Hunter, it is the sort of reminiscent drama, that appeals to sentimental taste.Interestingly demonstrated in it is the use of what is called the "dynamic frame"—a means of contracting, expanding and varying the shape of the image on the screen, so that the whole or part of the panel may be used or the frame contracted so that it encloses, let us say, just the close-up of a face. The device allows a definite concentration and proportioning of attention at crucial times, but it tends to be disconcerting and gimmicky when too freely used. The CastANDY, written, directed and produced by Richard C. Sarafian; a Deran Productions, Inc. release distributed by Universal Pictures. At the Beekman Theater, Second Ave. and 66th St. Running time: 85 minutes.Andy . . . . . Norman AldenMrs. Cliadakis . . . . . Tamara DaykarhonovaMr. Cliadakis . . . . . Zvee ScoolerMargie . . . . .

476-> The Screen: 'Cat Ballou':Parody of a Western Opens at Victoria
MAKING fun of Westerns is an old and enjoyable sport with Hollywood movie-makers. It is also an easy thing to do, considering the obviousness of the Western formulas and the corniness of the clichés. Thus there is nothing surprising or unusual about "Cat Ballou," a cheerful lampoon of the two-gun horse operas, which opened at the Trans-Lux 52d Street and the Victoria yesterday.It is a carefree and clever throwing together of three or four solid Western stereotypes in a farcical frolic that follows—and travesties—the ballad form of Western storytelling made popular in "High Noon."There's the innocent young school teacher whose dear old daddy is gunned down by a killer for the monopolistic villain who wants to take over his valuable ranch. There are the two or three brazen young stalwarts who would like to help her but are powerless in the face of the organized antagonism of the cowardly citizens who want the villain to build his slaughterhouse. And there's the old and once-dreaded gunfighter the heroine desperately hires, first to give her father protection and then avenge his death.So the characters are familiar. It is just the way they are played and the gusto with which the plot is mangled that makes this a breezy little film.The heroine—the Cat Ballou—of Jane Fonda is a big-eyed, big-hearted grown-up child, a veritable Little Mary Sunshine, who takes to gunning and robbing a train with the gee-whiz excitement of a youngster confronted with a huge banana split. The lads who would like to assist her—Michael Callan, Dwayne Hickman and Tom Nardini—are younger and better-looking versions of the Three Stooges, with lively romantic overtones. And the aged gunfighter of Lee Marvin is a titanic and bleary-eyed drunk who, when he first tries to hit a target tacked up on a barn, doesn't even hit the barn.That's the combination, the quintet of innocents who become a gang of desperadoes when they hold up a train and make off with the money that's to be used to build the slaughterhouse. And the fellows compose the rescue party that snatches Cat from the jaws of death as she is about to be hanged on the gallows for shooting the villainous Sir Harry.It is fun, broadly played, with Mr. Marvin playing it in the broadest style — so broadly, in fact, that there are moments when it looks as though he is going to spread himself right off the screen. That is in the role of the gunfighter. He also plays Silvernose, a darkly menacing killer for Sir Harry, whom Reginald Denny hams.Photographed in color, which is also used to make fun of the photographic styles of several Westerns, most notably "Shane," and rigged with a couple of ballad singers, Stubby Kaye and the late Nat King Cole, to move into the picture at intervals and sing of what's going on, this "Cat Ballou" does have flashes of good satiric wit.But, under Elliot Silverstein's direction, it is mostly just juvenile lampoon. Saddle-sore television viewers should find it a soothing relief. CAT BALLOU, screenplay by Walter Newman and Frank R. Pierson, based on a novel by Roy Chanslor, directed by Elliot Silverstein and produced by Harold Hecht. Released by Columbia Pictures Corporation. At the Victoria Theater, Broadway and 46th Street, and the Trans-Lux 52d Street Theater. Running time: 96 minutes.Cat Ballou . . . . . Jane FondaKid Shellen . . . . .

574-> He Stars in War Film, 'None but the Brave.'
IF the threat of Frank Sinatra as a film director is judged by his first try on "None But the Brave," it is clear that there need be no apprehension among the members of the Screen Directors Guild. A minimum show of creative invention and a maximum use of cinema clichés are evident in the staging of this war film, which opened at the Palace and other theaters yesterday.Everything happens as hopelessly expected in this morbidly ordinary tale of the confrontation of a Japanese garrison and a transport planeload of United States Marines on a tiny, remote Pacific island, cut off from all communication, in World War II.The totally isolated forces fight like demons at the start, not only against one another but especially among themselves. The Japanese quarrel with their commander, who is a curiously unmilitary type; the Americans bicker and battle as to whether the captain of the plane or the lieutenant of the platoon is to be in charge.Eventually, under the influence of a feeling of comradeship induced by an exchange of fresh water for the services of a medical corpsman to cut off a wounded Japanese's leg, the beat-up and battle-weary enemies arrive at a technical truce, which they maintain until the American radio fellow finally gets his set going and calls for help. Then they take to fighting again as the Americans are leaving—and you can guess which force is wiped out.In putting it all together in a joint production with two Japanese companies, Mr. Sinatra, as producer and director, as well as actor of the secondary role of the booze-guzzling medical corpsman, displays distinction only in the latter job. Being his own director, he has no trouble stealing scenes, especially the one in which he burbles boozy wisecracks while preparing to saw off the shivering Japanese's leg. Mr. Sinatra is crashingly casual when it comes to keeping the Japanese in their place.He has a good deal more trouble with the American fellows. Clint Walker as the captain of the plane, Tommy Sands as the cocky lieutenant, Brad Dexter as a sergeant and Tony Bill as the radioman make over-acting—phony acting—the trademark of the film. What with incredible color and the incredible screenplay of Katsuya Susaki and John Twist, this adds up to quite a fake concoction.They used to make better war films at Monogram. The CastNONE BUT THE BRAVE, screenplay by John Twist and Katsuya Susaki, from a story by Kikumaru Okuda, produced and directed by Frank Sinatra; a co-production of Tokyo Eiga Co., Ltd., Toho Film and Artanis (Sinatra) Productions, Inc. Released by Warner Brothers. At the Palace Theater, Seventh Avenue and 46th Street, and other metropolitan area theaters. Running time: 105 minutes.Maloney . . . . .

580-> THE SPIRIT OF SELMA
Gay Talese's article on Selma, "Where's the Spirit of Selma Now?" (May 30), is much too cynical.

ROME -- A fact that strikes diplomats with experience in Communist China is that Peking, although continuing its violent anti-American propaganda, seems to have ceased referring to the United States as a "paper tiger."

655-> Letter to the Editor 4 -- No Title
I was very much surprised to learn, after reading Brigid Brophy on Louisa May Alcott, that Beth doesn't die in "Little Women." I grew up with the sad understanding that she did.

1035-> Over There, 1914-1918'
THE real worth and power of "Over There, 1914-1918," a French documentary of World War I, comes through most solidly in the sequence depicting the Battle of Verdun. The bleak, slogging, bloody, horrendous impact of this giant arena wasteland is memorably conveyed in vintage film clips showing misty terrain dotted with charging humans, stalking like unseeing zombies through mud and trenches and, in the best single clip of the picture, being loaded, lifeless after a bayonet charge, aboard a wagon like sides of beef.There is a terrible, freezing moment in yesterday's arrival at the Trans-Lux 85th Street and other houses, when the camera sweeps toward the horizon and the narrator says: "If all the men who died here could rise, they wouldn't have room to stand."On the whole, this picture is a sturdy and sensible—though hardly definitive—vintage panorama of events shaping the war, the enveloping whirlpool and the battle-grounds that led to the Versailles Treaty. It is far from being the supreme documentary on the great holocaust, just as "The Guns of August" missed the target by several miles.In context, if not actual footage, the two films have several things in common. There are many conventional scenes here, too—especially in the first part, which almost skittishly ticks off political events, dominated by shots of bobbing crowned heads, bowing politicians and restless masses, that brought on the war. Furthermore, in scenes showing the build-up of the mighty German war machine, an otherwise level-headed British narrator spews such fanciful sarcasm at the Kaiser that it gets monotonous.Also, many of the clips that follow, such as the Germans trotting into Belgium and a fleet of Parisian taxis jogging troops out to the front, have become familiar standbys by now. And finally, this film could have used more footage on aerial battles and the insidious impact of the German U-boat submarines.However, in general, the compilers of the footage, Jean Aurel and Cecil Saint Laurent, have assembled background clips that at least chart the war in straight, comprehensible chronology. Sound effects — interminable gunfire, car motors, even crickets—are substituted for a musical background—an inspiration on somebody's part in this Pathé Contemporary presentation.And best of all, with the Germans heading toward Paris, the picture doggedly clings to the battlegrounds themselves, whenever possible, as with Verdun and the Marne. Some of these scenes—new to us, at least—are stunning, such as one locust-like Russian cavalry charge in East Prussia. The earth-bound immediacy of actual combat comes through memorably, in all of war's filth, grimness and waste.This is the principal asset of a war documentary that complements history well enough but closes in even more impressively on the dirty business of combat. The ProgramOVER THERE, 1914-1918—a French documentary compiled by Jean Aurel and Cecil Saint Laurent; presented by Pathe Contemporary Films. At the Trans-Lux 85th Street on Madison Avenue, and other theaters. Running time: 90 minutes.

1064-> Screen: 'Empress Wu' Opens at 55th St.:Color Used Lavishly in Hong Kong Film
BEAUTIFUL but absolutely artless so far as cinema communication is concerned is the new Chinese film at the 55th Street Playhouse, the Shaw Brothers' "Empress Wu." Intended to tell the story of a famous woman who rose from a concubine to be a surrogate empress in China during the T'ang dynasty in the seventh century, it is a two-hour succession of richly costumed and ornamented scenes in which the drama of personal conflicts and intrigues is communicated almost entirely in dialogue.And what dialogue! It may be euphonious and eloquent to those whose ears are tuned to the meanings and accent of the Mandarin dialect, which is used. But for those of us who have to pick it out of the Chinese or English subtitles that glitter like strings of winking sequins at the bottom of the frame, it is dismally infelicitous and hard to follow and keep straight. It is also excruciatingly painful and punishing on the eyes.I must confess that I gave up trying to read it after the first hour or so, up to which point I had gathered that the beautiful and Imperious exconcubine had displaced a couple of rivals, including the legitimate empress, and had taken over the job of running the country because the emperor was suffering from dizzy spells.Exactly what happens thereafter I cannot tell you, nor is it made clear in the lengthy synopsis of the story provided by the theater. Apparently the empress disposes of a number of intriguers, singly and in pairs, mostly by talking to them and telling them where to get off.Screenplay, direction and acting are elementary to the point of naiveté, but the settings and costumes are gorgeous, even though stiff as boards, and photographed in a quality of color that makes one think of jewels. That and the enameled beauty of an actress named Li Li-hua, who plays the supposedly volatile empress with virtuous vapidity, may be sufficient graphic splendors to satisfy those who do not care that the drama is no more compelling than the first-reader stories of Dick and Jane. EMPRESS WU, screenplay by Wang Yueh-ting; directed by Li Han hsiang; produced by Run Run and Rumme Shaw at Movietown Studios, Hong Kong. At the 55th Street Playhouse, east of Seventh Avenue.
