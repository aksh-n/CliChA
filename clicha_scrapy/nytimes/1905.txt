--------
78-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Further reports from the gay Summer quarters of the Peace Conference are fearfully disconcerting in one regard at least. When on Tuesday Baron KOMURA and Mr. TAKAHIRA failed to "show that they liked" the salvo of feminine smiles and banzais with which they were greeted at their Portsmouth hotel, we put it down to a sense of diplomatic propriety and a chivalrous consideration for a gallant foe. 
--------

Mr. E.P. Hadley declared in a letter last week that your issue of two weeks ago was simply "bully." So say we all! And I want to say further that any week I can fret more bookish joy out of THE NEW YORK TIMES SATURDAY REVIEW than I can get elsewhere for twice the money. Long life to you!

Harold Randolph and Ernest Hutcheson, two pianists of repute from Baltimore, gave a recital upon two pianos yesterday afternoon in Mendelssohn Hall.

--------
98-> JAPANESE FISHERIES.
We were remarking the other day that the value of the concession of fishing privileges on the Siberian coast made by Russia, while it cost Russia nothing, was probably of far more value to Japan than was appreciated outside of Japan. It seems that the Japanese fisheries, like all other possible sources of Japanese wealth, have been made the subjects of a careful and scientific exploitation. 
--------
99-> THE COTTON OUTLOOK.
We respectfully call the attention of the gentlemen who are meeting to-day to fix a minimum price for cotton to things that have happened since their meeting was called, and perhaps their plans were adopted. There is more cotton, actual and potential, than anybody has imagined.

YALE'S QUARTERS, GALES FERRY, Conn., June 24. -- With Ortmayer in the 'Varsity eight-oared boat the rowing to-day was not intended to be a trial of speed, but rather to accustom the other men to the change made necessary by Daly's withdrawal.

--------
118-> SWINBURNE'S LYRICS.; A Consideration of Their Quality Based on a New Selection of the Poems, Arranged and Commented Upon by William Morton Payne.*
NO lover of English poetry will dispute that an anthology of Swinburne reduced to the proportions of a vade mecum is a desideratum. Such a selection has been attempted twice before, once by Richard Henry Stoddard in 1884, and once by the poet himself in 1887. Neither of these compilations is what lovers of poetry required, a "Golden Treasury," to use the title that Mr. Palgrave made both current and classical, of Swinburne's verse. 
--------

--------
120-> POLICE MARKSMANSHIP.
Mr. MCADOO is credibly reported to be much disgusted with the poor showing his subordinates of the force have been making as marksmen. In fact, the showing is very poor.

--------
121-> COMPLAINT OF JURY DUTY.; A Plea for More Consideration of Talesmen.
Every year thousands of men, to evade jury duty, either perjure themselves, refrain from voting, or adopt some other equally reprehensible course. The majority of them would gladly serve the State in that respect were they treated with fairness or courtesy by the courts, the officials, or the law. I am a traveling salesman.

136-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Irregularly Strong; Call Money Firmer, 3 1/2@4 1/2%. Higher Money and a Dubious Bank Statement No Bar to Improved Speculative Sentiment.
Stocks and money rose together yesterday, with that cheerful lack of logic which makes observation of the security market so far from an exact science. The explanation of the inconsistency is that the rise in money was too late, and promises to be too temporary, to offset other market factors. 
--------
137-> The City of Nomanana.
ONCE upon a time there was a great city where they believed that Tomorrow was only a shadow thrown forward by To-day, and the people that dwelt there called it the City of Nomanana. Every day was to them the last one. In accordance with this faith they lived. 
--------
138-> HUNTING ROJESTVENSKY.
The announcement that a strong Japanese squadron has been seen south of Hongkong and heading southward is ominous for the remnant of the Russian Navy. The announcement seems rather belated than premature. As a matter of fact, until the fall of Port Arthur the Japanese fleet was very hard worked.

--------
142-> THE CONSTITUTIONAL RETURNS.
Returns upon the constitutional amendments are at last arriving. The vote is supposed to be about one-half that of the various candidates, and all have a substantial majority, without much distinction regarding the merits of the various proposals.

153-> HOW FOLKS FEEL WHEN THE LINEK WARPS IN
THE biggest liner, a little late and therefore somewhat in a hurry, moved ponderously into her berth with the tide.

At the trial yesterday in the Supreme Court of the suit of Franklin, Scott  Co. against Joseph H. Hoadley and Joseph Leiter several witnesses were called to prove that Hoadley and Leiter were in the pool behind Judson at the time the brokers lost $65,800 by operating in the stock of the International Power Company.

305-> Adelaide Keim in Hamlet.
Adelaide Keim made her first appearance in New York as Hamlet in Shakespeare's tragedy last evening at the Harlem Opera House.

306-> AN APRIL FOOL REPORT.; Sixty-five Per Cent. of Infant Deaths Not Due to Impure Food.
In your issue of April 2 appeared an Associated Press dispatch which claimed that the Secretary of the Indiana State Board of Health had asserted that 65 per cent. of the deaths among infants in the United States last year were due to impure and adulterated food.

--------
307-> Review 5 -- No Title
If Mr. James Mott, whose list of obscure literary allusions was very interesting, but who seems unready to accept the offered solutions, will consult so concise a reference book as the Century Cyclopedia of Names for the name of Charlemagne's perfidious paladin, the world's by-word for treachery, he will find it in the three recognized forms of Ganelon, Gan, and Gano, followed by an "," indicating still other forms less familiar.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. -- That this country is in peril of a timber famine, and that there should be a National forest service to assist in preserving forests was asserted by President Roosevelt this afternoon in an address before the American Forest Congress.

316-> THE LONDON MARKET.
LONDON, March 18. -- Supplies of money were more plentiful in the market to-day and rates were easy. The indebtedness to the Bank of England is practically liquidated. Discounts were a shade easier on favorable Continental exchanges.

To link in one romance the glamour of Elizabeth's England and the Oriental magnificence of her Indian contemporary, Akbar the Great, shows a bold and adventurous imagination. This thing Louis Tracy has done, and the story he has woven of such rich material is a good story to read whenever of an idle evening you are in the notion to cheat yourself with borrowed splendors and lose yourself in the ageless land of dreams. 
--------
318-> HAGUE'S ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATED BY WOMEN; Oscar S. Straus, Kept Away by Illness, Sends Letter. CZAR DENIED WIVES' APPEAL Such a Country Deserves Dissolution, Mr. Straus Tells Peace Circle -- Addresses by Prominent Women.

A Faculty meeting has been called for to-morrow to hear the case, and if found guilty there is little doubt that Daly will be removed from the crew, necessitating a shake-up at the eleventh hour. 
--------
321-> Things the Audience Laughs at in "You Never Can Tell"
In such a performance as that of Bernard Shaw's "You Never Can Tell," which Arnold Daly and his company are presenting at the Garrick Theatre, much of the fun cannot be translated to cold type, as the "business" of the actors provides an important complement to the brilliant wit of the author. Many lines which would not cause a smile in the reading, become occasions for prolonged mirth when supplemented by the acting. 
--------
322-> SKIM MILK AGAIN.; Under Present Conditions It Is All Consumed, but Under False Colors.
In a back number of your paper I find an article from a correspondent advocating the use of skimmed milk as a nutritious food.

Charles Seribner's Sons have inserted a short biographical preface to the new edition of the late Francis H. Nichols's "Through Hidden Shensi." (8vo, pp. about 350. Cloth, $2 net.) which is appearing with many illustrations taken by and for the author. The writer says of Mr. Nichols:

330-> SOLDIERS' MONUMENT AT OGDENSBURG
SOMEWHAT different from the conventional monument to the soldiers and sailors who fought in the civil war is that which was unveiled last Wednesday at Ogdensburg, N.Y. It consists of a tall column of Barre granite surmounted by a bronze figure, a Winged Victory holding a standard in the right hand and extending a wreath in the left. 
--------
331-> SEASON'S HOTTEST DAY COOLED BY SLIGHT RAIN; Heat and Humidity Combine to Torture Humanity. FOUR DEATHS REPORTED The Only Respite Was the Electrical Storm and Shower in Afternoon -- Ball of Fire on Brooklyn Bridge.
The combination of high temperature and excessive humidity which prevailed in New York and its vicinity -- especially in Manhattan -- yesterday served to make the day the most disagreeable of the Summer.

SCATTERED over the eastern end of long Island, survivals of the period before and following the Revolution, are windmills of the type common in Holland and the southern counties of England, mills with four long "whips" or arms, with inner works made of huge timbers of oak rough-hewn by the axe and outwardly clothed with boards or shingles trimmed by hand.

340-> THE SPORTS OF STROUDSBURG; Bowling, Golf, Baseball, and Driving Divide Attention.
STROUDSBURG, Penn., June 17. -- Summer sports have the right of way in this resort town, and the tournaments of the Highland Country Club are creating widespread attention.

--------
342-> ETHICS AND LAW.
Mr. H.H. ROGERS is undoubtedly a very capable person in his own line. Even Mr. LAWSON, we believe, admits that. But Mr. ROGERS'S line does not appear to be ethics, in which he has just made his maiden effort. We are sure that it would not qualify him for a professorship of ethics, or even of casuistry, from any intelligent institution in want of such a functionary. 
--------
343-> No Personal Reflection on Mr. Carnegie.
Will you kindly permit me a word in regard to a reference to Mr. Andrew Carnegie, made by me in a brief talk at the Samuel M. Jones memorial meeting at Cooper Union last night, and referred to in to-day's TIMES under the caption, "Crosby Raps Carnegie." 
--------

Princeton's veteran lawn tennis player, Frederick B. Alexander, won the title and trophy of metropolitan champion yesterday on the dirt courts of the West Side Lawn Tennis Club, One Hundred and Seventeenth Street and Amsterdam Avenue. He defeated Ross Burchard in the final round in brilliant style and then took the championship because of the default of Holcombe Ward, the holder, as the latter is on his way to England with the American challenging team. 
--------
345-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Irregular; Call Money Rates, 2@3 Per Cent. A Morning Decline and Afternoon Recovery in the Market -- Money and Crop Report the Factors.
The early trading in yesterday's stock market was carried on under the influence of an advance in the Bank of Germany's official discount rate from 3 to 4 per cent., an increase in the price of bar gold in London and a ruling rate of 3 per cent. for call money in this market, with a small advance in time rates. 
--------
346-> LOADS OF BIRDSHOT FOR BLACK HAND MAN; Women Held Alleged Agent While Baker Got Gun. VISITOR CAUGHT AT HOSPITAL Had Fired Two Shots at Mount Vernon Man, Who Had Received Letters Demanding $500.
MOUNT VERNON, May 6. -- Antonio Fotti, an alleged agent of the "Black Hand Society," fired two shots at Giovanni Barberri, a baker at South Columbus Avenue and Sixth Street, Mount Vernon, last night, and then held the crowd at bay with two revolvers.

--------
347-> SYSONBY ROMPED OFF WITH COMMONWEALTH; Great Colt Always First for "Suburban Renewal" Handicap. WAS WINNER IN A CANTER Great Crowd Saw Running of Popular Race at Sheepshead Bay Track -- Bill Phillips's Stakes.

Keene's English-bred three-year-old colt Sysonby in the race for the Commonwealth Handicap at the Coney Island Jockey Club's Sheepshead Bay course yesterday. 
--------
348-> WASHINGTON, 9; CHICAGO, 1.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 5. -- Washington defeated Chicago to-day by 9 to 1. Walsh was batted out of the box, and Patterson, who succeeded him, fared little better. Hughes allowed the visitors but four hits. Fielder Jones, Hickman, and Cassidy made sensational catches of fly balls. Score: 
--------

Magistrate Pool had dealings yesterday in the Tombs Court with Anthony Comstock, who recently asked: "Who's Bernard Shaw?" 
--------
350-> QUAKERS WIN DUAL MEET FROM COLUMBIA; Develop Great Strength and Easily Defeat Morningside Men. GOOD TIME IN TRACK EVENTS Mile, Two Mile, and Pole Vault Result in Unexpected Reverses for Columbia's Sure Things.
Victory went to Pennsylvania in the dual track meet with Columbia yesterday afternoon at Columbia Oval, William's Bridge, by a score of 73 to 44. The Blue and White athletes did not show up nearly as well as had been expected, several of the men going to pieces at critical times. On the other hand, the Quaker team had several surprises in store for the Morningside collegians, and showed unexpected strength. 
--------
351-> EASTERN LEAGUE.; Soffel's Home Run Wins for Toronto -- "Rooters" Angry at Umpire.
NEWARK, N.J., June 11. -- The Torontos can thank Umpire Conway for to-day's victory over the Newarks. When it looked as though the Newarks would win in the fifth, they having tied the score with only one out and men on first and third, the umpire declared Jones out at the plate for interference. Jones protested so strongly that he was put out of the game. 
--------
352-> HOPPER EXPECTED TO-DAY.; Ahearn Will Not Act Until He Sees Him and Has Report.
Borough President Ahearn said yesterday that he did not expect any report on the Harlem building collapses until the middle of next week. Superintendent Hopper of the Bureau of Buildings probably will reach New York to-day. Until the commission of masons and builders, appointed for the purpose, has prepared its findings, the Borough President will not act, except to discuss Building Department matters with Mr. Hopper. 
--------
353-> ASSASSINS AND HEROES.
We are not a little afraid that the cheers and the enthusiasm which gave so much animation to the Murray Hill Lyceum meeting on Sunday afternoon were rather for the assassin of Grand Duke SERGIUS than for the cause of Russian liberty. Dr. TSCHAITOWSKY, the Social revolutionist who is a representative of the "Fighting Terrorists," was the most popular man on the platform, apparently. 
--------
354-> NURSES GET DIPLOMAS.; Sixteen Pupils at Bellevue Training School Receive Diplomas.
Sixteen nurses, in pretty striped gowns, white aprons, and caps, were graduated last evening from the Bellevue Hospital Training School for Nurses. The exercises were held in the dining room of one of the three buildings 426, 420, and 416 East Twenty-sixth Street, occupied by the pupil nurses and probationers of the school. 
--------
355-> APPLEJACK IN ANNANDALE.
In New Jersey's gazetteering nomenclature the name of Annandale modestly appears and it is not surprising that the commune should present an occasional outbreak of old-fashioned Scotch habits. A Sunday school festival was held there the other day, and before it was half over four-fifths of the persons assembled of both sexes and all ages were in a state of boisterous hilarity to which only an alcoholic origin could be ascribed. 
--------
356-> THE PROPOSED NEW STATES.
The House bill for the admission of the four Territories as two States, Oklahoma and Indian Territory as one and Arizona and New Mexico as the other, was a wise, conservative, and practical measure. It is a pity that the Senate has changed it by dropping out Arizona and proposing to admit New Mexico as a State by itself. 
--------
357-> CINCINNATI, 3; ST. LOUIS, 2.
ST. LOUIS, June 5. -- A two-base hit by Seymour in the ninth inning and a single by Barry, which scored Seymour, won to-day's postponed game for Cincinnati by 3 to 2. Score:

359-> ENVOY FOUND MENELEK AN UP-TO-DATE RULER; German Minister's Report of Visit to Moroccan Court. KING WEARS AMERICAN HAT Declares He Is a Jew and a Descendant of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba.
BERLIN, June 11. -- Dr. Rosen, Minister-elect to Morocco, has returned from Adis Ababa, Abyssinia, where he went as special envoy of Germany to King Menelek to conclude a commercial treaty with Abyssinia. 
--------
360-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Market Break Followed by Rally Which Caught the Traders Short.
The market had a very substantial rally yesterday, following a further break in the morning, and the traders as usual got caught short at the bottom. In the morning the market looked so weak that almost every trader on the floor went short of the market, and men who had bought stocks on the decline in the expectation of a rally thought it wise to get out again. 
--------
361-> VERY FREE IS SUZANNE, ALSO VERY CHARMING; Empire Audience Wonders Whether to Laugh or Be Shocked. SENSE OF HUMOR PREVAILS Cosmo Gordon Lennox's Play Splendidly Acted by Miss Tempest and English Company.
Was the polite assemblage at the Empire very much shocked last evening at the disclosure of a very intimate little attention of married life? 
--------
362-> Eight "Ghost" Stories.
Montague James Rhodes, Litt. D.., of King's College, Cambridge, England, author of "Verses on the Windows of Canterbury Cathedral," "Sculptures of the Lady Chapel at Ely," , has collected in one volume which Longmans, Green  Co. will bring out in America, eight tales, under the title, "Ghost stories of an Antiquary." 
--------
363-> OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN DOMINICA.
It is obvious that the gravest feature in the new arrangement with the Dominican Republic is the part we assume in the settlement of claims against that State. Practically this is the basis of the arrangement, since there would be no need of our intervention if it were not for the untoward consequences that might ensue from the collection of such claims on the part of foreign Governments. 
--------
364-> THE CALL OF THE RAIL.; Accused of Begging, Reavis Paints a Race Tack Panorama.
He said that he was Philander Q. Reavis, fifty-five years old, a bookkeeper. He was taken before the desk at the Tenderloin Station yesterday afternoon charged by Detective Morton with begging. 
--------
365-> FRANK M. BAKER INJURED.; State Railroad Commissioner Lost Toes Crushed by Car.
PORT JERVIS, N.Y., March 7. -- State Railroad Commissioner Frank M. Baker had his foot so seriously injured under a car wheel at the Erie station in this village last evening that all the toes had to be amputated. Mr. Baker was on his way from his home, in Owego, to New York City, and stopped off at a restaurant near the station to get his luncheon. 
--------
366-> IRISH PARADOXES.; More of T.W.H. Crosland's Swaggering Half Truths.*
IN his own manner of studied contrariness and in short, sharp phrases, artfully manufactured to make his readers sit up and take notice of the utterness of his contempt for commonly accepted opinions, the author of "The Unspeakable Scot" (and other paradoxical volumes) has written a book about the Irish. 
--------
367-> WHAT IS TEMPERANCE?; A Correspondent Takes The Times to Task for Its Use of the Word.
The editorial in THE TIMES of the 12th inst., on "Temperance and Total Abstinence,"' is not quite up to date in spite of its very positive character. There may be old dictionaries as much behind the times as THE TIMES itself, but that is not the case with the "Standard," the latest and best. 
--------
368-> LONELY POLICEMAN QUITS.; A Month Without Meeting a Human Being on His Post Too Much.
NEWARK, Sept. 16. -- Policeman Henry Holmes came in from Post 23 this morning and handed his shield and buttons to Capt. Cosgrove. Post 23 is the lonesomest stretch of territory in the city. 
--------
369-> MINING COMPANY DROPS NAME OF GOV. BRADY; Writes to President Roosevelt That Prospectus Is Withdrawn. NOT RE-ELECTED A DIRECTOR Other Concerns Complained That Alaska's Chief Executive Did Not Recommend Them All.
It became known yesterday that after a meeting of the Reynolds-Alasaka Development Company, held at its local offices. 60 Broadway, on Saturday, a letter was forwarded to President Roosevelt, in which it was announced that all the company's mining advertising literature containing the name of John G. Brady, Governor of Alaska, who has been criticised for allowing his name to be used to promote, as has been alleged, the sale of shares, had been withdrawn. 
--------
370-> THURSTON CALLS HALT ON MARITIME LEAGUE; Ex-Senator's Acceptance of Presidency Obtained by Trick. HE TAKES RESPONSIBILITY Says He'll Refund Money Subscribed -- Learns Lot About Concern at Meeting Attended by Organizer.
The American Maritime League, whose mail has been held up at the Post Office pending an investigation, and which, according to its prospectuses, numbers among its members some of the most eminent men in the country, was put out of business temporarily yesterday by its President, ex-United States Senator John M. Thurston of Nebraska. 
--------
371-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Decline in Northern Securities and High Money Features of Market. Last-Week's Trading Reflected Principally Purely Technical Conditions -- Opposite Considerations Likely Shortly to Govern the Course of Prices.
The decline in Northern Securities from 184 to 165 and the advance in call money to 7 per cent. were the events which characterized last week's stock market, and which, it may be, give the best indication of what is to be expected of the market when it reopens this morning after the three-day holiday. 
--------
372-> THE CAMPAIGN FUND SCANDAL.
The New York Life Insurance Company's contribution of $48,702.50 to the Roosevelt campaign fund last year, to which Mr. PERKINS has testified, will be considered by everybody under two aspects, and under each right-thinking men must hold it to have been immoral and flagitious. 
--------
373-> "The Stage Irishman."
" The Stage Irishman" was discussed at the London Playgoers' Club the other evening. Mrs. Meynell, the well-known author, who presided, remarked that the stage Irishman in England was very much like the stage Englishman in America. On the stage in America the Englishman was quite unreal. He was never supposed to see a joke, said Mrs. Meynell, amidst laughter. In England the stage representation of the Irishman was quite as unreal. 
--------
374-> CASH FOR LIGHT PLANT; COMPANIES SEEK TERMS; Aldermen Pass the Resolution Appropriating $600,000. CORPORATIONS' BIDS CUT If Municipal Plan Is Abandoned They Will Furnish Arc Lights at $120 and $115.
As an attempt to forestall the erection of a municipal electric lighting plant, the officials of the various gas and electric lighting companies have opened negotiations with the city looking to a material reduction in prices. 
--------
375-> DUMSER IN COLLISION WITH A HORNLESS COW; Barge Office Watchman Tried to Cross Bow Against Signals. HE LANDS IN SUBWAY DITCH Fractured Dignity Causes Him to Plead Illness for Day -- Cow Lays Course for Staten Island.
Peter Dumser, day watchman at the Barge Office, descended the stairs of the South Ferry elevated station promptly at 7 o'clock yesterday morning and headed for his sea wall post.

377-> A Novel Luncheon.
YES, there are good mid-day restaurants downtown," said the athletic young lawyer to his friend as the down-bound office-building elevators began to crowd with the hungry of noontime, "but that isn't what I mean when I say that a man can get the best luncheon on earth downtown." 
--------
378-> MR. OGDEN'S PARTY BACK FROM VIRGINIAN TRIP; Attended Installation of President Alderman at Charlottesville. ENTHUSIASTIC OVER GIFTS Company Considers That Rockefeller Donation Was Accepted in Proper Spirit of Thankfulness.
Robert C. Ogden and the party which he took to Charlottesville, Va., to attend the inauguration of Dr. Edwin A. Alderman as first President of the University of Virginia arrived in New York yesterday afternoon. Dr. Lyman Abbott and President James M. Taylor of Vassar College also shared Mr. Ogden's hospitality on the trip northward. 
--------
379-> THE COMMISSIONER OF LABOR.
The movement in opposition to the reappointment of Mr. McMACKIN as Commissioner of Labor has been a strong one, and there seems good ground to believe that it has been effective with the Governor. If that be correct -- and the criticism of Mr. McMACKIN has been very explicit and severe -- the question of his successor is pertinent.

In reflecting upon the wreck of the Central's 18-hour flier at Mentor, Ohio, following, as it does, so soon after the statement of an official of that road that the fast train had only been loafing, it would appear that railroad officials do not fully recognize the dangers attendant upon this extraordinary fast running.

--------
412-> THE GOLD PERIL.
The butcher, the baker, and the candlestickmaker -- that is to say, the average merchandiser -- never suspects that the price of his commodities depends upon the number of coolies imported into the Rand or upon the rate of dividends earned by the mines of Colorado.

--------
426-> A REVIVAL OF "DIPLOMACY."; Good Performance of Fine Old Play by Proctor Stock Company.
That generalizations are likely to prove unsafe with regard to matters of the theatre is a fact capable of easy and frequent demonstration. One builds up a conclusion based upon supposedly sound premises to prove that in the matter of playwriting there is an advance as constant, if not as marked, as in other lines of ambitious endeavor. 
--------
427-> HOW IT FEELS TO LOOP THE GAP IN AN AUTO; Brain Seems to be Bursting, Says Mlle. de Tiers. BUT SHE'S NOT AFRAID Paid at the Rate of $100 a Second -- Street Automobile Too Fast for Her.
Leaping through space in a 1,100-pound automobile, and getting $100 a second for doing it is the great feat a beautiful young French woman, Mlle. de Tiers, is performing twice a day at the circus at the Madison Square Garden. It is a hair-raising, heart disease performance. 
--------
428-> THE BRIBERY OF VOTERS.
The corrupt use of money at elections is already odious, but odium does not suffice to cure the evil. Senator BRACKETT'S bill which passed the Senate Monday night will go far to cure it, if it is enacted, for it makes election bribery exceedingly dangerous to the beneficaries thereof, that is, to the candidates whose election may be invalidated on proof of tile improper use of money. 
--------
429-> AMERICAN FICTION.; A Novelist's Study of the Work of His Fellow Novelists in General and a New First Story by a Young American Author in Particular -- Mr. E.U. Valentine's "Hecla Sandwith."*
MANY of us are philosophizing or are attempting to philosophize, at present, about the fiction of our country -- about all of it, or some especial part of it, or some particular piece of it. We praise, we overpraise, we underpraise. We express wonder, perhaps, that, as a whole, it can be so good without being better; so bad without being worse.

--------
432-> THE IMMUTABLE TARIFF.
Our neighbor The Sun is duly astonished at the publication in the columns of The Pittsburg Gazette of an article demanding the revision of the Dingley tariff. As our neighbor justly observes, Pittsburg is "the citadel town of the stronghold State of the protectionist faith," and The Gazette of that city is "a venerable and ever loyal protectionist journal." 
--------
433-> THE NEW STEAMBOAT RULES.
Steamboat owners have no just cause of complaint that the new code of rules of the Steamboat Inspection Service are stringent in some particulars, or that the convenience of those who must comply with them was not consulted as to when they should take effect. Experience has shown that very little can safely be left to the judgment and conscience of the steamboat owner in the matter of construction and equipment.

--------
436-> Charades.
Florence L. Sahler in her book "Captain Kidd and Other Charades," (New York: Robert Grier Cooke, $1.) has provided verses, and enigmas. The titles, including "Florentine Cloisters" and "My Motor Car," indicate the diversity of topics treated. Parodies, hits at bachelor maids, vegetarians, and the isms of the day, are interspersed with the more usual themes of versifiers, and underlying them all is the fascination of the puzzle. 
--------
437-> John Burroughs's New Book.
When John Burroughs's "Riverby" appeared the author declared that it was probably his last outdoor book. But, as he writes in the short note to his volume of essays, "Far and Near." "My life has gone on, my love of nature has continued, my habit of observation has been kept up, and the combined result is another collection of papers dealing with the old, inexhaustible, open-air themes." 
--------
438-> Another John Knox.
Under the title, "John Knox, A Criticism and an Appreciation," John Glasse, M.A., D.D., of Edinburgh, has expanded a lecture on John Knox, which the Macmillan Company is about to send out in this country. The writer has taken the story of the Scotch Reformation as told by others, especially by Knox himself. He writes in his preface: 
--------
439-> THE FINANCIAL SITUATION
Last week advances and declines so alternated that the net result was small, and the market had an appearance of indecision or confusion. Certainly it is impossible to say that the price movement throws any clear light upon the trend of the market. This cannot have resulted from lack of influencing factors, but might better be attributed to a surplus of them, the week being crowded with incidents adapted to affect prices powerfully and long. 
--------
440-> THE BATTLE OF MUKDEN GRAPHICALLY SET FORTH; Plans Showing the Five Stages of the Decisive Struggle. RUSSIAN COMMANDER'S ERROR Insufficient Care Taken to Keep Bilderling and Linevitch in Touch, and the Japanese Broke Through.

The cut was several inches long, and extended from under his right eye to his lip. The nostril was also torn. 
--------
444-> Tontine Policies Condemned on the Ground of General Welfare.
If life insurance is founded upon an ethical fallacy, as I believe it is, we should not be surprised to find the superstructure honeycombed with rottenness, as is evident from recent revelations. 
--------
445-> GOOD ROADS.
The argument made by Mr. SHATTUCK before the Chamber of Commerce would probably have been no stronger or more convincing, but it would certainly have carried more weight, if the gentleman presenting it had not been the President of the Automobile Club of America.

--------
452-> THE ELEVATED ACCIDENT.; No Excuse for the High Speed of the Ninth Avenue Trains?
The statement is made in the press that the direct responsibility for the tragedy on the elevated railroad yesterday has been narrowed down to two men, the motorman and the switchman. Nothing of the kind. When it is discovered, if it ever is discovered, whether the motorman had his signals set wrong and disregarded the switchman's signals, or whether the switchman made the mistake, the responsibility will still remain with the management of the company.

461-> CERVANTES.
It is agreed by the specialists that the first publication of "Don Quixote" occurred three hundred years ago this month.

It is necessary to interpret the bank statement by contraries nowadays.

--------
549-> ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.
The revolt of Arizona against being unequally yoked together with New Mexico in the bonds of Statehood seems to be sincere and general. It is made to appear that, by admitting the two together, Congress will establish a chronic feud of races and religions. The recent incident in Arizona itself, in which a mob interfered to prevent the adoption of American foundlings into Spanish Catholic families, indicates how such a feud would be waged.

--------
558-> GEN. KUROPATKIN AS A SCAPEGOAT?
The feeling of sympathy for Gen. KUROPATKIN on the ground that he has been made a scapegoat by persons more responsible and less blameworthy than himself is quite a natural one. It does not follow that his course is entirely justified.

--------
579-> THE "MORAL" ISSUE.
Mr. ROOSEVELT is nothing if not a moralist. Nothing seems realty to interest and arouse him if it does not present itself from the moral point of view.

To take an illogical position and fight for it is a frequent mistake of organized labor.

754-> THE CANADIAN MAIL ROUTE.
Perhaps New York and Chicago will be receiving to-day or to-morrow "specially addressed" letters from England via North Sydney or Montreal, and if so the postmarks should be noted carefully for the time of transit.

BOSTON consistently follows the advice of Dr. Holmes, "Don't be consistent," and nobody was much surprised when the late Miss Abby L.

--------
805-> A Scotch View of "Nancy Stair."
Inquiries as to the historic value of "Nancy Stair" having reached me from time to time, it seemed best to get the opinion of a Scottish writer of the Burns country rather than to trust to my limited knowledge of Scotland and her traditions.

--------
811-> MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP.
The unmistakably rapid growth of a sentiment in favor of the public ownership and control of all public utilities indicates a cheerful optimism which is difficult of comprehension when it is remembered in how many ways every large municipality fails to discharge the duties and obligations it has assumed anything like as well as it would expect and demand that these should be discharged by private corporations.

The People's Choral Union comes before the public but once in each season. The rest of the time it is working steadily every Sunday afternoon in Cooper Union, and to such good purpose that when it does give its public performance the musical public, or such of it as is there is moved to sit up in wonder and delight to think that there is such a chorus in New York and such choral singing. 
--------
826-> Review 3 -- No Title
It is agreeable to note that the literary tradition associated with the American Ambassadorship to London has been kept alive, in the minds of English-men, by our retiring Ambassador, Mr. Choate.

--------
827-> "Tom" Paine as an American Patriot

--------
838-> "UP THE STATE."
It is interesting to learn that the Republican editors "up the State" are firmly opposed to Mr. JEROME'S proposition to recognize in legislation the habits and desires of the people of the city, and to enact excise laws that can be enforced. It is particularly interesting to learn that the editor of The Roscoe Review "believes" that "the people in New York who want Sunday opening have got to give in to us." 
--------
839-> AMERICAN LEAGUE.; Hughes's Wild Pitching Helps New Yorks to Win -- Orth Injures Hand.
WASHINGTON, April 15. -- Orth's pitching was too much for the Washington team, and Hughes and two of the fielders behind him were just erratic enough to allow New York to win the second game of the year by a score of 4 to 0 in eight innings. Not one of the runs was earned, and the home team could hardly have given the game to the visitors with any less effort. 
--------

844-> THE POLICE AND THE BURGLARIES.
No doubt there is a good deal of truth in the plea of the police authorities that the force is too small to deal thoroughly with the prevention of burglaries under the conditions prevailing in the city during the Summer months. Entire protection, without more effectual co-operation than is given by householders, would be simply impossible unless the force were doubled or even trebled.

848-> IRON TRADE CONDITIONS.
Reviewing the situation in the iron trade The Iron Age says in its issue of to-day: 
--------
849-> Review 7 -- No Title
It seems to me that those who appear so excited at the atrocity of the expression "the hair stood on end" are lacking either in experience or in observation, or suppose that the expression means that each particular hair stood stiff and stark at right angles with the surface and straight as a lightning rod. 
--------
850-> BROOKLYNITES OPPOSE SHORTER SCHOOL DAY; Meeting of 200 Society Delegates Declares Against Plan. ONLY THREE SUPPORT IT Simply an Economy Measure, One Principal Declares -- Says There Is Too Much Economy Now.
Following the example set by Manhattan and Queens, Brooklyn last evening declared itself against the proposed "shorter day" plan by an almost unanimous vote at a hearing held in the Girls' High School before the Committee on Elementary Schools.

Scores:

John and Mary Kovak, twins, 3 years old, are in the Presbyterian Hospital suffering from fatal burns received in a fire in the rooms occupied by their parents on the fifth floor of the tenement at 1,325 Avenue A yesterday afternoon. That the children were not burned to death outright is due to the bravery of Daniel Lynch and George Knoener of Hook and Ladder Company No. 16.

DETROIT, Mich., Aug. 31. -- New York and Detroit furnished quite an interesting exhibition this afternoon, Detroit winning by a score of 5 to 0.

--------
859-> THE SURFACE RAILWAYS.
None of us escapes paying nickels to the city's surface railways, and if any of us could escape doing so none of us could help regarding their successive annual reports from the standpoint of civic patriotism as an excellent measure of the metropolis's progress. It is well to disentangle this aspect of the subject from the financial side. 
--------
860-> GEO. J. GOULD IN FINANCE; His Recent Policy Greatly Puzzles Wall Street. MANY FRIENDS ESTRANGED Why Gould Securities Are Discriminated Against by Speculators, and Even in Some Instances by Investors.
I. The last four or five years of George J. Gould's career in railroad finance have been so crowded with contradictions, and the "Gould policy" has become so inscrutable to Wall Street, that members of the financial community refer nowadays to the Gould situation only in terms of bewilderment, or as if it were a situation that had been brought about through the operation of secret and mysterious influences. 
--------
861-> COGHLAN PLEADS FOR NAVY.; Bishop Potter Amuses Company at Dinner of the Cincinnati.

The theory that the broker killed 
--------
863-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Stocks Lower -- Call Money Rates 4@5 1/4 Per Cent. Market Moves Irregularly -- Sterling Exchange Rises and Cotton Prices Advance.
Before the opening of the local stock market yesterday London was discussing a number of rumors the most sinister of which had to do with the health of a prominent financier of this city. This was a baseless fabrication, but it seemed not wholly unconnected with the lower prices for American stocks in the London market and the moderate sales for that account in this market. 
--------
864-> TO MEND LA SAVOIE'S SHAFT.; Damage to French Liner Probably Will Be Repaired Abroad.
The French liner Savoie, from Havre, news of the breaking of whose port shaft was reported by wireless telegraph late on Friday night, arrived at her pier in the North River at 8:30 o'clock yesterday morning.

ODESSA, July 1. -- 10:50 P.M. -- Matters appear to be becoming increasingly serious. 
--------
867-> CHINA AND THE WAR.
The application of China to be admitted to take part in the negotiations at Portsmouth was as reasonable abstractly as it was absurd practically. It was certain beforehand that the settlement would be at the expense, territorially, of China, since, excepting Korea and Sakhalin, Chinese territory, and the respective privileges of Japan and Russia therein, were alone in question. 
--------
868-> Cruises of the Y.M.C.A. Yacht Amazon; (See Pictorial Supplement.)
TWENTY THOUSAND members of the Greater New York Young Men's Christian Association and several times that number of their friends have been aroused to a keen interest in yachting by the quiet presentation to the association of the trim ocean going schooner yacht Amazon, ninety tons, 108 feet over all, by Commodore Arthur Curtiss James of the Seawanhaka Yacht Club and Cleveland H.

--------
871-> ABOLISH FOOTBALL, SAYS HARVARD BULLETIN; Or Radical Changes Will Have to be Made in the Game. PLAYERS COACHED TO "SLUG" Scathing Condemnation of Present Rules, Which Make Game Unfitted for Human Body.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 18. -- President Roosevelt's plea for changes in the rules governing college football found hearty support and indorsement in an article published to-day in The Harvard Bulletin, which it is asserted represents graduate sentiment. It declares that football ought to be substantially changed or else altogether abolished. 
--------
872-> THE MAYOR'S APPOINTMENTS.
The reports that are in circulation as to the intended changes in the departments to be made by the Mayor at the opening of his second term are more or less in the nature of "trial balloons," sent out to ascertain which way the currents are setting in the upper regions of party politics. 
--------
873-> "The Servant Question" --- Another Effort to Solve It; Fall Experiences in the New and Old "Meccas" of Servant Hunters; and the Reason the General Houseworker is Almost Extinct --- Taken from Life.
LET President Roosevelt, who so bravely and decidedly faces the "race suicide" question, weigh on the other side of the scales the "servant girl problem," and it will make interesting reading. It is scarcely possible, however, for any "mere man" fully to understand and appreciate the various causes that have led to the present conditions.

874-> Politics.; PARTY ORGANIZATION AND MACHINERY. The American State Series. By Jesse Macy, Professor of Political Science at Iowa College. Pp. xvii.-299, 16mo. New York: The Century Company. $1.25.
This study in political pathology will be a welcome addition to the books available to the student of political science. It is not a history of political parties, but a study of the growth and influence of two nearly evenly balanced and contending parties which the author believes to be absolutely necessary in the conduct of a democratic government like that under which we live and work. 
--------
875-> FOSTER-PARENT MURDERS TWO-YEAR-OLD CHILD; Because She Was "In the Way," Neighbors Say. MAN AND WOMAN ARRESTED Thousands Viewed the Little Body After It Was Found in Eleventh Avenue Tenement.

--------
876-> COTTON AND COTTON GOODS MARKETS.
The violent rise in the cotton market has a significance which it did not possess before the adoption of a sliding-scale arrangement between the employers and their operatives. The employes watched the option market like hawks, and when there was a sudden dip they demanded and secured a readjustment of their wages according to the margin between the selling price of cloth and the buying price of cotton. 
--------

--------
879-> Dr. Geer's Volume on Our Continental Growth in "The History of North America."*
THIS is the history of a movement, not of a period or an event. Indeed, the name is not perfectly descriptive of the subject, and the reader who consults this volume for a detailed and lengthy account of the acquisition of Louisiana will be disappointed.

--------
883-> THE DIFFERENTIALS ARBITRATION
The opinion rendered by the Inter-State Commerce Commission as to the preferences given to Philadelphia and Baltimore on exports of flour and grain is favorable to New York, so far as it goes. The reduction in the preferences recommended will, if carried out, undoubtedly correct some of the injustice heretofore done to this port.

884-> "A Liberal Education."; FACTS AND IDEALS. Short Studies of Life and Literature. By Philip Gibbs, Author of "Knowledge Is Power." 12mo. Pp. 324. New York: Longmans, Green & Co.
In a way this volume is a curiosity. Some thing about most things under the sun may be found in it, all seasoned with the sort of didactic sauce proper to little lay sermons for the plain people, who are not quite so plain. The matter appeared originally in provincial weekly papers in England. 
--------
885-> THE CHICAGO STRIKE.
That the Chicago strike is breaking up is evident from the fact that negotiations are in progress which usually precede surrender. It is not proposed to declare the strike at an end nor to lift the boycott against the concerns which have incurred the displeasure of the unions; but the strikers will quietly slip back into the places still open for them and defeat will be confessed without any demonstration.

895-> HOW THE AUCTION ROOM HABIT GROWS UPON THE NEW YORK WOMAN
THERE is always contained in the sweet of life something of bitterness, but when one has possessed cloisonne, Sevres, old Spanish faience, bronze busts, and Italian tables inlaid with mother of pearl, and these are placed on a common wooden table, flanked by two men of marble countenance and knocked off to the highest bidder, one may truly say:

ST. PETERSBURG, May 12. -- This acute question of neutrality, the cause of several diplomatic troubles, in France and even in Japan, the echoes of which only reach here very much attenuated, has not been made the occasion by certain organs of the St. Petersburg press and by administrative circles for showing us a little gratitude and even politeness.

New York defeated Brooklyn yesterday at Washington Park in the final game of the local series.

--------
913-> THE BUDDENSIEK REVIVAL.
The story of the collapse of tenements and other cheap speculative buildings all over Harlem, thus far to the number of eleven within a few days, but likely to be much increased before April 1, shows very clearly that we are experiencing a Buddensiek revival, and that the Bureau of Buildings is about as useful to the citizens of New York as is the Tenement House Department, as both are at present conducted.

Your correspondent, C.Z. Burgess, in discussing Chicago's electric lighting plant, quotes, without explanation, some figures given by Haskins  Sells, the export investigators, which show a wide variation in the cost per lamp from year to year.

922-> BUSTER BROWN'S PUP SURE CURE FOR BLUES; Outcault Cartoons Transferred to the Stage. TWO CHIEF FIGURES FUNNY Create Enough Laughter to Atone for the Sins of the So-Called Musical Comedy.
As a general thing it is neither dignified nor safe to call a man a dog. But, although George Ali, who appeared last night at the Majestic Theatre in the role of Buster Brown's faithful friend Tige, is not a dog, we would be willing to wage a dollar to a dog biscuit that he would be promptly admitted to any canine convention in the land without the wagging of a single dissenting tail.

Charles Lamb's famous cottage at Colebrook Row, Islington, from which his eccentric friend John Dyer, emerging, walked into the New River, is about to be marked by a tablet.

935-> "NO CAUSE FOR ALARM."
This is the reassuring headline which our esteemed contemporary The Tribune prefixes to a statement of the Bureau of Statistics showing the proposed changes in the German tariff, with the figures of our exports of various sorts. The notion of our protectionist friend is that the advances in the German tariff are so insignificant that the export interests will not feel them.

Many and varied have been the articles written on the ungallantry of the native New York business man toward women.

944-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.

--------
945-> RECIPROCITY AND GRAFT.
Your true stand-patter can be relied upon to smell a rat and nip it in the bud. The purpose of the reciprocity minions who visited Oyster Bay was not to ask the President to associate himself with anything so hateful and hopeless as reciprocity. Not at all. They were not seeking to embarrass him by any reference to his own earlier record, nor by urging him to follow the counsels of BLAINE and McKINLEY.

946-> Volumes of Verse by English and American Poets Lately Published.*
IN the memoir which introduces the poems of Ernest Dowson Mr. Symons frankly claims for him the attitude of the "decadent."

950-> A PROSPEROUS JULY.
Perhaps hot winds may even yet scorch the corn crop. Perhaps early frosts may reduce the cotton crop. Perhaps the flooding commercial current may turn to ebb in unforeseen and unforeseeable ways.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Sept. 4. -- The Japanese here say they have no information of the reported revolutionary outbreak in Japan. 
--------
954-> THE COTTON STRIKE SITUATION.
It is a curious situation when 30,000 cotton operatives refuse an advance of wages. It is all the more singular when such action follows an unsuccessful strike so recent that it would seem that its distress would still be remembered. Still that is the situation in Fall River, where the strike of 1904 is still technically on in some mills, although they are running with full forces of new operatives satisfied with their earnings.

--------
971-> MR. MANSFIELD AND MOLIERE'S "LE MISANTHROPE."
WHEN the stage chronicles of the twentieth century come to be written the historian will probably pause to add a line -- Moliere's "Le Misanthrope" acted at the New Amsterdam Theatre, New York, April 10, 1905. For the event has historical interest whatever its ultimate result may be in financial and artistic returns to the actor who was responsible for this first setting forth in English of a famous French classic.

--------
973-> "FREE" DISCUSSION IN RUSSIA.
The announcement from St. Petersburg of the new step to be taken in the way of greater freedom of meeting and greater freedom of the press shows the continued irresolution of the Government, and necessarily must seem to the minds of English-speaking people a half measure, as dangerous as it is deceptive.

BERLIN, April 8. -- The speech of the French Foreign Minister, M.

Mr. WALLACE suffers from inability or unwillingness to tell just why he resigned the post of Chief Engineer to the Panama Canal Commission.

BERLIN, May 31. -- Efforts are being made in Government quarters to measure the changed situation of the belligerents in the Far East and the consequent possibilities of peace.

1017-> AS TO MEDIATION.
Mr. BARTHOLDT of Missouri makes a good point when he points out that the repeated declarations of Russia that she would regard any attempt by neutral Powers to intervene for the ending of the war, even by the tender of good offices, as an unfriendly act, are themselves a violation of Russia's international obligations. 
--------
1018-> STORM OVER EXCISE BILL.; McKeown's Objection Met by Threat of an Emergency Message.
ALBANY, April 21. -- Trouble in unlocking Committee Chairman Plank's desk this morning almost caused several days' delay on the report of the Raines Excise law amendment in the Assembly.

PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 10. -- A conference between Henry H.

1022-> A WEAK POINT IN OUR ART.
The Germans and Austrians have taken the occasion of the World's Fair at St. Louis to look over the field of art in the United States in order to see wherein we are deficient and just where objects we produce in small quantity can be placed to advantage.

--------
1023-> THE LADY AND THE PEARL.; In This Country Precedent Would Give the Gem to Her.
Your editorial in to-day's TIMES on the question of the pearl found in an oyster by a lady in Germany was perfectly delightful. Its playful sarcasm, charming wit, and rollicking humor gave it a delicious flavor, as no doubt the oyster itself possessed, while the lady ate. But did she eat the bivalve? Had she done so perhaps the story of the pearl would never have been told.

--------
1031-> PLAYS NEW AND OLD
THAT phase of genius which consists in an infinite capacity for taking pains again finds expression in David Belasco's latest contribution to the theatre, for whatever opinion one may hold as to the value of his work considered as seriously projected drama the fact cannot be gainsaid that as a producer he has no equal in this, if, indeed, in any country. 
--------
1032-> Article 2 -- No Title

LONDON, Nov. 18. -- Russia continues to block the way to an all around improvement of the stock market.

--------
1040-> EDUCATORS AT ASBURY.; 35,000 Members of National Association Expected This Week.
ASBURY PARK, June 24. -- Weather conditions this week gave the season a temporary setback.

There was a change for the better yesterday, and to-day's arrivals were up to the average for June. 
--------
1041-> NOAH MODERNIZED.
" The Noahs Afloat: An Historical Romance,'' by H. Rea Woodman, has been brought out by the Neale Publishing Company.

--------
1043-> "Speak Gently."
Concerning the authorship of the poem "Speak Gently," about which H.B., Main, Street, Binghamton, inquires, (Appeals to Readers, Nov. 19,) let me say that Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography states that David Bates was the author of that poem. Many of Bates's poems were published in book form under the title "The Eolian," (Philadelphia, 1848,) and a complete edition of them was edited by his son, (Philadelphia, 1870.) 
--------
1044-> ROCKEFELLER CHURCH MAY SELL ITS PROPERTY; Proposes Consolidation with the Epiphany Congregation. OPPOSITION TO THE PLAN Prominent Baptists Don't Want to See the Fifth Avenue Church Wiped Out.
Baptists in this city learned yesterday of a proposal to sell the site of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, known as "Rockefeller's Church," and of consolidating its congregation with that of the Epiphany Baptist Church at Madison Avenue and Sixty-fourth Street. A special committee of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church went informally to the Policy Committee of the Epiphany Church within the last few days and proposed a plan of consolidation. 
--------
1045-> THE HOUSE INDIGNANT.
The House of Representatives is clearly right in resenting the action of the Senate as to drawbacks under the Dingley law. The Senate has no right to propose legislation on revenue subjects, and it has no right to tack on the appropriation bills declaratory clauses having the effect of legislation. 
--------
1046-> Poe's Fordham Cottage.
I have read with great interest the communications in your issues of the 12th and 19th regarding the restoring of Poe's Fordham cottage.

--------
1047-> Dr. Rolfe's Shakespeare.
It is now many years since William J. Rolfe, then master of the High School in Cambridge, Mass., tentatively put forth an edition of "The Merchant of Venice," attractively printed and illustrated, and accompanied by an unusually large collection of informing and discriminating notes. It was published in a neat, brickred volume bearing the imprint of Harper  Brothers. 
--------
1048-> Herman Melville and Others.
I thought I had laid down my pen for good. Mr. Hall's last letter contained nothing which had not before been discussed in these columns. I have also been "zu sehr viel anderswo engagiert." But meanwhile I have found time to read Herman Melville's books, and wish to thank THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW for introducing us to that author in an April number.

1049-> The Millionaire Parson.; THE RAGGED MESSENGER. By W.B. Maxwell 12mo. Pp. 384. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, The Knickerbocker Press.
As a study in modern phases this story must be considered something more than remarkable. The phases themselves are more than remarkable, the motive almost fantastic in spite of the realistic modern London setting. For the Rev. John Morton is an enthusiast with the faith in him that he is divinely appointed to set crooked ways straight. 
--------
1050-> REPUDIATES W.O. McDOWELL.; Bartholdt Denies He Is an Envoy of Arbitration Union.

--------
1051-> ROBERT HICHENS.
One of our correspondents this week, on the always interesting and suggestive readers' page, makes inquiry as to the ten living English authors of the highest standing. The context of his letter of inquiry shows that he has in mind only the imaginative writers. The first five, he thinks, might be easily named, but he fancies there would be many differences of opinion in regard to the others. 
--------
1052-> W.E. WOODEND ARRESTED.; Held in Philadelphia Accused of Getting $21,700 by Fraud.

--------
1066-> Joseph Conrad and Henry James.
Immediately after writing and posting for the columns of your esteemed publication a letter about Joseph Conrad and his "Nostromo," chiefly laudatory, the writer became aware of his essay of appreciation on Henry James in The North American Review. It seemed hardly worth while to recall the laudatory letter, but the mere fact of the publication of that essay threw new light on the wordiness of "Nostromo." 
--------
1067-> THE BRITISH WHIGS.
Another volume of memoirs of the Whig Party in England by Lord Vassal Holland will be published by E.P. Dutton  Co. with the title, "Further Memoirs of the Whig Party." The volume begins in 1807 and closes in 1821, with the death of Queen Caroline, the "luckless" consort of George IV.

1069-> PENALTIES AND PRIZES.
THE very first essay in a new book by Henry W. Nevinson called "Books and Personalities" -- a collection of his lighter literary papers which have appeared in various periodicals -- deals with Heinrich Heine and the persistent legend that Goethe called him the poet "who lacks love." Matthew Arnold accepts the legend as fact in his lines on Heine -- strangely harsh, prosaic lines to address to the most gifted of melodists:

1071-> POLITICS AND BUSINESS.; Proposed Scheme for Cunning the City by Means of a Commission.
Twist or turn it any way you will, the police problem resolves itself into the question of getting the right man or men to manage the Police Department, giving them all necessary power. What is true of the Police Department is true of the whole City Government. Now what is the most practical way to get men who will properly manage the affairs of the city? 
--------
1072-> THE SUBWAY TAVERN.
Most persons who have considered the temperance question seriously will have read with regret of the failure of the Subway Tavern. On the other hand, the same fanatics who have managed to suppress the beneficent and temperance-promoting army canteen will rejoice in the failure of the tavern, and on the same grounds on which they opposed the canteen.

WASHINGTON, April 3. -- Lovers of horse racing were disappointed at Benning to-day, as the finishes in the majority of the six events were commonplace affairs, the winners generally going under the wire with lengths of daylight between them and the second horse. Only two favorites rewarded the betting talent, and the books had much the best of the argument.

1076-> THINKS PAUL KELLY'S A NEST OF FLOATERS; Revelations Following Early Morning Murder in Saloon. PRISONER'S SAMPLE BALLOT Think Dead Man Was Killed for Fear He Would Inform -- Kelly Still Missing.

Shall New Rochelle pay out more than half its proposed budget of $10,000 for library purposes for rent and the salaries of a staff of nine librarians to carry on a library with 13,000 volumes, an average daily circulation of 230 volumes, and an annual expenditure of but $1,850 for books? That is the question that is shaking the little city to the north of us from centre to circumference.

1155-> A WET DAY AT PORTSMOUTH.; Weather as Bad as the Peace Outlook -- High Jinks in the Hotel.
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Aug. 15. -- The weather at Portsmouth to-day was as cold and gloomy as the outlook for peace.

WASHINGTON, June 4. -- The German Ambassador, Baron Speck von Sternburg, was closeted with President Roosevelt for two hours to-night, discussing the war situation.

1157-> NATIONAL LEAGUE.; Pittsburg Hits Chicago Pitcher Freely and Takes Two Games.
CHICAGO, June 4. -- Chicago was outclassed in all departments to-day and lost both games to Pittsburg. The first was a hard-hitting contest, in which the visitors bunched their hits, while those of Chicago were made with two out, or when the bases were unoccupied. Pittsburg won the second game by batting Lundgren at will for the three innings he pitched

1158-> THE FINANCIAL MARKETS; Continued Improvement in Bonds Feature of Past Week's Trading. Transactions Monopolized by Very Few Issues -- Interesting Movement in the Local Traction Stocks.
For the past three weeks the trading in bonds on the Stock Exchange has from week to week resulted in an increasing proportion of gains. The showing for the past week was 16 advances of a point or more to 4 declines. This steady improvement in the bond department irrespective of the irregularity in stocks appears one of the most favorable indications in the market's record for the past thee weeks.

As a novel Mr. Wise's book, while it contains some excellent material, will not hold the average reader's attention. But it is only ostensibly a novel. It is rather a personal explanation, and as such will interest persons who know who Mr. Wise is. Such persons are somewhat numerous, for the expatriated Virginia politician has been something of a public character -- a Congressman -- even a candidate for Governor -- and has made talk.

1160-> Study in Anglo-Saxon Institutions.

--------
1162-> JOURNALISTIC INCAPACITY.; Complaint That Newspapers Take Too Narrow a View of Things.
Newspapers may represent heir readers, but they strike me queerly these days. Probably the greatest naval battle in history has just been fought, yet I have not read a single editorial anywhere that gave the subject the importance it deserved, and some papers ignored it. One sheet gave the most prominent editorial space to a long article on a capitalist's business in the Subway, two others preached peace sermons. 
--------
1163-> Poetry.
The article in the March number of The Critic, giving the views of publishers and poets as to the publishing of poetry in our later time, deserves serious notice. Those publishers tell us there is no falling off in the calls for good poetry, and why should there be?

ST. PETERSBURG, March 24. -- According to the calculations of the General Staff the rival armies now are forty miles apart. The Russians are encamped and intrenching themselves south of Chang-Chun. The Japanese are stopping to refill their ranks. 
--------
1165-> AUTOCRITICISM.
The word is Stevenson's, unless, as we seem vaguely to recall, it was Charles Reade's before him, Stevenson being by the nature of his gift and work one of the most valuable, and Charles Reade one of the most negligible, of autocritics. But all self-criticism of a writer who tempts his readers to criticism is at least readable.

1166-> SCHOOL OF FINE ARTS PLANNED FOR COLUMBIA; Dr. Butler Wants to Co-operate with Academy of Design. MUSEUM OF ART INTERESTED To Appoint a Committee to Work with University Trustees -- Contemplate Building on South Field.
The fact was made public at Columbia University yesterday that plans for a School of Fine Arts are rapidly approaching completion. A hint of the nature of these plans was contained in President Butler's last annual report to the Trustees, but it is now known that they are of more far-reaching significance than has hitherto been understood.

ST. LOUIS, April 16. -- Errors by the home team at critical points lost the game to-day, the Chicagos winning by 4 to 3. The weather was clear but extremely cold, which accounts for the ragged fielding done by both teams. Attendance, 8,000, Score:

1168-> THE APPOINTMENTS.
The nominations sent to the Senate yesterday by the President can hardly be said to possess the quality of news. For substantially all the appointments on the list the public had been prepared by advance intimations. The only change in the Cabinet is the appointment of Mr. CORTELYOU as Postmaster General succeeding Mr. WYNNE, who gets the highly desirable office of Consul General at London.

PATERSON, April 21. -- Johnny Nolan dances well enough to earn a living at it, but the same joyous spirit that makes him dance so well generates financial aspirations which his nimble legs cannot overtake. Hence Johnny's enlistment into the ranks of the rail birds, dreamers of the continuous dream of exchanging a one-dollar bill for the bookmaker's one-hundred-dollar note.

Although entirely too early to diagnose the quality of the players of the National and American Leagues so as to get an outline of the strength of the various teams, the three days of championship play show that the material in both organizations, with few exceptions, is of sufficient calibre to place the teams in a position to make an interesting season.

CHICAGO, April. 21. -- "Joe" Kelley's Cincinnati combination broke its run of hard luck here to-day and gave Selee's colts a jolt through the fine pitching of young Chech. The Reds' manager was so much impressed by the cool-headed work of his new find when he went in on a relief assignment that he decided to start him to-day.

1180-> GROUT ORDERS HIS MEN NOT TO SERVE MAYOR; Says He Was Not Consulted About Financial Commission. PUTS BLAME ON TAMMANY Controller's Subordinates Hand in Their Resignations Just Before Board's Initial Meeting.
With the initial meeting of the Mayor's Financial Commission yesterday the warfare which for months has existed between Mayor McClellan and Controller Grout came to the surface. The Controller forbade his two subordinates, who were named by the Mayor on the commission, from serving and said that he himself was not named because of his differences with Tammany.

1181-> GREENE REGAINS CONTROL.; Five Hostile Directors Ousted from Copper Company.
A sequel to the collapse in the stock of the Greene Consolidated Copper Company last December came to light yesterday in the resignation of five Directors.

1186-> JOHN HAY.
AMONG the various tributes that have been paid to John Hay naturally one was to his quality as "Literary man," both as poet and as "prosateur," to borrow from the French a locution which it is to the discredit of our language that it does not supply.

1190-> TAXING STOCK SALES; Wall Street Opinion Solidly Against Proposed Law. FINING LEGITIMATE BUSINESS Traders Would Suffer Most, but Investors Along with Them -- Stock Taxes in Other Countries.
No recent legislative suggestion has so thoroughly aroused the opposition of Wall Street as the proposition now before the New York Legislature to impose a tax upon the sale and transfer of stock. The proposition in itself is very familiar to the Street for the reason that by this State measure it is intended to re-enact the stock transfer tax clause in the Federal revenue law in force during the time of

Further selling for foreign account owing to the continuance of anxiety abroad over the Moroccan situation kept the market here under pressure throughout the first hour of business yesterday and prices yielded all around.

In The Journal of Cutaneous Diseases Dr. Albert S. Ashmead has an article in the May (1905) issue in which he claims that the Japanese race is of a secondary or derived origin, and shows signs of being derived from negro, and therefore African, origin. Does the mulberry-colored spot on the skin of the lower spine of the Japanese and other dark races indicate, as Dr. Ashmead claims, negro descent?

George Sneven a boatbuilder, forty-five years old, of Shelton, Conn., was in Boston yesterday morning when he was seized with a sudden attack of baseball fever. He had to come to New York on business anyway; why not catch the 10 A.M. express and get here at 3:15 P.M.? Certainly he would get here in plenty of time to see the New York and Chicago National League Clubs play at the Polo Grounds.

These are wonderful revelations which are making, on the one hand, of the facility with which, according to the proverb, a certain kind of possessor and his possessions are parted, and on the other of an unfeigned worship of the Golden Calf coupled with a yearning to acquire a Golden Veal Cutlet. Says one of the able projectors of "Fads and Fancies," in an awe-stricken whisper, about his subscribers: "The list is almost unique.

Yesterday's news was hardly disturbing, but it certainly was not stimulating, and the underlying strength of the situation was demonstrated by the refusal of prices to soften under such conditions. That nothing worse than dullness supervened upon the day's intelligence may show that the market is unresponsive to good and bad news alike, but it also shows that prices will only yield to actually bad news, calamity mysteries having lost much of their power.

When Admiral TOGO ascribed his victory to the "brilliant virtues" of his Emperor and to the protection of the Emperor's "divine ancestors," it seemed to us Occidentals as if we were in the presence of something extremely Oriental and fantastic, and we couldn't, or at least didn't, refrain from smiling at such nonsensical talk, coming from a man in most ways thoroughly up-to-date and practical.

1224-> SCHOOL AND SCHOOLING.; Better Teachers and More Liberal Expenditures Needed.
One of the troubles with our public school system is that weak, half-educated teachers are allowed to lay the foundation of the system; young, inexperienced women that ought to be in school themselves. The primary teachers should be as thoroughly educated and receive as much salary as the higher grade teachers.

The report of the Buffalo. Rochester and Pittsburg Railway Company for the year ended June 30 last shows gross earnings of $8,161,079, an increase of $631.121.

WHITE MOUNTAINS, N.H., July 1. -- The season in the White Mountains will not be fairly launched until the first week in July.

1241-> BLOCK ISLAND AWAKENING.; Better Transportation Facilities Bring Many Visitors to the Resort.
BLOCK ISLAND, R.I., July 1. -- The steamboats and railroads offer greater facilities this year than ever before for reaching Block Island.

--------
1242-> SCIENCE OF RELIEF.
Two movements of public sentiment with reference to the relief of poverty and its accompanying suffering and evils are pretty plain in modern times. One is a decided growth of the tendency toward sympathy with the sufferers; the other is the development of a feeling that relief can and should be given in a manner to prevent injury to those relieved and to the permanent interests of society.

Gen. CORBIN has been delivering an allocution to the officers in his Department of the Philippines against luxury, and in favor of simplicity and frugality.

1256-> TO MAKE PERJURY UNPROFITABLE.
It is understood by the friends of the amendments to the Raines liquor law now before the Governor that a good deal of pressure is being brought to induce him to withhold his approval of the bill.

--------
1257-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Market a Puzzle -- Passing Effect of Securities Decision.

Railroad traffic is still in a crippled condition, though a pretense of operating on schedule time is being made on all the railroads. Trains yesterday were anywhere from five to fifteen hours late.

1265-> VOLUME IN LIFE INSURANCE.; Huge Funds Lead to Too Much Power--Real Suffrage Necessary.

--------
1268-> THE CZAR'S NEW PEACE APPEAL.
It was a graceful and yet a perfectly characteristic act on the part of President ROOSEVELT to yield to the Czar of Russia what we may call his rights of priority in appealing to the nations to meet a second time at The Hague to deliberate upon the means of averting war and its multitudinous evils.

Prince Louis decided yesterday that his squadron shall not leave this port till to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock. The delay is not on account of "desertions" or any shortness of men, but merely owing to the late arrival of the colliers bringing coal for the fleet. 
--------
1272-> "The Boys' Own Book."
The "Boys' Own Book," fifth edition, revised, 1881, referred to by Mr. James Chittick in the last number of THE BOOK REVIEW, is possibly a reprint of some old plates.

--------
1274-> THE OPERATION OF THE SUBWAY.
The talk attributed to the officers of the Rapid Transit Commission, embodying threats to cancel the lease of the Interborough Company of the Subway if it does not do certain things which at the moment would seem to be impossible and not at all in accordance with the public interest, is ill-advised. 
--------
1275-> "LITTLE ENTANGLED."
Mr. WHITELAW REID very delicately and diplomatically, but quite intelligibly, hinted in his first speech in London that the talk of the promotion of good relations between Great Britain and the United States was becoming perfunctory. The relations already were good.

PARIS, Feb. 3, 1905. I THINK nothing is more striking than the change that has come over France with regard to Russia, and when I have said what I have to say you will see what I mean. I am old enough to remember the time when the republic was regarded with marked disfavor throughout Europe.

1284-> THE CIVIL WAR.
IN your columns "From Readers," Saturday, June 24, in communication signed by George F. Shrady, Jr., with the heading "The written History of the American Civil War -- Capt.

1285-> PRINCE KROPOTKIN.; His Informing But Prejudiced Book on Russian Literature.*
PRINCE PETER ALEXEI -vitch Kropotkin is one of the greatest living Russian geographers. Few people, however, consider that fact in perusing his works on Socialistic subjects. To the world at large his notoriety is due to the fact that he is a theoretical Anarchist, feared by the Russian oligarchy and at times incomprehensible to even intelligent foreigners.

--------
1302-> John Hancock.
I wonder if any of your readers have noticed the attack on John Hancock's memory in 'My Lady Laughter," a new novel by Dwight Tilton. This author evidently takes himself quite seriously in his attempt to pervert history, and makes Hancock out to be a coxcomb, at usurer, and a silly and brainless exquisite.

1416-> THOSE QUEER CANADIANS.
A few days ago in a moment of inadvertence we referred to Canadians as peppery, and wondered why they were so much more British than the real British. By return mail we were inundated by countless letters saying that Americans were responsible for the state of mind across the border. For aught we know the letter writers may hold Americans responsible for Canadian legislation. If that be so, we have much to answer for.

VICTORIA, B.C., June 20. -- The steamer Empress of China to-day brought an account of the experience of the Japanese prize crew on board the Russian battleship Orel in taking the captured vessel from the scene of battle to Japan. 
--------
1426-> SLEEPING-CAR REFORM.
This is just the time to catch the man in the street -- and especially the woman in the street -- with projects for reforming the worst feature of American railway travel. "One person cars" -- doubtless the idea is one-person compartment cars -- and no change between coast and coast is the proposal of a promoter who wants only a million dollars and a contract with some railway to carry out his idea. 
--------
1427-> NEW FALL BOOKS.; Educational and Scientific Works, Poetry and Fiction.

Business will open to-day under pressure from calls for margin and orders to sell by out-of-town customers alarmed by yesterday's collapse.

1446-> TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
