859-> HINTS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD; A CHAPTER ON THE WASTING OF MEATS.
How to evolve the beasts of the field from the herbs thereof primarily, and how to transform their would-be possessor's one talent into the cash value requisite to their purchase secondarily, are sufficiently important problems for ordinary human ingenuity to solve, but they are not final.

862-> THE LORDS AND THE LAND BILL.
Lord SALISBURY is evidently determined that the Lords shall rule or be ruined.

"The World," a melodrama which has been sufficiently described in these columns, was produced last night at Niblo's Garden. "The World" was a popular piece during its career at Wallack's Theatre, and it has been received with favor elsewhere.
