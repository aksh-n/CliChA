421-> THE NEWEST AMERICAN FARM INDUSTRY
AGE has not withered nor custom staled those proverbs and saws handed down since those days beyond the memory of the oldest great-grandfather which concern the blindness and uselessness of moles.

428-> THE IMPORTER'S HARDSHIPS; Ex-Consul Urges Revision of Defective Customs Rules.
The impartial view expressed in THE TIMES, with regard to the administering of the tariff is the best thing that has been written regarding the methods of assessing and collecting duties in a long time.

--------
446-> OBJECT TO 'REGULAR' BILLS.; Merchants See in Them a Plan to Get Free Bookkeeping.

May I appeal to your readers to send some of their overflow of Christmas spirit South, to make a first Christmas celebration for 150 children of Georgia "crackers"?

--------
450-> THOMAS R. MARSHALL."; Is It Really the Vice President We Are Listening To?
I think I have an explanation of the extraordinary outgivings of the man named Marshall who is going about the country outdoing Cassandra, Jeremiah, and Theodore in foretelling evil. It is simply a case of false identity or impersonation, and reminds one of Dean Swift's clever clearing up of the mystery of the outrageously bad living Bishops of the Established Church in Ireland in the eighteenth century. 
--------
451-> POPE FOR PEACE LEADER.; Dr. Campbell Wants Him to Unite Christians Against War.
LONDON, Dec. 21. -- London celebrated "Peace Sunday" to-day. The Rev. Dr. R.J. Campbell preached a remarkable sermon in the City Temple. He said that Christendom and militarism had made an alliance. All the rest of the world was helpless before the armed forces of Christendom.

--------
455-> TOPICS IN WALL STREET.; Copper Producers Hopeful.
With copper established on a 14 1/2 cent, or lower, basis, more attention is being paid in Wall Street circles to earnings of producing companies than was the case when the metal was being quoted at 15 cents.

--------
459-> THE EQUITABLE LIFE SOON TO BE CHANGED; Morgan Hopes for Early Mutualization of the Company -Trustees Hold Over.
Mutualization of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which the State Superintendent of Insurance has long been trying to bring about, may be hastened by the transfer of the majority interest in the company's stock to J.P. Morgan, Jr., by the will of the late J.P. Morgan.

--------
463-> Woman's Beauty Is Judged by More Exacting Standards.
" Nonplussed," I think, is entirely wrong when he -- or she -- makes the statement that men are, in general, better looking than women. It is not that men are more comely; it is simply that, in this particular, we expect more of the ladies. In men we look for deeper, more lasting qualities than beauty. 
--------
464-> KURTZ IS OUTPOINTED.; Jack McCarron Whips Newark Boxer at Sporting Club.

--------
470-> BRITISH AND GERMAN FINANCE.
The stolid Englishmen have been through more crises, economic or political, than any Government existing under its present organization.

In the Kentucky towns schoolhouses and churches are filled with refugees. 
--------
677-> LABOR AND AMBASSADOR PAGE.
What with "outlaw organizations" and a considerable amount of red tape in connection with trades union operations, it is not easy to determine just who among the labor leaders are trying to get President WILSON to recall Ambassador PAGE because his firm maintains an open shop. We venture to think, however, that Typographical Union No. 6 is not engaged in this silly business, or, if it appears to be, that it is being misrepresented.

683-> PRAISE AND THANKS.
The city has cause to congratulate itself upon the manner in which it gets the dual subway as well as upon the getting of it. Success has been snatched from defeat, with credit to both sides.

--------
685-> CONCERNED ABOUT TARIFF.; American Motormakers Fear Foreign Competition if Reduced.
No one group or class of business men in this country is more interested in the inauguration of President-elect Wilson than the America automobile manufacturers. Of this class the New York dealers are perhaps more concerned than any others of the industry's selling agents, for the reason that a majority of foreign-built cars sold in the United States find a market here. 
--------
686-> THE ALASKA RAILWAY.
The opportunity has been taken while the Alaska investigation is proceeding to introduce in Congress a bill appropriating $35,000,000 for a Government railway. The witnesses connected with the private railways, or rather beginnings of railways, declare their readiness to extend them if only they are allowed to proceed under conditions compatible with solvency, but they testify in vain.

For once it is posible to agree with an author's description of his own work. Mr. Joseph Byron Totten's play is decidedly "elemental." Moreover, it is both foolish and incompetent.

--------

--------
692-> Is Tired of High Prices and Unstimulating Plays.
If theatrical managers would present well written and constructed, well acted and staged plays suitable to American audiences for $1.50 instead of $2 they would not complain, as one of them is just reported to have done, that their audiences are being depleted by the automobile, the vaudeville show, and the moving picture.

THE TIMES remarks at the close of a discussion of "The New Tariff," re the sugar tariff: "Revenue is sacrificed, but it is extremely unlikely that the consumer will largely benefit by the reduction."

--------
704-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
Modern penology, with its new views as to the placing of responsibility for crime, looks more than a little askance at attempts to adjust the severity of punishment to the amount of viciousness shown in deeds committed. 
--------
705-> MONA LISA'S TRIUMPH.
It is a significant fact that the fame of LEONARDO DA VINCI'S portrait of the wife of GIOCONDO is greater by far to-day than at any other time in the 400-odd years of its existence.

Massenet's "Manon" came last evening to the Metropolitan Opera House to join in the repertory Puccini's "Manon Leseaut" and to throw a somewhat different light upon the Abbe Prevost's delectable story -- certainly to make it more intelligible to the operatic listeners. For the book that Messrs. Meilhac and Gille made for Massenet is in many respects more logical and coherent than the one that was provided for Puccini to set on the same subject. 
--------
714-> BETTER PRINTCLOTH SALES.; Buyers Take 200,000 Pieces at Fall River -- Fine Goods Active.
FALL RIVER, Mass., May 31. -- There has been fairly good trading in the New England cotton goods markets this week, and sales will exceed 200,000 pieces, the largest total for some time It is known that on a few styles advances ranging from a sixteenth to a quarter of a cent a yard have been made, but even at these prices manufacturers have not shown a willingness to sell.

PHILADELPHIA, May 3. -- Three straight from the New York Giants. This sounds almost too good to be true, but it is the record made by the Phillies since they returned to the home grounds.

John D. Rockefeller's purchase of the W. Seward Webb house on Fifth Avenue with the intention of razing the mansion for a low business structure, formed an interesting topic of comment in realty circles yesterday.

Twombly's mansion on the Fifty-fourth Street corner, adjoining.

--------
725-> TRY TO ENCOURAGE BOYS.; " Big Brothers" Do Not Seek to Reform Criminals, Secretary Says.
It was with great surprise that I read in Saturday's TIMES a letter from a Mr. Sirovich criticising the recent dinner of the Big Brothers.

PARIS, Aug. 23. -- It is safe to say that every gown worn during the Grande Semaine, the last gay week of the racing season at Deauville, showed the fashionable ballet tunic. For the most part these tunics were made of tulle or chiffon and they were quite short and very full.

Mr. Reinald Werrenrath, baritone, has made a name in New York not only as one of the most artistic of local singers but also as one of the most enterprising, who is not content in well-worn paths. He gave a concert last evening in Aeolian Hall that kept him well outside the well-worn paths.

Henry L. Rogers wants to know what the difference is between buying stocks on margin and "gambling in any other form." Buying stocks on margin is not gambling.

Thousands of people own outright stocks they have paid for a little at a time. 
--------
745-> TOPICS OF THE TIMES.
So obvious and great is the need to revise in the interest of public safety the law in relation to the running of automobiles that the Secretary of State has done well to give the subject earnest attention and to draw up a series of suggestions, covering the whole subject and designed to end the present intolerable situation.

747-> YANKEES PRESENT GAME TO CLEVELAND; Bases on Balls and Error Bring New Yorkers Close to Last Place Again.
The Yankees had a spasm of generosity at the Polo Grounds yesterday and deeded a game to the Clevelands. The team from Ohio had little or nothing to do with winning, for the game was thrust upon them with such positiveness that they couldn't have turned it down if they had wished to. 
--------
748-> DINERS IN HEALY'S BESIEGED BY POLICE; Dwyer Tries to Imprison Four Women and Sixteen Men All Night in Restaurant.

--------
753-> Senators Go to Pieces and Lose.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 22. -- Washington played miserably in the field to-day and St. Louis had little difficulty in winning, 7 to 5. The defeat coming when Cleveland was winning from New York ousted the locals from second place, which they had held jointly with the Naps since Saturday. Ayres, a recruit from Richmond, Va., started his first major league game to-day and pitched splendidly while on the mound.

--------
758-> BROOKLYN TAKES TUMBLE.; Boston Wins Opening Game of Series by Score of 9-1.
Brooklyn baseball stock took a slump yesterday when the Boston Braves hammered three Superba pitchers for an aggregate of sixteen hits and nine runs, while the locals' batting effort produced one lone tally. It was a slaughter of the most humiliating type and Dahlen's men did not have the slighest chance against Perdue, who distributed seven hits throughout the nine sessions in such a way as to be the least productive. 
--------
759-> SUBSIDY HUNTERS.; Horace White Sees Them in Panama Tolls Betrayal.
In the Panama Canal bill we smite all other nations by the same blow that strikes Great Britain, and we smite ourselves by earning the scorn of the others as a faithless people. What are we to do about it? It seems to me that this question takes precedence of everything else, and that it will not be settled till it is settled right. 
--------
760-> HARDWARE TRADE ACTIVE.; Spring Outlook Encouraging, but Tariff Causes Conservatism.
The local hardware business is reported to be picking up remarkably well for this time of year. The outlook for Spring business seems very encouraging, and one representative house reports all its factories running full time in order to meet the demand.

--------
761-> ATHLETICS WIN AGAIN, CHOKING OFF GIANT RALLY; Pull Out 6 to 5 Victory, with Bender Tottering Toward the Finish.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct 10. -- When the spectre of a crushing 6 to 0 defeat haunted the Giants at Shibe Park today and 20,000 hostile fans were taunting them in their humiliation, McGraw's men threw themselves into the fight in desperation and started a magnificent rally, which cut down the clouting Athletics' margin of victory to a lone run in the fourth game of the world's series.

John Buford, with his horsemen, who brought on the battle of Gettysburg by entering the town in pursuit of his duties as cavalry commander covering the left wing of Meade's army fifty years ago to-day. Gettysburg had been in a panic all day over the appearance of the Confederates, and its joy at seeing Buford's cavalrymen in their blue uniforms knew no bounds. 
--------
765-> TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.
There is war between the Housewives League and the "holders" of rice. The trouble arises from the fact that thus early in the season there is a surplus of 1,800,000 sacks of the raw material of puddings, a calamity which can be measured only by the fact that it surpasses last year's overstock by a million sacks. 
--------
766-> THE MEXICAN DANGER.
The change in the attitude of President WILSON toward the Mexican problem is not encouraging. The promise of a message on the subject to Congress at this time, to be delayed three or four days, indicates a desire to get an expression of public opinion, to shift, in some measure, the burden of responsibility which hitherto he has insisted upon bearing without help. 
--------
767-> DESIGN PROTECTION TOO FAR-REACHING; Bill to Satisfy Foreigners at San Francisco Fair Said to be Faulty.
Considerable opposition is being expressed among trade journalists against the Kahn bill, recently introduced in the House and providing for free importation of articles intended for display at exhibitions.

--------
768-> OF PLAYS TO BE READ AND PLAYS TO BE SEEN AND HEARD; An Inquiry Into the Means to Appreciation With a Suggested Theme for a Drama of Local Life.

PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 12. -- The good physicial condition of the Tigers permitted another scrimmage this afternoon, the final tussle of the week before the Yale game, and incidentally the last scrimmage of the season on the Princeton field. There was a make-believe Yale team on the field again, using Yale's plays, and the 'Varsity was lined up against this team for an hour of stiff work in a regular game.

LONDON, Thursday, Jan. 2. -- Sir Edward Carson's amendment to exclude Ulster from the operation of the Home Rule bill led to an exciting debate in the House of Commons yesterday, during which Premier Asquith, after declaring that the exclusion of Ulster would be an impossible surgical operation and would wreck the bill, asked the Opposition leader if another general election would conciliate Ulster. 
--------
778-> THE KING OF SERVIA'S HYMN TO LIBERTY
ONE would scarcely expect to hear from a monarch of the Near East a prose hymn to Liberty, like the one which follows. Yet its author is the present King of Servia, who, when he was plain Peter Karageorgevitch, expressed these lofty sentiments in the preface to his Servian translation of John Stuart Mill's "Liberty": 
--------
779-> VON BERNSTORFF ATTACKED.; Berlin Paper Asks What Qualifications He Has for Foreign Office.
BERLIN, Dec. 31. -- Die Post, the organ of the German war party, is probably helping the chances of Count von Bernstorff to become Imperial Foreign Secretary by vigorously assailing the success with which, as Ambassador at Washington, he has aided the cause of German-American friendship. 
--------
780-> NO DEAL TO ELECT SHERMAN.; Plan Discovered Which Would Mean Defeat for Senate of Col. J.H. Lewis.
SPRINGFIELD, Ill., Feb. 1. -- Friends of Lawrence Y. Sherman to-day denied knowledge of any plan whereby he was to be elected United States Senator and Col. James Hamilton Lewis was to be defeated. On the contrary friends of Sherman, among whom are Republican leaders in both the House and Senate, say that it would be suicidal for both the Republican and Democratic Parties if such a deal were made. 
--------
781-> TERMINAL TRAINS RUN BY LOOP SYSTEM
THE great objection to the terminal or sub-station is the stalling of the locomotive, whether it be steam or electric. This difficulty in olden times used to be overcome by the shunting or transfer table, but now the machines are so big as to make this impracticable.

--------
783-> HAPPINESS IN POVERTY.; Man Sacrifices Wealth to Gratify Ambition.
What THE TIMES says in its "Topic" entitled "A Portly Parson Speaks Out for Once," particularly the remark that a certain class of people invariably ignore the fact that there are several ways of being poor, reminds me of an instance, lately come to my knowledge, which, if it does not illustrate one way of being poor, surely seems to me to point to a way of getting poor.

--------
1022-> COMPANIES DESERT MISSOURI.; 50 Fire Insurance Representatives Decide to Shun State.

--------
1027-> ANTI-WEALTH POLICY.
Various propositions are before Congress to tax the property of individuals or corporations more and more heavily the greater it is. Some of them propose a maximum tax of 8 per cent. Mr. LA FOLLETTE would go as high as 10 per cent. Mr. HITCHCOCK of Nebraska, who has broken loose from the caucus, wishes to run the tax up to 20 per cent. 
--------
1028-> ILL-FEELING IN MEXICO.
It does not matter much now whether the Government at Washington has been mistaken in its Mexican policy, whether a less admonitory attitude toward the Provisional Government of a people to whom revolution is the very breath of life, whose ideals and motives are always totally different from ours, might have led to more reasonable international relations. 
--------
1029-> PRINTCLOTH TRADING.; Fall River Reports Week's Business as Below Normal.
FALL RIVER, Mass., July 12. -- The New England cotton goods market ruled fairly active on some lines, while on others conditions were quiet. To sum the entire trading of last week it was below normal, but it required only moderate permanent improvement to bring business up to a normal level.

They tied for the medal with 78. 
--------
1032-> " Virginia" -- "V.V.'s Eyes" -- Reviewing Fiction
IT seems to me that in last Sunday's TIMES Ralph H. Waggoner went wide of the mark in his criticism of Ellen Glasgow's book, "Virginia." He speaks of "Oliver, the Brute," although Oliver was as much the victim of social conditions as Virginia -- perhaps more so -- and deserved as much sympathy. 
--------
1033-> LATEST DEALINGS IN THE REALTY FIELD; Rogers, Peet & Co. About to Lease Fifth Avenue Site Near Forty-second Street.
Particulars regarding an important Fifth Avenue move leaked out prematurely yesterday, and the brokers connected with the transaction declined to add further particulars.

--------
1034-> CREDIT DUE KERN.; Interpolated Numbers by American Composer Often Bring Success to Foreign Musical Plays.
The Great American Public cannot always believe what it hears. This is a modification of a familiar adage that has special application to musical comedies. Everybody will agree that a musical comedy without music is as useless as a wagon without wheels. And this is just about as true of a musical comedy in which the music lacks an appealing quality for the audiences before whom it is played. 
--------
1035-> GERMAN SPY CONVICTED.; English Judge Sentenced Him to Five Years' Penal Servitude.
LONDON, July 5. -- With a sentence of five years passed on a dentist named William Klare at the Winchester Assizes, the British police believe that they have in prison one of the most clever spies of the German Foreign Service. Incidentally the case has revealed the presence of a "centre-espionage" in the British service. 
--------
1036-> THE QUESTION OF WORLD'S FAIRS
What the purpose may be of The London Morning Post in striving continually to stir up ill-feeling between Great Britain and the United States would be hard to determine. Lately one of its American correspondents has been insisting, without a particle of evidence that we have been able to discover, that Americans were greatly incensed by the remarks of the British Ambassador in Mexico and the English attitude toward President WILSON'S Mexican policy. 
--------
1037-> SPEED BOATS FOR HARMSWORTH CUP; Ankle Deep Meets All Requirements -- Peter Pan V. and America May Be Selected.
The elimination trials last week at Huntington to select three challengers for the Harmsworth Motor Boat Challenge Cup taken to England last year by Maple Leaf IV. proved very disappointing.

--------
1038-> SHIP NEWS REPORTERS DINE.; Alderman Curran Tells Them He Got Into Politics from That Work.

--------
1039-> FRIEDMANN.
It is predicted, and on good authority, that the first hospital reports of Dr. FRIEDMAN'S treatment for tuberculosis will not be favorable enough to warrant faith in it in preference to any other approved mode of treatment, much less as a cure. If there are doctors in this country who believe that the German physician's method of vaccination against the great scourge of humanity may ultimately be adopted as efficacious, they are silent. 
--------
1040-> NEW YORK BANKERS FETED IN OTTAWA; Guests of Dominion at Banquet After Opening Their Convention.

--------
1046-> CHILDREN ROLL WAY TO HAPPINESS; May Pole Dancing Gives Way to Human Tobogganing in Central Park.

--------
1054-> CROCKERY MARKET ACTIVE.; Larger Orders Reported -- Scarcity of Merchandise in Retailers' Hands.
Buying was quite active in the local crockery and glassware market this week, and in many instances the individual orders were reported to be larger than usual. This feature was attributed both to the prevailing scarcity of merchandise in retailers' hands and the fear of still higher prices on certain lines following the recent advances. 
--------
1055-> LLOYD GEORGE TO TESTIFY.; Other Ministers to be Heard To-day by Marconi Inquiry Committee.
LONDON, March 24. -- Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George, the Attorney General, Sir Rufus Isaacs, and Postmaster General Herbert Samuel will give evidence at to-morrow's meeting of the Parliamentary Marconi Inquiry Committee.

--------
1056-> This Government's Policy Contrasted with That of Canada.
Although the people of this country show faith in the banks by intrusting them with several billions of dollars, the United States Government does not share in this faith even with respect to banks of its own creation and under its direct official supervision. It virtually says to the people, "You may trust the banks if you choose, but I will not." 
--------
1057-> LYDIG COLLECT0N SOLD FOR $362,555; Art Treasures Scattered at Two Sales to Dealers and Private Collectors.
The art treasures of the Rita Lydig collection were sold yesterday for a total of $362,555.

After an interesting series of closely contested bouts, Studdiford Pitt of the Fencers Club won the junior foil championship of the Amateur Fencers League of America last night in the gymnasium of the New York Turn Verein, Eighty-fifth Street and Lexington Avenue.

1062-> NAPS LOSE FINAL GAME TO YANKEES; New York Wins While Falkenberg Is in the Box--Slim Caldwell Invincible.
The Yankees have learned, after more or less experience this season, that the only way to win a baseball game is to grab it quickly before the other folks suspect their intention. Following this general line of argument, the Yanks quarreled with the Clevelands at the Polo Grounds yesterday, and won the game in the early moments of the first inning before Cleveland recovered consciousness. The score was 3 to 1. 
--------
1063-> FRESH AIR STACKS; Proposed for Subway Ventilation by Mr. Opdycke.
The subject of the removal of the gratings from the street surface, together with a new plan of ventilation, was first brought to my attention by the occupants of several large banking institutions in Broadway, who feared that the polluted air arising, as it does, from the present gratings in the sidewalk would enter their buildings and be injurious to traffic.

1067-> FINANCIAL MARKETS; Prices Advance Slightly -Trading Very Light -- Banks Report Expansion in Loans.

--------
1070-> FOR CHILDREN; Marked Change of Character in Books for Young People
AUTHORS are ambitious people, nowadays. Years ago they were content to entertain their readers; now they aim variously to remake them. M. Dumas and Mr. Stevenson were story tellers; sometimes they preached a little, but that was just because occasional preaching is pleasant for the preacher, or just because they wanted to express their enthusiasm for masculine courage or feminine modesty or some other quaint archaic virtue. 
--------
1071-> MAY ELECT GARDINER.; One Way of Breaking Deadlock for Football Captaincy at Harvard.

--------
1079-> BIG CITY EXPENSE IN TITLE SEARCH; Bill Drafted Requiring Owners to Pay Title Examination Fees in Ceded Lands.
A bill which has aroused some opposition among property holders, especially those in the outlying sections of the city, will probably be introduced into the Legislature this week. Its object is to throw the expense for examining the title of property ceded to the city for street opening upon the owner, and not as hitherto, upon the city. 
--------
1080-> HOME DRY CLEANING
EVERY woman knows the ruinous sums it costs each season to have her evening frocks, light suits, silk blouses, and other unwashable articles dry cleaned. Where gasoline is possible as a renovator she may sometimes try the experiment of doing a little of her own cleaning, but it is seldom successful, and it is as hard to lose the odor of gasoline as it is to acquire the odor of sanctity.

--------
1084-> GAMBLERS AID POLICE.; Form Vigilance Committee to Drive Rivals Out of Hot Springs.
HOT SPRINGS, Ark., Jan. 13. -- A delegation of resident gamblers last night formed a vigilance committee to rid this resort of "crooks." It was self-preservation with the gamblers.

--------
1085-> WONDERS OF HOTEL ROOF.; Fruits, Vegetables, and Berries, Englishmen Hear, Await Picking.

1091-> MEXICO NOW FEELS HERSELF A VICTOR; Believes That President Wilson "Made a Bluff" and Cannot Enforce It.
MEXICO CITY, Sept. 1. -- It is generally believed here that the negotiations between the United States and Mexico are at an end, as it is evident that the United States expects Mexico to move next, which Mexico will not do. The action of the United States is regarded as a colossal bluff. It is understood that attempts are being made to impress this fact upon Secretary Bryan, who is incredulous.

--------
1094-> Mr. Alden and Psychical Research
No one could be more interested than myself in Henry M. Alden's article on "Psychism," which appeared in THE BOOK REVIEW of Nov. 30. At the same time, I cannot but feel that the title of the article is rather a misnomer, and that it constitutes a short "talk on immortality" rather than a discussion of the facts and evidences of "psychical research." 
--------
1095-> SHAW AN ENIGMA IN PARIS.; Reviewers at Odds About the Intentions of "You Never Can Tell."
The Theatre des Arts, in Paris, has just brought out "On ne peut jamais dire." Perhaps you do not recognize "You Never Can Tell." The programme said that "the French version, at the particular request of the author, has been made by M. and Mme. Hamon."
