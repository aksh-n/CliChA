0-> 2020 Climate Action Award winners shine ray of hope
In a year that has cast darkness upon many, the 2020 UN Global Climate Action Awards, announced on Tuesday, shone a light on the positive action that many across the globe are taking, to combat climate change. While is the world’s most clear and present danger, climate change is a menace that threatens all future generations, according to the head of the UN climate change convention. “The last eight months have been a nightmare for many throughout the world”, said UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, that the pandemic has “altered lives, economies and the nature of business on every continent—from the largest cities to the smallest villages”. From carbon neutral hotels 🏨 and airports ✈️ to all women solar teams ☀️, the UN Global awards shine a light on some of the world’s most inspiring climate solutions. Find out more about this year's 13 winning projects from :  And while it is “the most urgent threat facing humanity today”, she quickly added, “we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term.” Building sustainably The UNFCCC chief attested that the convergence of these two crises has “opened a window of opportunity to build forward – to build cities and communities that are safe, healthy, green and sustainable”. “Nothing exemplifies this better than the efforts of our 2020 award-winning activities to address climate change”, she upheld. This year’s award-winning projects demonstrate leadership on climate change by nations, businesses, investors, cities, regions and civil society as a whole. They range from the Caribbean's only carbon-neutral hotel, to the world's inaugural green bonds platform and the first all-women solar team in Lebanon. congratulated the winners, saying that they “provide tangible proof that climate action is under way around the world”. “It is exciting to see these climate solutions, which reinforce my call for decisive leadership on climate change by Governments, businesses and cities, and for a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic”, stated the UN chief. “Let us keep pressing ahead to build a more sustainable and equitable future for all". Spearheading momentum As Governments work toward implementing the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the (SDGs), the awards are part of a wider effort to mobilize climate action and ambition. They also set the stage for two upcoming climate change events. The , from 9 to19 November, will serve as critical input to the to advance work governing the rules of the , which runs from 23 November to 4 December. The UN Global Climate Action Awards are spearheaded by the initiative at and each project presents an innovative solution that both addresses climate change and helps drive progress on other SDGs. “It is crucial we celebrate all actors who are leading the way,” said Gabrielle Ginér, Chair of the . “The recipients of the UN Global Climate Action Awards send a strong political signal to all nations – and through their leadership and creativity, we see essential change”.

1-> Climate action: UN chief encouraged by Japan’s 2050 net zero pledge
UN Secretary-General António Guterres Japan’s announcement on Monday that it would reduce carbon emissions to zero, by 2050, as part of the global effort to slow the worldwide rise in temperatures, and prevent the most damaging effects of human-made climate change. “The Secretary-General is very encouraged by Japanese Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide’s announcement of Japan’s commitment to get to net zero emissions  by 2050, which is a very significant positive development, and hereby expresses his appreciation for Prime Minister Suga’s leadership,” said the statement released by UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric. Japan’s announcement comes two weeks after and to submit more ambitious (NDCs) – in which each country spells out what it will do to reduce national emissions, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The statement said Mr. Guterres now looked forward to Japan, the world’s third largest economy, announcing concrete policy measures, along with an ambitiously revised NDC, in time for the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), due to be held in Glasgow in November 2021. “The Secretary-General has no doubt that Japan has all the necessary technological, financial and engineering tools to get to net zero emissions by 2050.  He is confident that Japan will also assist developing countries to reach that same objective, including through technological assistance and its public and private financing for renewable energy”, the statement said. Japan’s pledge comes a month after China’s that China aimed to have carbon emissions peak before 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. President Xi promised to revise China’s NDCs accordingly and called on all countries to meet their commitments under the 2015 , which sought to keep a global temperature rise this century well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The has also pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050. The United States has not made a similar commitment, and after signalling in 2017 that it would withdraw from the , it could formally leave the pact as soon as the day after next week’s presidential election.

2-> Dramatic Arctic fires and sea ice melt, show need for urgent climate action
“Exceptional and prolonged” temperatures in Siberia, have left parts of the Arctic warmer than sub-tropical Florida, and fuelled “devastating” wildfires for a second consecutive year, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said on Friday, of rapidly decreasing sea ice along the Russian polar coast. According to the UN agency, temperatures in Siberia have been more than 5C above average from January to June, and in June up to 10C above average. “Some parts of this week have again topped 30 degrees Celsius – so it’s been warmer in Siberia than many parts of Florida. This should not be happening.” -- spokesperson briefs press corps. “Some parts of Siberia this week have again topped 30 degrees Celsius – so it’s been warmer in Siberia than…many parts of Florida”, said spokesperson Clare Nullis at a press conference in Geneva. “We’ve had exceptional and prolonged heat for months now and this has fuelled devastating Arctic fires; and at the same time we’re seeing rapidly decreasing sea coverage along the Arctic coast”, she continued, noting that their estimated total carbon emissions since January are the highest in 18 years, when the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service of wildfires began. The development follows an astonishing reading of 38°C in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk on 20 June. This has been confirmed by the Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorological and Environmental Monitoring (Roshydromet); WMO is in the process of establishing a committee to assess that decision. The cause of the prolonged furnace-like conditions, is the “blocking” action of a vast weather front over the Arctic, along with a “persistent northward swing of the jet stream” which has been sending warm air into the region, journalists heard. “The Arctic is heating more than twice as fast as the global average, impacting local populations and ecosystems and with global repercussions”, Ms. Nullis said, adding that such extreme heat would have been almost impossible without the influence of human-induced climate change. Worrying footage of the forest fires close to the ocean have underscored the need for urgent climate action by nations and greater commitment to achieving the pledges made in the Paris Climate Agreement, the WMO spokesperson insisted, including efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Data from Wednesday showed 188 probable points of fire in Siberia, according to Roshydromet, with blazes particularly intense in Russia’s Sakha Republic and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, in the far northeast of Siberia. Both areas have experienced much warmer conditions than usual in past months. Russian authorities have also declared that there is an extreme fire hazard throughout the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug – Yugra which is in western Siberia, WMO reported. Wildfire smoke contains pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, volatile organic compounds and solid aerosol particles, the UN agency said in a statement, which noted that Arctic wildfires emitted the equivalent of 56 megatonnes of carbon dioxide in June, compared to 53 megatonnes in June 2019. “We’re seeing, you know, dramatic satellite images, which show the extent of the burns surface; the fire front of the northern-most currently active Arctic wildfire is less than eight kilometres from the Arctic ocean – this should not be happening,” Ms. Nullis said. Highlighting new climate research published in the journal Nature Climate Change pointing to irreversible threats to the Arctic ecosystem, the WMO spokesperson said that “polar bears - which as we all know is a symbol of climate change - could be nearly extinct by the end of the century”, if sea ice continues to shrink at current rates. Accelerating ice retreat along the Arctic Russian coast in the spring, has accelerated since late June, leading to very low sea ice extent in the Laptev and Barents Seas, WMO also warned. “The Northern Sea route appears to be nearly open”. it added. Changes to weather at the poles will likely affect other more distant and populated places too, Ms. Nullis cautioned, thanks to a phenomenon known as “teleconnections”. These are observed in weather events including El Nino, where cold and dry air reaches places that are more used to seeing warmer, wetter conditions. “In general, the Arctic is heating more than twice the global average”, Ms. Nullis said. “It’s having a big impact on local populations and ecosystems, but we always say that what happens in the Arctic doesn’t stay in the Arctic, it does affect our weather in different parts of the world where hundreds of millions of people live.”

3-> Climate emergency ‘a danger to peace’, UN Security Council hears
The climate emergency generated by global warming, is exacerbating existing risks to international peace and security, while also creating new ones, a senior UN official told the on Friday, making the case for swift climate action on multiple fronts. “The climate emergency is a danger to peace”, said Miroslav Jenča, the UN Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, as he called on peace and security actors to play their role and help speed up implementation of the landmark on climate change. Assistant Secretary-General Jenča today: Failure to consider growing impacts of will undermine efforts at conflict prevention, peacemaking & -building, risks trapping vulnerable countries in vicious cycle of climate disaster & conflict.  ‘Vicious cycle’ “The failure to consider the growing impacts of climate change will undermine our efforts at conflict prevention, peacemaking and sustaining peace, and risk trapping vulnerable countries in a vicious cycle of climate disaster and conflict”, he said. Mr. Jenča briefed the Council at the start of an open video-teleconference debate on climate and security, one of the key themes of this month’s German presidency of the 15-member body. Noting that the consequences of climate change vary from region to region, he said the fragile or conflict-affected situations around the world are more exposed to – and less able to cope with – the effects of a changing climate. Peacekeeping link “It is no coincidence that seven of the 10 countries most vulnerable and least prepared to deal with climate change, host a peacekeeping operation or special political mission”, he said. Differences exists between regions, within regions and within communities, with climate-related security risks impacting women, men, girls and boys in different ways, he said. In the Pacific, rising sea levels and extreme weather events pose a risk to social cohesion, he said.  In Central Asia, water stress and reduced access to natural resources can contribute to regional tensions. Across sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America, climate-driven population displacement could undermine regional stability.  And in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East, the effects of climate change are already deepening grievances and escalating the risk of conflict – providing fodder for extremist groups. Outlining some actions that Member States can take together, he said that new technologies must be leveraged to strengthen the ability to turn long-term climate foresight, into actionable, near-term analysis. Mr. Jenča also recommended stronger partnerships that would bring together the efforts already being made by the UN, Member States, regional organizations and others, to identify best practices, strengthen resilience and bolster regional cooperation.

4-> Deforestation has slowed down but still remains a concern, new UN report reveals
Although some 178 million hectares of forest has been lost worldwide over the past three decades, the rate of loss has declined substantially during this period, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) said on Tuesday. The finding comes in its latest Global Forest Resources Assessment report ( ), which aims to turn the tide on deforestation, or the conversion of forest to other uses such as agriculture. Did you know the world’s forest area is decreasing, but the rate of loss has slowed? Check out our new interactive report to find out more on how have changed in the last 30 years 👉 "The wealth of information on the world's forests is a valuable public good for the global community to help facilitate evidence-based policy formulation, decision-making and sound investments in the forest sector," Maria Helena Semedo, the Deputy Director-General. Forest area decreasing The global total forest area stands at some 4.06 billion hectares but continues to decrease, according to the report. FAO estimates that deforestation has robbed the world of roughly 420 million hectares since 1990, mainly in Africa and South America. The top countries for average annual net losses of forest area over the last 10 years, are Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Angola, Tanzania, Paraguay, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bolivia and Mozambique. Sustainability at risk However, there is good news as the rate of forest loss has declined substantially over the past three decades. The annual rate of deforestation was estimated at 10 million hectares between 2015-2020, compared with 12 million during 2010-2015. The area of forest under protection has also reached roughly 726 million hectares: nearly 200 million more than in 1990. Still, there is cause for great concern, according to FAO. Senior Forestry Officer Anssi Pekkarinen, the report’s Coordinator, warned that global targets related to sustainable forest management are at risk. “We need to step up efforts to halt deforestation in order to unlock the full potential of forests in contributing to sustainable food production, poverty alleviation, food security, biodiversity conservation and climate change while sustaining the production of all the other goods and services they provide”, he said. Forests: for people and the planet The FRA report has been published every five years since 1990. For the first time ever, it contains with detailed regional and global analyses for nearly 240 countries and territories. "These newly released tools will enable us to better respond to deforestation and forest degradation, prevent biodiversity loss and improve sustainable forest management,” said Ms. Semedo, the FAO deputy chief. The UN agency believes forests are at the heart of global efforts to achieve sustainable development that benefits both people and the planet. Protecting forests is critical as millions worldwide depend on them for their livelihoods or for food. Forests also contain thousands of different tree, mammal and bird species, among other life forms, and they help mitigate the impacts of climate change. Therefore, information about forests, such as the report, play a vital role in conservation.

5-> UN chief hails Republic of Korea’s vow to achieve carbon neutrality
The Republic of Korea’s pledge towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 has been hailed by UN Secretary-General António Guterres as “a very positive step in the right direction”. The UN chief was “very encouraged” by President Moon Jae-in’s announcement on Wednesday of South Korea’s commitment to get to net zero emissions by this date, according to a issued by his Spokesperson. Secretary-General encouraged by President Moon Jae-in’s announcement of the Republic of Korea’s commitment to get to net zero emissions by 2050, joining a growing group of major economies committed to lead by example. Growing group of nations “With this announcement the Republic of Korea, the world's 11th largest economy and sixth largest exporter, joins a growing group of major economies committed to lead by example in building a sustainable, carbon neutral and climate resilient world by 2050”, the statement said. President Moon made the vow in a speech to the national assembly to “actively respond” to climate change, in line with a $35 billion New Green Deal, announced in July, on ending investment in coal. The Secretary-General described it as “a very positive step in the right direction after Korea’s exemplary Green New Deal”, the statement continued. The announcement came just two days after Japan said it will get to net-zero emissions by 2050, which Mr. Guterres also welcomed. More ambitious targets The UN chief has long made climate action a top priority of his tenure. Speaking to international finance ministers earlier this month, he called for countries to step up commitment to achieving carbon neutrality, in terms of harmful greenhouse gas emissions. He urged nations to submit more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) spelling out action to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, as required under the 2015 on climate change. The Secretary-General is now looking forward to concrete policy measures that will be proposed and implemented by South Korea, the statement said. This includes submitting a revised NDC “which is more ambitious and consistent with its new commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050” in time for the next UN climate change conference, scheduled for next year.

6-> ‘Staggering’ rise in climate emergencies in last 20 years, new disaster research shows
The first 20 years of this century have seen a “staggering” rise in climate disasters, UN researchers said on Monday, while also maintaining that “almost all nations” have failed to prevent a “wave of death and illness” caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In an urgent call for countries to prepare better for all catastrophic events – from earthquakes and tsunamis to biological threats such as the new – data from the UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction ( ) indicates that wealthy nations have done little to tackle the harmful emissions that are linked to climate threats which make up the bulk of disasters today. Disaster risk governance done well can be the difference between: life and death; being injured or being fit; having a roof over your head or being homeless. 13 October is and   Short odds “Disaster management agencies have succeeded in saving many lives through improved preparedness and the dedication of staff and volunteers. But the odds continue to be stacked against them, in particular by industrial nations that are failing miserably on reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Mami Mizutori, chief, and Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. According to the UNDRR report - produced with Belgium’s Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at UCLouvain - there were 7,348 recorded disaster events worldwide, during the last two decades. Approximately 1.23 million people died – approximately 60,000 per year – with more than four billion affected in total; many more than once. These two decades of disaster also caused $2.97 trillion in losses to the global economy, with data also indicating that poorer nations experienced deaths rates more than four times higher than richer nations. By comparison, the previous 20-year period (1980 to 1999) saw 4,212 reported disasters from natural hazards, with 1.19 million deaths, more than three billion people affected and economic losses totalling $ 1.63 trillion. Climate danger spike Although better recording and reporting of disasters may help explain some of the increase in the last two decades, researchers insisted that the significant rise in climate-related emergencies was the main reason for the spike, with floods accounting for more than 40 per cent of disasters – affecting 1.65 billion people - storms 28 per cent, earthquakes (eight per cent) and extreme temperatures (six per cent). “This is clear evidence that in a world where the global average temperature in 2019 was 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, the impacts are being felt in the increased frequency of extreme weather events including heatwaves, droughts, flooding, winter storms, hurricanes and wildfires,” UNDRR reported . Despite the pledge made by the international community in Paris in 2015 to reduce global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, Ms. Mizutori added that it was “baffling” that nations were continuing knowingly “to sow the seeds of our own destruction, despite the science and evidence that we are turning our only home into an uninhabitable hell for millions of people”. COVID-19 exposure Turning to the pandemic, which has “laid bare many shortcomings in disaster risk management (despite) repeated warnings”, the UNDRR report recommended urgent action from Governments to better manage such overlapping disasters. These hazards included known “risk drivers”, such as poverty, climate change, air pollution, population growth in dangerous locations, uncontrolled urbanization and the loss of biodiversity. Chronic needs By way of an example of chronic weather risks which should be the focus of better national preparedness measures, the agency pointed that shifting rainfall patterns pose a risk to the 70 per cent of global agriculture that relies on rain and the 1.3 billion people dependent on degrading agricultural land. Despite the fact that extreme weather events have become so regular in last 20 years, only 93 countries have implemented disaster risk strategies at a national level ahead of the end-of-year deadline, Ms. Mizutori said. “Disaster risk governance depends on political leadership above all, and delivery on the promises made when the Paris agreement and the were adopted,” she said. “But the sad fact is that we are wilfully destructive. And that is the conclusion of this report; COVID-19 is but the latest proof that politicians and business leaders have yet to tune into the world around them.” She added: “It really is all about governance if we want to deliver this planet from the scourge of poverty, further loss of species and biodiversity, the explosion of urban risk and the worst consequences of global warming”, in a joint statement with UCLouvain’s Professor Debarati Guha-Sapir. Although the UNDRR report indicates that there has been some success in protecting vulnerable communities from isolated hazards, thanks to more effective early warning systems, disaster preparedness and response, projected global temperature rises could make these improvements “obsolete in many countries”, the agency warned. Currently, the world is on course for a temperature increase of 3.2 degrees Celsius or more, unless industrialised nations can deliver reductions in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 7.2 per cent annually over the next 10 years in order to achieve the 1.5 degree target agreed in Paris.

7-> FROM THE FIELD: Frontline resilience in Somalia
One hundred thousand households in Somaliland in northwest Somalia have better access to water, protecting them not just from the ravages of climate change but also against the spread of COVID-19, thanks to a project supported by the UN Development Programme. Some 70 per cent of Somalis live from agriculture and pastoralism but changing weather patterns have meant many cannot access the water to sustain these traditional activities. Many younger people have left for cities and towns to live in slum settlements where access to facilities is limited, but now a number of dams, dykes and storage tanks built in Somaliland by UNDP and its partners are encouraging people to carry on with their traditional livelihoods by providing stability in the form of a reliable and consistent supply of water. And as the virus which causes continues to spread across Africa, the new water sources are also key to slowing the spread of the disease by making it easier for people to wash hands and clean household items.

8-> FROM THE FIELD: Women guardians of the environment
Women from around the world are being given a more prominent role in the fight against climate change, thanks to the efforts of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Globally, countries are being encouraged to update their plans to curb climate change and restrict the increase in temperatures to at least two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a process which is being supported by . The impacts of a warming planet are being felt globally, as weather patterns become more unpredictable, and the frequency and intensity of disasters increase. The knowledge and leadership skills of women are being factored into the plans to reverse adverse climatic conditions; farmers in particular are considered to have a key role in introducing agricultural practices which are more favourable to the environment, and can help reduce the emission of harmful gasses, which are accelerating climate change. Read more about how women are increasingly taking on the role of guardians of the environment.

9-> Africa climate change report reveals heat rising north and south, Sahel getting wetter
Africa needs to prepare better for climate change by responding to a wide range of potential risks, a multi-agency led by the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Monday, the first in a series of continent-by-continent assessments. “In recent months we have seen devastating floods, an invasion of desert locusts and now face the looming spectre of drought because of a La Niña event. The human and economic toll has been aggravated by the pandemic,” Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. Filling the gap The report aims to fill a gap in reliable and timely climate information for Africa, which translates into a lack of climate-related development planning, said Vera Songwe, Under-Secretary-General, and Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa ( ). At todays launch of the in report, @FAOs highlighted the importance of & the FAO  initiative to increase farmers access to realtime weather data:     Africa has been warming progressively since the start of the last century, and in the next five years, northern and southern Africa are set to get drier and hotter, while the Sahel region of Western Africa will get wetter, WMO’s Regional Strategic Office Director, Filipe Lucio, told a press conference. “Overall, Africa needs to take action. Action is needed today in terms of adaptation, but also is needed tomorrow in terms of mitigation”, Lucio said. The agricultural sector is key to building climate resistance, since it is the dominant employer and it relies on the use of water and energy – both heavily implicated in climate change, he said. Northern and southern areas under threat of aridity and desertification would benefit from reforestation, which helps to prevent water runoff and creates vegetation which supports the hydrological cycle. Policy recommendations Policy changes are also recommended in transport, energy, infrastructure and industry. Financing has improved with the establishment of a UN-backed but there are still limitations in terms of the continent’s ability to tap into such funds, he added. Climate change has contributed to a jump in food insecurity, mosquito-borne disease and mass displacement in the past decade, and the rise in sea levels has led to unusual weather patterns such as Tropical Cyclone , which hit Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in 2019. It showed the need for communities to learn about the risks and for impact-based warnings about the appropriate actions to take. Cautionary tale A day after the cyclone made landfall, it appeared to have dissipated and people thought the worst was over. But then disaster struck when flooding followed, overwhelming Mozambique’s major port city of Beira, Lucio said. “People were asked to find refuge in appropriate places but the city of Beira was never built to withstand a category-5 tropical cyclone. So that means the building codes need to be changed, but the building codes cannot be changed using what tropical cyclones used to be like in the past. “They need to have forward looking analysis to anticipate the trends into the future and start designing infrastructure and other systems taking into account the changing nature of these tropical cyclones.”

10-> Thousands suffer extreme rights abuses journeying to Africa’s Mediterranean coast, say humanitarians
Thousands of refugees and migrants in eastern and western Africa, are dying while others face harrowing abuse in their attempts to reach the continent’s Mediterranean coast in search of a better life, a joint UN/Danish Refugee Council report Wednesday. Testimonies published by the UN refugee agency, , with the DRC’s Mixed Migration Centre (MMC), reveal random killings, torture, forced labour and beatings. “For too long, the harrowing abuses experienced by refugees and migrants along these overland routes have remained largely invisible.” ~ on latest report of the harrowing journey to Africa's Mediterranean coast  Other people on the move said they had been burnt with hot oil and melted plastic, while others faced electrocution and being tied in stress positions. Smugglers and traffickers were key abusers, but so too were State officials, to a surprising extent, Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR Special Envoy for the Central Mediterranean, told journalists at the UN in Geneva. “In 47 per cent of the cases, the victims reported the perpetrators of violence are law enforcement authorities, whereas in the past we believed that it was mainly smugglers and traffickers”, he said. “Yes, they are key perpetrators of violence, but the primary perpetrators of violence are people who are supposed to protect.” Although accurate data is extremely difficult to gather, data suggests that at least 1,750 people died leaving western or eastern African nations en route to countries including Libya, Egypt or Algeria in 2018 and 2019. This represents more than 70 deaths a month, “making it one of the most deadly routes for refugees and migrants in the world”, UNHCR said in a statement. Almost three in 10 people died as people attempted to cross the Sahara Desert, according to the UN agency. Other lethal hotspots included locations in southern Libya such as Sabha, Kufra and Qatrun, in addition to the “smuggling hub” of Bani Walid southeast of Tripoli and several places along the west African section of the migrant route, including Bamako in Mali and Agadez in Niger. To date this year, at least 70 people are known to have died, including 30 killed in June by traffickers in Mizdah, southern Libya, whose victims came from Bangladesh and African countries. In a note accompanying the report, UNHCR noted that overland deaths are in addition to the “thousands who have died or gone missing” in recent years trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, usually in vessels unfit to make the crossing. “We can consider that an estimate of 72 per cent minimum died overland even before reaching Libya or Morocco or Egypt, their place of initial destination on their journey,” Mr. Cochetel said. “That’s a low estimate in our view, in the sense that the number of deaths on land is more or less the same than the number of deaths at sea for 2018/2019.” Among the report’s findings is clear evidence that Libya is by no means the only place where migrants and refugees face life-threatening dangers. “Abuse actually is along the route and even sometimes it starts within the country of origin and follows people as they move”, said Othman Belbeisi, Senior Regional Advisor to the Director General on Middle East and North Africa. “Especially as they are moving at the hands of those smugglers and traffickers. People do not know their locations and they do not have communications, so even if people die or go missing, it’s very difficult to verify or to know where those people get missed.” Describing the report’s findings as “unacceptable” and calling for action to help vulnerable people on the move, Mr. Cochetel noted that internationally agreed measures to target business and individuals involved in people smuggling had shown limited success. “We have had no new names of traffickers listed for the last two years, we have not had one single arrest of a UN-sanctioned trafficker over the last two years”, he said. “So why can’t States do like they do with trafficking of weapons, terrorism or drug trafficking; why don’t we follow the money-flows, why don’t we seriously go after those people and try to combat impunity.” Around 85 per cent of refugees usually stay in the first country where they arrive, the UNHCR Special Envoy insisted, before underscoring the need for investment in countries of origin, to provide desperate people with an alternative to having to put their lives in the hands of traffickers. “Access to education is difficult, socio-economic inclusion is inexistent in many countries,” Mr. Cochetel said. “Access to medical care is not available, we’ve seen it during in many of those transit countries for migrants or for refugees, so there is a lot to be done under this umbrella of inclusion.” Highlighting the fact that Libya is not safe for refugees and migrants returned from dangerous sea crossing attempts by the Libyan coast guard, IOM’s Othman Belbeisi called for solutions beyond the war-ravaged nation. “The situation is not only in one country, (the) other side of the Mediterranean has also a big responsibility”, he said.

11-> Five things you should know about disposable masks and plastic pollution
The fight against plastic pollution is being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the use of disposable masks, gloves and other protective equipment soars, but UN agencies and partners insist that, if effective measures are put into place, the amount of plastics discarded every year can be significantly cut, or even eliminated. 1) Pollution driven by huge increase in mask sales The promotion of mask wearing as a way to slow the spread of has led to an extraordinary increase in the production of disposable masks: the UN trade body, , estimates that global sales will total some $166 billion this year, up from around $800 million in 2019. Recent media reports, showing videos and photos of divers picking up masks and gloves, littering the waters around the French Riviera, were a wake-up call for many, refocusing minds on the plastic pollution issue, and a reminder that politicians, leaders and individuals need to address the problem of plastic pollution. 2) A toxic problem If historical data is a reliable indicator, it can be expected that around 75 per cent of the used masks, as well as other pandemic-related waste, will end up in landfills, or floating in the seas. Aside from the environmental damage, the financial cost, in areas such as tourism and fisheries, is estimated by the UN Environment Programme ( ) at around $40 billion. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that, if the large increase in medical waste, much of it made from environmentally harmful single-use plastics, is not managed soundly, uncontrolled dumping could result. The potential consequences, says UNEP, which has produced a series of factsheets on the subject, include public health risks from infected used masks, and the open burning or uncontrolled incineration of masks, leading to the release of toxins in the environment, and to secondary transmission of diseases to humans. Because of fears of these potential secondary impacts on health and the environment, UNEP is urging governments to treat the management of waste, including medical and hazardous waste, as an essential public service. The agency argues that the safe handling, and final disposal of this waste is a vital element in an effective emergency response. “Plastic pollution was already one of the greatest threats to our planet before the outbreak,” says Pamela Coke-Hamilton, UNCTAD’s director of international trade. “The sudden boom in the daily use of certain products to keep people safe and stop the disease is making things much worse.” 3) Existing solutions could cut plastics by 80 per cent However, this state of affairs can be changed for the better, as shown by a recent, wide-ranging, report on plastic waste published by The Pew Charitable Trusts, and sustainability thinktank Systemiq. The study, “Breaking the Plastic Wave: A Comprehensive Assessment of Pathways Towards Stopping Ocean Plastic Pollution”, which was endorsed by Inger Andersen, head of the UN environment agency UNEP, forecasts that, if no action is taken, the amount of plastics dumped into the ocean will triple by 2040, from 11 to 29 million tonnes per year. But around 80 per cent of plastic pollution could be eliminated over this same period, simply by replacing inadequate regulation, changing business models and introducing incentives leading to the reduced production of plastics. Other recommended measures include designing products and packaging that can be more easily recycled, and expanding waste collection, particularly in lower income countries. 4) Global cooperation is essential In its July analysis of plastics, sustainability and development, UNCTAD came to the conclusion that global trade policies also have an important role to play in reducing pollution. Many countries have introduced regulations that mention plastics over the last decade, an indicator of growing concern surrounding the issue, but, the UNCTAD analysis points out, for trade policies to be truly effective, coordinated, global rules are needed. “The way countries have been using trade policy to fight plastic pollution has mostly been uncoordinated, which limits the effectiveness of their efforts, says Ms. Coke-Hamilton. “There are limits to what any country can achieve on its own.” 5) Promote planet and job-friendly alternatives Whilst implementing these measures would make a huge dent in plastic pollution between now and 2040, the Pew/ Systemiq report acknowledges that, even in its best-case scenario, five million metric tons of plastics would still be leaking into the ocean every year. A dramatic increase in innovation and investment, leading to technological advances, the report’s study’s authors conclude, would be necessary to deal comprehensively with the problem. Furthermore, UNCTAD is urging governments to promote non-toxic, biodegradable or easily recyclable alternatives, such as natural fibres, rice husk, and natural rubber. These products would be more environmentally-friendly and, as developing countries are key suppliers of many plastic substitutes, could provide the added benefit of providing new jobs. Bangladesh, for example, is the world’s leading supplier of jute exports, whilst, between them, Thailand and Côte d’Ivoire account for the bulk of natural rubber exports. “There’s no single solution to ocean plastic pollution, but through rapid and concerted action we can break the plastic wave,” said Tom Dillon, Pew’s vice president for environment. As the organization’s report shows, “we can invest in a future of reduced waste, better health outcomes, greater job creation, and a cleaner and more resilient environment for both people and nature”.

12-> Exported used cars ‘dumped’ on developing nations, driving up pollution, UN warns
Used vehicles exported from richer countries are contributing to increased air pollution in developing nations and hindering efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change, according to a report published on Monday by the UN Environment Programme ( ). The – the first-ever of its kind – found that some 14 million used cars, vans and minibuses were exported worldwide from Europe, the United States and Japan between 2015 and 2018. The trade in used vehicles matters to 🔵Our health 🟡Our safety 🟢Our planet 🌏🌍🌎 🟣Our wallets Learn more in our new report:  Around 80 per cent, went to low and middle income countries, with more than half going to Africa. Exports on the rise “Cleaning up the global vehicle fleet is a priority to meet global and local air quality and climate targets”, Inger Andersen, the Executive Director. “Over the years, developed countries have increasingly exported their used vehicles to developing countries; because this largely happens unregulated, this has become the export of polluting vehicles.” Globally, the transport sector is responsible for nearly a quarter of all energy-related greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicle emissions are a significant source of the fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides that are major causes of urban air pollution. Weak regulation policies The report is based on an in-depth analysis of some 146 countries.  The authors found that two-thirds have “weak” or “very weak” policies to regulate the import of vehicles past their prime. Poor quality second-hand autos also lead to more road accidents.  Countries such as Malawi, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Burundi, which have “weak” or very weak” used vehicle regulations, have very high road traffic death rates, according to UNEP. However, countries that implement age and emissions standards, or other such measures, receive high-quality used vehicles including hybrid and electric cars, and at an affordable rate. They also have fewer accidents on the road. Ms. Andersen said the lack of effective standards and regulation means that old, polluting and unsafe vehicles are effectively being dumped. “Developed countries must stop exporting vehicles that fail environment and safety inspections and are no longer considered roadworthy in their own countries, while importing countries should introduce stronger quality standards”, she charged. The road ahead calls for action by both sides to adopt harmonized minimum quality standards. UNEP, with the support of the UN Road Safety Trust Fund, is part of an initiative towards this goal. The focus initially will be on Africa, where several countries have already implemented minimum quality standards, including Morocco, Algeria, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Mauritius.  More have expressed interest in joining.

13-> First Person: Turning ‘apathetic people into climate activists’; a young person’s view
An 18-year-old environmental campaigner from the United States has told UN News how she wants to “turn apathetic people into climate activists”. Sophia Kianni, whose family originally comes from Iran, is one of seven young people from across the world who have been selected to participate in the UN Secretary-General’s Youth Advisory Group on Climate Change. The group which was launched at the end of the July aims to engage young people in “an open and transparent dialogue” about climate issues. “I first became interested in the effects of climate change as an Iranian-American when I visited my relatives in Iran as a 12 or 13-year old. I noticed how polluted the sky was; I couldn’t see the stars at night. I realized this was a symptom of the climate crisis that was particularly bad in the Middle East, where temperatures are rising at a rate of more than twice the global average. I talked to my relatives about the pollution and was startled they knew pretty much nothing about climate change even though they were adults and so it became my pet passion to educate them about the climate crisis. I understood that Iran as a country is facing many challenges and recognized that climate change was maybe not at the forefront of people’s minds, but I still thought that my Iranian family deserved to know about the climate crisis. Awareness growing When I told them what that actually meant, and that I was worried about my future, they were pretty shocked. And following those conversations they have tried to be more conscientious about the impact of their daily activities, for example driving less and switching off lights. These are small steps to minimize their carbon footprint but if everyone took these steps it would make a huge difference. I also realized there was no information in their language Farsi, so decided to translate information for them from English sources with the help of my mum. This experience with my relatives in Iran inspired me to establish my international nonprofit organization, Climate Cardinals, which has just launched, and which has over 5,000 volunteers translating climate information into more than 100 languages and dialects, including everything from Spanish to Haitian Creole, or Farsi to an Indonesian dialect. These volunteers have an average age of 16-years-old. We started by translating 3,000 pages of a sustainable fashion glossary as well as a forest climate glossary for which we are now awaiting feedback. One-person show, to ‘gigantic’ project So, a small one-person show of educating my family has turned into a gigantic project with over 5,000 people involved and now I am helping to educate thousands and thousands of people. I am very excited about our partnership with Radio Javan (Persian language internet radio station based in the United States) which has a reach of 11 million people on social media. So, I moved from educating 11 family members to 11 million people and it made me realise that small actions are the gateway for gigantic visions to develop. Everyone has a power to affect change in their own way. Most young people I talk to believe the climate crisis is a big deal but their passion to change depends on how much information they have; the more we talk, the more we raise awareness, the more people understand how pressing this is. For me, this is about turning apathetic people into climate activists. Message to UN Secretary-General Young people are on the front lines of , showing us what bold leadership looks like. That is why I am launching my Youth Advisory Group on climate change - to provide essential perspectives, ideas & solutions.  Our group has been meeting online and we are due to talk the UN Secretary-General in the next couple of weeks. We will be giving him feedback on his climate strategy and how the UN can better engage young people in the process. Personally, I would like to tell him that we need climate information in more than just the UN languages. The UN should also be engaging even younger people. At 18, I am the youngest in the group, but there are also many activists who are between the ages of 14 and 17, and their voices are very important. If more younger people are engaged in the climate discussion it is more likely they will become climate activists. The Individual v the political process Ultimately, I am optimistic that we can reverse climate change, but a lot of this will fall into the political process as no matter how much I or other individuals do on a personal level, it is really up to the government to pass comprehensive climate legislation. I really hope people become more engaged in the political process and educate themselves on which candidates support climate change policies. The younger generation is more progressive so I am hopeful in the future we will be able to elect more politicians who care about climate change issues, and who will pass aggressive legislation."

14-> Building a green economy, brick by brick
In Uruguay, thousands of families earn a precarious livelihood making bricks, using traditional methods that are often inefficient and harmful to the environment. A UN project, in collaboration with the Uruguayan government, aims to make the industry less polluting, whilst preserving jobs for the many artisans who depend on it. Land, fire and water When Eduardo Romero was 40 years old, he was fired from his job as a bricklayer. It was 1992, in the city of Durazno, Uruguay. With his few belongings on his shoulder, Eduardo headed for the north of the country and stopped only when he found work. It was in the city of Tranqueras, and his new source of income came from land, fire and water: Eduardo started making bricks. Today, five jobs, two ventures, three children and 28 years later, Mr. Romero is still linked to this insecure industry, which is both an easy source of employment for those who need it most, but where people work without social security or insurance, and with their labour rights continuously violated. “It is a precarious sector,” says Mr. Romero. “We are always on the edge of town, wearing dirty clothes.” Reliable statistics on the industry are hard to come by, but estimates suggest that there are some 14,000 families working in 3,500 production units across the country. The informal nature of the work makes for high turnover. Changing traditions On top of the pressure on individual workers, the industry has a negative impact on the environment; emissions are high and some brickmakers, lacking other sources of fuel, burn protected species of trees. During the brickmaking season, which lasts from September to April, an artisanal producer can make an average of about 30,000 bricks per month; the entire sector in Uruguay yields enough bricks every year to build at least 1,500 new houses, plus hundreds of businesses, kilns, factories, and more. Eduardo is one of a growing number of artisanal producers who are changing the way they make bricks and, in the process, helping the entire country enjoy a cleaner environment. But in a sector like this, changing traditions is difficult. Turning mud and garbage into solid foundations Making bricks the traditional way, is an art that requires several stages. First the elements are obtained to make the raw material: water, soil, clay, sand, and organic matter such as horse dung. This material is mixed and put into moulds, then laid out to dry for three days. Then they are baked in an oven, with firewood serving as the main fuel, for between two and seven days, and allowed to cool. Four days later they are ready for sale. At each stage of the process, there are abundant occupational hazards and environmental impacts. ‘Far behind in technological terms’ In addition, this method is far more inefficient than modern, mechanized techniques: according to the government, factories can churn out bricks almost seven times faster than an artisanal producer. “The artisanal brick industry is far behind in technological terms,” says Pablo Montes, who works for the Uruguayan government, and is also national coordinator of PAGE Uruguay (Partnership for Action on the Green Economy), a project involving the UN and the Uruguayan Government. He explains that there are significant obstacles to artisans moving to newer techniques: it has fewer job opportunities; it also requires certification that most artisans don’t have, whether for the expense, or because many have not finished primary school and can barely read or write. That’s why PAGE is looking to support the artisanal industry, helping workers to enjoy greater rights and higher incomes, and cutting pollution during the production process. PAGE staff talked to brickmakers from all over the country, looking for improvements at every stage of the production process, and brought in consultants from other countries – such as Colombia, which has already undergone its own transformation – to give workshops on how to make better bricks. By doing so, PAGE is helping to move Uruguay closer to the twin goals of a greener and more prosperous economy. The project is still in progress, and is developing even better methods and training more brickmakers. Artisanal, safer, greener “Transforming the industry will allow these ventures to be successful,” says Mr. Romero. Still, he has no illusions that such a change will be easy to achieve. “In this profession, there are men and women who have made an honest living for decades or for their whole lives,” he explains. Artisanal brickmaking is a way of life, a tradition. Countless homes and businesses in every part of Uruguay have been built with bricks made by the hands of anonymous laborers. They have invested their lives in the profession, and they are proud of what they have created. “That is what we are trying to defend,” says Mr. Romero. Even as he changes his own way of working, with guidance from PAGE, he realizes that not everyone will be so quick to adapt. Some may be sceptical of outsiders who come to teach them a skill they’ve practiced for many years. Pablo Montes of PAGE is optimistic that brickmakers will be won over by the benefits that the new ways of working offer them. “We want to keep the industry artisanal, while making it safer and greener,” he says. “We can have both.”

15-> UN praises resilience and vision of younger generation, marking International Youth Day
Commemorating International Youth Day, top UN officials have called on leaders around the world to “do everything possible” to enable young people to reach their fullest potential. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, which has upended young peoples’ lives and aspirations and heightened their vulnerabilities, UN praised the younger generation’s resilience, resourcefulness and engagement. It is not easy to be a young person in the world today. From unemployment to climate change to gender inequality to mental health, there are so many issues that set us back. But you fight for your rights and your communities every day. Happy to all those unsung heroes! “They are the young people who have risen up to demand climate action. They are mobilizing for racial justice and gender equality and are the champions of a more sustainable world”, he said in a marking . “Many are young women who have been on the frontlines in mobilizing for justice and climate action — while also serving on the frontlines of the response.” The Secretary-General also underscored that realizing the promise of the young generation requires investing far more in their inclusion, participation, organizations and initiatives. “I call on leaders and adults everywhere to do everything possible to enable the world’s youth to enjoy lives of safety, dignity and opportunity and contribute to the fullest of their great potential,” he added. The of this year’s International Youth Day, “Youth Engagement for Global Action”, highlights the ways in which the engagement of young people at the local, national and global levels is strengthening national and multilateral institutions and processes, as well as draw lessons on how their representation and engagement in formal institutional politics can be enhanced. Also this year, through the #31DaysOfYOUth social media campaign, UN celebrates young people throughout the month of August, leading up and following International Day, to help spread the word and strike up a conversation surrounding youth engagement for global action. ‘Young people are the trail-blazers of progress’ – UN General Assembly President Echoing the Secretary-General’s call, , the President of the UN General Assembly, also underlined a “global responsibility” to ensure that young people everywhere have access to just and equitable opportunities to fulfil their rights and aspirations. “The potential for humanity to create a peaceful, prosperous future will not be reached as long as inequities and discrimination against youth remain commonplace, and young people lack opportunities to have their voices heard,” he said in a separate on the International Day. The Assembly President applauded young people for their “amazing contributions” towards a better future. Their movements in their communities and countries, he said, are already improving societies and raising global ambitions, every day. “In the era of COVID-19 and the long-lasting social and economic negative effects it has on youth – and with only 10 years left to achieve the (SDGs) – [their] vision and commitment are paramount to creating a more sustainable and inclusive world,” he added. “With your innovation and ambition, and guided by the , I am sure that your generation will effectively transform the world into a more sustainable, inclusive and just place for all,” Mr. Muhammad-Bande urged all young people, inviting them to take part in the virtual UN75 Youth Plenary, to be held in September to add their voice to shaping the United Nations for decades ahead.

16-> Shift needed from what weather will be, to ‘what the weather will do’
Extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency, intensity and severity as a result of climate change, hitting vulnerable communities disproportionately hard, a new UN report has revealed, calling for greater investment in effective early warning systems. The , released on Tuesday by the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ), underscored the need to switch to impact-based forecasting – an evolution from “what the weather will be” to “what the weather will do” so that people and businesses can act early, based on the warnings. Being prepared and able to react at the right time, in the right place, can save many lives and protect the livelihoods  “Early warning systems constitute a prerequisite for effective disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Being prepared and able to react at the right time, in the right place, can save many lives and protect the livelihoods of communities everywhere,” Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of WMO, said in a foreword to the report. He also highlighted that while it could take years to recover from the human and economic toll of the pandemic, it is crucial to remember that climate change will continue to pose an on-going and increasing threat to human lives, ecosystems, economies and societies for centuries to come. “Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is an opportunity to move forward along a more sustainable path towards resilience and adaptation in the light of anthropogenic climate change,” added Mr. Taalas. Challenges in small islands, developing countries Globally over the past 50 years, some 11,000 disasters, attributed to weather, climate and water-related hazards, claimed over 2 million lives and cost the world economy $3.6 trillion, to WMO. In 2018 alone, storms, floods, droughts and wildfires left some 108 million people in need of international humanitarian assistance. By 2030, this number could increase by almost 50 per cent at a cost of around $20 billion a year. In spite of the alarming figures, one in three people are still not adequately covered by early warning systems, with communities in Africa, least developed countries and small island developing States most affected, the UN agency added, citing challenges such as weak dissemination of early warning, inadequate observing networks, and insufficient capacity to translate early warning into early action. Making early warning systems more effective The report outlines six key recommendations to improve the implementation and effectiveness of early warning systems, globally:

17-> Climate change: Record northern heat, fuels concerns over US wildfire destruction
The northern hemisphere experienced its warmest August ever, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said on Tuesday, amid searing conditions that have contributed to devastating wildfires on the west coast of the United States. “The northern hemisphere just had its hottest summer on record”, said Clare Nullis, spokesperson. Northern hemisphere had its warmest summer and warmest August on record, per . Globally, it was 2nd warmest August. It was 44th consecutive August and 428th consecutive month with temps above 20th-century average. The 5 warmest Augusts have been since 2015.  “It also had its hottest August on record; this is according to figures released last night by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).” Data indicates that from June to August, temperatures were 2.11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.17 degrees Celsius) above average. This surpasses previous warmest periods in 2016 and 2019, Ms. Nullis said, adding that the five warmest summers for the northern hemisphere have occurred since 2015. At a global level, August was the second warmest on record, the WMO spokesperson added, citing NOAA data, at 1.69F (0.94C) above the 20th-century average of 60.1F (15.6C). The past month was the 44th consecutive August and the 428th consecutive month, with temperatures above the 20th century average. “The 10 warmest Augusts on record have all occurred since 1998”, she said. The 2020 fire season on the west coast of the US has also been record-breaking in its scale, with some 16,0000 firefighters involved in the effort to protect people and towns in California alone. “The heat has contributed to a very, very destructive fire season”, Ms. Nullis said. “As we know, the states of California, Oregon and Washington have been worst-hit, entire neighbourhoods razed to the ground, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and thousands of people and tragically causing casualties.” In addition to fatalities and destruction, the fires have impacted air quality for millions of people and turned skies orange, the UN agency warned. Satellite images show clouds of smoke billowing over the western Pacific and likely travelling more than 1,300 miles (2,092 kilometres). The smoke led to a hazy morning on the opposition coast, as the sun battled to shine through an unusual layer of smog in New York City. Citing “red flag” conditions in northeastern California for much of this week, Ms. Nullis explained that this was the most dangerous threat level and that it is characterised by a combination of strong winds and tinder-dry conditions. Of 41,599 fires recorded in the US so far this year, 36,383 were caused by human activity, the WMO spokesperson continued, with more than 2.5 million acres scorched across the United States. California saw most individual blazes, with 7,072 human-caused fires reported, according to the US National Interagency Fire Center. Ms. Nullis also that the US National Hurricane Center issued advisories for “no less than five” tropical cyclones over the Atlantic basin – tying with the record for the highest number of tropical cyclones there at one time. The 2020 Atlantic hurricane season is so active that it is expected to exhaust the regular list of storm names, the WMO spokesperson said. “If this happens, the Greek alphabet will be used for only the second time on record,” she added.

18-> Ozone treaties ‘inspiring examples’ of political will, UN chief says on International Day
The United Nations commemorated the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer, on Wednesday, recognizing the success of landmark global agreements in helping restore the protective layer around Earth. In a , UN applauded the 1985 , its , and the Protocol’s . “The ozone treaties stand out as inspiring examples that show that, where political will prevails, there is little limit to what we can achieve in common cause,” he said. It is imperative that we put our efforts and investments into tackling climate change and protecting nature and the ecosystems that sustain us  “Let us take encouragement from how we have worked together to preserve the ozone layer and apply the same will to healing the planet and forging a brighter and more equitable future for all humanity.” Against the backdrop of the pandemic and its devastating socio-economic impacts, the Secretary-General urged efforts to build stronger and resilient societies. “As we look ahead to global recovery from the social and economic devastation caused by the pandemic, we must commit to building stronger and more resilient societies,” said Mr. Guterres. “It is imperative that we put our efforts and investments into tackling climate change and protecting nature and the ecosystems that sustain us,” he added. The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, which celebrates its thirty-fifth anniversary this year, was the first step in fixing the hole in the planet’s ozone layer. In 1987, countries adopted the Convention’s Montreal Protocol, committing to replace gases used in aerosols and cooling appliances that were causing the hole. So far, about 99 per cent of these gases have been replaced, helping the ozone layer heal. But the work of the Montreal Protocol is not over, said Mr. Guterres “Through the Protocol’s Kigali Amendment, the international community is finding alternatives for coolants that contribute to the growing menace of climate disruption,” he continued, adding, “If fully implemented, the Kigali Amendment can prevent 0.4 degrees Celsius of global warming. I congratulate the 100 Parties that have been leading by example,” added Mr. Guterres.  Ozone is a special form of oxygen with the chemical formula O3. The oxygen we breathe and that is so vital to life on earth is O2. Most ozone resides high up in the atmosphere, between 10-40 kilometres (about 6-25 miles) above Earth’s surface. This region is called the stratosphere and it contains about 90 per cent of all the ozone in the atmosphere. Though it constitutes a very small part of the atmosphere, ozone’s presence is vital for life on Earth, as it shields the planet from Sun’s biologically harmful ultraviolet UV-B radiation. The International Day In 1994, the UN General Assembly 16 September the , commemorating the date of the signing, in 1987, of the . The 2020 theme for the International Day, “Ozone for life”, is a reminder that not only is ozone crucial for life on Earth, but that we must continue to protect the ozone layer for future generations.

19-> Reversing land degradation can ‘pre-empt and manage’ conflicts
To help prevent conflicts and at the same time protect the planet, “we all must tackle environmental degradation”, a top UN official told the Security Council on Thursday. In a virtual briefing on the humanitarian impact of continued degradation, peace and security, the Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification ( ), Ibrahim Thiaw, reminded the Council that environmental protection was vital for “our health, our wealth and our wellbeing”. “If we, in a coordinated way, avoid, reduce and reverse land degradation we can better prevent and preempt and manage many conflicts in the world”, he maintained. : Join our ES and  as they brief ministerial-level open debate on the humanitarian effects of environmental degradation for peace and security in the  Shifting threats The UNCCD chief outlined that today’s threats have shifted from conflict between States to violence predominantly at the hands of non-State actors. “An assessment of the root-causes of these conflicts shows that a large proportion have a link to the environment”, he stated, pointing to the abundance of natural resources that can be monetized, such as oil, minerals and wildlife or “the scarcity of land, water and vegetation”. He noted that in arid lands, such as Africa’s Sahel region, violence often erupts over competition for land. Conflict causes Ecosystem degradation, resource competition or inequitable distribution of benefits also increase vulnerability and raises the risk of conflict, according to Mr. Thiaw. However, he attested, environmental cooperation can “increase capacity to conflict management, prevention and recovery”. He said security concerns were not limited to violent conflict but also includes “sustainable livelihoods, health and wellbeing”. The UNCCD chief asserted that rural-urban migration due to drought and desertification was additionally responsible for different types of violence. “Grievances against government might rise when agricultural outcomes are depressed by drought and its induced-out migration”, he said, as an example. Risks outpacing solutions Against the backdrop that the world relies on ecosystems rooted in soil, Mr. Thiaw said that the economy is influenced by the land’s health, which “catalyzes the impact of environmental degradation on peace, security and stability”. And he explained that the world’s capacity to address security risks driven by climate change and environmental degradation are not keeping pace with the changing landscape of threats. Moving forward Reducing environmental security risks should focus on “maintaining the earth’s life-support ecosystem generating water, food and clean air” and on improving “resource governance and social resilience to natural resource shocks and stresses”, he said. He pointed out that protecting land could trigger a broad peace, stability and ecosystem recovery cycle, that yields “a constructive feedback loop extending far beyond an initial choice to protect the environment”. Tightrope of survival In his briefing to the Council, Peter Maurer, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), spelled out that “from the Sahel and Lake Chad region to warzones around the globe, millions are suffering on the front lines of environmental degradation, climate change and conflict”. He underscored that peace and security would not be established by focusing only on military and security measures to curb conflict and violence. “We must ensure, those most at risk are urgent priorities”, said the top ICRC official, adding that building and protecting resilient communities from violence is “critical”. Voice of youth Also addressing the meeting, Inna Modja, Earth Ambassador and activist, said forced migration was increasing, causing many to flee the vast Sahel region, which stretches from west to east across Africa. She encouraged the Council to invest in the region’s “youth and women” as major “agents of change”.

20-> FROM THE FIELD: Protecting the post-pandemic planet
An emphasis on sustainable development and fighting climate change will benefit countries around the world as they recover from the unprecedented economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, says the UN Development Programme, (UNDP). has been working for over a decade with governments on developing what are known as Nationally Determined Contributions ( ), which outline commitments made by individual states to combat climate change. These commitments, which focus on forestry, energy, environment and oceans, are part of the on climate change which aims to restrict the global increase in temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius and hopefully 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. continues to disrupt the life of billions globally, pushing tens of million into extreme poverty and straining health and social security systems, as countries face the deepest global recession in 75 years.

21-> UN chief and UK premier announce December climate summit
With the COVID-19 pandemic having disrupted plans to hold the annual international UN climate meeting - known as the COP - this year, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom have announced that they will instead co-host a “landmark global event” on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The event is being dubbed “the sprint to Glasgow” by the UN. Before the pandemic hit, the UK was slated to host this year’s COP in the Scottish City. The Summit is now scheduled to take place a year later, in November 2021. The December event will be held amid signs that the world is off-track to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and that a carbon-free economy is long overdue. “The climate emergency is fully upon us, and we have no time to waste, Mr. Guterres said in a statement. “The answer to our existential crisis is swift, decisive, scaled up action and solidarity among nations”. The aim of the event is to rally momentum and call for much greater climate action and ambition. National governments will be invited to present more ambitious and high-quality climate plans, as well as COVID recovery plans, new finance commitments and measures to limit global warming to 1.5C. It will bring together leaders from across all levels of government, as well as the private sector and civil society, to present new measures, boosting ambition and action. High-level climate roundtable More details of the event will be released on Thursday, during an online High-level Roundtable on climate, which will feature addresses from Mr. Guterres and Mr. Johnson, as well as several other world leaders. The Roundtable, beginning at 11:30 New York time, features opening remarks from Mr. Guterres and Mr. Johnson; a discussion on climate finance from several leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Sebastián Piñera Echenique, President of the Republic of Chile, the country originally slated to host this year’s climate COP. Discussions on aligning COVID-19 recovery packages and business plans with the 1.5C and carbon neutrality goals, and on climate adaptation and resilience will follow.

22-> LIVE: UN Climate Change Roundtable - a 'just transition' through climate action is key says Guterres
Live coverage of the High-Level UN Climate Change Roundtable, featuring UN chief António Guterres, designed to rally momentum for more ambitious action to limit global warming and ensure sustainable post-pandemic recovery plans.  UN chief warns that ' ' Watch the roundtable live on UK and UN to . UN climate envoy: ' '  13:40 Our common objective must be a just transition, UN chief The UN Secretary-General was listening to the interventions of Heads of State, CEOs and experts, and he came back at the end of the Roundtable to share his thoughts. The main takeaway for Mr. Guterres was that a common conclusion has been reached: the global climate increase must be limited to 1.5 degrees, and carbon neutrality reached by 2050, with a dramatic reduction in emissions by 2030. Countries need to present updated climate action plans before COP26, in a year’s time, and all actors, from cities, to companies to NGOs, need to present their own transition plans. Let’s make sure we abide by what science tells us to do The fundamental task of governments and other public institutions, said Mr. Guterres, is to avoid putting up barriers to these plans. This is still happening today, he said, in the form of taxation, and fossil fuel subsidies that are actively hindering climate action. A tax on carbon, declared the UN chief, is essential. Recounting a discussion with a Prime Minister who feared losing elections if they taxed carbon, Mr. Guterres suggested taxing pollution rather than income, as a move that would save jobs, and might even win elections. Responding to another Prime Minister’s complaint that they couldn’t remove fossil fuel subsidies, because small businesses and citizens need cheap fuel, the UN chief told them to instead give the money directly to the poor. Even if effective action is taken, climate change is already here, and is having a terrible impact on vulnerable people, warned Mr. Guterres. Financing must therefore be mobilized, not just for climate mitigation, but also for climate adaptation to support those who are suffering. “Let’s make sure we abide by what science tells us to do”, he concluded. “a 1.5 degree limit, carbon neutrality by 2050, and a just transition”.  13:10 The theme of the last section was “protecting people and planet to ensure a sustainable and just recovery”. Two Heads of State spoke on the subject: Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, and Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda. The UN official involved was Vladimir Kattsov, who is a member of the World Meteorological Organization’s Scientific Advisory Panel and the UN Climate ( ) Adaptation Committee. Mr. Kattsov declared that science is a powerful tool in climate adaptation. He took his own country, Russia, as an example: a huge country with vast differences in climate. Without regular monitoring, effective climate adaptation is not possible. The UN official said that cost of making erroneous decisions is high, and that governments must therefore invest in research and intellectual capital, and ensure that there is strong dialogue between scientists and politicians.  12:55 Several UN agencies have been underlining the devastating impacts of climate change during the Roundtable. UN Peacekeeping has listed global risks, and the links between climate and security issues, whilst the refugee agency , tweeted a reminder of the effect that climate change has on the movement of people. Climate issues and security issues are inextricably linked. Recognizing the urgency to address them is a must.    ICYMI: people are being displaced by climate change. We must meet with .  12:45 The section of the event devoted to recovery packages has just wrapped up. The speakers, a mix of business and government leaders, were Lotay Tshering, the Prime Minister of Bhutan, Nitish Kumar, Chief Minister of Bihar State, India, Dinah McLeod, CEO of the Global Cement and Concrete Association, the head of Microsoft, Brad Smith, Kahori Miyake, Co-Chair of the Japan Climate Leaders' Partnership, and Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and formerly a French politician, who played a key role in the 2015 Paris climate talks.  12:30 The entire financial sector needs to adapt The world leaders involved in the climate finance section of the roundtable have all had their say, including commitments to ramping up ambition. The last speaker was Mark Carney, the Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, and formerly the Governor of the Bank of England. Mr. Carney declared that, to achieve the Paris climate goals, the whole economy needs to transition, including the financial sector, and every financial sector must take climate into account. Disclosure, he continued, is essential, adding that it is unacceptable for companies not to disclose the impact of their decisions on the climate. The EU is making this mandatory, and banks are moving in the right direction. This shift, declared Mr. Carney, will have a huge impact on companies’ plans. The Special Envoy described the financial sector as being at a tipping point, and told world leaders that the climate actions they take over the next year, will allow the private sector to adjust in a way that will help us to achieve our climate goals. 12:00 Youth climate activist Sophia Kianni is watching today’s event. She has been reacting to Mr. Guterres's speech. "The Secretary-General is absolutely right in stressing that we need sustainable recovery plans that tackle climate change. On the topic of us “prioritizing the most vulnerable people and communities,” it is especially crucial to include and prioritize indigenous people in climate change negotiations, as they have been protecting the earth for generations but their voices have been neglected or ignored in high-level discussions. We must acknowledge and address the links between racial justice and climate justice as we work to devise a fair and just transition -  Additionally, we must acknowledge and address the links between racial justice and climate justice as we work to devise a fair and just transition away from fossil fuels that addresses structural inequities. Young people are deeply concerned about climate change, as our generation will have to reckon with the disastrous implications of global warming exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius. Millions of young people have turned out to strike for climate action, and it is crucial for us to have a seat at the table when discussing issues such as climate change that will have such a large impact on our futures. We have captured the world’s attention and now it’s time for governments to listen to our demands. With the United States general election getting closer each day, it has been scary to imagine another 4 years without decisive climate action, especially after watching forest fires exacerbated by warmer temperatures ravage through California. The new climate crisis countdown clock erected in New York City displays that there are only 7 years left until Earth’s current carbon budget is depleted. I am dismayed by the lack of climate action being taken by world leaders; as we bounce back from COVID-19, it will be crucial to include climate action in recovery efforts". 11:50 UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson followed Mr. Guterres. The UK will be hosting the next UN Climate summit, COP26, which has been delayed until November 2021. After going through some of the ways in which the UK is attempting to meet its climate commitments, Mr. Johnson expressed his desire to work with all world leaders to make COP26 a success, and looked ahead to the virtual event due to be co-hosted by the UN and UK on 12 December, the fifth anniversary of the Paris Climate Agreement. The next part of the event focuses on climate finance, featuring Mark Carney, Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Sebastián Piñera Echenique, the country originally slated to host this year’s climate COP. They’ll be discussing ways to boost climate finance 11:40 In his opening , told the Roundtable, that “the world has a high fever and is burning up”. Noting that climate disruption is “daily news”, he painted a picture of the past decade being the hottest on record, rising greenhouse gases and devastating wildfires, combined with record floods that are upending people and the planet. “The recent United in Science report from the World Meteorological Organization ( ) is unequivocal”, he told the meeting. “We must urgently reverse course”. Against this backdrop, he urged everyone “to act on three urgent priorities”, beginning with sustainable recovery plans that tackle climate change. In recovering from the pandemic, UN chief stressed the need for everyone to work together to end fossil-fuel subsides, put a price on carbon and consider climate risks in all financial and policy decisions. “And most important, leave no one behind”, he said. The UN chief outlined specific action which needs to start immediately, including COVID-19 recovery packages that also decarbonize the global economy, and policies consistent with the key goal of limiting emissions to 1.5 degrees Celsius. “Transitioning to renewable energy…will yield three times as many jobs as fossil fuels”, he said, noting, “the possibilities of a sustainable blue economy are still untapped”. Secondly, the UN chief told the meeting that science must guide them in protecting economies and societies – zeroing in on a 45 per cent reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. He described the fifth anniversary of the in December, as “an important moment to continue raising climate ambition”. Finally, the Secretary-General stressed that all solutions must prioritize the most vulnerable nations and communities through just transition policies, international cooperation and solidarity. On the current path, “the scale of suffering around the world due to climate disruption will be beyond all our imaginations”, he said, urging everyone to commit “now” to sweeping climate action. 11:30 The event is about to begin! A reminder that you can watch the whole thing live , thanks to our colleagues at UN Web TV 11:15 The UN has been canvassing the views of young people on the future of the organization, and committing to taking their views into account. In this powerful video, young people recount powerful stories of the devastating impact that climate change is having on their lives. It includes climate activist Greta Thunberg, whose impassioned speech at the 2019 UN Climate Action Summit made headlines around the world.   These young people are calling for urgent climate action with . And here's why it's all so important, in case you needed a reminder... 10:30 Apart from Mr. Guterres and Mr. Johnson, a host of other leaders are expected to join via video conference. They include Mark Carney, Secretary-General’s Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and Sebastián Piñera Echenique, the country originally slated to host this year’s climate COP. They’ll be discussing ways to boost climate finance. This will be followed by a roundtable on aligning recovery packages and business plans with the 1.5C and carbon neutrality goals. The leaders will include the head of Microsoft, Brad Smith, Laurence Tubiana, former French politician and now CEO of the European Climate Foundation, and  Lotay Tshering, the Prime Minister of Bhutan. The last discussion will be on climate adaptation and resilience, which will involve the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, Vladimir Kattsov from the UN Climate ( ) adaptation committee, and Tasneem Essop, Executive Director of Climate Action Network. The whole event is expected to wrap up at about 13:00 New York time.  Good morning from New York, where the UN is hosting (online, of course, given the ongoing pandemic) a High-level Climate Change Roundtable, at 11:30 Eastern Time, featuring several world leaders, including Mr. Guterres, which is designed to showcase the vast benefits or recovering from the pandemic in a sustainable way, that helps to limit global warming to 1.5C or lower. Mr. Guterres will kick things off, and he’s expected to outline the dangers of not acting faster, but also going through some of the positive actions undertaken since last year’s Climate Action Summit, which famously involved young climate activist Greta Thunberg delivering a fiery, angry speech, telling world leaders “ ”. UK Prime Minister will also deliver opening remarks, and he’s likely to give more detail of the 12 December event on climate that he is co-hosting with the UN. This event is being dubbed “the sprint to Glasgow”, in recognition of the fact the annual UN COP climate conference, due to be held in the Scottish city, has been postponed until November 2021. We have more on the December event .

Costa Rica’s is taking the lead in promoting the socially-conscious production of pineapples whilst protecting the environment, thanks to a project supported by the UN Development Programme ( ). The Central American country is the world leader in growing the fruit, a business worth more than US$800 million a year. In a new approach, some plantations have adopted socially responsible practices including equal pay for men and women, worker education programmes and agricultural techniques which aim to protect the environment. about how pineapples are promoting decent work and environmental sustainability.

24-> UN chief praises Japanese climate resilience, as Typhoon Hagibis cleanup begins
With Typhoon Hagibis causing destruction and loss of life in Japan, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has praised the leadership role the country is playing in climate resilience, and its “extensive and efficient preparation for this latest extreme weather event”. The World Meteorological Organization ( ) has the typhoon as one of the highest impact storms to hit Japan in many years, with hurricane-force winds, record-breaking rainfall, devastating storm surges, and coastal and inland flooding. Hagibis made landfall on Saturday, south of the capital Tokyo, before moving north. The typhoon has brought widespread devastation and disruption to densely populated cities, and infrastructure, and has led to the deaths of at least 25 people, with 15 declared missing. The casualties are believed to result mainly from landslides, or from being swept away by flood waters. According to media reports, tens of thousands of troops, firefighters and other emergency workers have been sent to the worst-hit areas, to rescue people trapped by floodwater. By Sunday, the intensity of the storm had lessened, and it had moved off land. Utility companies were reportedly attempting to restore power to hundreds of thousands of homes. Hagibis hit Japan just a month after another intense storm, Faxai, caused widespread damage to property in parts of the country, including tens of thousands of homes, which have yet to be repaired. In a , released on Sunday, the Secretary-General said that he was saddened by reports of loss of life and extensive destruction caused by Hagibis. The UN chief extended his deep condolences to the families of the victims, the Government and people of Japan, and wished a speedy recovery to those who have been injured.

25-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: UNICEF child health report, Peacekeeping operations end in Haiti, Syria-Turkey latest, Haitian migrants deported from Bahamas
A recap of Tuesday’s stories: Millions of children undernourished and overweight says landmark report; Security Council marks transition after 15 years of ‘blue helmets’ in Haiti; violence continues ‘on both sides’ of Syria-Turkey border; UN human rights office raises concerns over deportation of Haitian migrants from the Bahamas; UN migration agency helps migrants in Algeria return to Niger; rural women celebrated on International Day. ‘Alarmingly high’ number of children malnourished worldwide: UNICEF report Across the globe, at least one-in-three children under-five are malnourished and not developing properly, revealed on Tuesday, in its most comprehensive report on children, food and nutrition in 20 years. “An alarmingly high number of children are suffering the consequences of poor diets and a food system that is failing them,” the UN children’s agency (UNICEF) warned. Around 200 million children under-five are either undernourished or overweight, while one-in-three globally - and almost two-thirds of children between the fragile ages of six months to two years - are not fed food that nurtures proper development, n, found. Our full story . Security Council marks transition from 15 years of UN peacekeeping in Haiti Although 15 years of UN peacekeeping in Haiti has drawn to a close, the Organization’s commitment to strengthening and stabilizing the country, will continue, the heard on Tuesday. Jean-Pierre Lacroix, UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations, briefed ambassadors on major developments and achievements during this period. “This chapter, which comes to an end today, was characterized by shared successes with the people of Haiti, the tragedy of the (2010) earthquake, and by lessons in what we should have done better. Today, we must think together about all these aspects: They are the basis on which we can go into the next stage of the partnership of Haiti with the United Nations,” he said. Full details . In Syria, violence continues ‘on both sides’ of border with Turkey Amid ongoing fighting in northern Syria and disturbing reports that extrajudicial killings have been streamed online, the United Nations and their partners are continuing to deliver humanitarian supplies to tens of thousands of people displaced by the violence, UN agencies stressed on Tuesday. Since Turkish forces began their offensive last Wednesday, at least 160,000 civilians have been displaced, with hospitals and schools and other public infrastructure hit or affected by the fighting. According to the World Food Programme ( ), 83,000 people have already received food aid. UN Children’s Fund UNICEF, meanwhile, confirmed the deaths “of at least four children and the injuries of nine in north-east Syria”, along with seven other youngsters in Turkey. Find our coverage . Syria-Turkey update from Special Advisers on Genocide, Responsibility to Protect In a joint statement, the UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, Adama Dieng, and the United Nations Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect, Karen Smith, expressed their alarm over the current situation in northeast Syria, late on Tuesday. The Special Advisers stated that “the civilians of Syria continue to live through one of the worst conflicts of our time, with repeated violations of their basic rights and protections guaranteed under international law. This latest escalation of the conflict again puts civilians at grave risk. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported on several civilian casualties, including allegations of summary executions, and humanitarian actors report that at least 160,000 civilians have been displaced in the six days since the start of the military operation.” The Special Advisers also stressed that Turkish authorities "and all parties to the conflict in Syria need to ensure strict adherence to the legal obligation to protect civilians. This is the responsibility of all State and non-State actors. No civilian should be forced to leave their home against their will. In addition, they said, any return of refugees needs to be voluntary and when conditions are safe for them to do so sustainably.  The full statement . Concerns over deportation of Haitian migrants from Bahamas to Haiti – OHCHR In the Bahamas, there’s concern that over 100 Haitian people have been deported, including some from the Abaco islands, that were devastated by Hurricane Dorian only weeks ago. In a statement, the UN human rights office, , said that there is “panic” among Haitians since the authorities reversed their decision not to enforce immigration checks in places affected by the natural disaster. It also cited reports of people leaving temporary shelters because they feared being arrested, and of others going into hiding. In an appeal to the Bahamas, the UN office urged the authorities not to deport anyone else, noting that many Haitian migrants lost their documents, jobs and belongings when the hurricane hit the informal settlements where they live. IOM organizes first humanitarian charter flight from Algeria to Niger For the first time, more than 160 migrants flew back to their homes in Niger on Tuesday, after leaving Algeria, with the help of the UN migration agency, . Working with the Governments of both countries, IOM helped men, women and children board the inaugural flight from the Southern Algerian city of Tamanrasset to Niger’s capital, Niamey. The voluntary returns initiative was set up to prevent the migrants from having to repeat the long journey that took them northwards in the first place. After the migrants have returned to their communities, they are given help to reintegrate, depending on their needs, skills and aspirations. This can include medical assistance or vocational training, IOM says, or setting up a business. Rural women a ‘powerful force’ for global climate action: UN Secretary-General Rural women and girls across the world are a “powerful force” in global action to respond to climate change, according to the UN . In a to mark the , observed annually on 15 October, the UN chief said that “listening to rural women and amplifying their voices is central to spreading knowledge about climate change and urging governments, businesses and community leaders to act.” The theme for this year’s celebration is “Rural Women and Girls Building Climate Resistance.” ’s our story.

26-> Lives at risk if wireless technology demands are not held in check: UN weather watchdog
Amid growing competition for radio wave space due to new wireless technologies, the World Meteorological Organization on Thursday called on governments to protect radio frequencies allocated to potentially life-saving weather forecasting services. Earth observation services vital to weather forecasts and long-term climate change monitoring, are having to share more and more limited bandwith, with the rollout of new communication devices, including the new 5G phone data service. Frequencies dedicated to weather forecasts need to be balanced with commercial interests, Eric Allaix, chair of the group dealing with frequency issues, , explaining the risks posed by having too little bandwith, when it comes to early warnings of bad weather. “Thanks to timely weather warnings, there has been a big reduction in loss of life during recent decades. These improvements are directly related to the use of radio frequency-based remote sensing, feeding directly into numerical weather prediction systems giving more accurate predictions with longer lead periods.” No wish to hold technology back Mr. Allaix, said WMO does not wish to hamper technological advancements, “but we are concerned that they should not encroach on the frequencies used by life-saving applications” including aircraft, radar and other observing systems beyond predicting the weather. In June, the World Meteorological Congress, WMO’s decision-making body, passed a resolution stressing the need to protect radio bandwidth necessary for earth observations, explaining that “jeopardizing these frequencies jeopardizes weather forecasts and services, and thus, people’s lives.” Our ability to foresee incoming disaster and destructive weather events is possible thanks to “passive sensing techniques”, used by many weather experts, the WMO . Sensitive instruments measure very low-power microwaves emitted from the atmosphere and the Earth’s surface. The radio frequency on which these observations operate, runs adjacent to the 5G frequency used on many mobile devices, which make lines of communications in predicting the weather vulnerable to interference. From 28 October to 22 November, the World Radio Communication Conference will bring together more than 3,500 participants in Sharm el-Shaikh, Egypt, to address and revise radio regulations with major repercussions for earth exploration, environmental and meteorological monitoring. The 193 Member States belonging to the International Telecommunications Union ( ) will be in attendance, along with 267 members of the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R).

27-> World Migratory Bird Day highlights deadly risks of plastic pollution
Saturday marks World Migratory Bird Day which, this year, is raising awareness about the serious threats that plastic pollution poses to bird life, with a call for urgent measures to end the problem. These include getting caught up in fishing gear and other plastic debris; confusing plastic waste with food and eating it, which fills their stomachs and causes them to starve; and using debris as material for nest-building, which can harm their chicks. The world is choking on plastic and so too are our birds, on which so much life on Earth depends  One-third of global plastic production is non-recyclable and at least eight million tons of plastic flows unabated into our oceans and water bodies each year,” said Joyce Msuya, acting Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme ( ). “It is ending up in the stomachs of birds, fish, plankton, and in our soil and water. The world is choking on plastic and so too are our birds, on which so much life on Earth depends." Discarded fishing gear is the biggest reason for birds becoming entangled in plastic, particularly seabirds, many of whom are not detected because they die far from land, out of sight of humans. Digital technology shows full extent of pollution threat Online tools have helped scientists to build up a comprehensive picture of the effect that discarded fishing equipment is having on birds. Studies by Peter Ryan, Director of the Fitzpatrick Institute of African Ornithology at the University of Cape Town, have shown that almost all marine and freshwater birds are at risk of entanglement in plastic waste and other synthetic materials. A wide diversity of land birds, from eagles to small finches, are also affected, and these numbers are expected to increase. Research shows that about 40 per cent of seabirds have consumed plastic. This can kill them or, more likely, cause severe injuries, and plastic accumulations can block or damage the digestive tract or give the animal a false sense that they are no longer hungry, leading to starvation. UN action to reverse the trend In an effort to tackle plastic pollution, UNEP launched the Clean Seas campaign in 2017, which asks individuals, governments and businesses to take concrete steps to reduce their own plastic footprints. The Convention on Migratory Species, and the African Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA), which are backed by UNEP, work with countries to prevent plastic items from entering the marine environment. A recent resolution on seabird conservation, adopted by AEWA member countries in December 2018, includes a series of actions that countries can take to reduce the risk caused by plastic waste on migratory birds. At the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species in 2017, countries agreed to address the issue of lost fishing gear, by following the strategies set out under the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Efforts to phase out single use plastics and to redesign plastic products to make them easier to recycle are underway in many countries. “There are no easy solutions to the plastic problem. However, as this year’s World Migratory Bird Day underlines, everybody on this planet can be part of the solution and take steps to reduce their use of single-use plastic,” said Jacques Trouvilliez, Executive Secretary of the AEWA. “Tackling this problem globally will not only be beneficial for us, but also benefit our planet’s wildlife, including millions of migratory birds.”

28-> After this year’s Climate Action Summit, what happens next?
People across the world need to embrace “fundamental change” in order to combat climate change and meet the target of restricting the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius, Claudio Forner, from UN Climate Change in Bonn, told UN News in an interview that took place following the . He leads up the Ambition Team, which analyses the climate commitments made by countries, regions and cities across the world, which are vital to help slow down global warming. Dozens of commitments were made at the Climate Action Summit 2019 hosted by the UN Secretary-General, in New York in September. Chief amongst them was a move by many countries to reach a point by 2050 where the net balance of emissions of harmful carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is maintained at zero. What does zero net CO2 emissions mean in practice? The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) says to keep to the 1.5 degrees increase in global temperatures over pre-industrial levels, it is important to meet the target of zero net carbon dioxide or CO2 emissions by 2050. This does not mean zero emissions as it is perhaps unrealistic to suggest that emissions could be entirely eliminated; however, any residual CO2 emissions that result have to be compensated by carbon captures. So, for example, you can capture CO2 from the atmosphere by planting more trees. There are also new technologies which can capture or remove CO2. Are you optimistic that it can be achieved? It’s not about being optimistic. If we don’t achieve it, we will have a global catastrophe within 50 years. The IPCC is clear in saying that a fundamental change is required in which every single person across the world is on board. So, I’m more worried than optimistic, and I think it’s crucial to mobilize the international community. What gives me some optimism is that we have seen examples of commitments at the Climate Action Summit. If you want to plant a forest you begin with one tree.  There are also strong signals by civil society and young people, demanding change. What will that catastrophe look like? An increase in the global temperature will see more of what we are beginning to see now; the climate going crazy. Hurricanes which are stronger and happen more frequently, of the type we are seeing in the Caribbean. There will be more persistent drought conditions, and irregular torrential rains, which will affect farming and livelihoods. The melting of arctic ice will hasten rises in sea-level leading to global flood conditions which could displace millions of people. In short, if we don’t act now, we will see far more extreme and destructive effects of climatic change. Which initiatives would make the biggest difference? A change to the way we produce and consume energy is essential and so is the way we manage our lands, including to produce our food. Initiatives that come to mind include those that eliminate coal in energy generation and increase renewables, that increase the efficiency of energy use, that emphasize public transport and enhance public transport, that reduce deforestation to zero and change our bad habits. It is important to develop policies alongside new technologies in order to reduce CO2 emissions. Several countries at the summit, for example, Chile, Germany, Italy and New Zealand pledged to abandon coal. That is a bold move. Other countries, like Guatemala, pledged to restore 1.5 million hectares of forestland by 2022 and Nigeria said it would employ youth to plant 25 million trees. More than 60 countries committed recently to net zero-carbon by 2050…but not the world’s biggest polluters …China, the US and India…does it make any sense without these big three? It’s impressive that the summit motivated so many countries in a short period of time.  Of course, in an ideal world, you would want everyone to be on board, but we are talking about a fundamental change.  So, there is progress and thus a reason to celebrate. The value is a political one as a significant number of countries are demonstrating leadership which it’s hoped others will follow. From a technological standpoint, it’s also important to show that moving towards zero net-CO2 is possible, that the solutions are available. It’s important to mention that high-emitting cities and regions from the largest countries also joined the call for net zero. They include cities in China and the state of California in the US which have put forward ambitious carbon-neutral goals. And at the summit, almost 90 multinational companies, such as Danone, Nestlé and IKEA, committed to implement the 1.5 degrees target across their operations. To what extent is a lack of investment and political will the most significant obstacles? There is not a lack of money in the world, the problem is more where those funds are being invested. The key element is political will. If governments can pass policies which reflect the will of people when it comes to climate change, then they will be able to influence and legislate how, and where, investments are made. What are the benefits…apart from reducing global warming? Many countries are transitioning to a low-carbon, sustainable growth path because they see the many benefits. Cleaner air means improved health and psychological well-being. There are opportunities for job creation. The UN estimates that 65 million low-carbon jobs could be generated by 2030. For example, the UN’s International Labour Organization ( ) says that 2.5 million jobs will be created in renewables-based electricity, offsetting some 400,000 jobs lost in fossil fuel-based electricity generation. And six million jobs can be created by transitioning towards what is known as a “circular economy” which includes activities like recycling and repairing. Ultimately, this transition, this global transformation, represents a new world to which we need to adapt, which comes with costs but also huge opportunities. What would life be like in a zero-carbon country? We are not talking about foregoing benefits and wellbeing, is about how we achieve this.  We will still have energy, but it will come primarily from clean sources.  We would use safer and smarter transport.  Vehicles will be electric and people will use more public transport or bikes.  Our diets may also change and there would be a lot less food waste; however, I don’t think people would stop eating meat, the production of which is a significant contributor to global warming. We are looking at a world where a change of behaviour is facilitated by new technologies. So, it’s less about the services or benefits people receive, and more about how those services are provided. We can all still enjoy a good quality of life, whilst ensuring the sustainable development of the world.

29-> Reducing disaster risk is a good investment, and ‘the right thing to do’, says Guterres
There is a strong economic case for climate resilience and reducing the risk of disasters, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in a message to mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction, which falls on Sunday. Mr. Guterres pointed out the “horrendous suffering” that disasters can inflict, and the decades of development gains wiped out “in an instant”. He added that climate resilience and disaster risk reduction must be central to the trillions of dollars that will be invested in new housing, schools, hospitals and infrastructure over the coming decade. As well as being the “right thing to do”, because it can ease and prevent human misery, investing in climate resilience has a positive economic effect, said the UN chief: it creates jobs, saves money and, for every dollar invested, six dollars can be saved. Mr. Guterres called for greater focus on urgent climate action, increased ambitions, and for disaster risk reduction to be at the heart of the “Decade of Action”, leading up to the deadline for the UN’s . The 2019 theme of the International Day focuses on reducing damage to critical infrastructure, and disruption of basic services. The theme is a reference to one of the seven targets of the 2015 Sendai Framework, a major agreement on reducing disaster risks, adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan. The International Day was first marked in 1989, after the General Assembly called for a day to promote a global culture of risk-awareness and disaster reduction. The day celebrates how people and communities around the world are reducing their exposure to disasters and raising awareness about the importance of reining in the risks they face.

30-> Thursday's Daily Brief: Syria latest, tech needs threaten life-saving weather forecasts, #UN75 birthday conversation begins, polio virus nears eradication
A recap of Thurday's main stories: Wireless technology could block life-saving weather forecasts; UN gears up for 75th birthday dialogue; polio close to eradication; UN steps up northeast Syria aid; "unique opportunity" for end to Sudan-South Sudan border disputes. Lives at risk if wireless technology demands are not held in check Amid growing competition for radio wave space due to new wireless technologies, the World Meteorological Organization on Thursday called on governments to protect radio frequencies allocated to potentially life-saving weather forecasting services.

More in our story, We need to talk: UN gears up for 75th anniversary with Global Conversations The UN announced on Thursday the launch of the “biggest-ever global conversation” about the future of the planet, as part of the events marking next year’s 75-year anniversary of the Organization. The UN is aiming to reach the global public, via dialogues which will be held around the world, from January 2020. The objective of the dialogues is to listen to the hopes and fears of a wide range of people, to learn from their experiences, and spark discussion on ways to build a better world for all. Feedback will be sought from all segments and generations of society, in settings as varied as classrooms, boardrooms, parliaments and village halls, but there will be a particular focus on youth, and marginalized groups. The views and ideas generated, will be presented to world leaders, and senior UN officials, at a high-profile event held in September 2020. Here's our World is closer than ever to seeing polio disappear for good In a “historic achievement for humanity”, two of three wild poliovirus strains have been eliminated worldwide, the World Health Organization announced on Thursday, following the conclusion by a group of experts that WPV3, type three of the disease, has been eradicated completely. The deadly viral disease is “very close” to disappearing altogether, with the number of affected children having dropped by 99 per cent since 1988, the UN Children’s Fund announced on World Polio Day, marked each 24 October, positioning the world closer than ever to its total eradication. Get our story UN and partners stepping up support to north-east Syria as winter approaches With winter looming in northeast Syria, UN agencies and their partners are to support people in need, including 120,000 living in displacement camps as well as others who require aid relief. So far this month, they have delivered food to 256,000 people and distributed winter items to 100,000. The UN humanitarian affairs office, , reports that nearly 180,000 people in northeast Syria have been displaced since 9 October, when Turkey launched a military operation in the region. A reduction in fighting in some areas has seen an estimated 43,000 people return to their homes in recent days. The UN continues to reiterate the need for all sides to ensure that civilians remain protected and that humanitarians have safe access to those in need. ‘Unique opportunity’ to resolve border dispute between Sudan, South Sudan Sudan and neighbouring South Sudan “have never been closer” to reaching a sustainable peace with each other, and their own internal armed opposition groups, the head of UN peacekeeping told the on Thursday. The meeting was focused on the disputed, arid, oil-rich border territory of Abyei, where the UN Interim Security Force, UNISFA, has helped to monitor an uneasy peace without formal governance, and protect civilians, since 2011, in the weeks before South Sudan became independent from its northern neighbour. Boundary lines for the ethnically-split rectangle of territory, have not been agreed between the two nations, but both sides agreed to allow UNISFA's neutral presence when inter-communal fighting erupted in 2011, to help foster a more secure environment, until final agreement can be reached.

31-> COP24 addresses climate change displacement ahead of crunch migration meeting
As hundreds of decision-makers are gathering in Marrakech to agree new standards for global migration, the United Nations climate change conference ‘ ’ is looking at concrete ways to help countries tackle large-scale displacement caused by the impacts of climate change, including water scarcity, flooding, storms and rising sea levels. “Changing weather, floods and droughts in many places increasingly threaten people’s safety and livelihoods. That is leading a lot of families to have to consider whether they can stay where they are, or try to live somewhere else,” said Koko Warner, who leads on migration issues at the UN climate change convention ( ) secretariat. While it is very challenging to quantify the number of people who have been displaced by climate change, today, over 258 million people live outside their country of origin. Global warming is expected to increase this number as its impacts increasingly render some areas of the planet uninhabitable. “For example, if you’re a farmer and the rains fail you for several years in a row, you may all of a sudden lose not only your access to food, but your entire source of income, and the well-being of your entire family can become very precarious,” explained Ms. Warner. Currently, four times more people in the world are displaced by extreme weather events than they are by conflict. To address this, a set of recommendations to help countries cope with climate-change-related displacement was presented here at , the key two-week meeting being held in Katowice, Poland, to define the way forward on the commitments made by all countries for climate action in the 2015 . “We’ve come a long way. Climate change migration was more or less absent from discussions until 2010, in Cancún. In Paris, five years later, the countries asked for some recommendations on how to better prepare and respond to this phenomenon, and in Katowice, now, we are hoping they will adopt them,” Ms. Warner explained. The various recommendations delivered to the 197 parties to the UN Climate Change Convention include proposals on contingency planning, consultation and data analysis, and cooperation among countries. The document was prepared by a Task Force on Displacement and presented on Saturday for endorsement by the technical delegates of the Member States. Next week, they will be presented for adoption at ministry-level. “The goal is really to help countries understand the scale of what is coming and really prepare for it,” ’s climate vulnerabilities expert noted. “It’s really about finding ways to reduce the suffering and ensure the safety, dignity of the people at risk of displacement in the face of climate change.” These discussions are taking place just two days before the adoption of the – the first-ever UN global agreement for a common approach to international migration – to be held in Marrakech, this coming Monday and Tuesday. The recommendations vary in size and their criticality will depend on contexts. On planning, for example, one of the recommendations includes suggestions like forecast based finance which would enable communities who are facing natural disasters to prepare adequately. Another recommendation made is to focus on data collection and risk analysis to better map and understand human mobility. The document insists on the need to include and ensure the participation of affected communities every step of the way, so they feel empowered and well-informed when making decisions about their lives. “We are very pleased with how far this topic has moved in the discussions, and we hope the countries will use the recommendations,” said Ms. Warner. “The real impact,” she noted, “will only be measured through the steps countries take to avoid and minimize unnecessary suffering, and address the risks involved in climate-related displacement.”

32-> Four things the UN chief wants world leaders to know, at key COP24 climate conference opening
During the UN COP24 Climate Change Conference grand opening on Monday, Secretary-General António Guterres gathered for climate action that “we are in deep trouble” and asked decision-makers to focus on four key things: stepping up climate action, according to a solid plan, with more funding, as a smart investment in the future of the planet. The two-week 24th conference in Katowice, Poland, of the parties to the UN Climate Change Convention ( ), technically started on Sunday, but Monday saw the high-level grand opening. It marks the deadline for the 197 parties that signed the Convention, to adopt guidelines for the implementation of the historic 2015 . In the French capital, three years ago, countries collectively agreed to keep global temperature rises to no more than 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and if possible, to limit the rise to 1.5°C. Now, in Poland, they have to agree on how they will achieve this collectively. “We cannot fail in Katowice,” said UN chief Guterres. Kicking off the event, along with several other high-level representatives, he highlighted four key messages for the thousands of representatives of the world’s nations, non-profit organisations, UN agencies, and private sector companies gathered in Katowice. The Secretary-General started by noting that climate change is already “a matter of life and death” for many people, nations and countries of the world, and that the science is telling us we need to move faster. Citing various alarming UN reports – including one on rising global CO2 emissions and another one on increasing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere – he called on nations to pay attention to the science and step up their pace as well as their ambitions. “Even as we witness devastating climate impacts causing havoc across the world, we are still not doing enough, nor moving fast enough, to prevent irreversible and catastrophic climate disruption,” he stated. “Last year I visited Barbuda and Dominica, which were devastated by hurricanes.  The destruction and suffering I saw was heart-breaking,” he explained, noting that “these emergencies are preventable”. He called on the international community to work to ensure that emissions must decline by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net zero by 2050, and that renewable energy will need to supply half to two-thirds of the world’s primary energy by 2050 with a corresponding reduction in fossil fuels. “If we fail, the Arctic and Antarctic will continue to melt, corals will bleach and then die, the oceans will rise, more people will die from air pollution, water scarcity will plague a significant proportion of humanity, and the cost of disasters will skyrocket”, he warned the delegates ahead of their negotiations:. Stating that “we have no time for limitless negotiations”, the Secretary-General insisted on the need to operationalise the Paris Agreement, and reminded Member States that 2018 is the deadline that they set for themselves to finalise the guidelines for implementation. “We need a unifying implementation vision that sets out clear rules, inspires action and promotes raised ambition, based on the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances”, said the UN chief. “We achieved success in Paris because negotiators were working towards a common goal,” he added as he implored the delegated to maintain the same spirit of urgent collaboration to “ensure that the bonds of trust established in Paris will endure.” “We need concerted resource mobilization and investment to successfully combat climate change,” the Secretary-General told the delegates attending the grand opening, noting that three quarters of the infrastructure needed by 2050 for climate action still remains to be built. He insisted on the need to focus efforts on five key economic areas: energy, cities, land use, water and industry. “Governments and investors need to bet on the green economy, not the grey,” he explained, stressing the need to embrace carbon pricing (i.e. charging emitters of CO2 for their emissions), eliminate harmful fossil fuel subsidies, and invest in clean technologies. “It also means providing a fair transition for those workers in traditional sectors that face disruption, including through retraining and social safety nets,” he noted, adding that “we also have a collective responsibility to assist the most vulnerable communities and countries – such as small island nations and the least developed countries – by supporting adaptation and resilience.” In 2015, a total of 18 high-income nations committed to providing US$100 billion dollars a year, by 2020, to lower-income nations to support their climate action. Mr. Guterres urged developed nations to deliver on this commitment. He also urged Member States “to swiftly implement the replenishment of the Green Climate Fund. It is an investment in a safer, less costly future”. “All too often, climate action is seen as a burden,” said the UN secretary-General, as he explained that “decisive climate action today is our chance to right our ship and set a course for a better future for all”. The UN chief commended cities, regions, civil society and the business community around the world for moving ahead. “What we need is political more will and more far-sighted leadership. This is the challenge on which this generation’s leaders will be judged. According to the recent New Climate Economy report, “ambitious climate action could yield 65 million jobs and a direct economic gain of $26 trillion US dollars compared to business as usual over the next 12 years”. The UN chief stressed the need to ensure that this economic transformation is led with a commitment to gender equality, and the inclusion of youth. “We must start today building the tomorrow we want,” the Secretary-General said. 'Audacity' and 'five times more ambition' needed Echoing the UN Secretary-General’s remarks, the Prime Minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, who presided over COP23 called on the world to deliver “five times more ambition, five times more action” and avoid “becoming the generation that betrayed humanity.” The President of the UN General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, called for “audacity” in climate action and noted that multilateralism is the only way to reverse the negative effects of global warming. As for the President of this COP, Michał Kurtyka, referring to the mining past of Katowice, he invited the delegates to “pursue a path of deep but just transition” when bringing the Paris agreement to life. Earlier, the President of Poland, Andrzej Duda, presented a “Declaration for a Just Transition,” During the grand opening, the World Bank Chief Executive Officer, Kristalina Georgiewa, also announced that the World Bank would will double its current five-year investments towards supporting climate change initiatives by allocation $200 billion from 2020 on. This will include $100 billion from the World Bank directly, half of which will be allocated to mitigation and resilience-buidling initiatives, and another $100 billion from two World Bank Group members — the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency — and private capital. The event closed with an address by the world’s people delivered by world renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough. The statement was inspired by thousands of messages posted by individuals on social media over the past weeks, urging world leaders for climate action. “Their message is clear: time is running out. They want you, the decision makers to act now. They’re behind you, along with the civil society represented here today,” he said.

33-> World ‘off track’ to meet most Sustainable Development Goals on hunger, food security and nutrition
Key parts of the Global Goals agenda linked to achieving zero-hunger are “off-track”, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Thursday, in an appeal for much greater public investment in farming. Four years since the international community agreed to implement the 17 - whose objectives include tackling food insecurity and poor nutrition - says that a lack of progress “is the norm”. In a new report focusing on Goals 2 (Zero Hunger), 6 (Clean Water And Sanitation), 14 (Life Below Water) and 15 (Life On Land), the agency also warns of unsuccessful efforts to make farming sustainable, as well as the long-term management of land and ocean-based resources. The world is off-track to meet most of the Sustainable Development Goal targets linked to hunger, food security and nutrition. 🔖 New FAO report 👉      According to the study, Sub-Saharan Africa and Oceania - excluding Australia and New Zealand - registered the lowest levels of investment in the agricultural sector, which includes fisheries and forests. Key findings from the study that covers some 230 countries include data that more than 820 million people are going hungry around the world. That number has been rising for three years in a row “and is back to levels seen in 2010-2011”, FAO says. The percentage of hungry people has also slightly increased between 2015 and 2018, to 10.8 per cent. Among the report’s other findings is the warning that 60 percent of livestock breeds are at risk of extinction in the 70 countries for which information is available. This means that out of more than 7,000 breeds that are found in only one country, almost 2,000 are threatened, FAO says. Examples include Fogera cattle from Ethiopia or Bali’s Gembrong goat, according to FAO. It notes too that there has been "no progress” in conserving the animal DNA that would be needed to create new herds in case of extinction, with less one per cent of their genetic blueprint currently stored, with ongoing efforts to preserve these resources proving to be “inadequate". Plant conservation more successful While there has been more success in conserving the genetic material of plants, with global stocks held in 99 countries and 17 regional and international centres totalling 5.3 million samples, FAO cautioned nonetheless that crop diversity is still too limited. “Efforts to secure crop diversity continues to be insufficient,” the report states, “particularly for crop wild relatives, wild food plants and neglected and underutilized crop species.” Investing in sustainable fisheries ‘is worth $32 billion annually’ Highlighting the need to invest in sustainable fishing, the report also warns that one-third of marine stocks are overfished today, compared with 10 per cent in 1974. “Despite some recent improvements in fisheries management and stock status in developed countries, the proportion of stocks fished within biologically sustainable levels has decreased significantly in developing countries,” the UN agency says. Around 30 per cent of countries still have a relatively low implementation record of key international instruments designed to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, FAO maintains. All countries should “urgently” implement transformational changes in fishery management and governance, FAO recommends, as rebuilding overfished stocks could increase annual fishery production by 16.5 million tonnes and annual revenues from fishing by $32 billion. All continents face water stress, forest clearance ongoing Among the report’s other findings are that water stress affects countries in every continent. Nonetheless, the majority of countries that have registered high water stress since 2000, are mainly in Northern Africa, Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia. In addition, between 2000 and 2015, the world lost an area of forest the size of Madagascar, owing mainly to agricultural use. Most of this loss was in the tropics of Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia. On a more positive note, the rate of forest loss slowed down globally from 2010-2015, the FAO report notes, and this loss was partly compensated by the increase forest in Asia, North America and Europe.

34-> Friday’s Daily Brief: solidarity with Japan, call for DR Congo support, family-friendly workplaces, hottest June ever, Venezuela and Afghanistan updates
In today’s Daily Brief: UN stands in solidarity with Japan; avoid panic over DR Congo Ebola emergency; ‘transformative shift’ needed towards family-friendly work policies; hottest June EVER; Venezuelan migrant dangers; stop targeting Afghanistan civilians call. UN chief said on Friday he was “deeply saddened” at the death of at least 33 people inside a popular Japanese animation studio, in the city of Kyoto, following an arson attack that constitutes one of the worst mass-killings in the nation’s history. Japanese police have now identified the man suspected of carrying out the attack on Thursday morning, who reportedly entered the Kyoto Animation (KyoAni) building, carrying cans of flammable liquid, which he poured across different areas of the film and graphic novel media business, before setting it alight. Our full report . Don’t panic, support DRC in fight against deadly Ebola virus, UN health agency urges Ebola virus is just one challenge among many facing communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization ( ) said on Friday, reiterating an appeal for the international community to show support and solidarity for its people. Speaking in Geneva, spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris noted that measles has already killed more people this year than the Ebola outbreak, which began last August According to WHO, more than 2,000 people have died from measles in 2019, while the Ebola outbreak in Ituri and Nord Kivu provinces in the country’s north-east has claimed 1,705 lives. Read our full coverage . UNICEF urges ‘transformative shift’ in family-friendly work policies to reap ‘huge’ benefits Because the “earliest years” of life are the most crucial, the United Nations Children’s Fund ( ) published a list of new family-friendly policy recommendations on Friday that will likely reap “huge” benefits. “There is no other time more critical to children’s lives than their earliest years”, said Henrietta Fore, Executive Director, “which is why we need a transformative shift in how businesses and governments invest in policies and practices that not only support healthy brain development, but also strengthen the bond between parents and their children – and reap huge economic and social benefits in return.” Read the full story . Hottest June on record – it's official According to the World Meteorological Organization ( ), both land and sea surface temperatures were the highest yet recorded last month - 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit or 0.95 degrees Celsius above the global average, making last June the hottest on record. These unprecedented temperatures  - which surpassed previous highs in June 2016 - happened across central and eastern Europe, northern Russia, Asia, Africa, South America, the north Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Using global data, WMO also says that nine of the 10 warmest Junes have occurred since 2010. The impacts of these high temperatures include wildfires in the Arctic Circle and unprecedented shrinking sea ice, the UN agency says, while also pointing out that the northern-most permanent settlement on Earth – which is called Alert, in  Canada—reached 70 degrees Fahrenheit (that’s 21 degrees Celsius) for the first time in recorded history this week. One in two Venezuelan families on the move face ‘drastic’ choices to survive And finally, more than half of Venezuelan families who have left their country amid economic and political turmoil face what the UN refugee agency, , calls “specific risks” while they are on the move. After speaking to nearly 8,000 people this year in Latin American countries and the Caribbean, the agency says that more than six in 10 were unemployed or working informally, while four in 10 faced problems finding accommodation. More than three in 10 also said they had no permit to stay in the country where they are sheltering, while UNCHR spokesperson Liz Throssell noted that the region’s asylum application system remains “overwhelmed”. According to UNHCR, well over 3.3 million Venezuelans now live outside the country. ‘Indiscriminate blasts’ in civilian areas ‘must stop’, UN mission in Afghanistan stresses The “deliberate targeting of educational facilities” during armed conflict is “a war crime”, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan ( ) said on Friday after a bomb detonated near the entrance to Kabul University, in the country’s capital. The University “was [the] intentional focus of attack”, UNAMA tweeted, saying that blast killed at least “eight civilians” and wounded 33 others. For our full coverage, click .

35-> UN Youth envoy launches coding competition to help solve climate crisis and ‘Reboot the Earth’
Can young coders help solve the climate crisis? The UN’s Youth Envoy launched a global competition earlier this month, “ ”, with support from the UN Office of Information & Communications Technology, Deloitte and SAP, to try and answer that question, fostering collaboration between the United Nations, academia, civil society, and young people to address the climate emergency. ’s office describes the competition as a “global hackathon”, where teams of computer programmers, scientists and others, will try to solve a local climate crisis, that may be unique to each location in line with specific community needs, by creating new software, or improving upon existing programs. The hackathon will take place at United Nations in five different countries (Malaysia, Finland, India, Egypt and Germany), during August. Through a series of Tech Challenges, one team from each country will be selected to travel to New York City to attend a “Reboot The Earth” awards ceremony, during the UN on September 21. The winner from each country will get the chance to have their solution showcased at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, in January 2020, and the overall winner has the opportunity of seeing their software proposal developed at one of the UN Technology Innovation Labs. This Sept, young ppl will not only bring in their voices, they'll bring solutions to climate challenges! Join & Reboot The Earth to present your ideas at the Climate Summit! ➡️ ➡️   You can find more details of the competition, and how to enter, . In an interview with UN News, Ms. Wickramanayake said that young people are key to solving global climate challenges, and drivers of change and innovation: “With the global climate movement led by young people, the United Nations supports youth’s effort in driving climate action”, said the Sri Lankan-born envoy. Since the launch of the Strategy, the United Nations has been scaling up global, regional and national actions to meet young people’s needs, realize their rights and tap their possibilities as agents of change. As the Youth Envoy explains, Reboot The Earth is about creating a platform for young people to share their best innovative ideas and solutions with the United Nations, making them equal partners in the global fight against the climate crisis: “Reboot The Earth" presents young people with the opportunity to not only showcase their potential and ideas, but also to be recognized at the United Nations Climate Summit in September 2019” “We’re calling the winners of this year’s hackathon ‘The #ClimateReboot Troops’, and they will be able to collaborate with the United Nations on a long-term project, to work on, and scale up, solutions that will have a real-life impact in communities.”

36-> Migration and the climate crisis: the UN’s search for solutions
Throughout human history, migration and climate have always been connected, but in the modern era, the impacts of the man-made climate crisis are likely to extensively change the patterns of human settlement. Dina Ionesco is the head of the Migration, Environment and Climate Change Division at the UN International Organization for Migration ( ), which has been at the forefront of efforts to study the links between migration, the environment and climate. As she explained to UN News, we are now living in an era where catastrophic climate-related events are linked to human activity, and this is likely to have a major impact on the way that we decide to migrate, and settle: “The , which gives examples dating as far back as 45,000 years ago, shows that environmental changes and natural disasters have played a role in how the population is distributed on our planet throughout history.” “However, it is highly likely that undesirable environmental changes directly created by, or amplified by, climate change, will extensively change the patterns of human settlement. Future degradation of land used for agriculture and farming, the disruption of fragile ecosystems and the depletion of precious natural resources like fresh water will directly impact people's lives and homes.” The climate crisis is already having an effect: according to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre, people had to leave their homes last year, because of disasters that negatively affected their lives. Slow changes in the environment, such as ocean acidification, desertification and coastal erosion, are also directly impacting people’s livelihoods and their capacity to survive in their places of origin. As Ms. Ionesco explains, there is a strong possibility that more people will migrate in search of better opportunities, as living conditions get worse in their places of origin: “There are predictions for the twenty-first century indicating that even more people will have to move as a result of these adverse climate impacts. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), the main UN authority on climate science, has repeatedly said that the changes brought on by the climate crisis will influence migration patterns. The has put forward projections for internal climate migration amounting to 143 million people by 2050 in three regions of the world, if no climate action is taken.” “However, our level of awareness and understanding of how environmental factors affect migration, and how they also interact with other migration drivers such as demographic, political and economic conditions, has also changed. With enhanced knowledge, there is more incentive to act urgently, be prepared and respond.” The Global Compact for Migration: a roadmap for governments In the past decade, there has been a growing political awareness of the issues around environmental migration, and increasing acceptance that this is a global challenge. As a result, many states have signed up to landmark agreements, such as Agreement, the and the , which, says, Ms. Ionesco, marks a clear way forward for governments to address the issue of climate and migration. “The Compact contains many references to environmental migration including a whole section on measures to address environmental and climate challenges: it is the first time that a comprehensive vision has been laid out, showing how states can handle - now and in the future – the impacts of climate change, disasters and environmental degradation on international migration.” “Our analysis of the highlights the priorities of states, when it comes to addressing environmental migration. Their primary concern is to “minimize the adverse drivers and structural factors that compel people to leave their country of origin”, in particular the "natural disasters, the adverse effects of climate change, and environmental degradation". “In other words, the main priority is to find solutions that allow people to stay in their homes and give them the means to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This approach aims to avoid instances of desperate migration and its associated tragedies.” “However, where climate change impacts are too intense, another priority put forward in the Compact is to “enhance availability and flexibility of pathways for regular migration”. States are thus looking at solutions for people to be able to migrate safely and through regular channels, and at solutions for those already on the move. “A last resort measure is to conduct planned relocations of population – this means organizing the relocation of entire villages and communities away from areas bearing the brunt of climate change impacts.” “Humanitarian assistance and protection for those on the move already, are also tools states can use. Finally, states highlight that relevant data and knowledge are key to guide the decision-making process. Without knowing more and analyzing better, policies run the risk of missing their targets and fade into irrelevance.” A range of solutions to a complex problem Responding to the challenges of environmental migration in a way that benefits both countries and communities, including migrants and refugees, is a complex process, says Ms. Ionesco, involving many different actors. Solutions can range from tweaking migration practices, such as visa regimes, to developing human rights-based protection measures. Most importantly, they involve a coordinated approach from national governments, bringing together experts from different walks of life: “There is no one single solution to respond to the challenge of environmental migration, but there are many solutions that tackle different aspects of this complex equation. Nothing meaningful can ever be achieved without the strong involvement of civil society actors and the communities themselves who very often know what is best for them and their ways of life.” "I also think that we need to stop discourses that focus only on migrants as victims of tragedy. The bigger picture is certainly bleak at times, but we need to remember that migrants demonstrate everyday their resilience and capacity to survive and thrive in difficult situations."

37-> Uneven progress on climate action at Bangkok conference
Climate change talks wrapped up in today, leaving several issues still to be resolved. The talks were part of series of meetings set up to develop guidelines for countries to implement the , an important element in ensuring transparent and practical climate action across the globe. Work on preparing the guidelines has been ongoing since 2016, the year after the was signed by practically every country in the world. The guidelines are due to be adopted at the annual climate change conference, , to be held in the Polish city of Katowice in December. If that goal is to be reached, urgent work is needed in the coming weeks, said , Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change: “In Bangkok, there has been uneven progress on the elements of the climate change regime that countries are working towards. Clearly, we need to increase climate action significantly. Clearly, fully implementing the Paris Agreement is the way to do this in a balanced, coordinated manner that leaves nobody behind.” Country representatives have been working on ways to increase action to deal with the impacts of climate change, increasing support for developing countries ­– in the form of finance, technology cooperation and capacity-building – and, crucially, limiting global temperature increase this century to well below 2C, ideally limiting the increase to 1.5C through emission reductions. Key concerns include the way in which actions are regularly and transparently communicated, clarity on financing the actions, and how to reflect the contributions and responsibilities of developed and developing countries. On this point, Ms. Espinosa was clear that the Paris Agreement strikes a delicate balance to bring all countries together: “We must recognize that countries have different realities at home. They have different levels of economic and social development that lead to different national situations.” she said. The negotiations are taking place at a time when the world has witnessed flood-related deaths, livelihoods wiped out by droughts and expensive infrastructure lost across large stretches of the developed and the developing world.

38-> ‘Direct existential threat’ of climate change nears point of no return, warns UN chief
The world risks crossing the point of no return on climate change, with disastrous consequences for people across the planet and the natural systems that sustain them, the United Nations warned on Monday, calling for more leadership and greater ambition for climate action, to reverse course. The pledge made by world leaders in the three years ago to stop temperature rising by less than 2-degree-Celsius and working to keep the increase as close as possible to 1.5-degree-Celsius, “were really the bare minimum to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,” said Secretary-General Guterres, in a , at UN Headquarters in New York. “The mountain in front of us is very high but it is not insurmountable. We know how to scale it,” he continued. “Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action,” he added, calling for a shift away from the dependency on fossil fuels towards cleaner energy and away from deforestation to more efficient use of resources. Put simply, we need to put the brake on deadly greenhouse gas emissions and drive climate action The UN chief went on to say that such a shift in thinking is where “enormous benefits await humankind.” “I have heard the argument – usually from vested interests – that tackling climate change is expensive and could harm economic growth. This is hogwash. In fact, the opposite is true,” he stressed. In his message, Mr. Guterres highlighted the huge economic costs of climate change and the opportunities presented by climate action. Climate action, socio-economic progress mutually supportive “Climate action and socio-economic progress are mutually supportive, with gains of 26 trillion dollars predicted by 2030 compared with business as usual, if we pursue the right path,” he said, citing the findings of the recent from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate Change. The benefits transcend monetary figures. “Climate-resilient water supply and sanitation could save the lives of more than 360,000 infants every year, clean air has vast benefits for public health [and] in China and the United States, new renewable energy jobs now outstrip those created in the oil and gas industries,” explained Mr. Guterres, noting several examples from across the world of climate action resulting in enormous benefits for countries and communities. Underscoring that important strides are being made, the UN chief highlighted the imperative to speed up these transitions. There is another reason to act – moral duty … the world’s richest nations are the most responsible for the climate crisis, yet the effects are being felt first and worst by the poorest nations and the most vulnerable peoples and communities “And for that to happen, the leaders of the world need to step up. The private sector, of course, is poised to move, and many are doing so. In his remarks, Secretary-General Guterres highlighted the skewed impact of the climate crisis on vulnerable nations and urged richer countries to do more to assist them. Looking ahead, the UN chief emphasized that he would be reiterating this message at the General Assembly’s high level segment later in the month as well as at other key events, including the G7 and G20 meetings of world leaders; and the World Bank and International Monetary Fund ( ) meetings. “The time has come for our leaders to show they care about the people whose fate they hold in their hands. We need them to show they care about the future,” he stressed. Climate Summit in 2019 Mr. Guterres further announced that in September 2019, he will convene a to bring climate action to the top of the international agenda and unveiled the appointment of Luis Alfonso de Alba, a former Mexican diplomat, as his Special Envoy to lead its preparations. The Summit, he said, will focus on the heart of the problem – the sectors that create the most emissions and the areas where building resilience could make the biggest difference – as well as provide leaders and partners the opportunity to demonstrate real climate action and showcase their ambition. “I am calling on all leaders to come to next year’s Climate Summit prepared to report not only on what they are doing, but what more they intend to do when they convene in 2020 for the UN climate conference and where commitments will be renewed and surely ambitiously increased,” he said. In the same vein, the Secretary-General called on civil society and young people to push the agenda of climate action. “There is no more time to waste. We are careering towards the edge of the abyss,” warned Mr. Guterres, adding that though it is not too late to shift course, “every day that passes means the world heats up a little more and the cost of our inaction mounts.” “Every day we fail to act is a day that we step a little closer towards a fate that none of us wants – a fate that will resonate through generations in the damage done to humankind and life on earth.”

39-> Devastating storms like Hurricane Florence ‘unusual this far north’: UN weather agency
In another manifestation of extreme weather conditions, hurricanes as strong as the Category 4 storm Florence - barreling towards the coast of the Carolinas in the United States - are rarely seen so far north, the United Nation’s weather agency ( ) confirmed on Tuesday. Hurricane Florence is ranked as a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  According to the US National Hurricane Center, category 4 hurricanes are ranked as major hurricanes, with winds at 130-156 mph (209-251 km/h), and a likelihood of catastrophic damage. Hurricane Florence, currently moving West over the northern Atlantic, is currently moving West over the Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas and is forecast to approach the coast of North Carolina or South Carolina on Thursday. A spokesperson for the described Hurricane Florence as “very large, very strong and very dangerous. Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday. It’s a very big hurricane which can be seen from space”. One of the main dangers from hurricane Florence is the rainfall, added the spokesperson. There is currently a 1-7 day rainfall forecast of more than 10-15 inches (254 to 381 mm). WMO Secretary-General spoke to UN News on Monday at UN Headquarters in New York where, on the same day, UN chief delivered a speech describing climate change as “ ”, and calling for more leadership and greater ambition for climate action. Mr. Taalas confirmed that we are seeing the highest worldwide temperatures since records began. “We have been breaking records in some parts of the world. We have seen heatwaves hitting Japan, Europe – especially the northern part of Europe – where a large part of the harvest has been lost, and we have seen quite devastating fires hitting Canada and western parts of the USA,” he told us. “We just saw a record-breaking typhoon hitting Japan a couple of days ago, the most intense typhoon in Japan for the past 25 years. Japan was also exposed to very intense rainfall, leading to flooding and landslides, with casualties.” Although the early part of the Atlantic hurricane season was quiet, there are now three active hurricanes moving across the ocean (Florence, Isaac and Helene). There have been 10 other years on record where we have had at least 3 hurricanes simultaneously, most recently last year (Irma, Jose and Katia) In the Pacific Ocean, Typhoon Manghut, a very strong tropical cyclone and the largest currently active, is expected to impact the northern part of the Philippines later in the week.

40-> Nigerian President calls for global action on climate change, Lake Chad crisis
A variety of “festering” causes and effects surround crises around the world, Nigeria’s President, Muhammadu Buhari, said on Tuesday, speaking on the first day of the high-level portion of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual general debate. “Most crises usually have a variety of and effects,” he explained. “It is the failure to address them early and effectively that lead to out-of-control conflicts,” he argued, noting that solutions include collective national and international actions. Speaking about the fight against international and local terrorism, “Boko Haram and Al Shabaab come to mind.” “Terrorist insurgencies, particularly in the Sahel and the Lake Chad Basin, are partly fueled by local factors and dynamics, but have been increasingly powered by the international Jihadi Movement, namely runaway fighters from Iraq and Syria, and arms from the disintegration of Libya,” he told the Assembly. On a brighter note, he drew inspiration from “the remarkable leadership” of Ethiopia and Eritrea to restore peace between them. According to Mr. Buhari, their “remarkable show of Statesmanship” has galvanized neighbouring countries, including Djibouti and Somalia to push for peace in the subregion. He noted that a topical consequence of global conflict is the irregular migration of affected people from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa to Europe. “Irregular migration entails huge avoidable loss of human lives, puts strains on services in host countries and communities, and fuels anti-immigrant and racist sentiments in Europe,” he stated. Against that backdrop, Nigeria welcomed “the successful conclusion of the negotiations on the first-ever for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,” and look forward to its adoption in Marrakech later this year – “to protect the rights of migrants worldwide, while addressing the concerns of countries of ‘origin,’ ‘transit,’ or ‘destination’.” Calling migration “a constant in human affairs,” he stated that Africa was grateful to the countries that treated migrants with compassion and humanity, “notably Germany, Italy and France.” Mr. Buhari also cited climate change, “one of the greatest challenges of our time,” as another reason for irregular migration, noting that it has “drastically shrunk Lake Chad” and was “parching” otherwise fertile, arable lands. “The Lake was a major source of livelihood to more than 45 million inhabitants of the region,” he said, explaining that its shrinking has taken jobs, rendered people poor and vulnerable, and exposed to extremists and terrorist elements. This instability has also intensified internal displacements, leading to intense economic competition, especially between farmers and herdsmen. Mr. Buhari called for rededicated international engagement to address the root causes of conflicts in the region. “What is required is continuous and robust UN cooperation with national Governments and sub-regional and regional organizations, such as the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the Economic Community of West African States and the African Union, to enhance capacity in conflict prevention, conflict management and peace building,” the President concluded.

41-> At UN, Pacific Island leaders warn climate change poses dire security threat to their fragile countries and marine resources
Ensuring Sustainable development and surmounting the ‘devastating impacts’ of climate change were on the top of the agenda at the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday, where King Tupou VI of Tonga was joined by a host of other Pacific Island leaders calling for action on what they saw as “the defining issue of our time”. “In contributing towards the implementation of the for Sustainable Development and its landmark Goals ( ), including the internationally agreed blueprint for the sustainable development of small island developing States (SIDS), the , Tonga has made both accords an integral part of its processes,” he said on Wednesday. He emphasized the importance of the UN High-Level Political Forum ( ) on Sustainable Development, which he pointed out will review the SAMOA Pathway in 2019. “Climate change continues to pose significant security threats to us as island States,” he said, noting with concern “the devastating impacts of climate change on our marine environment.” He welcomed the establishment at the initiation of German and Nauru of the Group of Friends on Climate and Security “to further highlight the nexus between the threats of climate change with threats to international peace and security.” He stressed that despite the effects of sea level rise, Tonga’s territorial boundaries, established under the , should remain unchanged. “Our Sovereignty must not be compromised by climate change and we welcome the work of the on this critically important and timely issue for consideration of the of the General Assembly,” he said, referring to the Assembly’s standing body that deals with legal issues. He was looking forward to the 24th Session of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) in December to address the adverse impacts of climate change and the need for innovation in adaptation for “Finally,” he said, “sustainable development, whether it be, [among others], through good health and well-being, climate action, life below water, or affordable and clean energy, can only be realized through international peace and security.” “We continue to look to the to protect the innocent from threats to international peace and security in whatever form, be they traditional threats such as armed conflict, or newer threats like climate change, to ensure no one is left behind,” concluded King Tupou VI.  Also addressing the Assembly, Kiribati President Taneti Maamau proudly reaffirmed that his country is continuing to maintain 11 per cent of its exclusive economic zone in the Phoenix Islands Protected Area (PIPA) – comprising over 400,000 sq. km of ocean – calling it “a powerful and effective tool for the rejuvenation of tuna fisheries and other marine organisms and a source of resilient coral species called super corals.” “It has the potential to become the most powerful source of marine life enrichment and provides solutions for many of the problems facing humanity,” which the for Sustainable Development is addressing, he said. Underscoring Kiribati’s strong commitment to implement the ( ), he noted that “by closing off the area to commercial fishing, we have sacrificed a substantial amount of income from fishing licenses every year, estimated at about 10 per cent of our annual fishing revenue,” averaging $10 million annually. Meanwhile, Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of Nauru, linked climate change to the country’s economic well-being, stating that while consumption-based economic growth has “destroyed the health of our oceans and the safety of our climate,” a liberalized global financial system has diminished opportunities for small domestic enterprises, rendering small island developing States to score extremely high on economic vulnerability indexes. “These are not new observations, he said, noting “We have been grappling with these challenges for decades. But in the face of climate change, developing effective strategies for dealing with them has become much more urgent.” He reiterated his call to the Security Council in July for a Special Representative on Climate and Security, saying “we are already seeing dangerous impacts on our countries and communities, with the most vulnerable among us bearing the greatest burden.” “A Special Representative, supported by a well-resourced staff, is needed to help us start managing climate risks more effectively,” he argued, calling it “a critical gap in the UN system that must be filled immediately.”   For his part, Tommy Esang Remengesau, Jr., President of Palau, called climate change one of his country’s core priorities and “the greatest challenge of our generation.” Citing the havoc wreaked on the Philippines from Super Typhoon Mangkhut, he called an “urgent global priority” the importance of building the resilience of vulnerable countries to climate change impacts. President Remengesau shared Palau’s Climate Change Policy Framework to prepare and minimize disaster risks and mitigate climate change by working towards low carbon emission through clean energy initiatives as it continues to work with partners in building capacity and mainstreaming climate change into its national planning and budgeting process. “Earlier this year, we took a big step forward by passing a law which modernized our electricity sector to enable a rapid transition to renewable energy,” he said. “And now we have the enabling framework to trigger investments in transforming our economy towards harnessing the power of the sun.”

42-> UN and partners express regret over US departure from Paris climate accord
The UN climate change secretariat, , has underlined its commitment to work with stakeholders in the United States and beyond, to accelerate climate action, in line with an historic treaty on limiting global warming and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. On Wednesday, the US formally withdrew from the 2015 , a decision originally announced three years ago. “We note with regret that the US withdrawal from the has formally come into effect today”, the UN body said in issued alongside Chile, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. "There is no greater responsibility than protecting our planet and people from the threat of climate change." Read the joint statement on the US withdrawal from the by Chile, France, Italy, UK and UN Climate Change >>  Under the Paris Agreement, countries pledge to take action to keep temperature rise to below two degrees Celsius and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Asked about the US withdrawal, UN Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric participating in the regular press briefing in New York that “our support, our belief in the need for a strong and active Paris Agreement, remains unchanged.” Rules for withdrawal The Paris Agreement allows for a party to at any time after three years from the date on which it entered into force for that State. Withdrawal would take effect one year after receipt of official notification. The US, under the Obama administration, acceded to the Paris Agreement on 3 September 2016, with entry into force occurring two months later. In August 2017, the Trump administration of its intention to withdraw from the accord as soon as it was eligible. For the and partners, there is no greater responsibility than protecting the planet and the world’s people from the threat of climate change, their statement declared. “The science is clear that we must urgently scale up action and work together to reduce the impacts of global warming and to ensure a greener, more resilient future for us all. The Paris Agreement provides the right framework to achieve this”, they said. Climate action summit Next month marks five years since representatives from more than 190 countries met in the French capital and the agreement. Mr. Dujarric reported that the UN will co-host a virtual climate ambition summit on 12 December, the treaty’s anniversary. “We know that the commitments made in Paris have not been met across the board”, he said. “We know that those commitments, given what the science is telling us, need to be increased.” Recently, two major industrial nations, and , announced their commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which the UN Secretary-General has welcomed. Mr. Dujarric expressed hope that this development “will lead others down that path”. Commitment remains firm This year, the UN was forced to postpone its latest global climate change conference, known as , due to the pandemic. It will be held in Glasgow, Scotland, next November, hosted by the UK in partnership with Italy. In the interim, the UNFCCC and partners will continue to support greater climate action. “As we look towards COP26 in Glasgow, we remain committed to working with all US stakeholders and partners around the world to accelerate climate action, and with all signatories to ensure the full implementation of the Paris Agreement,” their joint statement concluded.

43-> World in grip of ‘high impact weather’ as US freezes, Australia sizzles, parts of South America deluged
“High impact weather” has gripped much of the world so far this year, the UN weather agency, , reported on Friday, with “dangerous and extreme cold in North America, record high heat and wildfires in Australia, heavy rains in parts of South America, and heavy snow on the Alps and Himalayas. The assessment of January’s weather, published on Friday, describes it as “a month of extremes”, with large parts of North America gripped by bitterly cold temperatures, caused by the influence of the . In southern Minnesota, reports the UN weather agency, the wind chill factor pushed readings down to minus 65°F (-53.9°C) on 30 January.  The national low temperature record was measured at minus 56 °F (-48.9°C). “Disturbances in the jet stream and the intrusion of warmer mid-latitude air masses can alter the structure and the dynamics of the Polar Vortex, sending Arctic air south into middle latitudes and bringing warmer air into the Arctic. This is not a new phenomenon, although there is ”, the agency said. But climate sceptics should be careful before equating the frigid conditions, with a rejection of the inexorable rise in global temperatures due to global warming, or rising carbon dioxide emissions: “The cold weather in the eastern United States certainly does not disprove climate change”, said WMO Secretary-General . “In general, and at global level, there has been a decline in new cold temperature records as a result of global warming.  But frigid temperatures and snow will continue to be part of our typical weather patterns in the northern hemisphere winter. We need to distinguish between short-term daily weather and long-term climate’, he added. While The eastern US and parts of Canada are seeing record-breaking cold temperatures, Alaska and large parts of the Arctic have been warmer than average. During January, severe winter storms also hit the eastern Mediterranean and parts of the Middle East, severely affecting vulnerable populations lacking adequate shelter, including refugees. A cold front in the third week of January that swept south through the Arabian Peninsula, bringing a widespread dust storm from Egypt to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, also brought heavy rain and precipitation to Pakistan and northwest India, reports WMO. . In Hochfilzen in the Tirol region of Austria, more than 451 centimetres of snow fell in the first 15 days, an event statistically only expected once a century. On Friday, staff at the were advised to leave early due to major whiteout conditions. The German weather service or Deutscher Wetterdienst, DWD, also issued a number of top-level snow and winter weather warnings. Climate projections show that winter precipitation in Germany is expected to be more intense this winter. The Indian Meteorological Department issued warnings on 21 January of heavy or very heavy rain and snow for Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh, prompting warnings of avalanches amid an intense cold front. Meanwhile, down under, , according to its Bureau of Meteorology. The month saw a new series of heatwaves unprecedented in their scale and duration, said the UN weather agency. Overall rainfall was 38% below average for January. Australia saw an unusual extended period of heatwaves which began in early December 2018 and continued into January 2019. The city of Adelaide reached a new record high of 46.6°C on 24 January. Australia's annual mean temperature has warmed by just over 1 °C since 1910, and summer has warmed by a similar amount. Australia's annual warming trend is consistent with that observed for the globe, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. Heatwaves are becoming more intense, extended and frequent as a result of climate change and this trend is expected to continue. Elsewhere in the southern hemisphere, heat records tumbled in Chile. A weather station in the capital Santiago set a new record of 38.3°C on 26 January.  In other parts of central Chile, temperatures topped 40°C. Argentina has also been gripped by a heatwave, prompting a number of alerts about high temperatures. Northeast Argentina, and the adjacent parts of Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil have been hit with extensive flooding, with well above the long-term expected average rainfall. On January 8, the Argentine city of Resistencia recorded 224mm of rainfall, settin a new 24-hour rainfall record, much higher than the previous highest of 206mm, recorded in January 1994, according to the national meteorological service, SMN Argentina.

44-> Natural hazards don’t always spell disaster: UN risk reduction chief
Tsunamis are rare, but when they strike, they are the deadliest and most costly of natural hazards. With half of the world’s population expected to live in coastal areas more prone to tsunamis by 2030, investing in early warning systems and resilient infrastructure, will be vital to saving lives and economies, said the top UN official on disaster risks on Tuesday. Mami Mizutori, UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction laid out the benefit-cost ratio of building cities that will withstand increasingly frequent climate-related hazards, marking , designated by the UN General Assembly in 2015. Ms.  Mizutori told in an interview, the for every dollar invested in prevention, most countries will reap four times the economic benefit, thus, “if we know how to make a society resilient, a hazard doesn’t necessarily have to become a disaster.” In the last century, Tsunamis have claimed more than a quarter of a million lives, killing on average, around 4,600 per event, over the course of  58 recorded instances, according to . The disaster risk reduction chief Mami Mizutori, talks about the importance of investment, early warning systems, this From our news video team: Nearly 15 years on from the catastrophic Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004, which killed nearly 230,000 people in 14 countries, the technology of early warning systems across the world’s oceans has improved, and as a result, many lives have been saved, said in his for the Day. However, “the risks remain immense” he added, and “it is clear from the growing economic losses over the last 20 years, that we have not yet fully learned the importance of disaster-proofing critical infrastructure.” Rising sea levels caused by the climate emergency may further exacerbate the destructive power of tsunamis, he said, coinciding with 680 million people living in low-lying coastal zones. Build to last A September by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spotlighting global temperature increases, changes to the world’s water supply, and the overall scale of the climate emergency, revealed that extreme sea-level events are expected to hit once a year by 2050. “Can you think of one single country which is not really experiencing any disasters?” Ms.  Mizutori asked, speaking to With more people living in coastal areas, it will be increasingly important to be able to predict disasters before they strike, and when it comes to the havoc wreaked by tsunamis, seismographic and sea-level monitoring stations and strategic city building will be key to resisting the effects of a changing climate, she said. Knowing the signs of a looming tsunami has historically, been lifesaving. was the brainchild of Japan, which through bitter, repeated experience with tsunamis over the years, has built up expertise in early warning, and building cities to last. “Tsunamis” meaning “harbour waves” in Japanese, can’t be predicted, and often come with little warning, but earthquake and ocean activity observation can help those in danger buy time. Can you think of one single country which is not really experiencing any disasters?--  During the 1854 Ansei earthquake in Japan, a farmer noticed a receding tide – one key sign of a looming tsunami. To warn villagers, he set fire to his entire rice harvest, and the people fled to safety on high ground. The earthquake foreshadowed a great tsunami which overtook present day Hirokawa Town, but the farmer’s actions spared hundreds of lives. On the day for tsunami awareness, the world honours that Japanese story of “Inamura-no-hi”, or “burning of the rice sheaves”, and aims to promote the sharing of innovative approaches to tsunami risk reduction. To mitigate disaster risks, put forth a 15-year framework outlining seven clear targets to achieve substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, known as the adopted in Sendai, Japan, in 2015. In 2019, the Day promotes the Framework’s to reduce disaster damage to critical infrastructure and disruption of basic services, including hospitals and schools. Around 90 per cent of disaster-related funding goes towards reconstruction and damage response, with only 10 per cent to prevention, Ms.  Mizutori said, “We have to find a way to change this 10-to-90 equation, it should be 90-10.” By 2040, $90 trillion will have been invested in protecting and building global infrastructure. To help ensure future cities are not overpowered by tsunami waves, “build where you should, don’t build where you shouldn’t. When you build, build to last, with measure for resilience”, Ms.  Mizutori stressed. In addition, ensuring people have access to early warning education will spare lives, while hazards inevitably “continue to attack”, she said. The United Nations Development Programme’s implementation of tsunami drills in the Asia-Pacific region is one such example of disaster risk communication and prevention. The has so far involved 61,000 students, and 115 schools near the earthquake-prone “Pacific Ring of Fire”, home to more than 70 per cent of all tsunamis ever recorded. Speaking at a commemorative event for the Day at UN Headquarters in New York, President of the General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande,  explained that "over the past two decades, more than one quarter of a million people have lost their lives as a result of tsunamis. Today, we commemorate World Tsunami Awareness Day to remember these dear departed souls. "To ensure that their loss was not in vain, today’s event serves as a call to action. I urge all Member States to adopt and implement disaster risk reduction strategies in order to safeguard future generations", he added. " I am confident that by striving together, we will succeed in delivering for all."

45-> FROM THE FIELD: ‘Blue’ finance flows in the Seychelles
Protecting marine areas from over-exploitation and providing the people who have traditionally lived off the sea with a sustainable alternative livelihood does not come cheap, but in the Seychelles, a focus on financial instruments is making that task easier. The Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, is rich in biodiversity. However, years of over-fishing and the impact of climate change has meant that many Seychellois are unable to make a living. The island nation’s Government has been the UN Development Programme ( ) to put together a financial plan, including a “blue bond” and debt restructuring focused on climate adaptation. Ultimately, up to 400,000 km2, around 40 per cent of its marine environment, will be protected and marine resources will be managed in a sustainable way for the benefit of the people of the Seychelles.

46-> Shrinking biodiversity poses major risk to the future of global food and agriculture, landmark UN report shows
With the biodiversity of plants cultivated for food shrinking, the global population’s health, livelihoods and environment are under severe threat. This warning from the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) comes as the UN agency releases a – the first of its kind – on the state of the world’s biodiversity in food and agriculture. The study, released on Friday, delivers a stark message: that there is a real risk of the plant and animal species that provide our food, fuel and fibre (as well as the many animals, insects and micro-organisms that make up crucial parts of the food chain) disappearing for good. The received a large amount of information from 91 countries, provided specifically for the report, and the analysis of the latest global data to compile the report, which was prepared under the guidance of the , the only permanent intergovernmental body that specifically addresses biological diversity for food and agriculture. While 6,000 plant species are cultivated for food, just nine of them account for two-thirds of all crop production. When it comes to livestock, around a quarter of breeds are at risk of extinction: just a handful provide the vast majority of meat, milk and eggs. And more than half of fish stocks are at risk of extinction. Wild food species are also rapidly disappearing, with just under a quarter of known wild food species are decreasing. However, the true proportion is believed to be much higher as more than half of reported wild food species is unknown. In addition, species that contribute to the food ecosystem, such as pollinators, soil organisms and natural enemies of pests, are under sever threat. Examples include bees, butterflies, bats and birds. FAO chief José Graziano da Silva, quoted in a statement published on Friday, described biodiversity as “critical” for safeguarding global food security, and called for food to be produced in a way that doesn’t harm the environment: “Less biodiversity means that plants and animals are more vulnerable to pests and diseases. Compounded by our reliance on fewer and fewer species to feed ourselves, the increasing loss of biodiversity for food and agriculture puts food security and nutrition at risk.” Human intervention is overwhelmingly at fault, says the report. Examples include the way land water are used and managed; pollution; overexploitation and overharvesting; climate change; and population growth and urbanization. No regions are exempt from biodiversity threats, although the main driving forces differ depending on the region. For example, in Africa a key problem is overexploitation, hunting in poaching; in Europe and Central Asia, deforestation and intensified agriculture are cited; and in Latin America there is concern over pest, diseases and invasive species. The majority of the countries that provided data for the report show an interest in an agriculture-related practice that supports biodiversity, such as organic farming, sustainable soil management and ecosystem restoration. Most of the countries have also put policies in place for the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity. However, the legislation and institutional frameworks are often inadequate or insufficient, and the is calling for much more effective action on a global scale. These include the promotion of pro-biodiversity initiatives, greater efforts to improve the state of knowledge surrounding biodiversity for food and agriculture, and better collaboration among policy-makers, food producers, consumers, the private sector and civil society. Simple ways for consumers to make a difference include opting for sustainably grown products, buying from farmers’ markets or boycotting foods that are unsustainably produced.

47-> Boat made of recycled plastic and flip-flops inspires fight for cleaner seas along African coast
After completing a historic 500km journey from the Kenyan island of Lamu to the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, the world’s first ever traditional “dhow” sailing boat made entirely from recycled plastic, known as the , has successfully raised awareness of the need to overcome one of the world’s biggest environmental challenges: plastic pollution. The Flipflopi Project was co-founded by Kenyan tour operator Ben Morison in 2016, and the ground-breaking dhow was built by master craftsmen Ali Skanda, and a team of volunteers using 10 tonnes of recycled plastic. The boat gets its name from the 30,000 recycled flip-flops used to decorate its multi-coloured hull. Plastics make up 80 per cent of all ocean litter The UN Environment agency’s ( ) joined forces with Flipflopi for the journey down the East African coast, which began on 23 January, ending on 7 February, with the aim of inspiring citizens from Africa and around the world to become more aware of the dangers of plastic pollution. The Clean Seas campaign was launched in 2017 to urge governments, businesses and citizens to eliminate major sources of marine litter – microplastics in cosmetics and the excessive, wasteful usage of single-use plastic – by the year 2022. Each year, more than 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the oceans, wreaking havoc on marine wildlife, fisheries and tourism, and costing at least $8 billion in damage to marine ecosystems. Up to 80 per cent of all litter in the oceans is made of plastic. Historic pollution commitments along Flipflopi route Flipflopi made several stops during the journey, letting local people know what they can do to halt the spread of toxic plastic waste, including the Kenyan coastal towns of Kipini, Malindi and Mombasa. Workshops were conducted to give community members a better understanding of the consequences of dumping plastic waste into the ocean and show children how they can create useful new objects out of dumped plastic bottles. During the Flipflopi voyage, every port of call announced historic commitments to fight pollution. One of the most significant was the pledge to close the Kibarani landfill site in Mombasa, which allows toxic water to drain directly into the ocean. Kibarani is now being restored and planted with trees, while waste will reportedly be disposed of at a new site in a more environmentally responsible manner. Another positive outcome of the campaign has been the decision of 29 businesses, including 22 hotels, to minimize their plastic waste through measures such as banning the use of plastic bottles and straws. UN Environment’s Clean Seas - Flipflopi expedition, is the latest chapter in Kenya’s push to become a global pioneer in tackling plastic pollution. In August 2017, the country introduced the world’s toughest ban on plastic bags with anyone producing, selling or using a plastic bag, risking imprisonment of up to four years or fines of $40,000. The next step for Flipflopi will be a journey to the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, where Heads of State, environment ministers, environmental activists, innovators, NGOs, and CEOs of multinational companies will gather for the fourth – the world’s highest-level environmental forum – from 11-15 March 2019.

48-> Ramp up nuclear power to beat climate change, says UN nuclear chief
Without significantly increasing the use of nuclear power worldwide, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of reducing harmful emissions and fighting climate change, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Monday. Cornel Feruta, the acting Director-General of the agency, was speaking in Vienna, at the opening of the first-ever International Conference on Climate Change and the Role of Nuclear Power. It brought together some 550 participants from 79 countries, and 18 international organizations, to exchange science-based information, and hold objective discussions on the role of nuclear power in mitigating the climate crisis. The pointed out that nuclear power contributes around one-third of all low carbon electricity, producing practically no greenhouse gases, and some 10 per cent of the total electricity produced worldwide. Radioactive waste and security concerns must be addressed However, the IAEA accepted that there are persistent public concerns about the potential dangers to health and the environment caused by radioactive waste from nuclear plants, and Mr. Feruta said that advances concerning the disposal of such material may alleviate fears about the long-term sustainability of the energy source. Also speaking at the event, Mr. Liu Zhenmin, the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), echoed Mr. Feruta’s remarks, and said that the problem of radioactive waste is an "unresolved issue" that needs to be addressed. In his keynote address, Mr. Zhenmin also raised nuclear safety, which he described as "a significant public concern, especially after the Fukushima accidents and terrorism related fears". The large up-front costs of nuclear power remain an important issue, continued Mr. Zhenmin, and renewable energies, such as solar and wind, are continuing to drop in price, becoming increasingly competitive with conventional, fossil-fuel based sources. Meeting the capital costs of building nuclear plants will require government commitments, and public acceptance. Nuclear technology’s ‘important role in society’ Nuclear technology plays an important and positive role in society, added Mr. Zhenmin. He outlined some of the benefits, such as monitoring pollution, and assisting in the diagnosis and treatment of cancers and other major diseases, and pointed out that radiation technology helps prevent food from spoiling, and to create new crop varieties, which supports climate change adaptation. Both Mr. Feruta and Mr. Zhenmin referred to the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), the UN body tasked with providing objective, scientific reports on the changing climate, which has that far-reaching changes to the way we produce energy must occur if we are to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. In its various models for a sustainable energy future, the IPCC has included significant increases in nuclear power generation by 2050, ranging from a 59 per cent increase, to a 501 per cent rise.

49-> New UN Global Climate report ‘another strong wake-up call’ over global warming: Guterres
The increasing number of natural disasters and dangers linked to climate change, highlighted in a major UN released on Thursday, represents “another strong wake-up call” to the world, which must be countered by finding sustainable solutions quickly, UN Secretary-General has said. Speaking at the launch of the report by the World Meteorological Organization ( ), Mr. Guterres reiterated his call for action, underlining that the alarming conclusion that climate change is accelerating, “proves what we have been saying: climate change is moving faster than our efforts to address it.” This was why he had convened the due to take place on 23 September, he said, sitting alongside the President of the General Assembly and the head of , briefing correspondents in New York. ‘Don’t come with a speech, come with a plan’ Mr. Guterres called on Heads of State to attend his climate action summit in New York on 23 September, and achieve positive change. “Don’t come with a speech, come with a plan,” he said, adding: “This is what science says is needed. It is what young people around the globe are rightfully demanding.” . ’s new report shows record highs in global temperatures, sea levels and greenhouse gas concentrations. This is why ambitious is urgent.  I want the summit to demonstrate the benefits of climate action and how everyone can benefit”, he said. “A growing number of governments, cities and businesses…already understand that climate solutions can strengthen our economies, improve air quality and public health and protect our environment.” This will involve a commitment to enhancing national pledges contained in the by 2020, Mr. Guterres explained, and countries “showing how we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade and get to net zero emissions globally by 2050”. Assessing the potential benefits of sustainably-driven climate solutions that leave no-one behind, the UN Secretary-General welcomed the “growing number of governments, cities and businesses” that had embraced -inspired climate solutions as a way to “strengthen our economies, improve air quality and public health and protect our environment”. Initiatives could come from a range of areas, “such as energy, sustainable agriculture, forests and oceans and resilience to climate impacts”, Mr. Guterres said, maintaining that renewable technologies “are already delivering energy at a lower cost than the fossil-fuel driven economy”. Despite this progress, much more radical steps must be taken, he insisted, explaining that “this means ending subsidies for fossil fuels and high-emitting, unsustainable agriculture, and shifting towards renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices”. In addition, “it means carbon pricing that reflects the true cost of emissions, from climate risk to the health hazards of air pollution”, the UN chief explained, “and it means accelerating the closure of coal plants, halting plans for new ones, and replacing those jobs with healthier alternatives, so the transformation is just, inclusive and profitable.” , Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said she had pledged throughout her time in office there was a need for “a holistic understanding of the socio-economic consequences of increasingly intense extreme weather on countries around the world”, adding that the report “makes an important contribution to our combined international action to focus attention on this very critical problem.” It was “really not good news” she told journalists, that CO2 emissions had jumped from 1.6 per cent in 2017, to passing the 2.7 per cent emissions growth, during 2018. “We need to act, and to act now. The numbers and data are extremely worrisome…We are capable, we have the science, we have the knowledge, we have the tools in hand” to push back on global warming, she added. WMO said that the temperature rise last year, came despite the agreement by the international community in December 2015 in Paris, to curb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, and to limit global temperature rise to well below 2C. Paris Agreement increasingly under threat – WMO chief “The time remaining to achieve commitments under the Paris Agreement is quickly running out,” said WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas. Outlining the report’s key findings, Professor Taalas warned of record greenhouse gas concentrations last year, that drove global temperatures towards increasingly dangerous levels. According to WMO, carbon dioxide levels were at 357 parts per million (ppm) in 1994, rising to 405.5 ppm in 2017. Professor Taalas also described “striking” evidence of record warming from 2015 to 2018, increasing sea-level rise and the loss of sea ice in both northern and southern polar regions. Idai victims ‘personify why we need to limit climate change’ Noting that extreme weather events have continued into 2019 - most recently with Tropical Cyclone Idai, which caused devastating floods and loss of life in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi – Professor Taalas said that its victims “personify why we need the global agenda on sustainable development, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction”. “We are seeing record rises in land and ocean temperatures, sea levels and greenhouse gas concentrations,” Mr. Guterres told journalists. “Second, we are seeing, more and more, the dramatic impact of extreme weather conditions. Last year saw 14 weather events where the devastation cost more than $1 billion…The average number of people exposed to heatwaves has increased by some 125 million since the beginning of the century, with deadly consequences.” 2019 so far: record warmth in Europe, unusual cold in North America According to WMO, the start of this year has also seen warm record daily winter temperatures in Europe, unusual cold in North America and searing heatwaves in Australia. The extent of ice in the Arctic and Antarctica is yet again well below average, it said. From now until May, WMO also forecasts above-average sea surface temperatures, which are expected to lead to above-normal land temperature, particularly in tropical latitudes. General Assembly meets on climate change and sustainable development Earlier on Thursday, the General Assembly held a High-Level meeting on climate change and sustainable development, including panel discussions on synergies between the two, and how the two agendas can be brought together in terms of concrete action. "We all can reduce our carbon footprint everyday: in terms of the food we consume, the clothes we use, the transport we choose and the garbage we generate”, said Ms. Espinosa. “Clearly we need to modify our consumption patterns. This is not just a world of shortages, but also of over-consumption. A great paradox is that 1,300 million tons of food are wasted every year, while almost 2000 million people suffer from hunger or malnutrition”, she told delegates at UN Headquarters.

50-> Ocean life faces ‘onslaught of threats’ from human activity, but tools exist to save it
Underwater life is severely impacted by an “onslaught of threats,” but we already have the tools to positively influence ocean conservation, the UN said in a statement marking 2019 which, this year, is celebrated under the theme “Life Below Water: for people and planet.” This is the first time that World Wildlife Day has focused on life below water, the crucial importance of marine species to human development, and how we can continue to save marine biodiversity for future generations. Marine wildlife has sustained human civilizations for thousands of years, providing food; materials for construction; and enriching lives culturally, spiritually and recreationally. Today, some three billion people depend on marine and coastal biodiversity for their livelihoods. But human activity is posing major problems, both for the planet’s oceans and for human lives, particularly in coastal communities. These problems include the over-exploitation of marine species, pollution, the loss of coastal habitats and climate change. Around one-third of fish stocks are being consumed at unsustainable levels, and up to half the world’s coral reefs have been lost due to factors such as warming sea temperatures, ocean acidification and a range of land-based activities. However, international frameworks to halt or reverse these negative trends have existed for some time. For example, the targets of the internationally agreed – for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources – call for restrictions on the trade of marine species; the campaign, the world’s largest global alliance for combatting marine plastic pollution, with commitments covering more than 60 per cent of the world’s coastlines, is supported by 57 countries; whilst some 143 states back the to promote the sustainable management and use of marine and coastal environments. This year, UN Environment’s campaign, which aims to conserve wildlife on land and oceans, has ramped up its awareness-raising efforts, with the addition of new advocates, including actor Adrian Grenier, best known for playing Vincent Chase in the TV series Entourage, who was designated in 2018 in recognition of his long-standing environmental activism. In an exclusive interview with UN News, Mr. Grenier said that we can all make a contribution to improving the oceans and marine life: “Overfishing is a problem, so we want to reduce it as much as possible; consider where food comes from; and make sure it's organic, because a lot of the chemicals in pesticides sprayed on crops end up running off into rivers, and can poison the sea.” March 3 was proclaimed World Wildlife Day by the UN General Assembly in 2013, the day the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( ) was signed, as a way to celebrate and raise awareness of the world’s wild animals and plants. It has become the most important global annual event dedicated to wildlife.

51-> Mitigating climate change in Asia-Pacific could give region an economic boost
The urgent need to move towards a low carbon economy and build resilience, would not only mitigate the worst impacts of climate change in the Asia-Pacific, but also lift the region economically, according to the body overseeing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As Asia-Pacific Climate Week (APCW 2019) wrapped up on Friday in Bangkok, a key takeaway was that long-term holistic planning would enable countries there to tap into the huge potential of renewable energy, and new technology while maximizing socio-economic benefits. Other compelling reasons to rapidly shift to low-carbon and resilience were outlined by high-level speakers that current levels of ambition to tackle climate change are putting the world on a path towards global warming of more than 3 degrees Celsius – that is double the goal of 1.5 degrees. Large turnout and active discussions in the Resilience and Adaptation breakout groups on: coherence, early warning systems, leaving no one behind, capacity building/tools, and the land-water-food nexus.   Participants agreed that in addition to governments, the transformation must be driven by sub-national regions and cities, the private sector and finance. Noting that over half the global population of 1.8 billion young people live in the vast Asia-Pacific region, said that youth groups played an important role in the week, by engaging with participants and coving discussions on social media. Key outcome will provide “important input to the convened by the UN Secretary-General on 23 September in New York”, UNFCCC said in a , adding that “the results will also help build momentum” towards the UN Climate Change Conference (COP25) that will take place in Santiago, Chile, 2-13 December 2019. On the table Countries are currently designing enhanced national climate action plans under the (Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs) and the Summit in New York will be an opportunity for governments and many climate action players to announce new plans and initiatives before the NDCs are communicated to the UN in 2020. Climate change adaptation planning and finance were also key throughout APCW 2019, with a focus on communities and ecosystems most in need. On building resilience to climate change, indigenous peoples from the region, academics and others, stressed the need for a mindset shift in the fight against climate change, proposing policies to help transform societies for long-term resilience. Carbon pricing, capacity-building and regional climate finance were also discussed, with a spotlight on highly vulnerable nations. During the week, work began on a new climate strategy for Indian Ocean Island States to access finance for priority projects. And the UN Climate Change Secretariat is assisting 10 sub-regions involving 77 countries in Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean in preparing strategies to access scaled up climate finance. Organized every year in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the Asia-Pacific, Regional Climate Weeks allow governments and other concerned parties to address the full spectrum of climate issues under one umbrella. The central aim is to bring together the public and private sectors around the common goal of addressing climate change. APCW 2019 was organized by UNCCC in partnership with the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ) and other international and regional organizations. It is the third Regional Climate Week to this year, following one in Accra, Ghana in March and in Salvador, Brazil in August. Next year, the United Arab Emirates will host a Regional Climate Week for the Middle East and North Africa region.

52-> Global South cooperation ‘vital’ to climate change fight, development, Guterres tells historic Buenos Aires summit
South-South cooperation is key to the world’s sustainable development and the fight against global warming said the United Nations on Wednesday, as the opening session of the Second got underway in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. António Guterres reminded top politicians, business and civil society leaders that the BAPA+40 conference, as it’s known for short, will enhance the ground breaking agenda laid out at the first conference 40 years earlier, which adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action for Promoting and Implementing Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries ( ). He said this week was an opportunity to recommit, develop and strengthen frameworks for South-South cooperation – between the developing countries of the Global South - as well as improve systems and tools, increase transparency, and strengthen accountability. “BAPA transformed the dynamics of international cooperation”, the UN chief said. “It highlighted the value of a different form of cooperation, based on the exchange of knowledge and appropriate technologies among nations facing similar development challenges”, he continued, adding that cooperation can enable developing countries to learn from each other and grow more quickly, close income gaps and build inclusive, resilient societies. Five issues, many solutions The UN chief underscored the main challenges that assembled leaders could help overcome, crucial in order to reach the 2030 , and the objectives of the 2015 which commits countries to keep global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Firstly, there is rising inequality both between and within countries, eroding trust worldwide and deepening a sense of injustice. Secondly, the climate change battle was only getting more intense, he said. “2018 was the fourth hottest year on record and natural disasters are impacting nearly every region”, he said, explaining to member States that they must enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent over the next decade. “South-South cooperation will be vital to ensure mutual support and exchange of best practices, to enhance adaptation and increase the resilience of developing countries and communities facing the devastating impacts of climate change. " “South-South Cooperation can also support the transformation of economies dependent on fossil fuels, with strategies that reinforce both sustainable development and environmental protection”, Mr. Guterres added. High-emissions future awaits, if urban development's bungled Third on the list, the need to improve infrastructure, especially in cities, as energy demands rise across the Global South: “Some 60 percent of the area that is expected to become urban by 2030, has yet to be built. If we get this wrong, we will lock ourselves into a high-emissions future with potentially catastrophic consequences”, the UN chief underscored. Fourthly, the UN chief said that although there has been significant progress in achieving gender equality over the years, the gap was widening. “This affects us all, because where women are better represented in politics, we see improved social protection and increased spending on development,” he noted adding that “when women have access to land and credit, harvests increase. When girls are educated, they contribute more to their communities and break cycles of poverty.” Finally, he said international institutions needed to do work harder to support the countries represented in Buenos Aires: “South-South cooperation has evolved significantly over the last decades – but multilateral institutions, including the United Nations, have not kept up”, he said, adding that he was grateful to Member States for acknowledging the role of the UN in the outcome document of the Conference, which will be adopted on Friday. The Secretary-General warned, however, that South-South Cooperation can never be a substitute for official development assistance or replace the responsibilities of developed nations, and that it must involve young people, civil society, the private sector, academia and others to build innovative partnerships. “South-South cooperation is a global exercise of all countries of the South to benefit everyone, including the Least Developed Countries. Every country, every partner has something to share or teach, whatever their circumstances”, Mr. Guterres added, saying that now is the time to take bold and transformative action. “Together, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, beat climate change, and transform the lives of people around the world”, the UN chief concluded. We all ‘share the same dreams’ - Espinosa The President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said BAPA was a symbol of the determination of the Global South to advance equality for all, across the world: “The people in New York or New Delhi, in Paris or Pretoria, in Quito or Helsinki, they all share the same dream: a decent job, health and education, a safe and healthy environment, a government that listens and responds, an efficient international system and with tangible results”, she said. “But these dreams, which seem so elementary, are increasingly distant”, Ms. Espinosa noted. “It is clear that we are helping to restore confidence and the effectiveness of international cooperation and multilateral action. South-South Cooperation represents the best of our people. The principles of solidarity and acting for the common good, make South-South cooperation a powerful force”, she declared.

53-> Flooding leaves South Sudan facing threat of ‘catastrophic’ hunger levels
Torrential rains and flooding across South Sudan have created the threat of “catastrophic” levels of hunger and left hundreds of thousands homeless, UN humanitarians said on Tuesday. Some 700,000 people are in crisis after flood waters swept across the country, submerging villages, land and livestock, according to a World Food Programme ( ) alert. “There is a very significant flood, which is covering vast areas of the country”, said Matthew Hollingworth, Country Director in South Sudan. “More than 36 counties of the country are under water, submerging entire villages, homes, farmsteads, killing livestock and putting an end to livelihoods.” More than 700,000 people across have been affected by heavy flooding since June. When port Mingkaman flooded, WFP found a way to ensure food keeps reaching those in need. 👇Here is our team, offloading food that was bought locally and delivered via the river. 💪👏 Across Jonglei and Unity State, homes and clinics have been submerged, communities have been stranded and animals “lie dead in the fields”, WFP said in a statement. Schools that were due to open next week “are filled with the homeless”. Worst flooding in 60 years The WFP official described the flooding as likely the worst in 60 years and explained that this year’s rains had begun before last year’s flood waters had receded fully. Some 5.5 million people in the country need humanitarian assistance, according to WFP, representing half the total population. The 2019 flooding was already “unprecedented” and had led to the expansion of wetlands, the Sobat and Nile basins, Mr. Hollingworth said, adding that this year’s crisis is likely to be even more severe, as the peak of the flood season still lies ahead. WFP is particularly concerned that crops have been lost in worst affected Jonglei state, where 85,000 people have been displaced by rising waters and some 230,000 people have experienced flooding more than once. Crops submerged “We’ve seen, as I mentioned, harvests being decimated in Jonglei state…and 45 per cent of all the land that was planted with cereals and sorghum - the mainstay of the diet - have been lost this year. That comes in addition to what we saw very similar last year,” Mr. Hollingworth said. He added: “This flooding crisis is coming on top of a very grim hunger situation in Jonglei, where already this year 1.4 million people were suffering from acute and severe hunger, in addition to over 300,000 children under five who are acutely malnourished.” The development adds to the challenges facing South Sudan’s people, where years of civil war, inter-communal conflict, political infighting and corruption have rendered the country vulnerable to natural disaster. Fighting obstacles Conflict was “very significant” ahead of this year’s rains in Jonglei, Unity and Lake State, along with the Greater Pibor Administrative Area, the WFP official explained. This added to the current crisis by preventing humanitarians from delivering food stocks to areas while they were still accessible. To help “half a million people more than we would usually”, WFP has appealed for $58 million to support assistance for the coming six months. This will help to fund assistance by air and boat to areas that are “completely cut off”, Mr. Hollingworth explained, including communities whose crops have been destroyed by the flooding. He warned that it was crucially important to provide support to host communities that had to cope with people displaced by flooding or violence to prevent further tensions and flare-ups, as the country continues to make gradual progress on implementing the 2018 peace agreement. “As cattle move into areas where they weren’t previously put to pasture, as people are displaced into areas where there are not necessarily sufficient resources to look after them as well as the resident community; all of those can breed future problems,” Mr. Hollingworth said. In the longer-term, it was also important to be able to encourage people to return home and to their livelihoods, he insisted. “We’ve been seeing natural disasters, we’ve been seeing conflicts displacing people, that is the situation we’re in right now. We have yet to get data back to confirm how bad it will be, but I think we all need to prepare ourselves that we must do everything in our power to avoid famine and to avoid the levels of hunger - the catastrophic hunger - that we’ve seen sadly in the past in this country.”

54-> Caribbean vital to tackling COVID-19, climate change, UN chief tells regional leaders
The twin crises of COVID-19 and climate change present a once in a generation opportunity for the Caribbean and its development partners to form a new alliance for inclusive, sustainable and resilient recovery, the UN Secretary-General told regional Heads of Government on Thursday. António Guterres was addressing a virtual meeting of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), where he praised countries for their leadership during the crisis, even as they confront shocks to their economies, tourism sector, trade and remittances. “Your unique voice is vital as we tackle shared threats such as climate change, citizen insecurity and the pandemic that expose deep and systemic inequalities,” he . Devastating regional impacts The UN chief stated that the pandemic’s socioeconomic impacts have been worse than the virus itself for some developing economies, including the Caribbean. He highlighted his push for a relief package equivalent to at least 10 per cent of the global economy, as well as an appeal for debt relief. “As you have long advocated, the world must look beyond incomes and factor in the vulnerabilities of countries. The private sector, including the credit rating agencies, also must be engaged in relief efforts”, he said. A strong moral voice Mr. Guterres also underlined his solidarity with CARICOM members in addressing climate change. “Your leadership and moral voice on the front lines is crucial for charting a recovery that will accelerate the decarbonization of the global economy and build a more inclusive and resilient future,” he said. Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  The Secretary-General emphasized his full support for the Caribbean vision of becoming the first fully climate-resilient region in the world. However, he noted the “significant barriers” countries face, including for access to climate finance. UN stepping up support Turning to sustainable development, Mr. Guterres reported that the UN system is ramping up support for the Caribbean and all small island developing states. “We are putting our best capacities and resources to support your voice and participation in global governance processes, to provide sound policy advice and help broker the partnerships that will facilitate your continued progress towards the ,” he said. “This includes expanding and reconfiguring as necessary our physical presence and ensuring tailored support to every country in the Caribbean.” The Secretary-General also thanked CARICOM for highlighting the crucial issue of advancing gender parity, and its unwavering support for multilateralism.

55-> Greening of India's railway network on track
An ambitious plan to make one of the world’s largest and most complex railway networks a net zero carbon emitter by 2030 is moving full steam ahead, although without the steam, thanks, in part, to support from the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). With over 68,000 kilometres of track and serving over a mind-boggling eight billion passengers a year, Indian Railways is vast and amongst the most complicated and involved transport systems in the world. And, perhaps not surprisingly, moving hundreds of thousands of passengers each day across tens of thousands of kilometres of network requires enormous amounts of energy, energy which in the past has often been provided by burning polluting fossil fuels. Those fuels have been identified as one of the key drivers of climate change. India’s transport sector contributes to 12 per cent of the country’s harmful climate-inducing gas emissions with railways accounting for about 4 per cent of that. One solution is to actually use the railways more and road transport less. Indian railways has committed to increasing the amount of freight transported by rail from about 35 per cent in 2015 to 45 per cent by 2030. Even though it takes a lot of fuel to move a train, passenger and freight-mile emissions are much lower than levels recorded by vehicle traffic. “Due to economic development and increased consumption, there is an increasing demand on the resources,” said Vinod Kumar Yadav, Chairman of the Railways Board. The Indian Government has been working on greening the railways, with over half of the network electrified, and a target to electrify the entire network in the next three to four years. Electrification would introduce a more centralized, efficient power system and make higher emitting diesel engines redundant. “We need to take care of the environmental concerns along with the economic development to ensure sustainability’, said Mr. Yadav. “Indian Railways has embarked on a mission to improve energy efficiency and replace fossil fuel sources with renewable energy sources like solar and wind to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2030”. Reaching that goal would mean eliminating emissions of 7.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) each year, about the same as two coal power plants. The United Nations Environment Programme ( ) has been supporting the efforts of Indian Railways, providing advice and training on sustainability and the green economy. Atul Bagai, Head of UNEP’s India Office, said, “India’s rail network has long been an integral part of the country’s societal fabric. Greening the railways not only is vital to achieve the Government’s climate objectives but is also an important symbol of India’s environmental initiative. UNEP is proud to assist these efforts through training and other support.” Emissions from power generation are only one part of the equation. Indian Railways is also looking to make stations and installations green-certified. Over 100 water treatment and recycling plants have been established. And, in a unique development, the railroad operator has fitted long-distance coaches with bio tanks to deal with human waste from passengers. These bio tanks may prevent emissions of up to 155 tonnes of CO2 annually. With more people and more freight set to ride the rails as India’s economy grows, it will be more important than ever to ensure that the future of India’s renowned rail network is sustainable.

56-> UN calls for shipping ‘propulsion revolution’ to avoid ‘environmental disaster’
If emissions from the maritime industry are not cut, we are headed for “an environmental disaster”, Isabelle Durant, the deputy head of the UN trade body, UNCTAD, summit on Wednesday. Will a push to getting to zero emissions impact trade & thus the industry? Our deputy Secretary-General told the Global Maritime Forum summit today that while 80% of global goods trade uses maritime transport, something needs to be done.  If emissions from the maritime industry are not cut, we are headed for “an environmental disaster”, Isabelle Durant, the deputy head of the UN trade body, , summit on Wednesday. Her views were echoed by the UN shipping agency IMO, whose spokesperson, Lee Adamson, told UN News in an exclusive interview that current levels of emissions from shipping are “not acceptable”, and the industry needs a “new propulsion revolution”, to completely cut emissions from the sector. For hundreds of years, shipping has been one of the most important methods of connecting the world, and, even today, it is crucial to international commerce, and linking nations and communities. Its key role is only likely to grow, along with a major increase in global trade and maritime transport. According to the IMO, shipping will be essential to the UN’s vision for sustainable development, providing a dependable, energy-efficient and low-cost way to transport more than 80 per cent of the world’s trade. Avoiding a bunker fuel mentality Nevertheless, the greenhouse gas emissions produced by the sector are significant and, according to the the sector has not kept pace with other forms of transport, when it comes to climate action. The World Bank estimates that a single large shipping vessel, produces as much sulphur as 50 million cars. At around 800 million tonnes per year, the industry as a whole is responsible for approximately 2.2 per cent of all global emissions. Speaking at a plenary panel, during the Forum, on the importance of drastically reducing maritime emissions, Ms. Durant said that the maritime industry is heavily reliant on a form of liquid fuel (so-called “bunker fuel”) that has a high carbon footprint. Global seaborne trade is expected to double over the next twenty years, which means that it is imperative to make sure ships are powered in a way that is much more sustainable. This is why the UN is leading a number of projects aimed at significantly cutting emissions and, eventually, phasing them out altogether. During the Secretary-General’s landmark Climate Action Summit in September, the global shipping industry launched the Getting to Zero Coalition to cut emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 and make the transition to full decarbonization possible. The Coalition will deliver a roadmap with concrete steps to speed up the production and operation of zero emissions shipping vehicles. The membership group behind the Getting to Zero Coalition numbers over 80 shipping stakeholders, including Shipping industry partners, energy companies, port cities, intergovernmental organizations, civil society and governments. ‘Decarbonizing shipping could be a powerful engine that drives green development around the world,” said Special Envoy for the Climate Action Summit, Luis Alfonso de Alba.  “The Summit brought together decision makers from across the shipping value chain, and delivered a major step up from key shipping industry leaders accelerating the transition from the grey to the green economy.  The Summit showed that the most ‘hard-to-abate’ sectors can make this shift if all partners of the value chain move forward together”.  At the Global Maritime Forum’s Annual Summit, taking place in Singapore, Ms. Durant and colleagues launched UNCTAD’s 2019 , which confirmed the necessity of a drive towards environmental sustainability, and noted that technological disruption and climate change have had a major impact on the shipping over the last decade. Some companies are calling for financing to be unlocked to develop zero-emission vessels. Mr. Adamson explained to UN News how the IMO is helping to make this a reality: “In 2018, IMO Member States adopted an for cutting GHG emissions from shipping and phasing them out entirely, as soon as possible. There’s a specific linkage to the , and clear levels of ambition – including at least a 50 per cent cut in emissions from the sector by 2050, compared to 2008.” “The agreed reduction targets signify a tangible trajectory towards the decarbonisation of shipping. Therefore, zero-emission ships should be built well before 2050, hopefully by 2030.” “The strategy is expected to drive a new propulsion revolution. There is a need to make zero-carbon ships commercially more attractive, and to direct investments towards innovative sustainable technologies, and alternative low-carbon and zero-carbon fuels”. the status quo is not acceptable because of the impact of ship emissions on climate change, and human health, and that has its own cost which is also borne by society -  Plugging in to a battery-powered future A number of exciting options are currently being explored by the industry which, says Mr. Adamson, has been given a clear signal of the way forward, thanks to the IMO emissions strategy. These include battery-powered and hybrid ferries, ships trialling biofuels or hydrogen fuel cells, and wind-assisted propulsion. Norwegian ferry company Color Line, for example, is building the world’s largest plug-in hybrid ship, capable of carrying 2,000 passengers and 500 cars between the towns of Strømstad, Sweden, and Sandefjord, Norway. The battery pack on the boat gives it up to 60 minutes manoeuvring and sailing at speeds of up to 12 knots, which means that the last leg of the two-and-a-half-hour trip, through the fjord that leads to Sandefjord harbour, is emission-free. Norway is also the home of Brødrene Aa, a constructor of highly efficient carbon fibre ferries, which, they say, can reduce fuel consumption by up to 40 per cent compared to traditional vessels. The company has developed a concept vessel that runs entirely on batteries and hydrogen, anticipating a future in which zero emissions ferries are the norm. Partnership for progress Despite these encouraging signs that a zero-emission future for shipping is possible, action needs to take much faster, warns Mr. Adamson, if the UN’s goals are to be achieved. To speed up progress, the IMO is engaged in several major global projects, involving Member States and the shipping industry (see text box below). Although investments in low or zero-emission shipping may mean higher costs, business as usual, says the IMO spokesperson, is not an option: “the status quo is not acceptable because of the impact of ship emissions, not just to address climate change, but also on human health and the environment, and that has its own cost which is also borne by society”. “The principle of ‘polluter pays’ is well established, and it has to be recognized that shipping is a polluter, in spite of its cost-effectiveness, and somehow that needs to be mitigated” IMO-supported projects to cut shipping emissions

57-> Over $39 million earmarked by UN-backed fund to combat effects of climate change in Nepal
More than $39 million in funding was on Wednesday for a project that will build resilience and mitigate the effects of climate change, benefitting nearly one million Nepalis, according to the Board of the UN-backed (GCF). The Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) has been working with the Government in developing this first-ever national bid to go before the Fund. Co-funding the initiative, Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment (MoFE) is adding another $8 million for a total of more than $47 million, which will see the project to fruition over the course of seven years. Nearly 1 million rural Nepalese vulnerable to climate change to benefit from USD 39 million grant to build resilience - government tops up further 8 million USD - to provide tech support. More info here:  Communities in the Churia hills region – the southernmost range of the Himalayan foothills, running east-west through Nepal – will be targeted as it provides vital ecosystem functions to the heavily-populated plains downstream where the most fertile agricultural land is located. Building rural resilience “This major GCF contribution to FAO’s work in partnership with the Government of Nepal at all levels of federalization, namely, central, provincial and municipal, will benefit more than 200,000 households in the Churia hills”, said Somsak Pipoppinyo, FAO Representative to Nepal, noting that it would help rural families to “become more resilient to the changing environment in which they find themselves”. Decades of unsustainable use of natural resources have resulted in forest degradation, floods and soil erosion.  And the negative effects on downstream communities have been exacerbated by increased droughts and extreme weather events precipitated by the climate crisis. It is predicted those impacts will intensify in coming years, further threatening food security and livelihoods. “It will also help them adapt to, and mitigate the effects of, climate and extreme weather events in the years to come,” added Mr. Pipoppinyo. Kailash Pokharel of Nepal’s Ministry of Finance underscored the region as “a national priority critical to Nepal’s food security and climate change policy” and pledged to ensure that the project “brings transformational change to grassroots communities” and enhances climate resilience. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions Designed to directly contribute to Nepal’s nationally determined contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), much of the project’s work will focus on developing infrastructure to move away from unsound and environmentally damaging natural resource management practices. And its long-term sustainability will rely on building both individual and institutional capacity at all levels. “The project will work with both government and communities to coordinate actions,” said Ben Vickers, FAO’s lead technical officer. “We anticipate these actions will deliver average annual emission reductions of nearly half-a-million tonnes of CO2 each year.”

58-> The sun’s impact on Earth and weather celebrated, as planet marks World Meteorological Day
Against a background of serious warnings against the effects of climate change, this year celebrates the in powering all life on Earth, and in driving the weather, ocean currents and the hydrological cycle. The day  which, every 23 March, marks the anniversary of the 1950 Convention that established the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ), is the occasion to take stock of the importance of the sun and weather monitoring for the common safety, health and well-being of all living things on the planet. Through its national meteorological and hydrological services, WMO has been providing expertise, monitoring and forecast services to both harness and protect us from the power of the sun. “Too little sun impacts our mood and well-being, and increases the risk of Vitamin D deficiency,” said WMO, noting on the other hand that “overexposure to sunlight causes harmful effects on the skin, eyes, and immune system. Experts believe that four out of five cases of skin cancer could be prevented, as UV damage is mostly avoidable.” Some key facts: About half the sunlight reaching the surface of the planet is radiated upward in the form of infrared heat, absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, warming the surface of the Earth. This “greenhouse effect” is what makes the planet livable. But now, shows that the warming of the planet is reaching dangerous levels causing a series of alarming disruptions. “Satellite measurements taken over the past 30 years show that the sun’s energy output has not increased and that the recent warming observed on Earth cannot be attributed to changes in the sun’s activity,” explained WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “The rise in temperatures – which are melting ice and – is driven by long-lived ,” he added. Independent climate change experts warn that if the current trend in greenhouse gas concentrations continues, we may see temperature increases by 3 °C to 5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels, by the end of the century. WMO’s analysis reveals that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years. To tackle this, UN will be hosting a in New York on 23 September, to galvanize climate action and ambition at the highest levels. As supporting evidence for the discussions, will be launched on Thursday 28 March. This report will provide an overview of temperatures, high-impact events, and key indicators of long-term climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, sea level rise and ocean acidification. It will be launched alongside a . The sun provides us with a valuable source of renewable energy that has the potential to replace fossil fuels like coal or oil, for electricity production, heating, and desalinating water, among other things. Its energy can be harnessed directly with “photovoltaics” or “solar cells”, even in cloudy weather. According to the International Energy Agency, solar power and other renewable sources have become the technology of choice thanks to falling costs and supportive government policies: by 2040, the share of renewables in electricity generation is expected to rise from 25 per cent today to over 40 per cent. However, power generation from solar cells is strongly dependent on the weather. Therefore, reliable meteorological forecasts are indispensable for balancing the power grid, and will gain even more importance as the renewable energy sector expands.

59-> Science, solidarity and solutions needed against climate change: Guterres
Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere are at record levels, and emissions that saw a temporary decline due to the pandemic are heading towards pre-COVID levels, while global temperatures continue to hit new highs, according to a major new UN report. , released on Wednesday, highlights the increasing and irreversible impacts of climate change on glaciers, oceans, nature, economies and it’s cost on people across the globe; manifest more and more often through disasters such as record heatwaves, wildfires, droughts and floods. Speaking at the launch of the report, UN emphasized that there is “no time to delay” if the world is to slow the trend of the devastating impacts of climate change, and limit temperate rise to 1.5 degree-Celsius. The five-year period since the since the signing of the will be the hottest on human record, according to new report. We must turn the recovery from into an opportunity by taking .  “Whether we are tackling a pandemic or the climate crisis, it is clear that we need science, solidarity and decisive solutions,” said Mr. Guterres. “We have a choice: business as usual, leading to further calamity; or we can use the recovery from to provide a real opportunity to put the world on a sustainable path,” he added. The Secretary-General outlined six climate-related actions to shape the recovery from COVD-19, to ensure a sustainable future for coming generations. The six actions include: delivering new jobs and businesses through a clean, green transition; making public bailouts contingent upon green jobs and sustainable growth; shifting away from grey and towards green economy, making societies and people more resilient; channelling public fund investments into sustainable sectors and projects that help the environment and the climate; factoring in climate risks and opportunities into the financial system as well as in public policymaking and infrastructure; and lastly – working together as an international community. “As we work to tackle both the COVID-19 pandemic and the climate crisis, I urge leaders to heed the facts in this report, unite behind the science and take urgent climate action,” added Mr. Guterres, urging governments to prepare new and ambitious national climate plans, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), in advance of . “That is how we will build a safer, more sustainable future.” Climate change continues unabated In one of its key findings, the report states that atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations showed “no signs of peaking” and continued to increase to new records. Benchmark stations in the network reported CO2 concentrations above 410 parts per million (ppm) during the first half of 2020, with Mauna Loa (Hawaii) and Cape Grim (Tasmania) at 414.38 ppm and 410.04 ppm, respectively, in July 2020, up from 411.74 ppm and 407.83 ppm the same month last year. “Greenhouse gas concentrations - which are already at their highest levels in 3 million years - have continued to rise,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ), in the foreword to the report. Meanwhile, large swathes of Siberia have seen a prolonged and remarkable heatwave during the first half of 2020, which would have been very unlikely without anthropogenic climate change. And now 2016-2020 is set to be the warmest five-year period on record, he continued. “Whilst many aspects of our lives have been disrupted in 2020, climate change has continued unabated,” added Mr. Taalas. Findings According to the report, CO2 emissions in 2020 will fall by an estimated 4 to 7 per cent in 2020 due to COVID-19 confinement policies. The exact decline will depend on the continued trajectory of the pandemic and government responses to address it. In April 2020, at the height of COVID-related lockdowns, daily global fossil CO2 emissions dropped by an unprecedented 17 per cent compared to the year prior. However, by early June, the emissions had mostly returned to within 5 per cent below 2019 levels. It notes that though the emissions gap – the difference between what we need to do and what we are actually doing to tackle climate change – is wide, it can still be bridged with urgent and concerted action by all countries and across all sectors. On the state of the global climate, the report indicates that the average global temperature for 2016-2020 is expected to be the warmest on record, about 1.1 degree Celsius above 1850-1900 (a reference period for temperature change since pre-industrial times) and 0.24 degree Celsius warmer than the global average temperature for 2011-2015. Impact of COVID-19 on Earth system observations The report also documents how the COVID-19 pandemic has impeded the ability to monitor changes in climate through the global observing system, which in turn has affected the quality of forecasts and other weather, climate and ocean-related services. Aircraft-based observations have seen major reductions, manual measurements at weather stations and of rivers have been badly affected and nearly all oceanographic research vessels are in ports, owing to direct or secondary impact of the pandemic. The impacts on climate change monitoring are long-term, according to the report. They are likely to prevent or restrict measurement campaigns for the mass balance of glaciers or the thickness of permafrost, usually conducted at the end of the thawing period. The report The United in Science 2020 report, the second in a series, is coordinated by the UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO), with input from the Global Carbon Project, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of , the UN Environment Programme ( ) and the UK Met Office. The report brings together the latest climate science related updates from a group of key global partner organizations. It presents the very latest scientific data and findings related to climate change to inform global policy and action.

60-> Far more needed to ‘confront the world’s climate emergency’, Guterres tells ASEAN-UN Summit
Four of the 10 countries most affected by climate change are members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said on Sunday, urging the ASEAN-UN Summit in Bangkok to “confront the world’s climate emergency”. “This region is highly vulnerable, particularly to rising sea-levels, with catastrophic consequences for low-lying communities, as recently published research illustrated”, he , pointing out that 70 per cent of the global population most at risk of rising sea-levels are within ASEAN and other countries that will be represented at summits later this week. The UN chief has been a strong advocate for progress on carbon pricing, ensuring no new coal plants by 2020, and ending the allocation of trillions of taxpayer dollars for the fossil fuel subsidies that boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases and heighten conflict. “I am particularly worried about the future impact of the high number of new coal power plants still projected in some parts of the world, including several countries in East, South and South East Asia”, he asserted. At the same time, Mr. Guterres maintained that developed countries “must fulfil their commitment” to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. To avoid climate catastrophe, the world must “I count on your leadership to undertake the concrete actions necessary to confront the world’s climate emergency”, Mr. Guterres underscored. No region immune Noting a global phenomenon of rising trade and technology tensions, and unease and uncertainty amidst revised downward growth forecasts, Mr. Guterres spelled out: “No region is immune”. From to the to human rights, collaboration between the and continues to grow stronger. Read ' full remarks on this vital and growing partnership:  📸:  And  he drew attention to rising US-China tensions as “another concern emerging on the horizon”,  fearing what he termed “a Great Fracture”, where the two world’s largest economies split the globe in half – each with its own “dominant currency, trade and financial rules…internet and artificial intelligence capacities, and its own zero sum geopolitical and military strategies”. “We must do everything possible to avert this Great Fracture”, the UN chief stressed, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a world with strong multilateral institutions and a universal economy with respect for international law. Turning to economic development, Mr. Guterres spotlighted that the world is “far off track” in meeting the (SDGs). While ASEAN countries have lifted millions out of poverty, there are still people being left behind. He pointed out the many complementarities between ASEAN’s Vision 2025 and the , saying that the UN stands ready to support the region in accelerating its progress, particularly through “our collective efforts on peace and justice, decent work and climate action” as well as in key human rights areas, such as freedom of expression and the right to a healthy environment. He also expressed concern over the situation in Myanmar and the plight of massive numbers of refugees . While welcoming ASEAN’s recent engagement with Rangoon, he flagged that it was ultimately Myanmar’s responsibility “to address the root causes and ensure a conducive environment for the safe, voluntary, dignified and sustainable repatriation of refugees to Rakhine State”. In conclusion, the Secretary-General urged everyone to keep building on the UN-ASEAN partnership “to ensure dignity and opportunity” for the people of the region and beyond.

61-> We are ‘burning up our future’, UN’s Bachelet tells Human Rights Council
The Human Rights Council opened in Geneva on Monday with a warning from the UN’s top rights official that, with forest fires raging in the Amazon, “we are burning up our future, literally”. In a direct appeal to the forum’s 47 Member States to unite to tackle climate change, Michelle Bachelet insisted that every region of the world stands to be affected. Key points to – :   🌀Climate change undermines rights, development & peace 📣 requires broad & meaningful participation 🌊Island States like cannot act alone to solve a problem that is not of their own making In the short-term, however, the worst effects of the fires and “drastic acceleration of deforestation” in Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil were on the families living in these areas, she explained. “Climate change is a reality that now affects every region of the world,” the High Commissioner maintained. “The human implications of currently projected levels of global heating are catastrophic. Storms are rising and tides could submerge entire island nations and coastal cities. Fires rage through our forests, and the ice is melting. We are burning up our future – literally.” Citing UN reports that the climate emergency has caused a sharp increase in global hunger levels, the High Commissioner also noted that warmer temperatures will likely contribute to an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. ‘We’ve never seen a threat of this scope to human rights’ “The world has never seen a threat to human rights of this scope”, Ms. Bachelet insisted. “This is not a situation where any country, any institution, any policymaker can stand on the sidelines. The economies of all nations; the institutional, political, social and cultural fabric of every State, and the rights of all your people – and future generations – will be impacted.” Speaking 14 days before UN opens a Climate Action Summit in New York, the High Commissioner urged the Geneva-based Council to do its bit, too. Each State should contribute the “strongest possible action to prevent climate change”, Ms. Bachelet told Member States, and they should promote the “resilience and rights” of their citizens when implementing these policies, too – one of no less than two dozen references in her speech to indigenous peoples and minorities. In keeping with tradition, the High Commissioner also highlighted numerous other country-specific human rights situations requiring the Council’s attention. Citing ongoing concerns about Kashmir, the High Commissioner cited continuing reports of curfews, internet blackouts and restrictions on political gatherings, including the detention of activists. Appealing to Pakistan “and particularly to India” to ensure people’s access to basic services, Ms. Bachelet also highlighted the recent census in the north-east Indian state of Assam. Some 1.9 million people had been excluded from this list, she maintained, before appealing to the Indian authorities to “ensure due process” for anyone appealing against this development, while also ensuring that people are protected against statelessness. On Ukraine, where more than five years of conflict in eastern territories bordering Russia has left thousands dead and injured tens of thousands more, the High Commissioner welcomed the “breakthrough agreement” of prisoner releases between the two countries. “I strongly encourage all parties to build on this momentum, to put an end to the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” she added. Turning to South Africa, Ms. Bachelet noted the “terrible recent incidents of xenophobic violence” where a spate of attacks has reportedly claimed the lives of least 10 foreigners. “All people in South Africa – citizens and foreign nationals alike – are entitled to fundamental human rights under the Constitution and international human rights law,” Ms. Bachelet said, while welcoming President Cyril Ramaphosa’s condemnation of the violence. Sudan’s new Cabinet ‘a cause for celebration’ On Sudan, where a ministerial cabinet was sworn in on Sunday, a first since President Omar Bashir was removed from office in April amid country-wide protests – Ms. Bachelet called the development “ a cause for great celebration”. She also welcomed the many human rights references contained in Sudan’s new Constitutional Declaration, notably its commitment to establishing a national investigation committee, following reported extreme rights violations against protesters. Amid ongoing protests in Hong Kong, the UN official reiterated her appeal to demonstrators to engage “peacefully and constructively” with the authorities. At the same time, she urged the territory’s security forces to respond to any violence with restraint, before encouraging Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, to “pursue her initiative to establish dialogue with the people”.

62-> Australia wildfires: communities must stay vigilant, urges UN weather agency
As Australia’s “catastrophic” and deadly wildfire emergency continues, UN weather experts on Tuesday echoed Government warnings for people to remain vigilant in the face of the fast-moving threat and tinderbox conditions. In Geneva, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) noted that dozens of fires are raging, affecting around six million in eastern New South Wales state, and southeast Queensland, amid reports that three people lost their lives in the fires at the weekend. “Apart from the immediate physical threat…when authorities issue a message of catastrophic fire danger, the message there is basically, “Get out, get away,’” Clare Nullis, spokesperson for the World Meteorological Organization ( ), told journalists. Citing Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology description of the situation as “evolving and dangerous”, Ms. Nullis said that conditions were likely to remain dry, with little to no rain forecast. Australia's report 2018 by and : "There has been a long-term increase in extreme fire weather, and in the length of the fire season, across large parts of Australia." is contributing to these changes  “The fires are due to a combination of factors including low soil moisture, heat and importantly, wind direction and wind speed,” she explained. New South Wales has declared a state of emergency as parts of the state - including the Greater Sydney area and Queensland - face a "catastrophic" fire danger, which is the highest level of warning. Although bush and grassfires are common in Australia, the emergency is linked to increasingly warm temperatures over the course of the last century. “According to the Bureau of Meteorology of Australia, it’s been the second warmest January to October on record for Australia as a whole, and these are records going back 110 years,” Ms. Nullis said, adding that the number of days falling into the category of “fire weather days” has increased. “The most extreme 10 per cent of fire weather days - which is how they measure the fire index - has increased in recent decades across many regions…There has been an associated increase in the length of the fire weather season and climate change including increasing temperatures, is contributing to these changes.” According to WMO, many at-risk communities face winds of 60 to 80 kilometres per hour (37 to 50 miles per hour) and temperatures in the mid to high 30s Celsius (around 95 Fahrenheit). Although a cool weather front that is forecast may ease fire dangers, “a combination of dry and gusty winds and a shift in wind direction will mean people in the impacted areas will need to remain vigilant”, Ms. Nullis insisted. Between 1967 and 2013, major Australian bushfires resulted in over 8,000 injuries and 433 deaths, close to 50 per cent of all fatalities from major Australian natural disasters, excluding heatwaves, Australian Government figures show. Over the same period, bushfires cost approximately $3.2 billion.

63-> From farm to fork: How food systems can power climate action
Taking specific steps to transform national food supply systems can help countries achieve climate goals and limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius, a new joint UN report on climate action has found. , published on Tuesday, by the UN Environment Programme ( ), WWF, EAT, and Climate Focus, also reveals that nations are missing significant opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. By adding diets and food loss and waste to national climate plans, policymakers can improve their mitigation & adaptation contributions from food systems by as much as  25%. More in our 🆕 report with , & ⬇️  It also identifies sixteen ways policymakers could take more action, from farm to fork, to integrate food systems in their national climate strategies, that could also help improve food security. According to the head of UNEP, while has exposed the fragility of food supply systems, the pandemic has also demonstrated that businesses and people are ready to build back better. “This crisis offers us a chance to radically rethink how we produce and consume food”, Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, said in a announcing the report’s findings. “For example, reorienting consumption by halving food waste and catalyzing a shift towards more plant-rich diets, is also a powerful climate mitigation tool to take advantage of. It is up to us to seize this opportunity and put sustainable food systems at the heart of the green recovery,” she added. Improvements by as much as 25 per cent Currently, diets and food loss and waste are widely ignored in national climate plans, but by adding them, policymakers can improve their mitigation and adaptation contributions from food systems, by as much as 25 per cent, said UNEP. Under the 2015 on Climate Change, every five years, countries are expected to revise or resubmit their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – steps that they will take to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. 2020, therefore, presents policymakers with the opportunity to adopt food systems solutions and set more ambitious targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, in turn, improve biodiversity, food security and public health. Food: more than a third of emissions Food systems – which gather all elements and activities that relate to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food – account for up to 37 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, offering plenty of space to improve. Marco Lambertini, Director General of WWF-International, called on governments to include climate and nature positive food systems approaches in revised and more ambitious NDCs submitted in 2020. “Without action on how we produce and consume food, we cannot achieve our climate or biodiversity goals, which are the foundation to achieve food security, prevent the emergence of diseases and ultimately deliver the (SDGs).” Affordable and accessible diets Gunhild Stordalen, the Founder and Executive Chair of EAT – a non-profit organization that works towards catalyzing a global food system transformation – added that fixing food systems goes beyond supporting the implementation of the and the Paris Agreement. “Shifting to regenerative, carbon-absorbing production and adoption of healthy, predominantly plant-based diets that are affordable and accessible, as well as halving food waste and loss, are crucial actions that must be included in countries’ NDCs and integrated in their climate action plans with clear ambitions,” she said. “As we enter the Decade of Action, let’s make it the decade of delivery for a healthy, sustainable and equitable food future for all,” added Dr. Stordalen. With a check-list and concrete examples of activities and targets, the report provides guidance for policymakers to integrate food systems in their national climate strategies  Action towards transformation The sixteen actions identified in the report include reducing land-use change and conversion of natural habitats, which could reduce emissions by some 4.6 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide, or Gt CO2e, per year. Comparably, reducing food loss and waste, which accounts for 8 per cent of all greenhouse gas emissions, could reduce emissions by 4.5 Gt CO2e per year. Similarly, improving production methods and reducing methane emissions from livestock, could reduce emissions by up to 1.44 Gt CO2e per year. Much greater reductions, could be achieved by shifting to healthier and more sustainable diets with a higher proportion of plant-based than animal-based foods could avoid emissions of up to 8 Gt CO2e each year. But, no current national climate plans explicitly discuss more sustainable diets. “Eliminating excessive meat consumption, improving storage facilities and reducing food waste is good for our health and improves food security,” said Charlotte Streck, Co-founder and Director of , a think tank that provides advice on international climate policy to public and private actors across the globe. “With a check-list and concrete examples of activities and targets, this report provides guidance for policymakers to integrate food systems in their national climate strategies,” she added.

64-> ‘Break the cycle’ of disaster-response-recovery, urges top UN official, as death toll mounts from Cyclone Idai
The destruction unleashed by Cyclone Idai on Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, continues to claim lives and displace thousands, in what the UN’s top disaster risk reduction official called on Monday “the to occur so far this year”. “Cyclone Idai underlines that no matter how effective early warnings are, there is still a huge demand for greater investment in resilient infrastructure in many parts of the world if we are to break the cycle of disaster-response-recovery”, UN Special Representative for (UNISDR) Mami Mizutori said, extending her condolences to the peoples and Governments of the three affected countries. According to news reports, Mozambique’s Beira has been battered severely, including more than 1,500 people injured by falling trees and debris. While the road to the city has been badly damaged, Beira is once again reachable by air. “It is still too early to know the full extent of the disaster unfolding in the port city of Beira in Mozambique where 500,000 people bore the brunt of the storm but the human impact and trauma inflicted on the population must be very significant given the scale of the damage being reported by the Government disaster management agency, UN agencies, the Red Cross and the media”, Ms. Mizutori continued. She said the severe damage to schools, hospitals, health facilities and other key infrastructure was particularly distressing “as this will have consequences not just for the emergency response phase but for the long-term efforts of these countries to eradicate poverty and hunger”. “Cyclone Idai is a clear demonstration of the exposure and vulnerability of many low-lying cities and towns to sea-level rise as the impact of climate change continues to influence and disrupt normal weather patterns”, spelled out Ms. Mizutori. Figures released at midday on Monday in New York, by UN humanitarian agencies, reported that at least 48 had died across the city. In Malawi, more than 183,000 have been affected, while 9,600 have been impacted due to flooding and landslides. On the disaster in Papua, Indonesia, heavy rains there since 16 March, have resulted in at least 79 deaths, with dozens missing or injured, said UN Spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.

65-> A youthful 75: New generation carries the torch for UN values
75 years on from the founding of the UN, young people are being enlisted to share their visions of a better planet, and help decide the next chapter of the Organization. ‘It will take selfless women to get us out of this mess’ “As a teenager from a third world country I fear for my future, and the future of the next generations, because of the increasing damage humanity is causing our environment. The climate is no longer safe, and politicians don't seem to care. I am deeply concerned with the slow response from global leaders on climate change and lack of climate justice. Thankfully, a new wave of young activists is sweeping the world. Young people like Greta Thunberg have become the adults in the room, which inspires me a lot. It will take selfless women to get us out of this mess. Female climate activists are showing leadership all over the world and showing us that solutions are within our reach. We've seen the urgency and the speed with which world leaders and the private sector have reacted to . It's time to do the same thing for the climate crisis. Governments need to start telling the truth about climate change to the public and most importantly declare a climate emergency. I want the UN to do more to hold governments accountable for the injustices and abuses they commit against their own people and the environment. Young people need to be given an active role, with the power to influence policies. The UN is trying to make all voices heard, but voices from the global South are still not listened to. It takes a lot of effort for a climate activist from Uganda to be heard internationally. I ask the UN to give us the same platform it gives to our counterparts from developed countries.” ‘The UN is still a symbol of hope’ “The UN is trying to be more relevant to young people, but there is still a long way to go. Young people should be part of every single discussion and initiative at the UN at all levels as key actors and contributors, they should not be included in only one or two campaigns and initiatives. We don’t just deserve a seat at the table, the table should be brought to us, and the most vulnerable and affected communities. The UN was created ‘to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war and to establish conditions under which justice and respect can be maintained’. Unfortunately, conflicts remain, torture has not been extinguished, and human rights violations continue to make headlines. Yet, 75 years down the line, the UN is still a symbol of hope to so many people, who often find themselves on the side lines. When people flee their country, they know that when they get to a UN camp they will be able to get food, shelter, and basic medical care. Most of us will agree that the fate of the human race would look much bleaker today if it wasn’t for the UN fostering international co-operation and preventing a repeat of the horrific world wars of the first half of the 20th century. Today, most of the problems facing our world are global, COVID-19 being one of them, hence they require a global response. But all nations need to show true and authentic intentions in uniting for peace and a sustainable future for our planet. To ensure it remains relevant, the internal democratic processes of the UN need to be revisited. The UN should be more democratic, more transparent, and much more accessible to everyone, especially underprivileged communities, so that any young person from a refugee camp, slum or indigenous community can see themselves fully represented.” ‘I want to see a world of equal opportunities’ “I want to see a world of equal opportunities for men and women; with reduced inequalities between countries, peoples and communities; in which young people are seen as a major asset for the development of nations, particularly in Africa, where they make up some 60 per cent of the population; and where vulnerable groups are represented at the highest level of government. Women have a lot of potential, but socio-cultural norms, and male leadership in Africa, still pose major challenges. Woman have a major role to play, at the family and societal level, if we are to achieve the by 2030. I do think that the voice of youth is being heard by the UN, but it can do more. 70 per cent of Cameroon’s population is young, and intelligent, but only 15 per cent of them have access to jobs in the public sector. I would like to see the UN create a ‘UN Youth’ agency, devoted entirely to themes linked to young people, such as project coaching – in areas such as start-ups, sustainable agriculture, agri-business and computing – and financial and technical mentoring. Today, many countries, including Cameroon, are suffering from problems such as armed conflict and civil wars, bad governance, commercial wars, and growing inequality. I want the UN to find new strategies, adapted to each country, that bring about peace and security; make equal opportunity for men and women a reality; and ensure that vulnerable parts of society, including indigenous people, have senior, decision-making positions of authority.”  Youth and the UN The UN chief, and other top UN officials, shared their thoughts on the importance of youth, multilateralism and the UN. Mr. Guterres praised the cosmopolitan attitudes and solidarity of young people, and their leading role in the fight for gender equality, climate action, and against racism. “I’m sure that in the future we will win the battle”, he said, “and we will have stronger and more inclusive multilateralism.” Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, the President of the General Assembly, described multilateralism as a framework for listening to others, and relating to the way that they see things. “This is absolutely fundamental”, he added, “and a major principle of the UN: it’s an example of respect for others, a willingness to work with them to solve common problems, and to give them the support they need.” Jayathma Wickramanayake, the UN Envoy on Youth, recounted the role of the UN in helping her country, Sri Lanka, recover from the devastating 2004 tsunami, which killed some 35,000 people, and encouraging the warring parties in its civil war to reach a peaceful solution. “For me multilateralism is about hope, opportunity and human dignity”, said Ms. Wickramanayake. “It’s about what the UN and other institutions do for the people on the ground, those who most need their help.”

66-> ‘The clock is ticking’ on meeting the Sustainable Development Goals, says UN deputy chief
Pointing to climate change, inequalities and other serious challenges, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told a forum on Thursday Development that “the clock is ticking” down, to making the for Sustainable Development. “Climate change is ravaging the planet… staggering numbers of children and youth – especially girls and young women – still lack access to basic education and healthcare services, [and] people in many countries are starved of economic opportunities, decent work and social protection measures”, she told the  2019 , where governments, business representatives and other influencers met to discuss how partnerships can best advance and the 17 ( ). During today's ECOSOC Partnership Forum, we explore how partnerships can drive inclusive implementation of the SDGs. Join us live:     Under the theme, “Partnerships Driving Inclusive Implementation of the SDGs”, the Forum will capture key policy messages to inform the High-level Political Forum ( ) in in September. “Our task is immense, but many of the pathways to change are in plain sight”, she asserted, adding that while “success is still possible”, it requires difficult conversations around “the need to fill partnership skillset gaps, tackle financing shortfalls, and address data deficiencies”. The economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development call for “a fully integrated approach” that engages everyone. “Partnerships are critical for achieving progress across the full agenda” stressed Ms. Mohammed, calling on partnerships, “the ‘connective tissue’ which will ensure an integrated and holistic approach to sustainable development”. The deputy UN chief shared four points for discussion, beginning with a commitment between the UN, governments, private sector and civil society to work together in a more coordinated and integrated way. “The transformation we need requires us to acknowledge that everyone is a development actor,” she argued. “Governments alone cannot achieve the SDGs”. Secondly, she pointed to the need to prioritize investments in platforms and coalitions that engage a larger ecosystem of partners. “Investments in cross-cutting, high-return priorities have strong potential to unlock progress across multiple SDGs”, she stated, flaggin a range of areas, from quality education and health services to zero-carbon energy and environmental conservation. Ms. Mohammad’s third point focused on leadership, innovation and strategic collaborations “at the local level”. “We must draw on the knowledge and experience of local communities and actors on the ground to ensure that we replicate and scale up the most promising models”, she emphasized. Ensuring that the process to socialize the SDGs and strengthen ownership is “inclusive, transparent and accountable”, was her final point. “All stakeholders, big or small should find a place to play their role and make their contribution”, she maintained. The transformation we need requires us to acknowledge that everyone is a development actor –  She urged everyone to “reflect honestly about where we are falling short, because those shortcomings are also where the opportunities lie to make a difference”. “Only with this kind of pragmatic approach will we realize our aspiration of leaving no one behind”, said Ms. Mohammed, with the reminder that promoting equitable access and equal participation by all, including the most marginalized, “is a fundamental ethic of the SDG era”. Turning to capacity-building for vulnerable groups, she encouraged the forum to apply “a lens of inclusion and empowerment” to ensure that they “are put in the driver’s seat for SDG implementation”. Recalling that young people, particularly women and entrepreneurs, are at the forefront of SDG progress, the Deputy Secretary-General concluded: “Let’s make sure we listen carefully to their vision and draw inspiration from their determination and commitment to creating a better world”.

67-> UN launches drive to highlight environmental cost of staying fashionable
It takes around 7,500 litres of water to make a single pair of jeans,  equivalent to the amount of water the average person drinks over a period of seven years. That’s just one of the many startling facts to emerge from recent environmental research, which show that the cost of staying fashionable is a lot more than just the price tag. When we think of industries that are having a harmful effect on the environment, manufacturing, energy, transport and even food production might come to mind. But the fashion industry is considered by the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( ), to be the second most polluting industry in the world. According to , some 93 billion cubic metres of water - enough to meet the needs of five million people - is used by the fashion industry annually, and around half a million tons of microfibre, which is the equivalent of 3 million barrels of oil, is now being dumped into the ocean every year. As for carbon emissions, the industry is responsible for more than all international flights and maritime shipping combined. The dominant business model in the sector is that of “fast fashion”, whereby consumers are offered constantly changing collections at low prices, and encouraged to frequently buy and discard clothes. Many experts, including the UN, believe the trend is responsible for a plethora of negative social, economic and environmental impacts and, with clothing production doubling between 2000 and 2014, it is crucially important to ensure that clothes are produced as ethically and sustainably as possible. Innovating for sustainability Despite the grim statistics, producers and consumers of fashion are increasingly waking up to the idea that the industry needs to change. A number of companies, including large volume retailers, are integrating sustainability principles into their business strategies. Examples include the global clothing chain H&M, which has a garment collection scheme; jeans manufacturer Guess, which is involved in a wardrobe recycling programme; and outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which produces jackets using polyester from recycled bottles. Smaller companies are also helping change the environmental landscape of fashion and building sustainability into their whole business model. Among them are the Swiss firm Freitag, which upcycles truck tarpaulins, seat belts and seat belts to make bags and backpacks; Indosole, which makes shoes from discarded tyres; and Novel Supply, a Canadian clothing business, which has a “take-back scheme,” whereby customers can return their clothes when they are no longer wearable, so that the company can reuse and recycle them. The founder of Novel Supply, ,, won a Young Champions of the Earth award, the UN’s highest environmental honour, in recognition of her attempts to create a production model that involves using environmentally-friendly materials, and finding solutions for waste created during the manufacturing process. In this video she explains how every element of her company’s production process is geared towards minimising waste and damage to the environment.  The UN’s role in cleaning up the fashion industry If we carry on with a business-as-usual approach, the greenhouse gas emissions from the industry are expected to rise by almost 50% by 2030  In a bid to halt the fashion industry’s environmentally and socially destructive practices, and harness the catwalk as a driver to improve the world’s ecosystems, 10 different United Nations organizations established the , launched during the 2019 , which took place in Nairobi in March. , Head of the Consumption and Production Unit at the UN Environment Programme ( ), one of the 10 UN bodies involved in the Alliance, explained the urgency behind its formation: “The global production of clothing and footwear generates 8% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and, with manufacturing concentrated in Asia, the industry is mainly reliant on hard coal and natural gas to generate electricity and heat. If we carry on with a business-as-usual approach, the greenhouse gas emissions from the industry are expected to rise by almost 50% by 2030.” The power of influencers British artist and environmental activist Elle L was one of the speakers at the launch, and she told UN News that she agrees that fast-fashion was the biggest obstacle to sustainability: “there’s a real pressure to buy, and there are no brake pads to slow over-production and over-consumption. We need better labelling, so that people know what they’re buying; a tax or a ban on synthetic fibres which are causing serious environmental damage and contributing to a micro-plastics crisis; and a shift in mindset regarding over-production and over-consumption.” Increasingly, and particularly over the last 10 years, it is social media ‘influencers’ like Lucia Musau, an award-winning fashion and lifestyle blogger based in Kenya, who are effectively spreading the kind of messages that can help highlight the negative consequences of fast fashion. UN News spoke to Lucia whilst she was taking part in talks about sustainable fashion at the UN Environment Assembly, and she agreed that, over time, she has become a voice to be reckoned with, advising people on trends and influencing what they buy: “As global citizens we have a big role to play. We’re becoming more conscious about the fashion we consume, and gone are the days when you could just buy something because it’s trendy. If a Kenyan designer wants me to promote them, I want to know exactly how they produce the clothes,” said the blogger, who’s also supporting the new UN alliance. As consumers become more aware, the industry will have no choice but to adapt to their needs,” she said. Less is more Despite the moves being made by some retailers to make the industry less harmful to the environment, it can be argued that, ultimately, the only way to really make fashion sustainable is to end the throwaway culture.  Not only is the average person buying 60 per cent more items of clothing than they did 15 years ago but, according to the McKinsey 2019 State of Fashion report, they are only keeping them as half as long as they used to. says that promoting a change in consumption modes, through actions such as taking better care of clothes, recycling and “take-back” programs, can make a major impact, and that simply doubling the time that we use each item of clothing could halve the fashion industry’s greenhouse gas emissions. However, for this to happen, both retailers and consumers will have to reject the “take, make and dispose” model and agree that, for the sake of the planet, when it comes to fashion, less is more.

68-> At COP24, countries agree concrete way forward to bring the Paris climate deal to life
After two weeks of crunch negotiations – with overtime – the almost 200 parties gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the United Nations two-week climate change conference, on Saturday a “robust” set of implementing guidelines for the landmark 2015 , aimed at keeping global warming well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. Following several sleepless nights, cheers and applause welcomed the President, Michal Kurtyka, as he opened the conference’s closing plenary meeting, which had been postponed close to a dozen times. He thanked the hundreds of delegates in the room for their “patience”, noting that the last night “was a long night”. General laughter followed when the room’s big screens showed a delegate yawning whole-heartedly; the meeting had been set to wrap up on Friday. “Katowice has shown once more the resilience of the – our solid roadmap for climate action,” said Patricia Espinosa, who heads the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  ( ) secretariat and who was speaking on behalf of António Guterres, the UN Secretary-General. Mr. Guterres, who has made addressing the impacts of climate change one of the top priorities of his term as UN Secretary-General, came three times to Katowice in the past two weeks to support the negotiations but, given the repeated delays, was forced to leave before the closing plenary, due to prior engagements. The adopted guidelines package, called the “rulebook” by some, is designed to encourage greater climate action ambition and benefit people from all walks of life, especially the most vulnerable. Trust and climate action financing One of the key components of the ‘Katowice package’ is a detailed transparency framework, meant to promote trust among nations regarding the fact that they are all doing their part in addressing climate change. It sets out how countries will provide information about their national action plans, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures. An agreement was reached on how to uniformly count greenhouse gas emissions and if poorer countries feel they cannot meet the standards set, they can explain why and present a plan to build up their capacity in that regard. On the thorny question of financing from developed countries in support of climate action in developing countries, the document sets a way to decide on new, more ambitious targets from 2025 onwards, from the current commitment to mobilize US$100 billion per year as of 2020. Another notable achievement of these negotiations is that nations agreed on how to collectively assess the effectiveness of climate action in 2023, and how to monitor and report progress on the development and transfer of technology. “The guidelines that delegations have been working on day and night are balanced and clearly reflect how responsibilities are distributed amongst the world’s nations,” said Ms. Espinosa in a press statement. “They incorporate the fact that countries have different capabilities and economic and social realities at home, while providing the foundation for ever increasing ambition.” “While some details will need to be finalised and improved over time, the system is to the largest part place,” she added. Article 6: the one major matter nations couldn’t find consensus on Ultimately, the negotiations tripped on one key issue which will be back on the table at the next UN climate change conference, COP25, set to take place in Chile. This is the matter known in specialized circles as “Article 6,” regarding the so-called “market mechanisms” which allow countries to meet a part of their domestic mitigation goals. This is done for example through “carbon markets” –  or “carbon trading”, which enables countries to trade their emissions allowances. The Paris Agreement recognizes the need for global rules on this matter to safeguard the integrity of all countries’ efforts and ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition - UN chief António Guterres “From the beginning of the COP, it very quickly became clear that this was one area that still required much work and that the details to operationalize this part of the Paris Agreement had not yet been sufficiently explored”, explained Ms. Espinosa, noting that the majority of countries were willing to agree and include the guidelines on market mechanisms but that “unfortunately, in the end, the differences could not be overcome”. Other key COP24 achievements In addition to the political negotiations among Member States on the Paris guidelines, over the past two weeks, the hallways of COP24 buzzed with close to 28,000 participants having lively exchanges, sharing innovative ideas, attending cultural events, and building partnerships for cross-sectoral and collaborative efforts. Many encouraging announcements, especially on financial commitments for climate action, were made: Germany and Norway pledged that they would double their contributions to the Green Climate Fund, established to enable developing countries to act;  the World Bank also announced it would increase its commitment to climate action after 2021 to $200 billion; the climate Adaptation Fund received a total of $129 million. The private sector overall, showed strong engagement. Among the highlights of this COP, two major industries – the sports and the fashion worlds – joined the movement to align their business practices with the goals of the Paris Agreement, through the launch of the Sports for Climate Action Framework, and the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. Many more commitments were made, and concrete, inspiring actions were taken. “From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition,” said Patricia Espinosa on behalf of UN chief at the closing planery. “Ambition in mitigation. Ambition in adaptation. Ambition in finance. Ambition in technical cooperation and capacity building. Ambition in technological innovation.” To achieve this, the UN Secretary-General is convening a on 23 September, at UN Headquarters in New York, to engage Governments at the highest levels.

69-> Dump fuel-hungry AC units to cut years of emissions and save trillions: UN report
A wholesale switch to efficient, “climate-friendly” appliances could make a huge dent in environmentally harmful emissions, says a new UN report released on Friday. Access to cooling is essential to maintaining healthy communities, helping to keep food fresh, and economies productive. It has added importance during the current pandemic, making lockdown bearable during periods of hot weather. However, many air-conditioning units emit carbon dioxide, black carbon and Hydrofluorocarbons (which have thousands of times the warming potential of carbon dioxide), and increasing demand for cooling is contributing significantly to climate change. An efficient solution The , from the United Nations Environment Programme ( ) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), shows that up to 460 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions – roughly the amount produced over an eight-year period – could be cut over the next four decades by making air conditioners twice as efficient as they are now: by 2050, it would be possible to save the amount of electricity produced by all the coal-fired power stations in China and India in 2018, saving up to $2.9 trillion. This action would make a significant contribution towards getting on track to limiting the overall global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which is critical to minimizing the disastrous impacts of climate change, says the study. Nations should seriously consider the move, as they plan their economic recovery from the pandemic, said Inger Andersen, the Executive-Director of UNEP: “they have an opportunity to use their resources wisely to reduce climate change, protect nature and reduce risks of further pandemics. Efficient, climate-friendly cooling can help to achieve all of these goals”. Some cool options The report notes that countries already have several options at their disposal, to make this possible. Signatories to the to the landmark Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, for example, have agreed to reduce the use of Hydrofluorocarbons. National Cooling Action Plans can accelerate the transition to climate friendly cooling, and identify opportunities to make efficient cooling a way to meet their commitments to the 2015 Paris climate accords. Other options available include implementing minimum energy performance standards, introducing building codes that ensure homes and offices are well insulated and require less cooling, and making temperature-controlled food supply chains more efficient and sustainable. The peer-reviewed report was authored by a range of experts under the guidance of a 15-member steering committee co-chaired by Mexican chemist and Nobel laureate Mario Molina, who played a key role in discovering the Antarctic ozone hole, and Durwood Zaelke, an American pioneer of environmental law.

70-> First Person: Looking to the skies to understand the climate crisis
Could studying the cosmos help us to fight the climate crisis? Two astronomers at the University of Hawaii think that knowledge of the solar system may help to slow down the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. John Tonry: I really like big questions; like, where did the universe come from and where is it going? One way to continue answering those types of questions was to create this asteroid survey. Our job is to track asteroid hazards and calculate if and when they will hit Earth. We have the technology to measure these events beautifully. The chances of being hit by an asteroid in the next year is very small, but in the next 100 years, it’s not so small and that could result in many deaths. So, we see an asteroid strike as a low probability but high consequence event. Ari Heinz: While most of our surveys focus on larger asteroids that we can see decades, or even a century, before they hit Earth, ATLAS focuses on smaller asteroids, which wouldn't cause global devastation, but which could destroy a city, and which we can only detect when they are close to Earth. If ATLAS discovers that kind of asteroid, then we would treat it like, for example, a hurricane and advise a city or state to evacuate, because there's going to be a big explosion there. JT: 20 years ago, we couldn't purchase the computers we use nowadays, as they were hopelessly expensive. The cameras and telescopes that we're building now simply weren't possible even 10 years ago, and we have developed the software to match the hardware capabilities. AH: The threat of asteroids although small, certainly motivates me to be careful and try not to miss anything. There's a strange paradox here. We’re sort of laid back in the asteroid community, we're trying hard but we're not under a lot of stress in general, but then we understand that at any moment, we could suddenly be some of the most important people in the world for a short amount of time. JT: Astronomy can play an important role in understanding climate change.  It's possible that the sun actually goes through century-long cycles: it’s crucial to understand how the sun behaves, and we have just built a new telescope to look at its surface. The understanding of planetary atmospheres tells us an awful lot about how climate change can actually run away.  We can learn from other planets in the solar system where climate change went seriously wrong. Venus was driven to extreme heat by its atmosphere while Mars went the other way and cooled down and now needs a warming atmosphere. So, the understanding of planetary atmospheres tells us an awful lot about how climate change can actually run away. AH: In terms of the future, I see a lot of exciting developments with new telescopes being built and new space missions being launched. There are areas where we can certainly make huge strides forward, for example, asteroids and solar system exploration. Then there are big questions that are extremely interesting, but may be completely intractable. We have been trying to figure out what dark matter is for 50 years now.  We might find out tomorrow, but it's also possible that we'll never find out what it is. JT: Astronomers are in a good position to correct misconceptions about whether climate change is happening or not. The simple answer is “yes,” and that’s what I told my students 30 years ago. The only questions are really, how severe it will be, and how much it will cost to put right. The most important thing for the human race right now is that we absolutely need to deal with it. I think astronomers understand all of this very clearly, and we can also explain it pretty clearly.

71-> Women and girls deserve more protection in emergencies, UN rights council hears
The collective impact of climate change, COVID-19 and conflict mean that well over 200 million people will likely need humanitarian assistance by 2022, the UN’s deputy rights chief said on Monday. Nada Al-Nashif, , told the that the situation is especially worrying for women and girls. They face additional hardships from the pandemic – including sexual abuse - Ms. Al-Nashif warned, particularly those displaced by war. “Experience demonstrates that insecurity and displacement fuel increases in sexual and gender-based violence, as well as other crimes and human rights violations such as child, early and forced marriages, or denial of access to sexual and reproductive health services.” According to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), more than 212 million people may need humanitarian assistance by 2022. This year, it’s believed that nearly 168 million people are in need of such protection, representing around one in 45 people in the world, the highest figure in decades. At a discussion on how to improve accountability for women and girls in emergencies, the deputy rights chief urged Member States at the Geneva forum to consider adopting a new approach. Swift and thorough justice In addition to the current practice of ensuring criminal prosecution for abusers, she called for specific laws to be enacted that would prevent or eradicate a “continuum of human rights violations”, by addressing the root causes of the lack of accountability for women and girls. This was the only way to restore their full equality and rights in dignity, she said. Highlighting recent human rights Council investigations into Myanmar, Venezuela and South Sudan, Ms. Al-Nashif noted that all countries shared systemic discrimination against women and girls that enabled violations to persist. Failings from Myanmar to Venezuela In Myanmar, the on wide-ranging gender inequality and the denial of freedom of movement faced by ethnic Rohingya women and girls, including sexual and gender-based violence, the UN official said. It also found the denial of access to education, basic health care and other economic and social rights. Turning to Venezuela, the deputy rights chief pointed to a 2019 UN human rights office ( ) report that limited access to sexual and reproductive health services, “with zero contraceptives available in several cities, alongside severe restrictions on abortion”. The resulting high rates of teenage pregnancies “have been a major factor driving many girls to leave school”, Ms. Al-Nashif added, while preventable maternal mortality is also increasing, she said, with an estimated one in five maternal deaths linked to unsafe abortions. South Sudanese sorrow In South Sudan, where sexual violence has been a widespread and pervasive feature of the conflict since 2013, an into health care for victims of such abuse indicated that there was only one health facility per 10,000 people, and many did not have enough qualified personnel to treat survivors. “As a result, victims may only seek assistance when they develop serious medical conditions and, of course, stigmatization forces many to continue to suffer in silence,” the UN official added.

72-> COVID disruption will ‘pale in comparison’ if world fails to act on climate change, SDGs
The fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement and the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) “go hand in hand”, the UN chief told a major development bank conference on Thursday. “The decisions we make now will determine the course of the next 30 years and beyond: Emissions must fall by half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions no later than 2050 to reach the 1.5C goal”, said in his to the virtual . “If we fail to meet these goals, the disruption to economies, societies and people caused by will pale in comparison to what the climate crisis holds in store”. Mr. Guterres maintained that the world has a shared responsibility to redouble its efforts to recover from the economic and social crisis and “get on track” to achieve the SDGs and build a sustainable, inclusive and resilient future. Crises often create opportunities for major transformation. of the world, all gathered for the first time, commit to support the transformation of the global economy, in order to achieve the   “Global solidarity is imperative to defeat the virus and recover better”, he upheld. Encouraging signs The UN chief told participants he was encouraged by the growing number of countries committing to the net zero target. He noted that the European Union (EU) had pledged to become the first carbon-neutral bloc by 2050 and has aligned its COVID-19 recovery package with that objective. And 110 other countries, including the United Kingdom, Japan and Korea, have also made the pledge for 2050 while China is aiming for 2060. “This means that 50 per cent of the world’s Gross Domestic Product, and about 50 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions, are now covered by a net-zero commitment”, Mr. Guterres explained, adding that many cities and businesses are realizing the “we have no alternative, and because they recognize the opportunities that are there to be seized”. ‘Not there yet’ So far, however, no bold commitments have been made to finance the vehicles necessary for the SDGs. The UN chief noted that public development banks are “uniquely positioned to play a leading role”, by providing concessionary finance where it is most needed, and leveraging private funding. “This is essential to reboot our economies and put them firmly on the path to a carbon-neutral, sustainable future”, he attested. Key steps The Secretary-General outlined five measures to achieve these goals, beginning with aligning the mandates of public development banks with the SDGs and carbon neutrality commitments by 2050. “Invest…in just transition programmes, that will leave no one behind, including SDG bonds, and incorporate gender and sustainability in all instruments”, he said. Painting a picture of enormous demands for emergency funding with simplified approval processes, Mr. Guterres’ second point was to give priority to funding immediate relief measures, particularly on public health and food security. “Investments by public development banks have been shown to bring in more private finance instead of replacing it…[and] offer opportunities to improve governance and regulatory frameworks in the countries where they operate, providing certainty and bringing in much-needed capital”, he said. Thirdly, there is a need to dramatically increase public development finance for adaptation and resilience, particularly for the most vulnerable groups. “We need to invest massively in public health, food security and education for all; in empowering women, girls and the most vulnerable; in supporting productive investment and employment; in access to energy; and in promoting human rights in general”, the UN chief spelled out. Next, it was important to have transparency to ensure that both public and private finance supports the SDGs and the . “Work together to adopt norms, standards and certification mechanisms for sustainable finance”, he urged all countries. Finally, Mr. Guterres underscored the need for better data. “We need public development banks to invest in the data and statistics that strengthen the capacity of developing countries to make the decisions that are needed and…openly share their data with decision-makers for better, coordinated action”, he elaborated. The UN chief told the participants that their decisions will “send a signal to the global financial community and to policy makers around the world”, transform development finance and “help build the foundations of a new economy fit for the 21st century”.

73-> Climate Action Superheroes empower children to protect the planet
Eight new animated characters on a mission to protect the planet, have been pressed into service by the UN to empower children worldwide and boost the drive towards sustainability by 2030. The are the face of a new campaign, to be launched on UN social media platforms this Saturday, aimed at mobilizing children under 12 to recycle and to save water and energy. “We want children to be aware of the difference they can make through everyday actions”, said Nanette Braun, Director of Campaigns in the , which is also home to . “Lifelong behaviours are shaped at an early age and we hope that providing the knowledge and tools to help build a more sustainable future will have lasting impact.” The rainbow of quirky superheroes is armed with advice on the steps youngsters can take towards meaningful action for themselves, and their families. They include the Energy Expert, Recycle Ranger, Green Guide and Water Wizard, who will engage children, and parents, in fun missions on topics such as reducing single-use plastic, saving energy and conserving water. Safe and sustainable style Take the , a seagreen-coloured titan taking on the global textile industry, which produces more than eight per cent of greenhouse gases and 20 per cent of global wastewater annually. The character shows how being stylish does not have to be wasteful by donating used clothing and mending items, thus giving them new life. Since superheroes wear masks, especially in the era, their “mission” includes making your own facemask, preferably from recycled fabric. Talking truth, telling facts Related to this is the , who “has the facts about climate change and tells others about it.”  The red-coloured character is also concerned about how best we can all communicate during this unprecedented period of global pandemic. Truth Talker encourages children to find out the facts and share them with their friends, thus helping to counter misinformation. As an anti-bullying crusader, the superhero encourages children to report online bullies and to speak up against any type of discrimination. But in order to tell others about the truth, you first need to learn what the truth is, the character advises. Children can take a simple quiz to test their knowledge about climate change, with answers and explanations provided. Join the squad, change the future Children and their parents can learn about the superheroes and their many missions through a colourful, animated world on the UN website. The campaign concept was developed by students at Parsons School of Design, part of The New School, a prestigious university in New York City, home to UN Headquarters. They are in a global executive master’s programme which has a focus on leading creative change.  They worked with the UN to brainstorm new ways of engaging the public on the ( ). The 17 SDGs provide a blueprint for achieving a better, more sustainable future, through addressing extreme poverty, inequality, climate change, justice, gender equality and other global challenges. Their deadline is 2030. The students felt a children’s campaign would have the greatest impact towards driving long-term, transformative change. “With climate change causing ever greater harm to people and the planet, the students were eager to take on this urgent topic”, said Melissa Rancourt, Academic Director for the Global Executive Master of Science in Strategic Design and Management at The New School. “By engaging children, we target the consumers and decision-makers of the future, who will drive the change the world needs.” ActNow for a better tomorrow The Climate Action Superheroes are a component of the UN’s ongoing campaign, a call for individual action on sustainability, launched in December 2018. So far, nearly one million climate actions have been logged through the campaign’s chat bot and mobile app, with a growing number of people making climate action an integral part of their daily life.

74-> Restore land to save the planet, boost the economy, says head of UN body combating desertification
Investing in land restoration could not only help keep our planet healthy, but also be the starting point for resolving some of the biggest issues of our time, the head of the UN entity tackling desertification told journalists on Friday via video conference, from the ongoing on the issue, underway in India’s capital. Put concisely, we must “invest in land restoration as a way of improving livelihoods, reducing vulnerabilities contributing to climate change, and reducing risks for the economy,” Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification said, speaking on the sidelines of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties, in New Delhi. The COP14 summit, which runs through 13 September, hosts ministers, scientists, government representatives, non-governmental organizations, and various community groups from 196 countries, in the hope of agreeing new actions to boost land fertility. Today at , we focus on sand and dust storms, a phenomena severely & increasingly affecting 151 countries- areas in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. It is a global  “Land is providing us with 99.7 per cent of the food we eat,” Mr. Thiaw shared in his remarks, “It is also providing us with water we drink - the quality of the water we get is coming from land and its ecosystems,” but, he added, the precious resource is in serious jeopardy. Last year, 25 countries called for emergency measures following widespread drought, Mr. Thiaw said, and on average, 70 countries are affected by droughts per year. Often the poorest communities are those who bear the brunt; facing depletion of resources and left relying on humanitarian aid. Land degradation also “has connections with peace and security,” he added, forcing communities to compete for access to land and water, and in some cases, spiralling into conflict. As the phenomenon of desertification intensifies, a thirsty planet has given rise to forced migration, rising pressures on fertile soil, food insecurity, and financial burdens. “It is estimated that desertification alone “is generating a loss between 10 and 17 per cent of the global GDP,” Mr. Thiaw lamented. Poor land health combined with biodiversity loss - exacerbated by the effects of climate change - has given birth to environmental shifts that could force up to 700 million people to migrate by 2050, the UNCCD calculates. The Conference is expected to agree on about 30 decisions in a bid to ensure the Convention’s goals for 2018-2030 are achieved, as outlined in the Convention’s Strategic Framework—the most comprehensive commitment to achieve Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). Parties in attendance will adopt a land degradation declaration to be presented at the upcoming on 23 September, which will highlight land restoration as part of the solution in combating the climate change scourge. ­

75-> FROM THE FIELD: Protection among the mangroves
The rehabilitation and replanting of mangrove forests in Cuba’s coastal regions is helping to protect the lives of people living on the Caribbean island, and reduce the effects of climate change, thanks to a UN Development Programme project. Mangroves not only provide a habitat for fish and other sea life that local communities eat, but also reduce the effects of rising tides and extreme weather that will become more intense with climate change. In Cuba, the loss and damage over several decades to mangroves, which are typically found on 70 per cent of its coasts, has made coastal communities increasingly vulnerable.

77-> Make COVID recovery ‘a true turning point’ for people and planet, Guterres urges, calling for concerted action by G20
UN has called on governments to incorporate “meaningful” climate action in all aspects of recovery from the global pandemic. Addressing ministers at a virtual meeting on sustainable recovery from on Thursday, the UN chief said that the world is confronting two urgent crises: COVID-19 and climate change. “Let us tackle both and leave future generations with the hope that this moment is a true turning point for people and planet,” he said, in a video . The ministerial meeting, convened by the Government of Japan, saw the participation of senior officials from several countries, as well as representatives from youth groups, civil society organizations, businesses and local governments. In parallel, an online portal that showcases climate and environment policies and actions in recovery from COVID-19 was launched. The will help build momentum for COP26, the UN conference that assesses progress in dealing with climate change, to be held in 2021. Renewables cheaper and more efficient The Secretary-General six climate-positive actions for a sustainable recovery, including investing in green jobs; not bailing out polluting industries; ending fossil fuel subsidies; accounting for climate risk in all financial and policy decisions; working together; and – most important – leaving no one behind. There is simply no rational case for coal power in any investment plan  Mr. Guterres spoke of governments and businesses shifting towards them, realizing that clean energy brings more jobs, cleaner air, better health and stronger economic growth. “The world’s top investors – including some in Japan – are abandoning fossil fuels because renewables are cheaper and more efficient”, he continued, adding: “They understand that it makes no economic sense to burn money on coal plants that will soon become stranded assets.” The UN chief also called on all countries, especially member of the G20 - the group of top industrialized nations - to commit to to carbon neutrally before 2050. He  urged them to submit “more ambitious” (NDCs) and long-term strategies before COP26 aligned with the goal to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius. Japan can be a world leader Recognizing Japan’s technological development in many fields, the Secretary-General said the country can become a world leader on the sustainable and resilient recovery. He called on Japan to stop investing in coal power plants and increase its share of renewables. “I sincerely hope Japan will end external financing of coal power plants, commit to carbon neutrality before 2050, set an early phase-out transition for domestic coal use and significantly increase the share of renewable energy,” said Mr. Guterres. A window of opportunity Also speaking at the meeting, Patricia Espinosa, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) Executive Secretary, said that the convergence of COVID-19 and the climate crisis has provided a window of opportunity, to not only recover from the pandemic but also to build a better future. She called on governments to move away from new carbon intensive infrastructures. Doing so would help bring down emissions for decades to come. We are at a true turning point for people and planet. I urge all countries, especially G20 members, to commit to carbon neutrally before 2050, and to submit more ambitious strategies ahead of .  “Preventing the spread of has been the most effective approach to the pandemic, so preventing future emissions is the most effective approach to address climate change,” she said. Highlighting the importance of a coordinated global effort, she urged everyone to “embrace the strength of multilateralism” to recover from COVID-19, make progress on climate change agenda, and build a more sustainable future. Speaking to an emergency meeting of G20 foreign ministers on the COVID crisis, Mr. Guterres noted the pandemic has forced “unprecedented lockdowns, travel suspensions and limited movement across borders”, adding that “concerns are growing that some of the current movement restrictions could outlast the immediate crisis.” He flagged “five focus areas” for the discussion, urging first that they seek agreement on common objective criteria in relation to the removal of travel restrictions, based on scientific evidence. Second, the UN chief called for “investments on systems and practices that support safe travel – in close coordination with the private sector. Thirdly, he called for better coordination in preventive measures – “in particular more systematic use of testing and tracing and other proven actions to avoid the spread of the virus and allow for effective control of the potential impacts of increased mobility.” Next, he highlighted the importance of full respect for international human rights and refugee law, and also called for agreement that future vaccines will be considered a global public good to be “available and affordable everywhere, supporting global health, global mobility and global economic recovery. “All actions must recognize upholding human dignity as the guiding principle for cross-border policies.” One direction, together He said there was “a long way to go” on two key fronts: “First, in our capacity to fight the pandemic together. We have seen the results when each country pursues its own strategy, with the advice of the World Health Organization ( ) being largely disregarded. “When countries go in different directions, the virus goes in every direction”, he added. “Second, we still lack effective international solidarity to respond to the economic and social impacts and the underlying fragilities exposed by the pandemic.” He said more than ever, effective international solidarity was key – “and concerted G20 action – to advance these priority areas and build a more inclusive, resilient and sustainable world for all.”

78-> UN builds momentum for restoring forests as world enters key decade for ecosystems
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is leading a push for the world to scale up efforts to restore landscapes and forests over the next decade, with eyes on a target to salvage 350 million hectares of degraded and deforested lands, an area bigger than India in total. The world has made considerable progress in the past decade, according to the new edition of 's international forestry journal Unasylva, entitled , since 63 countries, subnational governments and private organisations have already committed to restoring 173 million hectares, and regional responses are making significant advances in Africa and Latin America. Meet the challenge The goal is to meet the “Bonn Challenge” - the world’s largest voluntary forest landscape restoration initiative, which was launched in 2011. It is a global target to bring 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested lands into restoration by 2020 and 350 million by 2030. “Societies worldwide will need to be convinced of the global restoration imperative by rational economic argument, compassion for current and future generations, and an emotional connection to nature”, according to the authors of one article in the journal. The Unasylva issue looks at prospects for meeting the Bonn Challenge and mechanisms for measuring and accelerating progress, and examines work going on in China, Kenya, Brazil, Madagascar, Cambodia and Sao Tome and Principe. It also discusses how restoration work can be scaled up, including various initiatives that are underway to increase funding and boost local stakeholders and technical assistance. Enormous potential “These have enormous potential to be mainstreamed because of their cost-effectiveness, adaptability, applicability to many ecosystems and contexts, and ease of implementation”, the opening editorial in Unasylva said. Next year sees the start of the United Nations ,  a rallying call for the protection and revival of ecosystems all around the world, which runs from 2021 until the deadline for the (SDGs) in 2030. “There is a great opportunity for the Bonn Challenge process and its contributing regional platforms to provide a model for aspiring actors to embrace or reinforce restoration efforts in other ecosystems, such as wetlands and coral reefs,” senior officials at the  International Union for Conservation of Nature wrote in one of the articles in Unasylva.

79-> Youth activist speaks up for environmental protection at Human Rights Council
At the UN on Wednesday, a teenager from Côte d’Ivoire has explained why protecting the environment matters so much. The rare and refreshing intervention came from 14-year-old activist Junior, who spoke out against alleged industrial pollution, including from the cocoa production sector, in his home town of San-Pédro, in the West African State. At the child rights debate, Member States also heard from UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, , who warned that environmental harm severely affects “the youngest children, indigenous children and those from low-income and marginalized communities”. I want the authorities to take this question of the environment to heart. Because we children are suffering a lot –  This damage was being done, despite the fact that the effects of environmental degradation on children and their rights were “completely preventable”, Ms. Bachelet insisted. At the same time, the High Commissioner warned that over-exploitation of the environment “increases the risk of infectious diseases like jumping from animal to human hosts”. She also insisted that now was a key opportunity to discuss the rights of the child in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as 93 per cent of children live in environments where air pollution exceeds World Health Organization ( ) guidelines, making them more susceptible to air-borne infections, such as the new . Echoing that concern, Junior explained that children made up between 30-40 per cent of those suffering from respiratory and skin diseases, according to data from his town’s health authority. “I want the authorities to take this question of the environment to heart. Because we children are suffering a lot,” he said via video message. “If nothing is done to protect the environment, then all your (the Council’s) efforts to realize children’s rights will be burned by the sun and drowned by the rain.” Also participating in the debate, at the Council, WHO’s Dr Maria Neira said that one in four children globally is dying because of environmental factors, at home or elsewhere, and 570,000 children under five, are dying from respiratory infections every year. In recent years, many children and young people have joined and strengthened the worldwide struggle for protection of the environment and realisation of climate justice – tells . 📺 Watch the annual session on :  These include pneumonia, which is attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution, and second-hand smoke, said the head of the agency’s environment, climate change and health unit. Other common killers include poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene, with diarrhoea responsible for the deaths of 297,000 under-fives. By 2025, half of the world’s population will be living in water-stressed areas, Dr Neira warned. This is already a problem in least developed countries, where one in five health care facilities lacks water, sanitation service and waste management. Turning to climate change, the WHO senior official added that as temperatures and levels of carbon dioxide rise, this promotes pollen growth, which is associated with increased rates of asthma in children. “We have been listening to the children marching and demanding we protect their future,” she said. “We no longer need to raise awareness; we need to act. Many in our audience are uniquely positioned to provide a leverage for these new greener healthier society to happen.”

80-> ‘We may be small islands, but no man is an island’, Papua New Guinea youth tells world leaders
“All of us from small islands can relate to the word’s perception of us, as small islands”, but rather than treating them as distant vessels, imagine instead “an undivided Pacific, connected by an ocean highway.” That was the plea to world leaders from Vinzealhar Ainjo Kwangin Nen, on Friday, speaking on behalf of her generation, on the front line of climate change. Small island nations 🏝️ share a unique set of challenges due to their size & remoteness. While they emit the least carbon, they suffer the worst effects of climate change. Today at , the world will address their challenges 👉    The young advocate from the island nation of Papua New Guinea, painted a vivid picture of the dangers for delegates on Friday, during the last major summit of the UN’s high level week, dedicated to looking at the progress and pitfalls facing Small Island Developing States (SIDS) as the world warms, and the seas rise. Speaking from the Hall podium, she offered a personal view in poetic form, of the struggles she is dealing with: “I am a youth of a small island, when in a global community, most everyone doesn’t know where I am. And what hurts the most, is I know where they all are”. Testimonies like Ms. Nen’s received a warm welcome during the event, geared towards addressing climate and development issues unique to island states, and assessing the implementation of priorities laid out in a 2014 mandate, to accelerate SIDS development. The Small Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities of Action - or Pathway, was agreed in September 2014, during the to focus the world’s attention on islands’ special development roles and particular vulnerabilities. As world leaders gathered for a mid-term review on the plan’s implementation, five years form its adoption, they conceded that progress toward sustainable development for SIDS require a major increase in urgent investment, and the road to stability for many island nations is threatened by amplified environmental challenges, economic crises, food security, and others. While some progress has been made in addressing social inclusion, gender equality, poverty and unemployment, inequality continues to affect vulnerable groups, and devastating effects of climate change cause lasting loss of life and property. Putting the plan into action represents “an important chance for the international community to demonstrate solidarity”, stressed. “Small Island Developing States are a special case for sustainable development. They require the concerted long-term attention and investment of the entire international community”, . Following in line for comment, President Michael Higgins of Ireland, which sponsored the event, emphasized that “we cannot allow our words in one compartment to be contradictory to another. There must be consistency across the architecture and delivery, most of all the words must be followed by action.” “This is not academic, this is about life,” he added, highlighting that for island nations “the word ‘disaster’ has a different meaning…as it is a disaster that will come again and again, and therefore response must take account of the danger of recurrence.” The day-long review comes one month after Hurricane Dorian devastated parts of the Bahamas, adding to the increasing frequency, scale and intensity of natural disasters and their unique threat to island nations and their people. Keynote speaker and leading Hollywood actor, Jason Momoa said, “I am standing here today because I am ashamed that not all leaders have wanted agreement”, referring the groundbreaking pledge to limit the globe from warming beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius. “I have seen how one place can be oblivious to another…with a foothold in two worlds, I began to see how a problem for one can become a problem for all,” said the star of the Aquaman superhero movie, speaking to his background as Hawaiian-born, and Iowa-raised. A political declaration is expected to come at the summit’s conclusion, a concise action-oriented agreement to further propel the SAMOA pathway’s integration which will require the international community’s support.

81-> Millions of Bangladeshi children at risk from climate crisis, warns UNICEF
More than 19 million children in Bangladesh are at risk from devastating floods, cyclones and other environmental disasters linked to climate change, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned on Friday in a new report. According to the study - - the country’s flat topography, dense population and weak infrastructure make it “uniquely vulnerable to the powerful and unpredictable forces that climate change is compounding”. The threat is felt from the flood and drought-prone lowlands in the country’s north, to its storm-ravaged coastline along the Bay of Bengal, it explains. Today, around 12 million of the 19.4 million children most affected by climate change live in and around the powerful river systems which flow through Bangladesh and regularly burst their banks. “The danger that is represented by flooding is extreme and it is almost on an annual basis,” Mr. Ingram said. “The last major floods to hit Bangladesh were in 2017 when something like eight million people were affected by a series of flooding events that took place.” The major flooding of the Brahmaputra River described by Mr. Ingram inundated at least 480 community health clinics and damaged some 50,000 wells, which are essential for meeting communities’ safe water needs. “This had an enormous effect not just in terms of displacing families and pushing them out of their homes,” Mr. Ingram said, in addition to the “destruction that it caused to health facilities and to basic services like water and sanitation”.  In addition to at-risk communities living close to rivers, another 4.5 million children who live in coastal areas are regularly struck by powerful cyclones. This includes almost half a million Rohingya refugee children who began fleeing neighbouring Myanmar in August 2017, and who now live in bamboo and plastic shelters, ’s report explains, noting that a further three million children live further inland, where farming communities suffer increasing periods of drought. There are already something like six million climate refugees in Bangladeshi cities and that number is growing fast  Rising sea levels and unchecked salt water intrusion are also a serious threat to pregnant women, according to the UNICEF report, which underlines the link between high salinity in drinking water and an increased risk of grave medical conditions including preeclampsia and hypertension, identified among mothers-to-be at the coast. One of the consequences of the country’s long struggle with the elements is a spike in the number of families leaving rural areas and heading for major cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong, where children’s rights are frequently violated. “There are already something like six million climate refugees in Bangladeshi cities and that number is growing fast,” Mr. Ingram said. He described “brutal surroundings” where children “are forced to essentially fend for themselves, while many children are “pushed into very hazardous forms of child labour. Many girls who end up being pushed into taking early marriages because their families can no longer look after them. And there are other girls that also end up in what is clearly a flourishing and expanding sex trade in the cities.”  Highlighting the resilience of Bangladesh’s poorest communities who are those most at risk from the “deepening” climate threat, the UNICEF official noted that more than 1,500 youth activists in the south of the country are increasingly involved in raising awareness about the climate crisis. Working in coastal and climate-vulnerable regions across the country, members of YouthNet spread messages on disaster preparedness, water and sanitation, menstrual hygiene, gender-based violence and child marriage. “We wonder how on earth they can survive, and yet there is the sense also that society is pulling together,” Mr. Ingram said. “They have really learned a lot over the term of their last climate change strategy which the Government instituted in 2009, and which is now being renewed.”

82-> Women are key to response and recovery out of the COVID era: Deputy UN chief
Young women are fighting interconnected battles for “environmental, economic and racial justice”, the deputy UN chief said in a discussion on Thursday. UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed the second of a series of roundtable discussions with renowned women economists that she was honoured to witness the bold ideas put forward by “a generation that is confronted by a world increasingly characterized by closure, rather than openness, xenophobia, rather than tolerance, vulnerability, rather than security, and, above all, a world haunted by the existential threat of climate change”. We are off and running SG's Roundtable with Young Women Economists is focused on tangible & bold solutions to two issues facing world today: and in times . Join us live  Failure without women While acknowledging the unfairness of their having to shoulder burdens that they did not create, she pointed out that “status, country, and identity markers” that one is born with, are “little more than a matter of chance”. “We require an intersectional lens” to overcome barriers, upheld the deputy UN chief, underscoring that “importantly”, any effort that does not involve women themselves, “will ultimately fail”. Generational voice Ms. Mohammed said that the young economists presented “concrete, tangible, and bold solutions to two pressing issues facing youth today” – namely job scarcity and climate change – calling it “a further reminder of the need for us to listen to the voices of this generation”. “They are not the next generation”, she continued, “they are the current generation and leaders, because it is in fact their world that we are building through our response and recovery to this crisis”. Noting the at the meeting next week and the High-Level discussions of the General Assembly that will follow, Ms. Mohammed maintained that it is “our job to do justice to these solutions and ensure that we propel them forward”. A silver lining The deputy UN chief highlighted a “unique moment” presented by COVID, one in which “stakeholders are willing to discuss the hard questions” as they relate to economic models and financial architecture where innovative solutions were once “relegated to the fringes of economic thought”. “This would not have been possible even a few months ago”, she flagged, urging everyone to capitalize on the moment and “reorient the global financial system to make it truly work for all”. Recognizing that systemic problems will continue to persist “unless significant action is taken”, she concluded her remarks by expressing confidence that “we are crafting the solutions we need for a more resilient, equal, inclusive and sustainable world as we overcome the crisis and achieve the ”. ‘Seismic shifts’ Meanwhile, in his opening video , noted that as the social and economic fallout from the pandemic grows “ever more severe”, and the longer-term structural consequences “increasingly evident”, COVID-19 induced “seismic shifts” requiring bold ideas and innovative solutions, “particularly from younger generations”. Recognizing that the impacts of the pandemic “have yet to be fully realized”, Mr. Guterres stressed the need to reskill young workers with the right abilities for the future economy. “These include investing in technology skills, human skills that can’t be replaced by automation, and those aligned with green jobs”, the UN chief detailed. Bold actions needed Turning to the climate emergency, the top UN official said, “we face an existential crisis that is getting worse by the day”. “We need polluters to pay for their pollution, an end to subsidies for fossil fuels and no new coal-fired power plants”, he spelled out, adding “we need bold actions that balance people, planet and prosperity”. “These must be central to strategies that will allow us to recover better”, concluded the Secretary-General.

83-> Environment and health at increasing risk from growing weight of ‘e-waste’
Around 50 million tonnes of electronic waste, or e-waste, is being thrown away each year, according to a new joint United Nations report – which exceeds the combined weight of all the commercial airliners ever made, or alternatively, enough Eiffel Towers to fill the whole of Manhattan. To highlight the rising challenge posed by mountains of discarded electronics worldwide, seven UN entities came together to launch the report at the in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, in a bid to offer some solutions to a behemoth-sized problem that is making the world sicker and adding to environmental degradation. The joint report, entitled, “A New Circular Vision for Electronics – Time for a Global Reboot”, calls for a new vision for e-waste based on the “circular economy” concept, whereby a regenerative system can minimize waste and energy leakage. “E-waste is a growing that poses a serious threat to the environment and human health worldwide”, said Stephan Sicars, Director of the Department of Environment at the UN Industrial Development Organization. “To minimize this threat, works with various UN agencies and other partners on a range of e-waste projects, all of which are underpinned by a circular economy approach”. According to the report, a deliberative process must be instilled to change the system – one that collaborates with major brands, small and medium-sized enterprises, academia, trade unions and civil society. Walking the talk “Thousands of tonnes of e-waste is disposed of by the world’s poorest workers in the worst of conditions, putting their health and lives at risk”, maintained Guy Ryder, Director-General, International Labour Organization ( ). “We need better e-waste strategies and green standards as well as closer collaboration between governments, employers and unions to make the circular economy work for both people and planet.” Despite growing e-waste, “A New Circular Vision” points to the importance of technologies from the so-called Internet of Things – a network of devices that contain electronics and the connectivity that allows them to exchange data – through to cloud computing advances, which can all result in smarter recycling and tracking of e-waste. “A circular economy brings with it tremendous environmental and economic benefits for us all” said Joyce Msuya, Acting Executive Director, UN Environment Programme (UN Environment). “Our planet’s survival will depend on how well we retain the value of products within the system by extending their life.” The report supports the work of the E-waste Coalition, which includes International Labour Organization ( ); International Telecommunication Union ( ); United Nations Environment Programme ( ); United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( ); United Nations Institute for Training and Research ( ); United Nations University ( ) and Secretariats of the Basel and Stockholm Conventions.

84-> Climate emergency: City mayors are 'world's first responders', says UN chief
City bosses are “the world’s first responders to the climate emergency” UN chief António Guterres declared on Friday, at an international mayors’ summit in Copenhagen. In his opening remarks to the C40 World Mayors Summit – a forum for member cities to present innovative actions to slow global warming – the Secretary-General noted that cities, which contain more than half the world’s population, and have an “enormous climate footprint”, are “on the frontlines of sustainable and inclusive development”. Urban citizens, he continued, look to mayors to make cities havens for diversity, social cohesion and job creation. Reminding delegates of the existential threat to humanity posed by the climate emergency, and the need to dramatically boost climate action at all levels, Mr. Guterres said that, at the UN in September, some 70 countries, and around 100 cities, announced plans to enhance their national plans to cut harmful emissions by 2020. However, some of the countries responsible for the biggest greenhouse gas emissions have not yet committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and, with business, cities and society moving faster than governments, the UN chief called on the urban leaders to continue putting pressure on national authorities to increase climate ambition. Cities, emphasised the UN chief, are at the heart of the race to reduce emissions, and the consequences of growth without climate-conscious planning will be profound. Mr. Guterres welcomed efforts currently undertaken by C40 member cities, such as promoting healthier, more climate-friendly diets, and curbing air pollution. The Secretary-General also highlighted the importance of a “just transition” to low carbon societies, where no one is left behind, to ensure that public opinion solidly supports the initiatives necessary for reaching carbon neutrality. This means implementing social policies that address the anxieties of those who could be detrimentally affected by climate action, such as those who work in the fossil fuel industry, and take their interests into account. The two-day summit began on Thursday, with a commitment by 14 member cities to implementing sustainable food policies that will address the climate emergency. The mayors of these major cities pledged to work with their citizens to achieve a “Planetary Health Diet” for all, by 2030, with balanced and nutritious food, reflective of the culture, geography, and demography of their citizens. Research commissioned by C40 in June 2019 shows that eating a sustainable diet and avoiding food waste could cut food-related greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60 per cent.

85-> ‘Stay the course together to emerge stronger’ from COVID-19 crisis: UN chief’s message to major sustainability forum
As a major United Nations forum prepares to assess progress towards a fairer future for people and the planet, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that each of the of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The (HLPF), which formally begins on Tuesday, is an annual stock-take of the world’s progress towards achieving the (SDGs). This year, senior government figures are meeting virtually, via video-conferencing software, to discuss and debate ways to tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges; from poverty, to climate change, peace and security, and gender equality. National plans in the spotlight Countries will have the opportunity to present their updated plans for making the 17 Goals a reality (known as Voluntary National Reviews), and several UN, and other intergovernmental bodies will also provide input to the discussions. The extent to which the pandemic has affected so many aspects of society, and the economy, is reflected in the 2020 programme: the theme of “building back better” after the pandemic is the background to many of the sessions over the major 10-day conference, covering such areas as poverty reduction, financing for developing countries, protecting the planet, and access to sustainable energy. A decade of action The Secretary-General’s latest on progress towards the SDGs, which will form the basis of discussions, notes that 2020 marks the beginning of a “decade of action and delivery for sustainable development”, during which the pace and scale at which the goals are achieved will be ramped up. The report notes that the global crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19, has had a major effect on these targets, with health systems overwhelmed, businesses shut down, and 1.6 billion students kept out of school; the poor and vulnerable have borne the brunt of the pandemic, and tens of millions are expected to experience extreme hunger and poverty. Focus on inequality and climate change The discussions held during the forum will also be informed by a second from the Secretary-General, which focuses on how to deliver the SDGs, in light of the pandemic. In it, the UN chief outlines two overarching themes: reducing inequality, by making economies more sustainable and just; and committing to “rapid and sustained” carbon dioxide reductions. The first theme is described as a key strategy to reduce global poverty. Progress towards reduction has slowed in recent years, and it is projected that in 2020 alone, the pandemic could lead to up to 49 million people falling into poverty. Improving income distribution, says the report, can make a major impact, not only in keeping people above the poverty line, but also in contributing to faster economic growth, as the poorest in society gain greater spending power. Reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, is essential if the international community’s goal of keeping an overall global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels is to be met. Policies and strategies currently in place, warns the report, do not go far enough, and there is a real risk of significantly overshooting the target. The Secretary-General declares, in the report, that ambitious and immediate climate action is the only viable pathway that limits climate change, whilst protecting people, livelihoods and natural ecosystems. Such action would also see a tangible net economic benefit, saving the global economy tens of trillions of dollars. The UN chief’s progress report highlights the importance of international cooperation and solidarity in recovering from the crisis, a “large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive multilateral response”, amounting to at least 10 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP). Mr. Guterres raises the prospect of a post-pandemic global economy that “builds back better”, with measures in place that reduce the risk of future crises and bring the world closer to achieving the . What is the HLPF?

86-> Reduce risk to avert ‘era of pandemics’, experts warn in new report
Unless there is a “seismic shift” in how countries collectively deal with infectious diseases, future pandemics will emerge more often, spread more rapidly, cause greater damage to the global economy and kill more people than COVID-19, international experts warned in a UN-backed report published on Thursday. Their stems from an urgent virtual workshop convened by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( ) to investigate the links between pandemic risk and the degradation of nature. It finds that risk is increasing rapidly, with more than five new diseases emerging in people every year, any one of which could potentially spark a pandemic. Human activity drives pandemic risk is at least the sixth global health pandemic since the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918, also known as the Spanish flu, the 22 experts said. They stressed that although the new disease has its origins in microbes carried by animals, like all pandemics, its emergence has been entirely driven by human activities. “There is no great mystery about the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic – or of any modern pandemic”, Dr. Peter Daszak, President of EcoHealth Alliance and Chair of the IPBES workshop. “The same human activities that drive climate change and biodiversity loss also drive pandemic risk through their impacts on our environment. Changes in the way we use land; the expansion and intensification of agriculture; and unsustainable trade, production and consumption disrupt nature and increase contact between wildlife.” Science proves risk can be lowered However, pandemic risk can be significantly lowered, the experts said, through greater conservation of protected areas, and other measures to reduce human activities that contribute to biodiversity loss. This will in turn reduce wildlife-livestock-human contact and help avert the spillover of new diseases. “The overwhelming scientific evidence points to a very positive conclusion”, said Dr. Daszak. “We have the increasing ability to prevent pandemics – but the way we are tackling them right now largely ignores that ability. Our approach has effectively stagnated – we still rely on attempts to contain and control diseases after they emerge, through vaccines and therapeutics. We can escape the era of pandemics, but this requires a much greater focus on prevention in addition to reaction.” The “business as usual” approach of relying on response to diseases after they emerge is a “slow and uncertain path”, the experts charged, and can also threaten biodiversity. Furthermore, they estimate that economic impacts are 100 times the estimated cost of prevention. ‘Escaping the era of pandemics’ The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( ) is an independent body comprising more than 130 member Governments. However, the report has not been discussed and accepted by the IPBES plenary and is not, therefore, an intergovernmental product.  It represents the expertise and evidence of the 22 experts who participated in the workshop. They said it is estimated that another 1.7 million unknown viruses currently exist in mammals and birds, up to 850,000 of which could potentially infect humans. “Escaping the era of pandemics is possible”, the experts said, but will require “a seismic shift” in approach, from reaction to prevention. Their recommendations include establishing a high-level intergovernmental council on pandemic prevention, to provide decision-makers with the best science and evidence on emerging diseases; and to evaluate the potential economic impacts.  Members would also coordinate the design of a global monitoring mechanism. Countries could also set mutually-agreed goals or targets under an international accord or agreement, with clear benefits for people, animals and the environment. The report also called for enabling changes to reduce the types of consumption, globalized agricultural expansion and trade that have led to pandemics, for example through taxes or levies on meat consumption, livestock production and other forms of high pandemic-risk activities.

87-> UN chief stresses need for greater speed to achieve carbon neutrality
Although more Governments and businesses are committing to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the world is still falling far short of that goal, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Monday in his latest push for a cleaner, greener future. The UN chief made the statement in a for the opening of the , part of a global campaign that mobilizes businesses, cities, regions and investors to support net zero carbon emissions, in line with the e. Mr. Guterres reported that so far, the European Union, Japan and the Republic of Korea, along with more than 110 other countries, have made the pledge, while China is set to join them by 2060. The pathways are designed to unleash the full potential of the Paris Agreement - at the opening of Race to Zero Dialogues that kicked off today. More:  Still far away “That means 50 per cent of the world’s GDP and half of global CO2 emissions are now covered by a net zero commitment. And the number of net-zero commitments from companies has more than doubled in the past year to over 1,100. Yet, we are still far from where we need to be,” he said. “Our goal is to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Today, we are still headed towards three degrees at least.” The Race To Zero dialogues are part of the lead-up to the anniversary of the on 12 December, and the Climate Ambition Summit to be held that day. The virtual gathering began on Monday, which would have marked the start of the latest UN climate change conference, known as which had to be re-scheduled to next year due to the pandemic. “The postponement highlights the disruption the COVID-19 pandemic has caused. And these dialogues highlight that climate action is more urgent than ever as we work to recover from the effects of the pandemic,” the Secretary-General remarked. Ambition and action The Race To Zero Dialogues are being held online, and across multiple time zones, over the next 10 days, with more than 100 virtual events scheduled. Sessions are organized under different daily themes, covering key sectors including transport, health, energy, industry, oceans and water, and food systems. The Secretary-General issued a call to participants, underlining the need for ambition and action. “I urge you and the members of the different coalitions you are part of to promote, develop and implement credible decarbonization plans,” he said. “Bring your supply chain and partners on board in time for the Climate Ambition Summit I am co-hosting on December 12 – the five-year anniversary of the Paris Agreement.” Need for speed The UN chief commended the dialogues for being an example of the collaboration needed to address climate change, stating that “We are moving in the right direction, but we need greater speed.” However, he warned that “the window of opportunity is closing.” Mr. Guterres stressed that all Governments, cities, financial institutions and the private sector must establish transition plans for net zero emissions. “We need everyone to commit to carbon neutrality by 2050, and to take climate action that will benefit people and the planet,” he said.

88-> COP24 negotiations: Why reaching agreement on climate action is so complex
From Tuesday on, close to 100 Government ministers are due be involved in negotiating a final deal on moving forward with climate action here at the United Nations conference in Poland. So, what is the goal? To agree a concrete plan to implement the by mid-century. The stakes are high with numerous different pressure points. “We cannot fail in Katowice,” UN in the opening ceremony, on 3 December. A sentiment echoed by the President of , Michał Kurtyka, who stated: “Without success in Katowice, there is no success in Paris.” In the French capital, three years ago, countries agreed to do everything they could to keep global temperature rises to well under 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and as close as possible to 1.5°C. Now, in Katowice, Poland – with 2018 chosen by the parties themselves as the deadline for the adoption of implementation guidelines or a “work programme” to move forward with – the 197 parties of the UN Climate Chance Convention ( ) are gathered to agree on they will achieve the Paris commitments collectively, build trust among each nation, and bring the 2015 agreement to life. “Some might say that it will be a difficult negotiation. I know it is not easy. It requires a firm political will for compromise,” said Mr. Guterres during the opening ceremony. “But, for me, what is really difficult is to be a fisherman in Kiribati seeing his country at risk of disappearing, or a farmer or herder in the Sahel losing livelihoods and losing peace. Or being a woman in Dominica or any other Caribbean nation, enduring hurricane after hurricane destroying everything in its path.” Historically, multilateral climate negotiations have been difficult, as countries often attempt to protect their national interests, including economic ones. That is why the commitments made in Paris were hailed as groundbreaking in many ways. In addition to the 2°C/1.5°C target, the deal included commitments to: ramp up financing for climate action, including financial support from industrialised nations to developing countries; develop national climate plans by 2020, with self-determined goals and targets; protect ecosystems, including forests; strengthen adaptation and reduce vulnerability to climate change. Agreeing on to make all of the above happen, is a politically and technically complex matter that sometimes conflicts with a variety of local realities, country categorisations, scientific questions, money issues, and ultimately, brings into question the ever-so complicated notion of trust among nations. Here are five of the most major tension points: The first point of tension here is that some countries feel the need for global action more acutely than others. Take the plight of small island nations, for example, and areas of extreme weather activity such as the Sahel or the Polar regions. In addition, industrialized countries are considered to have benefitted for decades from an economy that had no limits on greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, they should take the biggest responsibility when it comes to the global effort to reverse the trend.  But then again, others contend that some currently developing nations, now have record emissions and that climate action responsibility should lie with them to a greater extent. The achieved a delicate balance to bring all countries together. All countries, to varying degrees, have recognized that climate change is a global problem that requires a global response, and they have all showed the will to contribute to collective climate action efforts, as evidenced by the fact that 181 national climate action plans with self-determined targets have been submitted to the UN to date. However, as countries face different realities, with various levels of economic and social development, the actions and obligations of the 197 parties need to be differentiated accordingly, especially when it comes to the financing of climate action – these are known as “common but differentiated responsibilities”. At COP24, a lot of the discussion centres around how to accommodate and handle these different realities fairly for all parties, while ensuring that the greatest and most ambitious climate action possible, can be undertaken. The Climate Change Convention, adopted in 1992, divides its 197 parties into two main groups: the industrialized group of 43 nations, and the developing group of 154, including 49 “least developed countries”. The climate action contributions and responsibilities of each group differ with regards to how transparently and regularly they communicate their actions and provision of support; especially in terms of finance or technology-transfer, now, and in the long term. Because the two groups were established more than 25 years ago, and taking into account that national socio-economic situations have evolved over time, some parties feel that the composition of these groups should be reassessed as we look to implement the Paris commitments. However, there is no process to change this grouping – and none is planned or anticipated - another complex point for this COP. To facilitate the political discussions and ground them in fact, various scientific reports are being considered at COP24. One of them is last October’s landmark , prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), drawn up by hundreds of scientists from around the world. The report, commissioned as part of the Paris Agreement, states that limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5°C by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial era, remains possible, but will require an “unprecedented” shift in every aspect of our societies. While all countries acknowledge the need to tackle climate change, one of the debates here at the COP is whether the IPCC report should be officially “welcomed” or merely “noted.” This seemingly small language technicality raises a critical question: to what degree should policy be based on science? It also signals a difference on how urgently and intensely various countries want to engage in climate action moving forward. Climate action – which requires new technology, infrastructure and skills – represents a cost that some nations, especially the least developed and most vulnerable, cannot carry alone. In Paris, donor nations committed to to fund climate action in developing countries, starting in 2020. This figure would include public and private contributions, which renders the reporting quite complex… Countries are arguing on how close we are to meeting that target and whether it will be met by 2020. Another burning issue is the lack of clarity over what constitutes “climate finance”, as many countries report some of their “development aid” as “climate action aid”. This lack of clarity complicates the discussions considerably, and questions regarding reporting, transparency and accountability are on the table. All the countries recognize the need for guidelines to be in place, so they can move on to implementing the Paris Agreement, and they are all mindful of the 2018 deadline. However, if we are to course-correct fast and well, efforts and investments are required – including in economic transition, ambitious reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, technology exchange and knowledge-sharing. What it all comes down to, is the ephemeral trust among nations, an important element that can only be realized if tangible transparency measures are in place. “We have no time for limitless negotiations,” said UN Secretary General António Guterres. “A completed work programme will unleash the potential of the Paris Agreement. It will build trust and make clear that countries are serious about addressing climate change,” he stressed. The conversations on reporting and evaluation, with the potential set-up of peer review systems, are very challenging. The negotiations on all of these issues are meant to last until the end of the week. “Many political divisions remain. Many issues still must be overcome,” the head of the secretariat, Patricia Espinosa, as she launched the high-level segment on Tuesday. “But I believe it’s within our grasp to finish the job,” she stated confidently to the dozens of decision-makers gathered together in the conference hall.

89-> Advancing multilateralism goes ‘hand-in-hand’ with work of the UN
Revitalizing the United Nations to “strengthen a multilateral rule-based world order” tops a list of priorities the General Assembly President told UN Member States on Tuesday. Convinced that “ go hand-in-hand”, Assembly President Maria Fernanda Espinosa Garces said that she was engaging with world leaders in New York and abroad, “to promote this objective”. She also vowed to work on revitalizing the General Assembly, as well as on reforming the UN and aligning the UN’s objectives to the for Sustainable Development. Calling the “a cornerstone of the success of multilateralism”, she stressed the importance of building greater public understanding and support for it. Her second priority was on implementing two new global accords on and , for which she had appointed two co-facilitators to consult with Member States on arrangements for the International Migration Review Forums – the primary intergovernmental platform for States to discuss implementing and share progress on the Global Compact. “I will also continue raising awareness about the importance of an informed debate on international migration, which is based on facts and figures, to help Member States develop their own policies and support the implementation of Global Compact for Migration” she stated. I am committed to strive towards gender parity within the General Assembly and gender equality in its outcomes –  As a Gender Champion, Ms. Espinosa’s third priority focuses on gender equality and women’s empowerment. “I am committed to strive towards gender parity within the General Assembly and gender equality in its outcomes, starting with my Office where gender equality is a reality”, she emphasized, noting her newly established Group of Gender Equality Leaders. Fourth, under the priority related to the creation of decent work opportunities, she spotlighted the need to build on the momentum created around the review of Sustainable Development Goal 8 ( ) in the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development ( ) under the auspices of the UN Economic and Social Council ( ) in July as well as the commemoration of the of the International Labour Organization ( ). Protecting the environment is Ms. Espinosa’s fifth priority. Nearing the first milestones of the 2030 Agenda, she committed to encouraging all participants to work collectively on climate and environmental action, as “more needs to be done to prevent dangerous levels of global warming.” “We need to see climate change response as an opportunity to set a course for a better future for human beings and towards a greener, cleaner and more sustainable world”, she maintained, particularly as it “is accelerating faster than our efforts to address it”. On plastic pollution, she asked for partners in “walking the talk” by reducing single use plastics within missions and at UN facilities. Under the rights of persons with disabilities, her sixth priority, she said that a Steering Committee on Accessibility at the UN had been launched in December on the eve of the . Moreover, she plans to launch the campaign for the Universal Ratification of the this month and host a High-Level Event on Persons with Disabilities in June. For her final priorities, peace and security, the Assembly President said she would seize on, or take advantage of, all existing mandates and events” to promote issues related to conflict prevention, peacebuilding and sustaining peace” to build more “peaceful and resilient societies.” Priority activities on the horizon Looking back Ms. Espinosa outlined the work the Assembly had already achieved since she took office in September, beginning with the “unprecedented” number of world leaders at the 2018 general debate, which sent “a strong message” in support of multilateralism and the Organization. She noted that in Marrakech, “we adopted the for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration”, and also the “so-called rulebook” for the at the in Poland. Among others, she: conducted a one-day High-Level Meeting on Middle-Income Countries that yielded concrete recommendations to address gaps in implementing the ; launched a series of Morning Dialogues with Ambassadors on thematic issues challenging the Organization; and appointed 28 co-facilitators and co-chairs, almost 60 per cent of whom are women.

The UN’s most senior official in Iraq, visited protesters in central Baghdad on Wednesday, calling for “a national dialogue to identify prompt, meaningful responses to break the vicious cycle of violence”, which has roiled the country during the past five days. Special Representative of the Secretary-General, , said she had gone to Tahrir Square to engage with the people, and listen to their concerns, as part of the UN’s continuous efforts to promote dialogue with the Government, as news reports suggest that Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, is facing growing calls to resign. ’s our full story. Chile pulls out of hosting major COP25 climate conference in December Citing the impact of on-going anti-Government protests, Chile announced on Wednesday that it was withdrawing as host of the upcoming COP25 annual climate summit, which is due to begin in early December. In a , the UN Climate change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said that she had been informed of Chile’s decision “not to host COP25 in view of the difficult situation that the country is undergoing”, adding that the secretariat she runs, the , would begin exploring “alternative hosting options”, for the world’s biggest annual conference addressing climate change issues. The President of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, also phoned the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, with the news. The Government also announced it would no longer host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, APEC, which was due to take place in the capital Santiago from 15-17 November, due to security concerns. Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Chile nearly two weeks ago, demanding an end to social inequality, rising prices, and better public services. Eighteen people have reportedly died, and 7,000 have been arrested during the rioting, amid allegations of human rights abuses by security forces. Reparations for sexual violence in conflict – ‘what survivors want most, yet receive least’ Ten years ago, the UN established a mandate to prevent and address the scourge of conflict-related sexual violence. At a commemorative event on Wednesday, the UN deputy chief described that commitment as essential to “highlight, prevent and seek justice for this crime”. The 2009 mandate had “sent a clear message that sexual violence during times of upheaval and conflict is not the inevitable collateral of war but a horrific violation of human rights and international law”, Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed spelled out. Full coverage, . UN chief voices ‘serious concern’ over Guinea-Bissau political crisis The Secretary-General has responded with “serious concern” to developments in Guinea-Bissau, following the firing of the country’s Prime Minister on Monday by President José Mário Vaz, who announced a replacement on Tuesday. With less than one month to go before the country’s presidential elections, António Guterres called on all political stakeholders to abide by decisions taken by the West African States regional body, ECOWAS, which has sought to find lasting solutions to chronic political instability in Guinea-Bissau since its independence from Portugal in 1974. IOM suspends South Sudan Ebola screening, after death of volunteers The UN migration agency ( ) on Wednesday condemned “in the strongest possible terms” the killing of three of its aid workers in South Sudan’s Morobo County, who were working as volunteers at Ebola screening points along the country’s border, sparked by the more than year-long outbreak in the Democratic in the Congo, or DRC. Two male, and one female humanitarian worker, were caught in crossfire during clashes that broke out in the morning hours of 27 October. IOM has since suspended Ebola Virus screening points at five points of entry to the country, namely Isebi, Bazi, Kirikwa, Lasu and Okaba - bordering points between South Sudan and Uganda, and the DRC. UN nuclear agency appoints new Director-General Ambassador Rafael Grossi is set to take office as Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( ) in early December, following his appointment to the post by the Agency’s Board of Governors on Wednesday. A career diplomat with over 35 years of professional experience in non-proliferation and disarmament, Mr. Grossi is currently Argentina’s Ambassador to Austria and the country’s Permanent Representative to the Vienna-based International Organizations, including the IAEA. Mr. Grossi will be the IAEA’s sixth head since it was founded in 1957 and was appointed by acclamation to serve for four years. He follows Yukiya Amano of Japan, who passed away last July.

91-> India urged to lead global push for clean energy, climate action
India has a crucial role to play in promoting clean energy and climate action as the world looks to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, UN said on Friday. Delivering the 19th Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture, the UN chief called on India to take the lead in transforming global economic, energy and health systems to save lives, create inclusive economies and avert the threat of climate change. As governments mobilize trillions of dollars to recover from , their decisions will have climate consequences for decades. These choices can either propel forward, or set us back years. --   “India can become a true global superpower in the fight against climate change, if it speeds up its shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy,” he . With the pandemic putting sustainable development at risk, exposing vulnerabilities that will worsen with climate change, the Secretary-General outlined how switching to clean energy could benefit millions worldwide. “Investments in renewable energy, clean transport and energy efficiency during the recovery from the pandemic could extend electricity access to 270 million people worldwide – fully a third of the people that currently lack it,” he said. Furthermore, “these same investments could help create nine million jobs annually over the next three years”, he added. End fossil fuel subsidies Mr. Guterres highlighted India’s progress in the renewable energy sector. The number of workers has risen five-fold since 2015, while last year, spending on solar energy eclipsed coal-fired power generation for the first time. Despite significant challenges, the South Asian giant has embraced the technology that will power a sustainable future, and is a pioneer in areas such as clean cooking. However, the UN chief noted that subsidies for fossil fuels, such as coal, are still roughly seven times higher  than subsidies  for clean energy. The situation is the same in many other parts of the world, something he found “deeply troubling”. “I have asked all G20 countries, including India, to invest in a clean, green transition as they recover from the pandemic,” he said. “This means ending fossil fuel subsidies, placing a price on carbon pollution and committing to no new coal power plants after 2020.” ‘Up in smoke’ Fossil fuels, including coal emissions, create pollution that has severely damaged human health. Mr. Guterres said eliminating them would result in a rise in life expectancy by 20 months, and prevent some 5.5 million deaths annually worldwide. Unlike renewable energy, investing in fossil fuels is “bad economics”, he continued, which explains why the world’s largest investors are abandoning coal. “They see the writing on the wall,” he said.  “The coal business is going up in smoke.” Time for bold leadership The UN chief said he was inspired to learn about a “promising trend” in India. During the pandemic, the proportion of renewable energy rose from 17 per cent to 24 per cent, while coal-fired power declined from 76 per cent to 66 per cent. Mr. Guterres underlined that renewable energy must continue to grow, and coal use progressively phased out. “Today is the time for bold leadership on clean energy and climate action. I call on India to be at the helm of the ambitious leadership we need,” he said. Honouring a climate action pioneer The Darbari Seth Memorial Lecture has been delivered annually since 2002, in honour of the late Indian industrialist and founder of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), a think tank in New Delhi. The Secretary-General described Mr. Seth as “a climate action pioneer” who stressed that his country must end its reliance on fossil fuels and instead invest in solar power. “India has all the ingredients for exerting the leadership at home and abroad envisioned by Darbari Seth,” he said.

92-> FROM THE FIELD: Planning a route to green cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina
Bosnia and Herzegovina  is showing how even highly polluted cities can be transformed into well-planned, climate-resilient urban hubs. With one of the world’s highest levels of air pollution, the central Bosnian city of Zenica, an industrial hub, is now attempting to turn around its fortunes, with the backing of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). A host of projects are underway in Zenica, including river-bed cleaning (to avoid flooding), ending the use of coal for municipal heating and, as part of UNDP’s Go Green Initiative, tree-planting. UNDP-supported initiatives are also designed to have a beneficial effect on surrounding rural areas, which have suffered from severe flooding in recent years.

93-> UN report highlights links between ‘unprecedented biodiversity loss’ and spread of disease
The continued degradation of the environment is increasing the likelihood of diseases spreading from animals to humans, warns a UN report on biodiversity, released on Tuesday. The fifth edition of the UN’s Global Biodiversity Outlook report, published by the (CBD), provides an authoritative overview of the state of nature worldwide. The report notes the importance of biodiversity in addressing climate change, and long-term food security, and concludes that action to protect biodiversity is essential to prevent future pandemics. Wake-up call The study acts as a wake-up call, and an encouragement to consider the dangers involved in mankind’s current relationship with nature: continued biodiversity loss, and the ongoing degradation of ecosystems, are having profound consequences of human wellbeing and survival. “As nature degrades,” said Elizabeth Mrema, Executive Director of the Convention on Biological Diversity, “new opportunities emerge for the spread to humans and animals of devastating diseases like this year’s . The window of time available is short, but the pandemic has also demonstrated that transformative changes are possible when they must be made.” Ten-year targets missed This year’s study is considered to be particularly significant, because it serves as a “final report card” for the , a series of 20 objectives set out in 2010, at the beginning of the UN’s , most of which were supposed to be reached by the end of this year. However, none of the targets – which concern the safeguarding of ecosystems, and the promotion of sustainability – have been fully met, and only six are deemed to have been “partially achieved”. “Earth’s living systems as a whole are being compromised”, said Ms. Mrema, “and the more humanity exploits nature in unsustainable ways and undermines its contributions to people, the more we undermine our own well-being, security and prosperity.” Although the lack of success in meeting the targets is a cause for concern, the authors of the Outlook are at pains to stress that virtually all countries are now taking some steps to protect biodiversity, without which the state of the world’s biodiversity would be considerably worse. The bright spots include falling rates of deforestation, the eradication of invasive alien species from more islands, and raised awareness of biodiversity and its importance overall. However, this encouraging progress can’t mask the fact that the natural world is suffering badly, and that the situation is getting worse. Financing is a case in point: funding for actions linked to biodiversity has been estimated at between $78 - $91 billion per year, way below the hundreds of billions needed. And this figure is dwarfed by the amount of money spent on activities that are harmful to biodiversity, including some $500 billion for fossil fuels, and other subsidies that cause environmental degradation. Transitions to a healthier planet Contained within the report are several recommendations, or “transitions”, which map out a scenario for a world in which “business as usual” is halted, and environmental devastation is reversed. Under the proposals, ecosystems would be restored and conserved; food systems would be redesigned to enhance productivity, whilst minimizing their negative effects; and the oceans would be managed sustainably. The design of cities also comes under the spotlight, with calls for a reduced environmental footprint in urban areas, and “green infrastructure”, making space for nature within built landscapes. The report amplifies the UN’s support for , hailed as one of the most effective ways of combatting climate change. Alongside a rapid phase-out of fossil fuel use, they can provide positive benefits for biodiversity and other sustainability goals. And, in relation to health concerns, and the spread of diseases from animals to humans, the report calls for a “One Health” transition, in which agriculture, the urban environment and wildlife are managed in a way that promotes healthy ecosystems and healthy people. Reacting to the report, UN chief António Guterres said that the transitions represent an unprecedented opportunity to “build back better”, as the world emerges from the immediate impacts of the pandemic: “Part of this new agenda must be to tackle the twin global challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss in a more coordinated manner, understanding both that climate change threatens to undermine all other efforts to conserve biodiversity; and that nature itself offers some of the most effective solutions to avoid the worst impacts of a warming planet.” Biodiversity at UNGA 75

94-> After nearly a decade away, La Niña weather system is back…
Many will be familiar with El Niño – the ocean-warming phenomenon that affects global weather patterns – but how about La Niña, which is linked to cooler sea temperatures? to the World Meteorological Organization ( ), La Niña is back in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, after nearly a decade’s absence. will affects rainfall and temperature patterns in many parts of the world but it is not the only climate driver. WMO's new Global Seasonal Climate Update factors in other climate drivers as well human induced   This is expected to result in sea surface temperatures between two and three degrees Celsius cooler than average, said Dr. Maxx Dilley, Deputy Director in charge of Climate Services Department at WMO. “These coolings of these large ocean areas have a significant effect on the circulation of the atmosphere that’s flowing over them. And the changes in the atmosphere in turn affect precipitation patterns around the world.” Uneven effects The likely results of La Niña vary around the globe, but indications are that the Horn of Africa will see below average rainfall, as will Central Asia. Elsewhere, WMO’s weather models forecast above-average rainfall for Southeast Asia, some Pacific Islands and the northern region of South America. The UN agency also warned that East Africa is forecast to see drier than usual conditions, which together with the existing impacts of the desert locust invasion, may add to regional food insecurity. WMO says that there is a 90 per cent chance of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures remaining at La Niña levels for the remainder of the year, and a 55 per cent chance that this will continue through March next year. This is important because La Niña contributes to temperatures, rainfall and storm patterns in many parts of the world. Alarm bells What’s more, everyone from governments to farmers uses the announcement of a La Niña event to protect activities that are sensitive to changes in the weather, including agriculture, health, water resources and disaster management. WMO is now stepping up its support and advice for international humanitarian agencies to try to reduce the impacts among the most vulnerable at a time when coping capacities are stretched by the pandemic. Heat is here to stay Although La Niña typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, there’s little chance that 2020 will buck the trend of increasingly warm years, however. That’s because of all the heat trapped in our atmosphere by greenhouse gases, said WMO head Petteri Taalas. And he warned that “2020 remains on track to be one of the warmest years on record and 2016-2020 is expected to be the warmest five-year period on record”.

95-> Monday’s Daily Brief: Earth Day, looking for a solution to Libya crisis, focus on indigenous issues, Security Council on Sri Lanka, a high-level visit to Bangladesh
Top news for Monday include: the celebration of International Mother Earth Day, efforts by the UN to push for a political solution to the Libyan crisis, the opening of the annual Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the UN Security Council's condemnation of the Sri Lanka attacks, and an upcoming UN high-level mission to Bangladesh to highlight the humanitarian needs of Rohingya refugees settled there. ‘Do everything in your power to tackle climate change’ UN chief urges on Mother Earth Day Marking , the UN on Monday debated how best to build “an equitable and sustainable future” for all, through enhanced education and , on the road to a key international summit on the issue due to take place in September. Billed officially as an Interactive Dialogue on Harmony with Nature, the UN General Assembly session involved Member States and top officials discussing the need to take urgent action against the pace of global warming, in line with the 2015 , to keep carbon dioxide emissions to well-below two degrees Celsius. The . UN continues diplomatic push for political solution to end Libya fighting The UN Special Representative for Libya and Head of the UN Mission in the country, , Ghassan Salamé, is continuing his efforts to try and de-escalate military action in and around the capital, Tripoli. The commander of the self-styled Libyan National Army began an offensive to try and take the Libyan capital from forces backing the UN-recognized Government, more than two weeks ago. Here’s UN Spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, briefing correspondents in New York on Monday on Mr. Salame’s progress. “Earlier today, he met with Tunisian Foreign Minister Khamis Jhinaoui in Tunis, with whom he discussed developments related to the clashes in southern Tripoli. Both asserted that the UN-facilitated political process is the ideal and only way to solve the Libyan crisis.” According to the UN office coordinating humanitarian affairs ( ), thousands of civilians, refugees and migrants remain trapped in conflict-affected areas, unable to flee either because of fighting or detention. In a statement released on Monday, said that medical teams were working relentlessly to evacuate and care for people wounded in the conflict. Through the Tripoli flash appeal, the humanitarian community has urgently called for US$10.2 million to continue providing life-saving relief, adding that “humanitarian needs in Libya are rapidly increasing, while funding levels remain low”. Traditional knowledge at ‘core’ of indigenous heritage Traditional knowledge is at the core of indigenous identity, culture and heritage around the world, the chair of the said at the annual event’s opening day on Monday, stressing that it “must be protected”. Anne Nuorgam, who is a member of Finland’s Saami Parliament and head of the Saami Council’s Human Rights Unit, described the Forum as an opportunity to share innovations and practices, developed in indigenous communities “over centuries and millennia”. Indigenous peoples make up less than six per cent of the world’s population, but account for 15 per cent of the poorest on earth, according to the Forum. They live in some 90 countries, represent 5,000 different cultures and speak the overwhelming majority of the world’s estimated 6,700 languages. Find . UN Security Council condemns ‘heinous and cowardly’ Sri Lanka attacks The members of the UN  “in the strongest terms the series of heinous and cowardly terrorist attacks” that took place in several churches and hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, which resulted in nearly 300 killed and hundreds more wounded. They expressed their “deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government of Sri Lanka” and wished “a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured”. Reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes “one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” they underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. The Security Council urged all States, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the Government of Sri Lanka and all other relevant authorities in this regard. The members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.  They reaffirmed the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. Rohingya refugee crisis: UN Humanitarian top officials to visit Bangladesh Three top United Nations officials will visit Bangladesh later this week, to highlight the need for supporting the humanitarian needs of almost a million Rohingya refugees now living in the country. The UN announced the visit of High Commissioner for Refugees ( ), Filippo Grandi; the Director General of the migration agency, , António Vitorino; and the UN relief chief, Mark Lowcock, head of OCHA, in a statement released on Monday. In the capital Dhaka, the delegation will hold talks with senior government officials, and then travel to Cox’s Bazar to meet with refugees, assess preparations underway ahead of the monsoon season and visit UN support projects. The aim of the visit is to highlight the need to continue strong international support, while solutions can be found for the safe, dignified return of Rohingyas to Myanmar.

96-> Rising global temperature shows ‘enormous challenge’ of meeting climate goal
Annual global temperature is likely to be at least 1°C warmer than pre-industrial levels in each of the coming five years, putting globally agreed climate change targets in jeopardy, new data from the World Meteorological Organization ( ) reveals. The prediction is among the findings in the UN agency’s latest , released on Thursday in Geneva, which also shows that temperature could exceed 1.5°C in at least one year between now and 2024. The Earth’s average temperature has already risen beyond 1°C above the pre-industrial period, which spans 1850-1900, while the last five years have been the warmest on record. “This study shows – with a high level of scientific skill – the enormous challenge ahead in meeting the on Climate Change target of keeping a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius”, said Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. No substitute for action The latest predictions take into account natural variations and human influences on climate but exclude changes in greenhouse gas emissions and aerosols resulting from lockdowns during the pandemic. WMO explained that the slowdown in industrial and economic activity due to the pandemic is not a substitute for sustained and coordinated climate action. “Due to the very long lifetime of CO2 in the atmosphere, the impact of the drop in emissions this year is not expected to lead to a reduction of CO2 atmospheric concentrations which are driving global temperature increases”, said Mr. Taalas. “Whilst has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries, Governments should use the opportunity to embrace climate action as part of recovery programmes and ensure that we grow back better.” Harnessing international expertise The is led by the United Kingdom’s Met Office. It harnesses the expertise of internationally acclaimed climate scientists and the best computer models from leading climate centres around the world. WMO explained that combining forecasts from across the globe enables a higher quality product than what can be obtained from any single source.

97-> 5 world-changing ideas: our top picks for World Creativity and Innovation Day
A low-cost, tiny home that provides everything you need. A boat made of recycled plastic and flip-flops. Vaccine-delivery drones… As the planet marks on Sunday, we’ve selected our favorite ideas to light up the way to a better future for all, across several sectors.  They’re small, self-sustaining – and they could revolutionize the way we think about housing around the world, as building materials become scarcer. Measuring just about 22-square-meters, or some 200-square-feet, a “tiny house” comprised of one room with a loft or pull-out bed, hidden storage, a kitchen and a bathroom, was presented last September to get people thinking about decent, affordable housing that limits the overuse of natural resources and helps the battle against destructive climate change. The design was created by the UN environment agency and the Center for Ecosystems in Architecture at Yale University in the United States, in collaboration with .   After completing a historic 500 km journey from the Kenyan island of Lamu to the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar, the world’s first ever traditional “dhow” sailing boat made entirely from recycled plastic, known as the , was created to raise awareness of the need to overcome one of the world’s biggest environmental challenges: plastic pollution. The Flipflopi Project was co-founded by Kenyan tour operator Ben Morison in 2016, and the ground-breaking dhow was built by master craftsman Ali Skanda, and a team of volunteers, using 10 tonnes of recycled plastic. The boat gets its name from the 30,000 recycled flip-flops used to decorate its multi-coloured hull.  3. Polyester made from recycled bottles, wardrobe recycling…: solutions to make the fashion industry more sustainable  It takes around 7,500 litres of water to make a single pair of jeans,  equivalent to the amount of water the average person drinks over a period of seven years. That’s just one of the many startling facts to emerge from recent environmental research, which show that the cost of staying fashionable is a lot more than just the price tag. Despite the grim statistics, producers and consumers of fashion are increasingly waking up to the idea that the industry needs to change. A number of companies, including large volume retailers, are integrating sustainability principles into their business strategies. Examples include the global clothing chain H&M, which has a garment collection scheme; jeans manufacturer Guess, which is involved in a wardrobe recycling programme; and outdoor clothing company Patagonia, which produces jackets using polyester from recycled bottles.   On a small island in the remote South Pacific, a one-month-old baby was the world’s first child to be given a vaccine delivered by a drone. The state-of-the-art craft which transported the vaccine, travelled nearly 40 kilometres over rugged mountain terrain, flying from Dillon’s Bay in western Vanuatu to remote Cook’s Bay – a scattered community accessible only on foot or by small boats – where 13 children and 5 pregnant women were inoculated by a nurse. Henrietta H. Fore, the Executive Director of said the tiny aircraft’s flight “is a big leap for global health." "With the world still struggling to immunize the hardest-to-reach children, drone technologies can be a game changer for bridging that last mile to reach every child,” she explained.   Satellite-based tracking to chart how land is being used on the Earth’s surface got much easier and more accessible, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation ( ), thanks to the launch of a new online portal, developed in collaboration with the United States Space Agency, NASA. The system – known as Collect Earth Online – is web-based, free of charge, and open to all platforms. It allows users to “systematically inspect” any location on the planet, from glaciers to rainforests, with satellite data. “This innovation allows the collection of up-to-date data about our environment and its changes in a more efficient and participatory manner, using the local experts that know the landscape and the underlying ecology”, explained Mette Wilki, the head of Policy and Resources at FAO’s Forestry Division.

98-> Hurricane Laura: Most dangerous hurricane to hit the US this season
Hurricane Laura is by far the most intense and dangerous hurricane to hit the United States this season, the UN weather agency said on Friday, the day after it made landfall on the US Gulf Coast.  While it is difficult to link any individual tropical cyclone to climate change, the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ) more powerful storms in future as a result of global warming. Scenes of the aftermath of  Laura is the seventh named storm to landfall in the US this season, which has just begun what is traditionally its most intense period. It intensified within 24 hours from a Category 1 to a strong Category 4 on the Saffir Simson hurricane scale. According to news reports, some 1,500 people are being sent into Louisiana for rescue and clean up missions, including troops from the National Guard. Winds of up to 150 mph caused severe damage, including the death of at least six people, and left half a million homes without power. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards tweeted that the hurricane has left roads flooded and wildlife displaced, warning people to stay vigilant. Breaking it down Because storms feed on warm water, and higher water temperatures lead to sea-level rise, an increase in the risk of flooding during high tides and in the event of storm surges follow, WMO explained. Moreover, warmer air also holds more atmospheric water vapor, which enables tropical storms to strengthen and unleash more precipitation. “Sea level rise, which very likely has a substantial human contribution to the global mean observed rise…could be causing higher storm surge levels for tropical cyclones that do occur”, Tom Knutson, Chair of the WMO Task Team on Tropical Cyclones and Climate Change in a statement. Anthropogenic warming Anthropogenic warming, which is caused by human activity, accompanied by an increase in atmospheric moisture will likely cause tropical cyclone rainfall rates to increase in the future, WMO pointed out. “Models project an increase on the order of 10-15 per cent for rainfall rates averaged within about 100 km of the storm for a 2 degrees Celsius global warming scenario,” said Mr. Knutson. Moreover, it is likely that the intensity of tropical cyclones around the world will increase on average, implying an even larger percentage increase in the destructive potential per storm. Uncertainty ahead However, the WMO official flagged that storm size responses to anthropogenic warming are “uncertain”. While the global proportion of tropical cyclones that reach intense Category 4 and 5 levels will “likely increase due to anthropogenic warming over the next century”, Mr. Knutson questioned “the global number” of Category 4 and 5 storms in future projections since “most modeling studies project a decrease (or little change) in the global frequency of all tropical cyclones combined”.

99-> Death Valley temperature likely highest since 1931: UN weather agency
“All indications” suggest that the extreme temperature reading of 54.4 degrees Celsius recorded in California’s Death Valley on Sunday, is legitimate, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Tuesday. “The weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley, California, reported a temperature of 54.4C, which is 130F, on Sunday 16 August,” said Clare Nullis, spokesperson. “If validated, it would be the highest temperature on Earth since 1931, and the third-hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet.” WMO committee of experts will verify temperature reading of 54.4°C (130°F), recorded at Death Valley on 16 August amid an intense and extensive . Details of the extreme heat in USA, Japan and Europe at  Experts on the case Speaking in Geneva, Ms. Nullis told journalists that WMO had tasked a panel of international experts to verify the reading by examining the observation, the equipment used, how it was calibrated and how it compared to data gathered at surrounding stations. According to WMO’s Weather and Climate Extremes archive, the hottest temperature ever recorded was in Furnace Creek, Death Valley, California, reaching 56.7C (134.06F) on 10 July 1913. The next highest temperature was set in July 1931 in Kebili, Tunisia, reaching 55C (131F). Other high temperature records include 54C (129.2F) in Mitribah, Kuwait, on 21 July 2016. Preliminary findings indicate that the equipment at Furnace Creek meteorological station was in proper working condition at the time of Sunday’s observation, Ms. Nullis noted. A ‘legitimate observation’ Although the full verification process will likely take many months, she said that the UN agency’s weather and climate extremes rapporteur, Randall Cerveny, had already said “all the indications so far are that this is a legitimate observation”. The scorching conditions have coincided with a heatwave on the U.S. west coast. The US National Weather Service has issued numerous heat warnings indicating that the intense and extreme temperatures will continue this week. “The National Weather Service in Las Vegas which covers the Death Valley area tweeted, ‘we are in the midst of a long-duration extreme heat event. Another run at 130F-plus temperatures in Death Valley remains possible,’” Ms. Nullis added. The development follows repeated warnings from the UN weather agency about extreme high temperatures which are having an impact on sea ice melt, also causing extensive wildfires in places such as the Arctic. Western and Central Europe witnessed another heatwave last week, Ms. Nullis explained, with a number of new weather station records being set. Arctic alarm On 17 August, Japan registered 41.1C (105.98F) at Hamamatsu, tying its national record. Siberia, meanwhile, has experienced a prolonged heatwave, with a recorded temperature of 38C (100.4F) on 20 June in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk. WMO is now examining this reading, which if verified, would be the highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic Circle. “July was the hottest July on record for the northern hemisphere and the Arctic sea ice was the lowest on record,” Ms. Nullis said. “The January to July period – the seven-month period - was the second-warmest such period on record.”

100-> A deep dive into Zero Hunger: the seaweed revolution
If just two per cent of the Ocean were to be sustainably farmed, the world could easily be fed, according to experts. In the first story of a two-part series looking at the opportunities and challenges facing Ocean farming, we take a look at the huge potential role of seaweed in mitigating climate change, cutting marine pollution, and achieving the UN goal of . ‘We are still hunter-gatherers’ “When it comes to the ocean, we are still hunter-gatherers”, says Vincent Doumeizel, a senior advisor on ocean-based solutions at the UN Global Compact, and an evangelist for seaweed. “By farming just two per cent of the ocean, we could provide enough protein to feed a world population of 12 billion people. Seaweed is extremely protein rich, low in fat, low in carbohydrates, and rich in vitamins, zinc and iron”. As any fan of sushi will already know, certain forms of seaweed are edible for human consumption. Whilst seaweed has been popular in Asia, particularly Japan, for many years, it is slowly becoming better known throughout the rest of the world, and Mr. Doumeizel is confident that it has the potential to become a mainstream food. “Most Japanese people eat seaweed three times a day, it is used in many dishes in Korea, and is eaten by many people in China. This may be a major factor in cutting the levels of non-communicable diseases in these countries. Underwater carbon capture Mr. Doumeizel also touts the environmental benefits of seaweed, particularly as an ingredient in animal feed: “Seaweed doesn’t need land, fresh water, or pesticides, just sun and saltwater. If livestock were fed on seaweed-based foodstuffs, rather than soy, methane emissions could be cut by 90 per cent, and improve digestion whilst boosting the animals’ immune systems, which reduces the need for antibiotics. This is already happening in some countries, such as Scotland and Iceland”. Seaweed has many other uses and benefits, as an organic fertilizer, a sustainable replacement for plastics, and an ingredient in cosmetics and medicines. It also plays a role in tackling ocean pollution, cleaning the water of nitrates and phosphates. Given the vast range of benefits seaweed offers, why isn’t it being used more widely? Technical barriers are one reason, according to Mr. Doumeizel. “There is a lack of space to grow underwater forests near shorelines, and it can be difficult to get a licence to grow them off-shore. We need to learn from oil companies, which have a lot of experience in dealing with strong ocean currents and waves”. In fact, one company with big plans to expand seaweed production, is run by a former executive at international oil company, Shell. Kelp Blue is planning to grow huge underwater forests of seaweed off the coast of Namibia, covering some 70,000 hectares. These forests, say the company, would help to solve the world’s food crisis whilst, at the same time, removing vast amounts of harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, and creating hundreds of jobs. They would be populated by giant kelp, a form of seaweed that can grow to 100 feet (30 metres). According to Kelp Blue, one million tons of carbon dioxide would be locked away by the forests and, because one of the main products from kelp is feed for livestock, it has the potential to remove much more, via reduced methane emissions. An added possible side benefits of the forests is a projected growth in fish stocks in the surrounding waters of up to 20 per cent, with the expectation that around 200 species would their home within the kelp. The seaweed manifesto Whilst companies like Kelp Blue appear to have solutions to technical challenges, the main obstacle that still needs to be overcome is a lack of global safety standards for seaweed products, and resistance to collaboration, in an industry still driven by relatively small companies and entrepreneurs, who are not keen to share. To overcome this problem, the UN Global Compact has published a , which calls for internationally agreed standards, new investment efforts, and greater collaboration between governments, science and industry, to drive production to the next level. The manifesto was officially launched one the sidelines of the 2020 UN General Assembly, at an which brought together several players from the private and public sector, and featured Alexandra Cousteau, grand-daughter of famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, and founder of Oceans 2050, a campaign and action platform dedicated to restoring ocean health over the next thirty years. If it succeeds, the seaweed industry could find itself playing a much greater role in fighting the climate crisis, strengthening marine ecosystems and bringing the world closer to the big prize: an end to hunger.

101-> UN migration agency launches $10 million appeal to support hurricane recovery in The Bahamas
The International Organization for Migration ( ) has launched a $10 million appeal to assist The Bahamas as the country continues to recover from the devastation brought on by Hurricane Dorian just over a month ago. The funding will support operations in areas such as camp coordination and management, provision of shelter and non-food items, and emergency evacuations through April 2020. “Hurricane Dorian caused widespread devastation on the islands of Abaco, from Marsh Harbour to the North, and Grand Bahama; from Pelican Point east to McLean’s Town; leaving behind a trail of destroyed infrastructure, clogged with debris from devastated houses, domestic goods, vehicles and natural debris like trees and mangroves, uprooted by the storm surge,” said IOM officer, Nazif Aliu. Hurricane Dorian hit The Bahamas on 1 September. In addition to the destruction, the Category 5 storm caused 61 deaths while more than 600 people are still missing. UN visited the country shortly afterwards, describing the disaster as “ ”. IOM has established two offices in The Bahamas—one in the capital, Nassau, and the other on Abaco—with a third planned for Grand Bahama. The organization is already supporting the country through grants from the United States and the UN Central Emergency Relief Fund, representing nearly $2 million of the appeal. The funding has allowed IOM to begin debris removal in Abaco, in partnership with the NGO Community Organized Relief Effort (CORE). “We are removing over 100 cubic meters of debris daily. This operation is coordinated with the government of The Bahamas, through its emergency response agency NEMA, which is leading the organized planning of debris removal”, said Mr. Aliu, who is based in Abaco. The Bahamian authorities have also formally requested IOM to help relocate citizens stranded in the United States after their evacuation following Hurricane Dorian.

102-> At UN, St. Vincent and Grenadines’ Prime Minister eschews ‘illiberal intolerance,’ calls for global cooperation; multilateralism
The world is at a “decisive crossroads,” Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, told leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly’s annual debate on Thursday. “We have retreated from the ethos of integration, cooperation, and consensus building…which is absolutely necessary to solve the global problems that confront us.” he explained. As a , St. Vincent and the Grenadines faces challenges to sustainable development, a small but growing population, limited resources, and susceptibility to natural disasters and climate change. “Small size is no impediment to impactful contributions on the world stage,” Mr. Gonsalves told the Assembly. Mr. Gonsalves’ encouraged solidarity and equality from the member states present for the general debate to deal with these challenges by invoking the a “recommitment to the bedrock foundations of our [UN] .” Citing (on global partnerships)of the ( ), he told the gathered leaders that “We have mainstreamed and prioritized goals related to clean energy, economic growth, sustainability, climate action and biodiversity. We have chalked up home-grown progress in tandem with selfless solidarity from some of our regional and global friends and allies, but much more is required to be done.” He went on to say that St. Vincent and the Grenadines “stands firmly against the continued interventionist assaults on the sovereignty of our neighbors in the Republic of Cuba and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,” calling for “constructive dialogue between and among the contradictory parties.” “Ours is a flame of respect,” Mr. Gonsalves said, concluding: “For sovereignty, for diversity of views, for dialogue, for peace and for development.” .

103-> COP25: ‘Signals of hope’ multiplying in face of global climate crisis, insists UN's Guterres
The UN has outlined the “increased ambition and commitment” that the world needs from governments during the coming days of the UN climate change conference which opens in Madrid on Monday, calling for “accountability, responsibility and leadership” to end the global climate crisis. “ is one of hope not of despair” said UN chief addressing journalists at a press conference in the Spanish capital on Sunday, after revealing the key takeaways from the State of the Climate report, due to be published during COP25. I expect a clear demonstration of increased ambition & commitment out of . Leaders of all countries need to show accountability & responsibility. Anything less wold be a betrayal of our entire human family and all generations to come. “The last five years have been the hottest ever recorded. Sea levels are at the highest in human history”, he said, listing the benchmarks which indicate that “the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. It is in sight and is hurtling towards us”. But scientists have provided a roadmap away from that point, which will allow us to limit global temperature rise to just 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, reach carbon neutrality by 2050 and cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent from 2010 levels, by 2030. 1.5 degrees ‘still within reach’ Efforts so far have been “utterly inadequate” and the commitments still mean a rise of 3.2 degrees unless more drastic action is taken, said the UN chief, but 1.5 degrees “is still within reach.” “The technologies that are necessary to make this possible are already available”, he added, “the signals of hope are multiplying. Public opinion is waking up everywhere. Young people are showing remarkable leadership and mobilization.” The key missing ingredient is a lack of political will he said: “Political will to put a price on carbon. Political will to stop subsidies on fossil fuels”, or to shift taxation from income to carbon, “taxing pollution instead of people.” Stop digging and drilling He said digging and drilling had to stop, replaced by renewable energy and nature-based solutions to drastically slow climate change. “In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments – particularly from the main emitters – to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.” Mr. Guterres said at least $100 billion dollars must be made available to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation and to take into account their “legitimate expectations to have the resources necessary to build resilience and for disaster response and recovery.” The “social dimension” of climate change must also be paramount, so that national commitments include “a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected as we move from the grey to the green economy.” In conclusion he noted: “We are in a deep hole and we are are still digging. Soon it will be too deep to escape.” Mark Carney to be new Special Envoy for Climate Action The Secretary-General announced on Sunday that the current head of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is to become the UN’s new Special Envoy for Climate Action. Describing the Canadian as “a remarkable pioneer in pushing the financial sector to act on climate”, Mr. Guterres said the new envoy would be focusing on ambitious implementation of action, especially shifting markets and mobilizing private finance, towards limiting global warming to the key 1.5 degrees mark. Mr. Carney replaces former New York mayor and billionaire philanthropist, Michael Bloomberg, who has embarked on a US presidential run. from the Spokespersons’ office said his tasks would include “building the frameworks for financial reporting, risk management and returns in order to bring the impacts of climate change to the mainstream of private financial decision making and to support the transition to a net zero carbon economy.” The Bank of England Governor has held numerous positions in finance in both the private and public sectors and will become a member of UN staff at the point at which he ceases to work for the Bank.  He also served, from 2011 to 2018, as Chair of the Financial Stability Board and Governor of the Bank of Canada from 2008-2013. “The Secretary-General will count on Mark Carney to galvanise climate action and transform climate finance”, as the UN looks to next year’s 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26), due to take place in Glasgow, Scotland.

104-> UN summit tackles climate change-induced threat to mountain water supplies
The world’s mountain and glacier regions are facing unprecedented challenges due to climate change, imposing a crippling effect on the people and economies that rely on them, the UN’s weather agency explained on Tuesday, ahead of to address the world’s rapidly-changing water systems. The earth’s glaciers, snow, permafrost and associated ecosystems, collectively known as the cryosphere, provide drinkable water for half of the world, but as the earth gets warmer, the supply is becoming unpredictable. The UN’s weather agency which is carefully monitoring the effects of climate change on water supplies, and partners, kicked off the High Mountain Summit in Geneva on Tuesday. Mountain environments are seeing changes in flash flooding patterns, retreating mountain glaciers, and changes to seasonal runoff, among others. A quick glance at how reference glaciers have retreated since 1950    As a result of these changes on the world’s peaks, freshwater supplies are being impacted, from mountainsides to urban economies, as recognized by the UN  in a recent General Assembly on Sustainable Mountain Development. From the Yukon, to the Andes, the mountain cryosphere provides and regulates freshwater resources for around half of the world’s population, explained in the summit , and the retreating ice, is creating major impacts. Species dependent on snow cover are migrating further and further upslope; pastures irrigated by glacial melt are becoming parched; artificial snowmaking is compensating for limited snowfall on the ski slopes; and glacial lake flooding, landslides and avalanches are costing more lives and economic loss. The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined these repercussions in a published in September, ahead of the three-day mountain summit,  which addresses the growing burden of the changing climate and its strain on the earth’s water systems, from its oceans, to its ice sheets. In the Hindu Kush Himalayan region, floods alone account for one-third of all natural disasters, which are increasing and leaving one billion people at greater risk of exposure, one expert on the region told summit attendees. Around the world, the human impacts of natural hazards are rising, nearly doubling every decade. WMO’s high-level dialogue aims to engage decision-makers and local actors to make the most of existing mechanisms to enhance the presence and quality of hydro-meteorological and climate services for disaster risk reduction, and better water resource management. Those who are mountain-dwellers and know them well, have a unique relationship with nature, therefore, the culture aspect is key when it comes to implementing disaster disk management technologies, in places they’ve never been before. People who are indigenous to Peru’s Andes region have long seen glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) as a fact of life and worshipped the mountain as a God. Building a weather station in a sacred place could stir fear of supernatural consequences among locals, who believe they may be punished by rain or drought, one environmentalist explained. The nexus between research and decisions which will impact local people, however positive, is therefore, a delicate one, and clearly communicating the benefits of change is essential. Further, the September report highlights the importance of locals’ and indigenous knowledge, coupled with scientific understanding, in building successful approaches to helping the earth’s highlands. In recent years, two neighbouring indigenous populations in the United States, who share a large reservation in the northern Rocky Mountains, rely on glacier meltwater for pasture irrigation, fishery maintenance, and traditional ceremonies, and thus, have sought to install mechanisms for more efficient water use, but were met with land law roadblocks. Governments must play a major role in supporting adaptation activities, which the High Mountain Summit seeks to promote. In addition, the event, concluding on 31 October, is expected to adopt a Call for Action, identify practical steps for enhancing the cryosphere, and foster interactive dialogue between science, policy, governance, and local actors. The Summit will be followed by the Santiago Climate Change Conference, featuring the annual 25th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change taking into account the landmark Paris climate accord and UN Sustainable Development Agenda.

105-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: Cameroon crisis deepens, Tsunami Awareness Day, online gender gap, Somalia floods leave children vulnerable
A recap of Tuesday’s top stories: Humanitarian needs in Cameroon up 15-fold from 2017; UN risk reduction chief calls for more resilient cities; Somalia’s floods put 200,000 children at risk; Internet use study reveals growing gender gap; UN partners spotlight youth mental health. Cameroon faces worsening humanitarian emergency Ongoing violence in Cameroon’s northwest and southwest has created a fast-growing humanitarian emergency that’s 15 times worse than it was in 2017, UN humanitarians said on Tuesday. Separatist clashes began in late 2017 linked to alleged discrimination against the country’s English-speaking regions. UN Children’s Fund spokesperson Marixie Mercado explained that almost a million children have been affected in the West African nation, which until a few years ago was among the most settled and peaceful in the region. Full story . Natural hazards don’t always spell disaster: UN risk reduction chief Tsunamis are rare, but when they strike, they are the deadliest and most costly of natural hazards. With half of the world’s population expected to live in coastal areas more prone to tsunamis by 2030, investing in early warning systems and resilient infrastructure, will be vital to saving lives and economies, said the top UN official on disaster risks on Tuesday. Mami Mizutori, UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction laid out the benefit-cost ratio of building cities that will withstand increasingly frequent climate-related hazards, marking . our full story. 200,000 children burdened by heavy flooding in Somalia ups risk of malnutrition, disease Approximately 200,000 children in Somalia have been affected by heavy flooding, making them more vulnerable to malnutrition and disease through displacement, lack of water and sanitation services, the UN Children’s Fund revealed on Tuesday. Thousands of families living near the country’s centre, namely in Belet Weyne, Berdale, Baidoa, Jowhar and Mahadaiin cities, have been forced to leave their homes and locate to higher ground to avoid the floods, which have destroyed schools and disrupted learning for thousands of youngsters. ’s Representative to the country, Werner Schultink if action is not taken, the impact of the disaster will be felt “long after the water levels recede.” Crops have been inundated with water, straining an already precarious food situation, while impeded healthcare access will cause malnutrition spikes among Somali children, and accelerate a deadly cycle of waterborne disease spread. UNICEF is working with partners to meet the urgent needs of vulnerable children, through dispatch of emergency supplies and life-saving services. Internet use and access is improving, but digital gender gap is growing: ITU The latest UN data shows that while more people have access to the world wide web, fewer women are using it than men. According to , the International Telecommunications Union, more action is needed to address this digital gender gap. Barriers are cultural, financial and educational, and they affect poorer countries most, ’s Susan Teltscher said. Today, 48 per cent of all women use the internet, compared with 58 per cent of men. More men than women go online in every region of the world except the Americas, where the ratio is about the same. While internet use in developed countries is close to 90 per cent, in some African countries, it is below 30 per cent. Increase in child and adolescent mental disorders spurs new push for action by UNICEF, WHO In a joint push to put child and adolescent mental disorders higher up on the global health agenda, and the World Health Organisation on Tuesday addressed the alarming high rates of self-harm, suicide and anxiety among the world’s youth. UNICEF’s Henrietta Fore said the mental health crisis, now impacting up to 20 per cent of adolescents every year, is affecting rich and poor alike. “This looming crisis has no borders or boundaries”, she  Suicide is the third leading cause of death among 15 to 19-year-olds worldwide, and around 15 per cent of adolescents in low and middle-income countries have considered suicide. In addition, the cost of mental disorders is not only personal, but further, has societal and economic implications, the UN partners said in a  UNICEF and will co-host the first ever conference on the topic in Florence, Italy, this week, as part of UNICEF’s global conference series for children and young persons.

106-> Friday’s Daily Brief: Day of the Girl Child, mayors lead on climate emergency, Turkey Syria offensive, new statelessness pledges, extremism in social media
Day of the Girl Child celebrated around the world; city mayors lead on climate fight; humanitarian alarm rising over Turkey’s Syria offensive; history’s made as countries step forward to tackle global statelessness; Burkina Faso violence forces 500,000 from their homes; 'white extremist’ use of social media in attacks must be curbed. The world’s one billion young girls, were celebrated on Friday as an “unscripted and unstoppable” force for change, with 11 October designated each year the International Day of the Girl Child. Every day, girls under-18 are challenging stereotypes, breaking barriers, and leading movements to tackle the issues that affect them, and beyond, Secretary-General said in his message for the  “As the theme of this year’s observance underscores, they are proving to be unscripted and unstoppable” in their undertakings, from eliminating child marriage, to closing the education gap, addressing violence and standing strong against the climate crisis. Full story . City bosses are “the world’s first responders to the climate emergency” UN chief António Guterres declared on Friday, at an international mayors’ summit in Copenhagen. In his opening remarks to the C40 World Mayors Summit – a forum for member cities to present innovative actions to slow global warming – the Secretary-General noted that cities, which contain more than half the world’s population, and have an “enormous climate footprint”, are “on the frontlines of sustainable and inclusive development”. Urban citizens, he continued, look to mayors to make cities havens for diversity, social cohesion and job creation. ’s our full coverage. Turkey’s Syria offensive could spark another catastrophe, warn humanitarians Airstrikes and a ground offensive by Turkey in northern Syria against Kurdish forces have left civilians dead and forced tens of thousands to flee, UN agencies said on Friday, amid fears of another “humanitarian catastrophe” in the war-torn country. Expressing concern about the military campaign launched on Wednesday, the UN’s emergency relief chief Mark Lowcock noted that the Turkish Government had “assured me that they attach maximum importance to the protection of civilians and the avoidance of harm to them”. Full story . ‘Historic moment’ as countries step forward to tackle global statelessness Describing it as a “historic moment in the global fight against statelessness”, the UN refugee agency, , that more than 85 governments, civil society and international and regional organizations have made 300 new pledges to end statelessness, a major cause of human rights deprivations for millions of people worldwide. The commitments were received at a known as the High Level Segment on Statelessness, which has been in session all week, and was hosted by the agency. Speaking at the end of the meeting, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said that the week “has shown that there is an unprecedented level of political will and commitment to resolve this issue and prevent it from arising in the first place”. He added that “it is crucial that these commitments are now turned into action” and underscored UNHCR’s support “to help States work towards the goal or eradicating statelessness completely”. There are about 3.9 million known stateless people, although UNCHR says the true global figure is estimated to be much higher. The agency aims to spearhead the eradication of statelessness by 2024. Burkina Faso conflict and violence force 500,000 from homes Hundreds of thousands of civilians in Burkina Faso, have fled insecurity and violence linked to armed groups in just the last three months. On Friday, the UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR, said that central and northern regions of the country had seen 486,000 people become internally displaced – 267,000 since July. A further 16,000 are now refugees in neighbouring countries of the Sahel, the agency said, while warning of “an unprecedented humanitarian emergency” in the making. 'White extremist’ use of social media in attacks must be curbed As German authorities indicate that this week’s synagogue attack in Halle was almost certainly the work of a white nationalist, the , , has called for much quicker action to stop the spread of extremism online. Wednesday’s attempted attack on worshippers left two people dead and two others wounded. Copies of the live-streamed video were reportedly downloaded before their removal from the broadcasting platform it surfaced on, and they are still circulating online. Highlighting the disturbing rise in violence directed at Jews, OHCHR warned that no society was immune from “viral hatred”, before echoing calls for greater protection for places of worship around the world.

107-> LIVE: UN chief, Prince Charles, rally ‘coalition of the willing’ to end biodiversity destruction
Here's our special LIVE coverage of the UN Summit on Biodiversity, where activists and senior UN officials are calling for urgent action on biodiversity, to help ensure sustainable development for all.  18:20 ‘Rescue the planet’s fragile tapestry of life’ Volkan Bozkir, the President of the General Assembly and the Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed, have just spoken, giving their recaps of the Summit and delivered a rousing call to action. Ms. Mohammed reminded delegates that, in a global consultation organized for the UN´s 75th Anniversary, involving more than one million people, climate change and the destruction of the natural environment were raised as the most overwhelming concerns. Today’s discussions, she said, have highlighted actions and commitments being made around the world, to “bend the curve of biodiversity loss” and move towards a nature-positive world. However, she warned, to "rescue the planet’s fragile tapestry of life", we need vastly more ambition and action High ambitions have been set, she continued, and now they need to be taken forward at an international level and delivered on the ground, to ensure that people benefit from the sustainable use of biodiversity. “The bottom line”, she said, “is that investing in nature is investing in a sustainable future”, and there is an opportunity to look forward to a post- world that is people-centred and planet-sensitive. Laying the foundation for Kunming For Mr. Bozkir, the initiatives and commitments announced at the event had laid the foundations for the , due to take place in Kunming, China, next year. The event, he said, had reminded him that humankind is capable of incredible feats of science and engineering, of deep compassion and consideration, and given him hope. The necessary transformation, however, will require efforts to mobilize public and private financing to support nature-based solutions and disaster risk reduction, and political will and leadership, to create pro-nature laws and regulations. Nevertheless, said the General Assembly President, it was encouraging to see that multilateralism continues to deliver the needs of the people served by the UN, and called on delegates to ensure that their efforts will be remembered 75 years from now. And, as the Summit ends with a musical performance from Indian composer Ricky Kej, we’ll say goodbye from UN News, and thanks for following us! 18:00 We’ve seen two Leaders’ Dialogues, one on addressing biodiversity loss, and the second on how to harness innovation, and financing for biodiversity, take place this afternoon. The dialogues involved plenty of heavy-weight speakers, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Pakistan’s President Imran Khan, and the heads of several UN agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), the International Labour Organization ( ), and World Bank. You can watch the speeches again on .   16:20 Youth climate leaders have presented a and during side-event at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The initiative outlines 12 priorities of young people to be addressed to achieve the 2050 vision of “living in harmony with nature.” The young people, who come from different social backgrounds, ethnicities, genders and geographies, requested world leaders to declare a “planetary emergency,” in relation to the worsening climate and biodiversity crises. They ask for heads of state to develop strategies for effective conservation and restoration, adopt binding environmental targets, create transformative education in schools, uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples, protect environmental defenders, ensure intergenerational equity and to be accountable.

You can follow the speeches on . We’ll be back later to bring you the concluding remarks from the President of the General Assembly, and the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina Mohammed. Until then, Here’s the perspective of Mohammed Alkhalid, from Saudi Arabia, a  : “Young people are the protectors and custodians of planet Earth. The sustainability of the planet is our responsibility and that’s why I took part in the Young Champions of the Earth to work with experts, exchange ideas, gain experience, and engage with decision-makers to set up laws and incentives to plant trees, and to make Saudi Arabia greener.” Read more about Mohammed Alkhalid .  11:50 Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, took part in today’s event, and announced, via a pre-recorded video, that he is working with a “coalition of the willing” to put nature, people and planet at the heart of the economy. The Prince called for a new “Marshall Plan” for a “blue-green recovery’ rooted in a new circular economy, that has nature at its centre, and went on to list some ways to bring this about. These include implementing carbon pricing; accelerating carbon capture technology, including nature-based solutions; and ending “perverse” subsidies for fossil fuels. “We know what we need to do, but we have to take bold steps now”, he concluded. “So let’s get on with it!”   11:30 Fernanda Samuel from Angola is another UN Environment Programme . Speaking to UN News she said: “You cannot talk about fighting poverty and economic growth without a serious commitment to protect natural resources, flora and fauna, soil, rivers and oceans." Read more about Fernanda Samuel .   11:15 Richard Wambua was chosen by the UN Environment Programme ( ) as a one of 35 people from around the world identified by UNEP as providing “an impressive array of scalable, innovative and potentially impactful solutions to some of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges”. [you can read more about Richard ] "Biodiversity loss is greatly threatening the tourism industry in Kenya which has also been hard hit by , as fewer tourists are coming because there is less to see.  Thousands of jobs are being affected. Additionally, due to deforestation and higher than usual temperature levels on the Indian Ocean, there has been increased rainfall and flooding. Kenyans living around Lake Baringo and Lake Bogoria have witnessed a rapid rise in water levels. The two lakes used to be 20 kilometres apart but are now a few kilometres from each other. When the two mix, they will contaminate each other since one is highly saline while the other is a fresh water lake, resulting in the death of biodiversity and a decrease in the food supply. Developing countries are most vulnerable to climate change, which aggravates the effects of population growth, poverty and rapid urbanization, resulting in habitat fragmentation and the loss of biodiversity. Thus, it is highly imperative that young people take charge, are on the forefront and exert the right amount of pressure which includes having a seat at the table. We can contribute towards the implementation of environmentally-conscious policies, hence further protecting our countries and our planet. Take Africa for instance; 75 per cent of its population are youthful and highly reliant on biodiversity for food, clean water, medicines, and protection from extreme climatic events. Inculcating a mindset change that favors biodiversity protection would be a sure way to ensure forests don’t become deserts, reefs don’t become rocks. The more young people are aware and involved, the better the planet’s biodiversity will be!" The Secretary-General has clearly pointed out that, “Investing in nature would protect biodiversity & improve climate action, human health & food security”. What such investments would also lead to, is jobs, for many youth and citizens from developing countries.  11:00 The Summit has now moved on to the “Fireside Chat” segment, featuring Achim Steiner, the head of the UN Development Programme ( ), Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment agency, , Elizabeth Mrema, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) chief, and Ana Maria Hernandéz Salgar, who runs the Inter-governmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). On Monday, Ms. Andersen and Ms. Mrema were interviewed by our very own Paulina Greer, as part of the SDG Media Zone UNGA High-Level Week series, where they gave more detail about the Leaders’ Pledge for Nature. Here’s how it went:  10:50 ‘Nature is fighting back’, UN economic chief Munir Akram, the head of the UN Economic and Social Council ( ) followed the Secretary-General, echoing many of the topics covered by Mr. Guterres and Mr. Bozkir. Biodiversity, said Mr. Akram, allowed mankind to build great civilizations, providing nutrition, food, clean air and water, natural medicines and raw materials, and to survive, grow and prosper.Hwever, demand for energy and raw materials has grown with the population, harming the environment, hewarned: “nature is fighting back”, and the impacts of biodiversity loss will be as devastating as climate change: masks could be a permanent aspect our existence. Political will is critical to achieve change, he concluded. It can be mobilized through events such as the Summit, which is of “existential importance”. Mr. Akram added that it is time to discard economic models that are driving States to fight nature and each other, and transition to a new economic and social paradigm which values the preservation of nature, and enshrines sustainability as an integral part of development.  Delegates then watched pre-recorded speeches by the President of Egypt, Mohammed El-Sisi, and Xi Jinping of China. They were invited to speak because Egypt was the host of the 2018 COP (Conference of Parties) of the Convention on Biological Diversity, and China is scheduled to host the next one in 2021.  10:30 ‘Humanity is waging war on nature’, says Guterres The UN chief, António Guterres, has just wrapped up to the Summit, in which he accused humanity of “waging war on nature”. Deforestation, climate change and the conversion of wilderness for human food production are, said the UN chief, destroying Earth’s web of life: “we are part of that fragile web -- and we need it to be healthy so we and future generations may thrive.” One of the aims of this Summit is to secure increased ambition for biodiversity: the Secretary-General noted that, despite repeated commitments, efforts have not been sufficient to meet any of the global biodiversity targets set for this year. By living in harmony with nature, he continued, the worst impacts of climate change can be avoided, for the benefit of people and the planet. Mr. Guterres raised the encouraging prospects of nature-based solutions: forests, oceans and intact ecosystems are effective carbon sinks, for example, and healthy wetlands mitigate flooding. Count natural resources as wealth Economic systems, he continued, must account for and invest in nature which, currently, does not figure in countries’ calculations of wealth. The current system, he said, is weighted towards destruction, not preservation, but investing in nature would protect biodiversity and improve climate action, human health, and food security. Protecting biodiversity and the environment can be a business opportunity: the Convention on Biological Diversity estimates that services from ecosystems make up between 50 and 90 per cent of the livelihoods of poor rural and forest-dwelling households, and poor communities can benefit from sustainable farming, eco-tourism and subsistence fishing. The Secretary-General welcomed the commitments made in the Leader’s Pledge for Nature and coalitions such as the Campaign for Nature launched at the UN Climate Action Summit in 2019 which, he said, send a strong signal to raise political ambition in the run-up to COP15 of the Convention of Biological Diversity. “Where effort has been made”, he declared “the benefits to our economies, human and planetary health are irrefutable.”   10:10 'Our existence on this planet, depends entirely on our ability to protect the natural world' The UN Summit on Biodiversity began a few minutes ago, and was opened by the President of the General Assembly, Volkan Bozkir, who began by outlining the high stakes involved in the issue of biodiversity, stating that “our existence on this planet depends entirely on our ability to protect the natural world around us”. Despite the importance of biodiversity, we are not doing a great job at protecting it: 13 million hectares of forest are lost every year, and one million species are at risk of extinction. We also risk, he said, jeopardizing food security, water supplies, livelihoods, and our ability to fight diseases and face extreme events. Health and biodiversity At a time when our collective health is top of mind, Mr. Bozkir noted the link between healthcare and biodiversity: four billion people depend upon natural medicines for their health, and 70 per cent of drugs used for cancer treatments are drawn from nature. Poor stewardship of the environment is putting our health at risk, as the majority of infectious diseases, including , originated from animal populations, a threat that scientists have been warning about for decades. The GA President re-emphasized calls for a “green recovery’ that addresses these concerns, and leads to a more sustainable, resilient world which, he said, would help unlock an estimated $10 trillion in business opportunities, create 395 million jobs by 2030, and encourage a greener economy. Wrapping up his opening remarks, Mr. Bozkir argued that biodiversity should be protected from a moral, economic and existential standpoint, an act that is “an investment in the health of our planet, is an investment in our future; one that we leave for future generations.”   09:40 Here are two more preview videos released on Twitter, ahead of the Summit. The UN Development Programme ( ) and the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) have both focused on the , which has so far been endorsed by 72 countries. The Pledge commits countries to ensuring that they are working in harmony with nature, and putting biodiversity, climate and the environment as a whole at the heart of their recovery strategies.  🌿 Nature must be at the heart of sustainable development.

108-> What will power the post-pandemic global economic recovery?
As governments try to kick-start their economies, the UN is calling for recovery plans to be built around low-carbon technologies, to avoid a return to fossil fuel-based "business as usual". Islands at the forefront In island economies, importing fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, comes at  a considerable costs. This is one of the reasons that some of them are becoming front-runners, in the bid to reduce carbon frontprints, by investing in renewable energy sources. Mauritius, for example, is planning to generate over a third of its electricity from renewable sources within the next five years. Projects supported by the UN Development Programme ( ), will be an important part of this transition, bringing an additional 25 Mega Watts of solar power to Mauritius, including a mini-power grid in Agalega, one of the outer islands. At the current pace, it would take the world forever to come anywhere near a no-carbon system.  As well as reducing pollution, this shift to clean energy is expected to aid economic recovery, with new jobs in areas such as the production, installation, and maintenance of renewable energy equipment, from solar panels, to batteries and wind turbines. Another added benefit is energy security: with such a high dependence on imported oil, price fluctuations can make budgeting difficult, and any interruption to supply can have serious consequences. “Home-grown” energy from renewable sources can make the energy grid more reliable, and more resilient. The Pacific US State of Hawaii is planning to go even further and become a trailblazer for the rest of the United States, by going completely renewable by 2045. As Hawaii State Governor, David Ige, explained to UN News, their commitment is now moving to the mainstream: “at the time we enacted the law to commit to 100 per cent renewables, no other community had done anything similar and at the National Governors’ Association, people were generally very surprised. They thought that it was so beyond possible that it was a foolish undertaking. Now, California has embraced the commitment to 100 per cent clean renewable energy and other states are contemplating doing the same. I’m proud that Hawaii has really inspired other states and communities.” Time to change the entire energy system As economies recover post-pandemic, following these examples will be essential to turn the tide and, as a new report from REN21 – a renewable energy think tank that includes the UN Environment Programme ( ) and UN Development Programme (UNDP) amongst its members – shows, remarkable progress has been made by the renewable energy industry, where costs are falling, and clean energy use is increase. However, this good news is currently offset by the fact that global energy use is rising, and is being powered, in the main, by fossil fuels. Following the release of the report, on 16 June, Rana Adib, REN21’s Executive Director, underlined the fact that the pandemic-related emissions drop barely makes a dent in the long-term problem of climate change, and an overhaul of the entire energy system is needed: “Even if the lockdowns were to continue for a decade, the change would not be sufficient. At the current pace, with the current system and current market rules, it would take the world forever to come anywhere near a no-carbon system.” The report warns that many recovery programmes include commitments to stick with dirty, polluting fossil fuel systems: whilst some countries are phasing out coal, others continue to invest in new coal-fired power plants. In addition, funding from private banks for fossil fuel projects has increased each year since the signing of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, totalling some USD 2.7 trillion over the last three years. “Some directly promote natural gas, coal or oil. Others, though claiming a green focus, build the roof and forget the foundation,” warned Ms. Adib. “Take electric cars and hydrogen, for example. These technologies are only green if powered by renewables.” Clean is cost-effective Nevertheless, Mauritius and Hawaii show that a green option is not only possible, but actually a better deal than a fossil-fuel based recovery plan, especially when the true costs, including air pollution, climate change effects and traffic congestion, are factored in. A new book from the World Bank, Technology Transfer and Innovation for Low-carbon Development, shows that most of the emissions reductions needed to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, can be achieved if existing, commercially proven low-carbon technology is adopted on a massive scale. As Inger Andersen, the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) explains, “renewables are now more cost-effective than ever, providing an opportunity to prioritize clean economic recovery packages and bring the world closer to meeting the Goals. Renewables are a key pillar of a healthy, safe and green recovery that leaves no one behind.” When Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2020, a report from UNEP, The Frankfurt School, and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, was released in June, it further underlined the plummeting costs of clean energy, highlighting the fact that “putting these dollars into renewables will buy more generation capacity than ever before”, and help countries deliver on stronger climate action. “If governments take advantage of the ever-falling price tag of renewables to put clean energy at the heart of COVID -19 economic recovery, instead of subsidizing the recovery of fossil-fuel industries”, said Ms. Andersen, “they can take a big step towards clean energy and a healthy natural world, which ultimately is the best insurance policy against global pandemics.” An opportunity for a cleaner world The economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant fall in harmful greenhouse emissions and, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), 2020 will see a drop of around eight per cent. This has given us an idea of what a cleaner world might look like, but it is only a temporary respite: it has also had devastating consequences, including the shuttering of entire sectors, and unemployment for millions of people. Now, with countries and regions like Mauritius and Hawaii investing in policies, programmes and initiatives to get people back to work, there is an opportunity for a more sustainable approach, with renewable technologies at its heart. The question is whether the international community will seize this opportunity, or stick with the devil they know.

109-> FROM THE FIELD: Hardy seeds bear fruit to protect Colombia’s environment
Communities in Colombia in South America are being helped by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to preserve and reintroduce indigenous crops as a way to combat the effects of climate change. The Antioquia region, a key agricultural area, has experienced steadily rising temperatures and now dry seasons are lasting longer. Rains, when they arrive, are more intense and often lead to flooding. In response, local farmers have been working with the UN to identify crops which are more resistant to drought and flooding. Seeds, including cashew, loquat and tamarind have been collected using age-old indigenous knowledge and now the efforts of farmers are beginning to bear fruit.

110-> Thursday's Daily Brief: UN chief remembers former Assembly President, Council on Africa's Great Lakes, FAO data shows stable food prices
A recap of Thursday's stories: Guterres addresses climate emergency in op-ed; UN envoy highlights 'golden opportunity' for Africa's Great Lakes region; FAO scales up banana crop protection against disease; Data shows September food prices held steady; Somalia Partnership Forum concludes.  When it comes to the climate emergency, “we have a long way to go. But the movement has begun,” UN declared in a widely-distributed opinion piece on Thursday, reaffirming his concern over the threats posed by a warming world, unless more urgent action is taken. In his op-ed, published by a consortium of more than 170 news outlets under the banner Covering Climate Now, which has an audience of hundreds of millions, he recalled that “on the eve of the September UN , young women and men around the world mobilized by the millions and told global leaders: ‘You are failing us.’” “They are right,'' he lamented. Here’s the full The international community must step up efforts to end instability around Africa’s Great Lakes so that millions there can benefit from its riches, the UN Special Envoy for the region told the on Thursday. “The Great Lakes region is, more than ever before in recent history, resolutely committed to pursuing stability for itself”, Huang Xia said in his first briefing to the 15 Council members since being appointed in January. The UN Special Envoy called for action to strengthen development programmes and accelerate integration among the nations of the vast Great Lakes region, among other support. Get the full story Efforts redoubled to protect banana crops from disease threat In a renewed effort to help protect banana crops in Latin America and the Caribbean, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has launched an emergency project to curb major plant losses threatened by a fungal disease, the agency announced on Thursday. Under ’s Technical Cooperation Programme, the project will work to fight the spread of Fusarium wilt, a fungal plant disease that can wipe out plantations of banana crops, upon which millions of people depend for their livelihoods. Assistant FAO chief and Regional Representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, Julio Berdegué, that “the role of bananas in providing food and household income in this region cannot be understated.” Read our full story The price of food is holding steady, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which tracks monthly changes in international prices of traded goods in its Food Price Index. The agency said on Thursday that costs of popular food items remain “virtually unchanged” from August to September, and 3.3 per cent higher than exactly one year ago. While the Vegetable Oil Price Index rose 1.4 per cent in September, its highest level in over a year, Soy and sunflower oil dropped. Conversely, sugar costs slipped by 3.9 per cent from August to September, next to drops in dairy prices by 0.6 per cent.

111-> Treat climate crisis with ‘greatest urgency’, Bahamas leader tells UN Assembly
Hurricane Dorian, one of the most destructive Atlantic storms ever recorded, “is a generational tragedy” for The Bahamas, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said on Friday. the , nearly one month after devastated two major population centres in the archipelagic nation, Mr. Minnis urged his fellow world leaders to treat the climate crisis as the greatest challenge to the planet. “I add my urgent plea to the cries and voices of many other leaders and citizens of the global commons, urging the nations of the world here assembled to treat the global climate emergency as the greatest challenge facing humanity. “It is a challenge that, if not treated with the greatest urgency, will continue to ravage small island states, such as The Bahamas, and will also have devastating impact on more developed states.” Hurricane Dorian slammed two islands in the northern Bahamas, Abaco and Grand Bahama, causing 56 deaths. Six hundred people are still missing. At its peak, the hurricane packed winds of 185 miles per hour and generated storm surges as high as 23 feet. Prime Minister Minnis described Hurricane Dorian as a “physical apocalypse” for some communities which include Marsh Harbour, the formerly picturesque main town on Abaco, now reduced to rubble. Although the hurricane has left Bahamians heartbroken, he said citizens are grateful for international assistance received in the aftermath. Prior to Dorian, The Bahamas was hit by major hurricanes from 2015 to 2017. Hurricanes in the region have grown “increasingly lethal” over the past three decades, according to Mr. Minnis. He added that because the islands of The Bahamas stretch over some 180,000 square miles of ocean, the country can be affected by any number of hurricane trajectories. “Our heating climate results in the increased severity and frequency of hurricanes for our archipelago, and also destroys our natural defenses against such storms. Coral and mangrove degradation, land erosion, increased tidal movements and the myriad other consequences of global warming, increase our vulnerability and handicap our ability to develop and to establish effective resilience,” he continued. Mr. Minnis said small island countries “are on the frontlines of being swallowed into an abyss created initially by human activity and increasingly by inaction.” The Prime Minister expressed support for the UN Secretary-General’s strategy to address the climate crisis, including his call to provide concessionary financing to affected nations.

112-> UN commits to help Pacific island agriculture adapt and survive climate crisis
The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) pledged on Friday to work hand in hand with the people of the Pacific to improve nutrition, and mitigate the worst effects of climate change, which pose an existential threat to many island nations across the region. The commitment came at a joint meeting of Pacific Ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, as part of the Pacific Week of Agriculture being held in Samoa, convened jointly by and the Pacific Community (SPC). Pacific Ministers of Ag. and Forestry Meeting in . 's Assist. Director-General encourages partnerships promoting inclusiveness across countries & sectors, facilitating investments for better results based on scientific evidence.   Many Pacific island countries, and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) around the world, are disproportionately threatened by climate change and the impacts of severe weather events, says FAO, a point during last week’s landmark summit on SIDS and the unique challenges they face, at UN Headquarters in New York. Coupled with the vulnerability to rising sea levels and crippling extreme weather events, the small size and isolation of many Pacific island communities has also led to unhealthy diets though an increasing reliance on imported, processed foods. Many of these foods are high in fat, sugar and salt, leading to a crisis of obesity. The Pacific region is home to all the countries ranked in the top ten highest obesity rates globally, and it has the highest prevalence of diabetes per capita, FAO notes. “While responding to obesity is a big challenge, the prevalence of stunting in children under-five in the Pacific is also a major concern. It is running at almost 40 percent, the highest rate of any subregion in Asia and the Pacific,” said Kundhavi Kadiresan, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Asia and the Pacific. “Globally, the prevalence of undernourishment is around 17.5 percent in SIDS countries, compared to a worldwide average of around 11 percent,” she added in her opening remarks to Ministers. Working towards 2030 The region has made progress in implementing an action programme on food security and nutrition, but much more will need to be achieved if the Pacific Islands are to meet the 2030 . “This is real progress, but what is still needed is a paradigm shift to accelerate actions and achieve real impact on the nutrition front and in responding to the threats of climate change in the Pacific,” Ms. Kadiresan said, noting that FAO outlined a new initiative last week that matches the least developed SIDS – those with the highest rates of hunger and poverty – together with developed countries. “The ‘ ’ will reach out to a wide range of partners including governments, the private sector, global foundations and others.” The meeting heard how a multi-pronged approach could put modern technology and new innovations into the hands of small scale farmers, alongside an effort to rediscover healthy, locally produced foods that will improve diets and lower the reliance on imported, processed foods. “Re-invigorating and re-establishing production of some of the healthier and naturally available local foods is a win-win approach. After all, generations of Pacific Islanders who farmed the lands and harvested fish from the sea knew what they were doing”, exclaimed Ms. Kadiresan. “They were providing nutritious foods for their families and maintaining livelihoods that were passed father-to-son, mother-to-daughter, father-to-daughter and so on...Today we call these ‘food systems and value chains’. The names might have changed, but the sensibilities have not.”

Catastrophic flooding and rising food and health costs in Sudan, have driven up the number of people in need, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ) said on Friday. Authorities declared a three-month state of emergency in early September after the worst flooding in 30 years. To date, more than 860,000 people have had houses destroyed or damaged and more than 120 people have died. Some 560 schools and thousands of health facilities have also been affected, compromising essential services to communities, especially in North Darfur, Khartoum, West Darfur and Sennar, which account for 52 per cent of all people affected. economic crisis, inflation, underdevelopment, floods, disease outbreaks, and conflict are ⬆️humanitarian needs: •Price of food basket ⬆️by 200% vs 2019 •Inflation reached 170% in August •9.6M people food insecure •Health costs ⬆️90% More:  400,000 reached and counting The response by UN agencies and partners has reached more than 400,000 people so far, including emergency shelter and essential household items relief to over 181,000 flood-affected refugees, 1.87 million internally displaced people and Sudanese across the country. Meanwhile, virus transmission has continued, with 13,653 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 836 deaths, according official data from the World Health Organization ( ). Amid growing needs, surging inflation – reaching nearly 170 per cent in August - has caused a shortage of basic commodities and increased prices of some locally sourced supplies by 300 to 400 per cent. “In some cases, by the time the procurement process is finalized, the supplies have increased prices, so that the original budgets are no longer valid”, said spokesperson Jens Laerke. He explained that this meant the purchasing process had to begin again and “there is no guarantee that by the time that that process is done, that the prices will not have risen once again”. Healthcare costs have also increased by up to 90 per cent, OCHA Sudan said in a recent . In Geneva, Mr. Laerke noted that the price of an average family food basket had increased by over 200 per cent since last year, based on World Food Programme ( ) data, increasing pressure on already dramatic levels of food insecurity across Sudan, where 9.6 million people are described as “severely” in need. Cash shortfalls and crop failure Inflation has also affected the UN’s humanitarian partners which provide cash support to vulnerable families, as they are constantly having to adjust the amounts transferred, Mr. Laerke said. Even with these adjustments, many families are no longer able to purchase what they need with the cash received: today, only one in four families who previously relied on outside assistance now receives it, the OCHA spokesperson said. Another concern in Sudan is that large areas of farmland are under water or ruined just before harvest.  “Most families in Sudan already spent around 65 per cent of their income on food, so these price hikes lead to increased hunger and less education, health and other services that families de-prioritize as they try to cope with the economic hardship”, Mr. Laerke explained. Increased risks to pregnant women The UN population fund ( ) has estimated that some 187,500 women of reproductive age are living in temporary flood shelters with minimal protection measures to ensure their safety and security. The damage to health clinics, hospitals and latrines poses further risks. 12,000 women are pregnant and more than 1,300 women will give birth in the coming month, said the agency. Of these women, 600 will likely experience complications in birth and require life-saving sexual and reproductive health services. In addition to urgent health needs, displaced women face limited settlement options, and financial difficulties as a result of job loss. They also face increased risk of gender-based violence, with limited services threatened by damaged facilities and networks. “Sudan needs immediate support to ward off this humanitarian crisis”, said said Massimo Diana, the UNFPA representative in Sudan. “Flooding means that economic livelihoods are destroyed and that disproportionately affects women. Stress means more domestic violence. Local health services are interrupted and support networks are disrupted.” UNFPA has helped to rehabilitate 16 emergency obstetric and newborn care facilities in seven regions of Sudan, support that can mean the difference between life and death for displaced pregnant women.

114-> Climate crisis could see ‘collapse’ of some economies without diversification, warns UN trade chief
Climate change poses an “existential threat to commodity-dependent developing countries”, the United Nation’s trade chief said on Wednesday, pointing to a newly released report highlighting the need to diversify economies and exports. The UN Conference on Trade and Development ( )’s , maintains that diversification could be either “horizontal”, meaning venturing into new goods and sectors to reduce dependence on a narrow range of commodities – or vertical, which involves increasing a commodity’s value. “The climate crisis…will result in the collapse of some economies if decisive action is not taken now,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi stressed. “Now more than ever before, these countries need to assess their diversification potential and reduce their commodity dependence, which for decades has kept them exposed to volatile markets and climate change”. According to the report, a successful diversification strategy will mostly likely involve a combination of horizontal policies, such education and health investments, and targeted measures to promote promising sectors. Shifting practices The climate crisis puts commodity-dependent developing countries most at risk because their economies depend on sectors which are highly exposed to extreme weather events, according to the report. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are among the worst affected, as are crop and fisheries production, which historically exist in low-latitude regions – where most commodity-dependent developing countries are located. The report underscores that the high risk faced by these countries reinforces their need to adapt, diversify and modernize their economies. Something's not right. 90% of fishermen work in small fleets, but 80% of go to big fleets. Why, when 33% of the world’s fish resources are overfished & 60% are being fished to their biologically sustainable limit? We discuss at the first . But the report maintains that tackling climate change presents some opportunities to these countries, such as boosting production of alternatives to cattle meat and milk. Moreover, according to the report, the quest for climate mitigation and adaptation has spurred investments in technological innovations that could benefit these countries; for example, solar photovoltaic cells, which could bolster energy security and support commodity sectors in remote areas not connected to national power grids. Bringing Paris Agreement home The report echoes experts’ warnings that commitments made by countries to mitigate climate change under the are not ambitious enough but must instead be quadrupled to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. For this, stronger political will and greater mobilization of financial and human resources are necessary. The report underlines that climate-related funding, which is currently only a fraction of actual requirements, needs to be substantially scaled up given the high cost of climate mitigation and adaptation. In addition, greening fiscal policies can help to ensure that taxes, subsidies and similar policy instruments assist in implementing action plans that would also work toward achieving the (SDGs). Climate actions need to be strengthened, including by building technical and regulatory capacities for institutions to implement more effective policies, and the report suggests reforming fossil fuel subsidies to further green fiscal policies. Finally, developed countries need to meet their commitment under the to transfer environmentally friendly technologies to developing countries to help them effectively participate in global efforts to mitigate and adapt.

115-> UN’s Guterres: Broad climate ‘movement’ has begun, but there’s a long way to go
When it comes to the climate emergency, “we have a long way to go. But the movement has begun,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres declared in a widely-distributed opinion piece on Thursday, reaffirming his concern over the threats posed by a warming world, unless more urgent action is taken. In his op-ed, published by a consortium of more than 170 news outlets under the banner Covering Climate Now, which has an audience of hundreds of millions, he recalled that “on the eve of the September UN , young women and men around the world mobilized by the millions and told global leaders: ‘You are failing us.’” “They are right,'' he lamented. “The science is undeniable” continued, and while some come to understand the climate crisis through data, those suffering its effects “can simply look out the window.” Last week, as world leaders convened for the start of the of the UN General Assembly, talks kicked off with the first-ever summit devoted to for which Mr. Guterres urged delegates to come with concrete plans for achieving carbon neutrality and slashing emissions, rather than “beautiful speeches”. Meanwhile, millions of the world’s youth mobilized in protest of government inaction, for the largest climate demonstration in history. September’s Climate Action Summit aimed to “serve as a springboard” to fast-track Member States “to crucial 2020 deadlines established by the ”, the Secretary-General explained. “And many leaders - from many countries and sectors - stepped up”, he added, noting that more than 70 countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, while 100 cities, including several of the world’s largest, pledged to do the same. The UN chief’s challenge for States to act, was fruitful; an additional 70 countries announced intentions to boost national plans; Small Island Developing States promised to move to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030; countries across the globe vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees; and some of the world’s richest pledged to invest in carbon-neutral portfolios. Mr. Guterres stressed that “these steps are important - but they are not sufficient.” He said he will continue to encourage more action for climate solutions now that the Summit has concluded. Radical change will not happen overnight, he writes, and to “avoid the climate cliff”, we must gain momentum in responding to science-cutting emissions by 45 per cent by the year 2020, and live in a carbon-neutral world, come 2050. A follow up UN Climate in Santiago, Chile, set for early December, will be an opportunity to hold the private sector and local authorities’ accountable for commitments made at the General Assembly, Mr. Guterres said. At the current rate of global heating, we face an increase of “at least 3 degrees Celsius” in global temperature by the end of the century. “I will not be there, but my granddaughters will”, he said. “I refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home.” “We have a long way to go.” he cautioned. “But the movement has begun.”

116-> Pacific Islands on the front line of climate change: UN chief
The concerns of the Pacific Islands, on the front line of climate change, are at the heart of the United Nations work, said Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday, at a meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum ( ), an intergovernmental organization, which holds status. The meeting, at UN Headquarters in New York, comes shortly after the organization’s annual summit, in Nauru on 3-6 September, which reaffirmed in an known as the Boe Declaration, that “climate change remains the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific.” Mr. Guterres said that, with (the 24th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) coming up in November, and the scheduled for September 2019, the world needs to urgently step up action, adding that climate change is absolute priority: "I am very concerned. It will be the central concern to ensure countries enhance their ambitions over the next two years. For the moment, unfortunately we are going too slow regarding what we promised in Paris. And what we promised in Paris was not enough." The Secretary-General thanked the PIF for including climate change as a security issue at the Nauru summit: the Boe Declaration expands the PIF’s concept of security to include “human security, humanitarian assistance, prioritizing environmental security and regional cooperation in building resilience to disasters and climate change.” He recognized the efforts of the PIF to prevent conflict, citing the leadership of Solomon Islands Prime Minister, Rick Hou, in taking forward peacebuilding priorities, and congratulating the Government of Papua New Guinea and the Autonomous Bougainville Government on implementing the . The PIF has taken a robust, regional approach to the implementation of The on Sustainable Development and the (which outlines action to be taken by Small Island Developing States), an approach appreciated by the Secretary-General. With several members of the Forum showing improved economic growth, and close to leaving the “Least Developed Countries” socio-economic bracket, the UN Chief stated the UN’s commitment to supporting graduating countries on their sustained path to development and prosperity: "Many countries that graduate continue to face shocks. It is important that the international community, including international financial institutions, continues to recognize this." He also commended action by Forum States to end gender-based violence in the Pacific – strengthening women’s political and economic participation and deepening women’s rights – and continuing efforts to expand opportunities for young people in the region. The Secretary-General concluded by thanking Pacific Island leaders for their support in the ongoing UN reform effort, promising to continue seeking their inputs and perspectives, and making a personal commitment to work with them for a safer, more secure and prosperous future for the people of the Pacific region. Forum leaders welcomed the Secretary-General’s leadership on climate change, calling for the appointment of a Special Adviser on Climate Change and Security, to strengthen the global focus on climate change as a security risk.

117-> Extraordinary ‘megaflash’ lightning strikes cover several hundred kilometres, smashing records
New records for extreme lightning bursts, or ‘megaflashes’, during 2019, have been made official, more than doubling the size and duration of the previous record flashes, the UN’s weather agency, WMO, announced on Thursday. Closing the windows and covering your pet’s ears, during the ensuing thunder, probably wouldn’t have made much difference to anyone stuck in the middle of the flash that developed continuously over northern Argentina on 4 March 2019, lasting a whopping 16.73 seconds. And the flash that stretched more than 700 kilometres (400 miles) across southern Brazil on 31 October last year, was equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington DC in the United States, or between London, England, and Basel, Switzerland. The previous megaflash distance record was 321 km (199.5 miles) on 20 June 2007, across the US state of Oklahoma, and the previous continuous duration record, was a puny-by-comparison 7.74 seconds, reached on 30 August 2012 in southern France. Seen from space The new record-breaking strikes, captured by the American Geophysical Union ahead of on 28 June, were recorded by equipment carried on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, and their orbiting counterparts from Europe and China. The records were described by Professor Randall Cerveny, chief rapporteur of Weather and Climate Extremes for WMO, as “extraordinary”: “Environmental extremes are living measurements of what nature is capable of, as well as scientific progress in being able to make such assessments”, he added. “It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as lightning detection technology improves.” Professor Cerveny said the technology could help scientists better understand the whole science of lightning, and potentially save lives: “This will provide valuable information for establishing limits to the scale of lightning – including megaflashes – for engineering, safety and scientific concerns.” Stay inside The WMO reiterated the dangers of lightning, and the many lives it claims every year. Previous extreme examples have led to major loss of life: in 1975, for example, 21 people in Zimbabwe were killed when a single flash hit the hut in which they were sheltering, and 469 people were killed in Dronka, Egypt  in 1994, when lightning tragically struck a set of oil tanks, causing burning oil to flood the town. The official advice from the agency is to follow the 30-30 rule: if the time between flash and thunder is less than 30 seconds, stay inside, and wait 30 minutes after the last observed flash, to resume outdoor activities.

118-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Fighting drought with Somalia’s sand dams
The construction of sand dams which retain water above and below sand bars, is improving access to water supplies for people in Somalia as the country continues to weather periods of damaging drought. Parts of the Horn of Africa nation have not received rain for three consecutive years and, as a result, crops and livestock have perished. Many fear a repeat of the 2011 famine in which nearly 260,000 people died. But now the -supported sand dams are providing immediate access to water and a longer-term solution to the challenges of climate change-related droughts. , about how the UN is helping to build the resilience of communities in Somalia.

119-> UN announces roadmap to Climate Summit in 2019, a ‘critical year’ for climate action
2019 is a critical year, the “last chance” for the international community to take effective action on climate change, General Assembly President said on Thursday, during a briefing to announce the UN’s roadmap to the in September. Ms. Espinosa was speaking alongside the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General on the Climate Summit, Ambassador of Mexico, at UN Headquarters in New York. Ms. Espinosa said that, with the deadline for achieving the first targets of the for Sustainable Development fast approaching, described by as “the UN’s blueprint for peace, justice and prosperity on a healthy planet”, the world stood at a crossroads. Two-thirds of these targets, she said, depend on climate and environment goals, and a five-fold increase in commitments from their current levels is needed in order to meet the targets set at the landmark 2015 on dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance, due to come into force in 2020. The General Assembly President walked the representatives of Member States through some of the key events of 2019, leading up to, and following, the Climate Summit. All of the events, she said, share two goals: a doubling of commitments and ambition at a national level, and ensuring the inclusion of diverse groups in the process of climate action. March will see the General Assembly on Climate and Sustainable Development for All, which is intended to build on the success of , the 2018 climate conference in Katowice, Poland, which led to the establishment of a “rulebook” for the reporting of emissions and the progress made in cutting them, every year from 2024. The March meeting will welcome representatives of the private sector, civil society and young people, and look to harness the enthusiasm of the latter group, who, said Ms. Espinosa, will be most affected by a warming world. On the 30th of June, in the build up to the Climate Summit, a “stocktaking” event will take place in Abu Dhabi, followed by a under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council in July, which will see a review of the progress made in achieving (“urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”). The Climate Summit will be followed by the first-ever , sponsored by the General Assembly on September 24. The year will be rounded off by the 2019 Climate Conference , which will take place in Chile. Multilateralism, said Ms. Espinosa, is the only effective to combat climate change, which is one of the main challenges facing the world and can only be overcome with constructive input from all. She concluded with a proverb: “’If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you wish to go far, go together.’ Let’s travel this road together.” Ambassador de Alba, following Ms. Espinosa, confirmed that the world is falling well behind targets for combating climate change, with only around a third of the necessary work currently completed. He reminded delegates that there are only between 10 and 12 years left to achieve the goals, and called for a ramping up of ambition. The Special Envoy added that, despite the challenges, an optimistic signal must be given: that it is possible to counter climate change, enjoy economic growth and eradicate poverty. “We can also meet social needs, healthcare needs and human rights needs,” he said, and bring about a “win-win situation to answer the doubters.” 2019 needs to see action, continued Ambassador de Alba, including partnerships with the private sector and civil society, and a huge mobilization of resources ( a target of 1 trillion dollars per year to support developing countries has been set), to invest “in our future, for jobs in a green future.”

120-> Ozone on track to heal completely in our lifetime, UN environment agency declares on World Day.
At the current momentum, scientists predict the planet’s protective shield of gas - or ozone layer as we know it - will be completely healed as far as some regions of the planet are concerned, by the 2030’s, the UN’s environmental agency (UNEP) revealed on Monday. The phaseout of controlled uses of ozone-depleting substances has not only helped replenish the protective layer for future generations but is also helping guard human health by filtering harmful rays from reaching Earth, said shared in a . The recognition of this success comes on marked 16 September. This year celebrates “32 Years and Healing”; a commemoration of the international commitment to protect the ozone later and the climate under the historic , which has led to the phase-out of 99 per cent of ozone-depleting chemicals in refrigerators, air-conditioners and other consumer products. Since 2000, parts of the ozone layer have recovered at a rate of 1-3 per cent every ten years, the latest estimates. At projected rates the “Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone will heal completely by the 2030’s”, UNEP said, with the Southern Hemisphere repaired by the 2050’s, and Polar Regions in the following decade. The has averted more than 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions going into the atmosphere from 1990-2010. Find out how the treaty is poised to do more for the climate at   📷  UN Secretary-General, António Guterres “we must be careful not to neglect the ozone layer,” as we “rightly focus our energies on tackling climate change”, spotlighting the importance of preventing threats posed by emission of ozone-depleting gases. Regenerating the ozone has helped curb the effects of climate change - with approximately 135 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from 1990 to 2010 averted by a strong protective shield. As of late last year, the World Meteorological Organization reported the global concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases is still steadily on the rise, with consequential warming effects on the planet and ozone-teardown. Damaging effects of ozone-depleting substances allow increased ultraviolet (or UV) rays to reach the earth, increasing incidents of skin cancers, eye cataracts, compromised immune systems and harm to agricultural lands and forests. The Montreal Protocol is, to date, the only UN treaty to be adopted by all Member States, with all parties sharing responsibilities relating to phasing out ozone-depleting substances, controlled trade of such substances, annual data reporting and other matters. “We can celebrate success,” UNEP said, “but we must all push to keep hold of these gains, in particular by remaining vigilant and tackling any illegal sources of ozone-depleting substances as they arise.” Looking forward, the agency has called for wholehearted support of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, which entered into force on 1 January of this year. The agreement targets the phasing of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), climate-warming gases, which could avoid up to 0.4 degrees Celsius of global temperature rise by end of the century.

121-> UN system mobilizing to support Indonesia, following earthquake and tsunami disaster
Rescue workers are still trying to reach areas of Sulawesi in Indonesia affected by an earthquake and tsunami, UN humanitarians said on Monday, noting that more than 840 people have died and more than 600 have been severely injured in the disaster. The update from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ) follows the 7.4 magnitude tremor which struck Central Sulawesi at 5.02pm local time last Friday. The quake subsequently caused a tsunami that hit coastal areas in Palu City and Donggala which has left more than 48,000 people sheltering in some 200 displacement sites. On Twitter, UN , said on Monday that he had been “following the unfolding tragedy.” The Pacific’s Ring of Fire is the most active seismic zone on the planet and requires special attention when it comes to disaster risk management -  “Our hearts go out to all affected by the earthquake and tsunami. My deepest condolences to all who have lost family and friends,” he said, adding that the UN system was “mobilizing to support government-led rescue and relief efforts as needed.” Before the Sulawesi disaster, on 7 August the Indonesian island of Lombok was rocked by a magnitude 7 earthquake, which left hundreds dead. That quake left about 80 per cent of buildings either damaged or totally destroyed in the north of the island, which is home to around 200,000 people. In addition to national search and rescue teams now in Sulawesi, the relief effort includes the armed forces, police and government officials, the update said. The UN agency added that the Government of Indonesia “welcomed specific offers” of international assistance that are in line with current needs, which according to the national disaster management agency (BNPB), include food, shelter materials, fuel and generators, clean water and medical assistance.   “The humanitarian community working in Indonesia is deeply saddened by the loss of life and the injuries following the earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi,” the OCHA statement said. “Humanitarian agencies are in close communication with the Government to more fully understand the situation in the affected areas and stand ready to support, however is required.” Delivery of aid is ongoing but landslides and damage to essential infrastructure is hampering access. This includes the damage to the runway at Palu airport, which is slowing the movement of equipment and personnel. Messages of support from the UN Secretary-General were echoed by his Special Representative for , : “The earthquake and tsunami are a reminder that the Pacific’s Ring of Fire is the most active seismic zone on the planet and requires special attention when it comes to disaster risk management,” she said. “About 90 per cent of the world’s earthquakes occur there and the risk of an associated tsunami is extremely high which is why early warnings are so important along with public awareness raising and evacuation drills.” According to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, , Indonesia has suffered more deaths from tsunamis than any other country. This is the sixth fatal tsunami to strike the country since the huge 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami claimed approximately 226,000 lives across 12 countries, the vast majority in Indonesia. Earthquakes and tsunamis are responsible for more deaths than extreme weather events, having claimed an estimated 747,234 lives over the last 20 years, according to a new UNISDR report. It will be released next week to coincide with International Day for Disaster Reduction on 13 October.

122-> Global response to poverty and environmental goals 'not ambitious enough’
The global response to realizing poverty and environmental goals agreed by world leaders in 2015 has not been “ambitious enough” according to the UN Secretary-General. In his latest report on the progress towards meeting the targets of the 17 or SDGs, the UN chief António Guterres said that while a “wealth of action” had been taken by governments across the world “the most vulnerable people and countries continue to suffer the most.” The 17 SDGs commit countries to mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change. Read more about the goals. The report tracks progress across 17 goals in the UN’s 193 Member States and largely takes a global view, however while many trends regarding the SDGs are common to all regions, there are significant regional differences. Here are six things you need to know about progress towards some of the key SDGs. Launching the report at UN Headquarters on Tuesday, at the start of the UN ( ), the UN Economic and Social Affairs ( ) chief, Liu Zhenmin, said that the clock for taking decisive action on climate change is ticking. He stressed the importance of strengthening international cooperation and multilateral action. “The challenges highlighted in this report are global problems that require global solutions,” said Mr. Liu. “Just as problems are interrelated, the solutions to poverty, inequality, climate change and other global challenges are also interlinked.”  Described by Mr Guterres last year as an “ ” to humanity, the outlook for meeting targets to reduce climate change is grim. With rising greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring at rates much faster than anticipated and “its effects are clearly felt world-wide.” The target, and remember this was agreed by world leaders, is to keep the rate of global warming to below 2°C and, if possible to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The average global temperature is already 1°C above pre-industrial levels but if not enough is done then warming will continue at an unsustainable pace and could well exceed 3°C by the end of the century. While there are positive steps in terms of individual countries developing climate plans and the increase in the amount of money being found to finance those activities, Mr Guterres said that “far more ambitious plans and accelerated action is needed” on climate mitigation and adaptation.  Extreme poverty, which the UN defines as a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, continues to decline but the decline has slowed to the extent that the world is not on track to achieve the target of less than three per cent of the world living in extreme poverty, by 2030. It’s more likely on current estimates to be around six per cent; that’s around 420 million people, a situation of “grave concern” according to the UN chief. Violent conflicts and disasters have played a role here. In the Arab region, extreme poverty had previously been below three per cent. However, the conflicts in Syria and Yemen have raised the region’s poverty rate and left more people hungry and homeless. Historically speaking, there are reasons for optimism. The share of the world population living in extreme poverty was 10 per cent in 2015, down from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990.  Hunger is on the rise again globally, with an estimated 821 million people undernourished in 2017, up from 784 million in 2015. So, one in nine people across the world are not getting enough to eat. Africa remains the continent with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, affecting one fifth of its population, that’s more than 256 million people. Public investment in agriculture is declining globally, a situation that needs to be reversed according to the Secretary-General. “Small-scale food producers and family farmers require much greater support and increased investment in infrastructure and technology for sustainable agriculture, is urgently needed.” The developing world is most acutely affected by this lack of investment. The share of small-scale food producers in countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 per cent to 85 per cent, compared to less than 10 per cent in Europe.  Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people, increasing life expectancy, reducing maternal and child mortality, and the fight against the most dangerous communicable diseases. Despite those improvements, an estimated 303,000 women around the world died due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2015, the majority in sub-Saharan Africa. Progress has stalled or is not happening fast enough in addressing major diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, while at least half of the global population, that’s some 3.5 billion people, do not have access to essential health services. Mr Guterres said that “concerted efforts are required to achieve universal health coverage, sustainable financing for health and to address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases including mental health.”  Gender violence persists. Globally, about a fifth of women aged 15 to 49, experienced physical or sexual partner-inflicted violence in the last 12 months. The prevalence is highest in the 47 poorest countries in the world, a group the UN calls the or LDCs. While some indicators of gender equality are progressing, such as a significant decline in the prevalence of female genital mutilation and early marriage, the overall numbers continue to be high. Moreover, insufficient progress on structural issues at the root of gender inequality, such as legal discrimination, unfair social norms and attitudes, decision making on sexual and reproductive issues and low levels of political participation, are undermining efforts to achieve targets. The UN Secretary-General has said “there is simply no way that we can achieve the 17 SDGs without achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls.”   Experts agrees that economic growth which includes all sections of society and which is sustainable, can drive progress and generate the means to implement the SDGs. Globally, labour productivity has increased and unemployment is back to levels seen before the financial crash of 2008, however, the global economy is growing at a slower rate. And young people are three times more likely to be unemployed than adults. Mr Guterres said that “more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, particularly for young people, reduce informal employment and the gender pay gap, and promote safe and secure working environments to create decent work for all.”

123-> UN chief commends India’s progress towards Sustainable Development Goals
UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Tuesday praised India’s progress on implementing the Sustainable Development Goals ( ), in particular the pursuit of and , which featured heavily during day-two of his official visit to the country. at the closing session of the Mahatma Gandhi International Sanitation Convention in New Delhi, Mr. Guterres noted Gandhi’s long record of advocacy and action on the issue, adding that the decision to begin marking the 150th anniversary of Gandhi’s birth – which takes place on 2 October next year – with the Convention, was a “fitting tribute to this great human being and example to us all.” An estimated 2.3 billion people, said Mr. Guterres, still do not have basic sanitation facilities. Almost 1 billion defecate in the open, a practice that “poses a serious threat to children, contributing to diarrhoea and to malnutrition and stunting that has a lifelong impact.” The UN chief outlined some of the many consequences and risks of poor sanitation, including disease, stunting and indignity, and pointed out that it “exacerbates inequalities between men and women, rich and poor, city and countryside. And it has major implications for human rights and human dignity.”  He said that women and girls are disproportionately impacted, as they may face an increased risk of harassment and abuse, and higher health risks due to a lack of access to sanitation facilities. Mr. Guterres went on to praise the Indian Government’s Clean India Mission, which seeks to achieve universal sanitation coverage, as the largest investment and largest mobilization campaign in the world. He added that “All people have the right to safe water and sanitation. If we are to build resilient societies on a healthy planet and achieve the overarching ambition of the for Sustainable Development, we must tackle this issue urgently, as is being done in India.” The country, said Mr. Guterres, is well on target to reach the SDG of Sanitation for All – including for women, children, young people, people with disabilities, the elderly, indigenous peoples, the homeless, refugees and migrants – before 2030. On Tuesday evening, the Secretary-General addressed the first general assembly of the International Solar Alliance, an organization initiated several years ago by the Governments of India and France in the build up to the , which describes itself as a coalition of solar resource-rich countries. The UN chief lamented the lack of political commitments to make the transformative decisions that will help to meet the goals set in the : current commitments are falling far short of meeting the target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius and striving for 1.5 degrees. At the same time, he said, the world is witnessing a “global renewable energy revolution,” with solar energy; now competitive with - and often cheaper than - fossil fuels, at the centre. Renewables accounted for some 70 per cent of net additions to global power in 2017, and India has set a goal to mobilize $1 trillion towards the deployment of 1,000 gigawatts of solar energy by 2030. Despite these positive developments, Mr. Guterres said that if we do not change course by 2002, we risk missing the opportunity to avoid “runaway climate change.” This, he said, is why he is convening next September’s , with the aim of bringing climate action to the top of the international agenda, providing leaders and stakeholders with the opportunity to showcase their ambition. Also on Tuesday, Mr. Guterres held a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during which he thanked Mr. Modi for the strong cooperation between India and the UN, especially in support of the UN chief’s organizational reform effort. The Secretary-General also underscored the leadership role that India plays in . The Secretary-General also addressed a group of young people at the India Habitat Centre, where he spoke to them about global challenges and answered questions on challenges facing the international community, including the trust-deficit, growing attacks on multilateralism and climate change.

124-> ‘The world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us,’ Holy See tells UN Assembly
The quality of a civilization, depends on how it treats the weak, the indigent, the elderly, the persons with disability, and by the place it gives them in community life, the representative of the Holy See told the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, urging everyone to value all human life and human dignity. “It is worth recalling here Pope Francis’ words: ‘a society without proximity, where gratuity and affection without compensation – between strangers as well – is disappearing, is a perverse society’,” said Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Secretary of relations with States of the Holy See, addressing the UN Assembly’s annual debate. “The same dehumanization occurs when people are reduced to the crimes they may have committed, the country to which they belong or to their productive capacity,” he added. Archbishop Gallagher noted the importance of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, to be adopted later this year in Marrakech, and said that together with the Global Compact on Refugee, they provide vital protection for those forced to flee their homes for a number of reasons and whose fundamental human rights are at most risk. “The Holy See hopes that the Global Compacts will serve as useful tools for good migration management at every level and a common resource for achieving our shared responsibility in front of the plight of refugees, as well as reference points for international cooperation in the management of migration and the care for refugees,” he said. The senior Holy See official also drew attention to the suffering of civilians in amidst myriad conflicts around the globe and urged States to honour their ‘responsibility to protect’, and highlighted importance of reconciliation and peacebuilding to resolve conflicts. “Forgiveness is not opposed to justice, but it is rather its fulfilment, since it leads to the healing of the wounds that fester in human hearts while acknowledging the evil that has been committed,” he added, urging all religions to assist in the reconciliation efforts. The Archbishop called for promoting equality in rights as well as the full and equal participation of women and men in society. He also outlined the challenges posed by poverty as well as from the impacts of climate change, urging “all efforts” towards achieving the (SDGs) and the on climate change. In that context, he expressed Holy See’s hope that the upcoming to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP-24), to be held in Katowice, Poland, will help reinvigorate action in support of the Paris Agreement. Concluding his address, Archbishop Gallagher quoted Pope Francis: “intergenerational solidarity is not optional, but rather a basic question of justice, since the world we have received also belongs to those who will follow us.” “While care for our common home benefits us, it is also a gift to future generations, sparing them from paying the price of environmental deterioration and ensuring that they are able to enjoy its beauty, wonder, and manifold endowment,” he said.

125-> Access still an obstacle to reaching stricken communities on Indonesian island: UN agencies
Aid is getting through to victims of last Friday’s deadly earthquake and tsunami, which struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, but stricken communities are still in dire need, UN aid agencies said on Friday. According to the Government of Indonesia, the official death toll has reached nearly 1,600 people, amid unconfirmed reports that more than 1,000 people have been buried in a housing complex, in the city of Palu, which suffered the full-force of the deadly tsunami wave. Drinking water has been identified as one of the most urgent needs in Donggala, one of the worst-affected districts on the island, along with shelter, healthcare and psychosocial support. In other areas, electricity has been restored and markets have reopened. In the most badly affected places, however, access is still a significant obstacle, said Paul Dillon, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration ( ): “Part of the problem is that the areas that are closest to the tsunami; where the tsunami hit hardest, are literally buried in mud.” “You have people circling those areas trying to get in but it’s literally inaccessible”, he said, adding that even standing just 200 metres from the remains of buildings “you can’t actually get into those areas because the mud is thigh- or waist-deep.” Help has now reached some of the worst-affected communities including in Sigi, Palu and Donggala districts. But needs remain critical according to rescuers, including in the town of Banawa, said a spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ( ).   “They’ve described this as the worst affected area,” said Matthew Cochrane. “All houses built along the coastline were swept away by the tsunami. Those who survived have sought shelter in the surrounding hills and their most urgent needs include emergency healthcare, shelter, blankets and diapers. There’s a lot of kids there apparently.” In coordination with the Government of Indonesia, is preparing to send an aid convoy from the south of the island to the north, where needs are greatest. “Tomorrow morning, an 11-truck convoy will depart from Makassar carrying about 83,000 litres of water, in 19-litre plastic jugs that can be reused by the people in the area,” IOM spokesperson Paul Dillon said, adding the convoy was bound for  Donggala. Providing emergency healthcare is also challenging, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), which said that around 2,500 people have been seriously injured in the disaster. “A lot of hospitals, clinics have been destroyed,” said spokesperson Jens Laerke. “So, if you are injured or wounded, you might have a lot of difficulty getting help there.” The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Palu, Central Sulawesi, on 28 September are estimated to have destroyed 10,000 houses and damaged a further 55,000.   Many thousands of people are still too afraid to stay in their houses, especially at night, owing to the ongoing aftershocks. To help them, $15 million has already been released from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund ( ). On Friday, announced the launch of a $50.5 million appeal for immediate relief activities, to complement the Government response. “The earthquake and tsunami effectively cut off much of Palu and Donggala for several days due to landslides and damage to infrastructure, and has created significant logistical and access challenges,” UN Resident Coordinator in Indonesia, , said. “The Response Plan outlines not only the immediate relief items that the international humanitarian community will prioritize, but also the logistics support needed to get aid to all those who need it.”

126-> UN summits to urge ‘ambition and action’ on climate change, sustainable development: Guterres
There are five key taking place next week to spur action on the climate crisis and other global concerns, which will showcase the UN as a “driver for meaningful, positive change”, at the helm of the Organization. For UN , there is no time to lose in the face of climate change, rising inequality, increasing hatred and intolerance; and what he described as an “alarming” number of peace and security challenges. As we begin a new session, my message to world leaders is simple. Put people first: their needs their aspirations their rights.  “The biggest challenge that leaders and institutions face is to show people we care – and to mobilize solutions that respond to people’s anxieties with answers. The upcoming high-level week is designed to do precisely that,” he told journalists in New York on Wednesday, “There will be dozens of summits, meetings and side events. But I can distill the significance of all these discussions into two words: ambition and action. I see the high-level week as an excellent opportunity to showcase the United Nations as a centre for solutions and a driver for meaningful, positive change in people’s lives.” The high-level week kicks off on Monday with the Climate Action Summit. Mr. Guterres said several plans to dramatically reduce emissions over the next decade, and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, should be unveiled there. The Secretary-General added that the UN is doing its part. This includes the announcement today of the Climate Action for Jobs initiative by the International Labour Organization ( ), alongside Spain and Peru. The four other summits will address universal health coverage, the , financing for development and support to Small Island Developing States. Mr. Guterres promised that his message throughout will be simple: “Put people first. Their needs. Their aspirations. Their rights.”

127-> A quarter of Pacific islanders live below ‘basic needs poverty lines’, top UN development forum hears
While progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) has been made over the past four years, some vulnerable island States are losing momentum in the race to 2030, according to discussions at the United Nations’ annual High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) on Wednesday. In 2015, the UN set out a vision for “people, planet, peace and prosperity” through partnership and solidarity, when it adopted the . To date however, many small island developing States (SIDS) still face persistent challenges linked to poverty, inequality and climate impacts. Speaking on behalf of the members of the Pacific Islands Forum, Fiame Naomi Mata’afa, Samoa’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment, painted a picture of dying corals and increasing numbers of cyclones, flooding and droughts. “One catastrophic event is undoing decades of progress, claiming lives, destroying vital infrastructure, homes, biodiversity and adversely affecting food security and the delivery of services and livelihoods”, she spelled out.  “Furthermore, our waste generation is outpacing our capacity to manage and are impacting our environment, ocean and marine life”. Climate crisis snapshot As SIDS grapple with the externally induced impact of the climate crisis – the chief cause of land-loss due to rising sea levels - amplifying their challenges and vulnerabilities, the reality of poor development outcomes and insecurities in many of countries prevail. “Despite sustained economic growth…our people are struggling to make ends meet with one in every four Pacific Islander, living below national basic needs poverty lines”, Ms. Mata’afa lamented. “Unemployment, particularly of women and young people is high, with youth unemployment at double the global rate” and “Pacific men outnumber Pacific women in paid employment by two to one,” she added. Moreover, some of the highest global rates of violence against women are in the Pacific. At 7.7 per cent, women’s representation in Pacific parliaments is the lowest globally. “Of the four countries globally that are without women parliamentarians, three are in the Pacific,” she asserted. Turning to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), she pointed out that regarding diabetes, seven Pacific countries are in the top 10 globally. And in 10 SIDS, five out of 10 Pacific islanders are overweight. “Moving forward, Pacific leaders are committed to more targeted support to enhance opportunities for women, youth, and persons with disabilities; addressing gender gaps in employment and decision making; enhancing sustainable tourism and fisheries while conserving the Pacific’s rich biodiversity; tackling NCDs and the dual threats of climate change and disasters more effectively”, she informed the meeting. She expressed the Pacific’s gratitude for $1.57 billion from the Green Climate Fund and said, “our challenge now is implementation ensuring we better utilise existing funding; strengthen capacities, institutions and partnerships; and increase investment in statistical systems”. ‘A holistic approach’ needed Turning to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), the HLPF evaluated progress and challenges in some of the world’s most vulnerable countries where populations are at high risk of being left behind, many in conflict or post-conflict situations. 47 countries present their efforts to implement the & ensure a better future for all at this year’s  meeting on “Empowering people & ensuring inclusiveness & equality". Action initiatives are highlighted at the zone  Many people in LDCs and landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) are disempowered by poverty and the lack of access to basic services.  They not only do not benefit from economic growth but high annual population growth rates present challenges for enrolment in higher education, and in training a skilled workforce. Moreover, climate change and its associated risks have put additional pressures on households and government resources in LDCs and LLDCs. To achieve sustainable results, development must be “a holistic process”, Saad Al Farargi, Special Rapporteur on the right to development told the meeting. One that requires the input and involvement of diverse groups, including States, international organizations, civil society, academia and the private sector. “Development programmes and policies can only succeed if they are addressing the right priorities”, he maintained. “To do that, participatory consultative processes, open for all segments of the society, have to be envisaged, budgeted for an implemented at every step of the way”.

128-> Global warming report, an 'ear-splitting wake-up call' warns UN chief
A on limiting global warming released on Monday by a UN scientific panel, should be heard around the world as an "ear-splitting wake-up call" said . He said the long-awaited findings show that "climate change is running faster than we are - and we are running out of time." The , or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), issued the report from Incheon, Republic of Korea, where for the past week, hundreds of scientists and government representatives have been poring over thousands of inputs to paint a picture of what could happen to the planet and its population with global warming of 1.5°C (or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). Limiting global warming will require “far-reaching and unprecedented changes” to human behaviour, according to the panel. "We are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes,” Panmao Zhai, Co-Chair of one of the IPCC Working Groups. This report by the world’s leading climate scientists is an ear-splitting wake-up call to the world. It confirms that climate change is running faster than we are – and we are running out of time -  The landmark adopted in December 2015 by 195 nations at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), included the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate  change by “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” Tweeting shortly after the report was launched, UN said that it is , according to the report. "But it will require unprecedented and collective climate action in all areas. There is no time to waste." In a statement released later in the day, Mr. Guterres said that getting there, would require "urgent and far more ambitious action to cut emissions by half by 2030, and reach net zero emissions by 2050." "This will take unprecedented changes in all aspects of society – especially in key sectors such as land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities," he said, adding that "we need to end deforestation and plant billions of trees; drastically reduce the use of fossil fuels and phase out coal by 2050; ramp up installation of wind and solar power; invest in climate-friendly sustainable agriculture; and consider new technologies such as carbon capture and storage. "The coming period is critical. We must meet the Paris commitments to bend the emissions curve by 2020 Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ), said on Monday in Geneva that there was "extreme urgency" needed on the part of signatories, and "so far the progress hasn't been good enough" to keep temperature rises below even 2°. “There will be 420 million people less suffering because of climate change if we would be able to limit the warming to 1.5°C level and we have certain areas in the world which are extremely sensitive,” Mr. Taalas said. “Small island states, (the) Mediterranean region and also sub-Saharan Africa is already suffering and will suffer more in the future.” It is still possible to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the official continued, “but we should change many things how we run our everyday business today”. Also in Geneva, a UN rights expert warned that failing to do more to address climate change risked “locking in decades” of grave violations. “Climate change is having - and will have - devastating effects on a wide range of human rights, including rights to life, health, food, housing, and water, as well as the right to a healthy environment,” said David Boyd, on human rights and the environment. “The world is already witnessing the impacts of climate change — from hurricanes in America, heat waves in Europe, droughts in Africa to floods in Asia.” Half a degree is a big deal The report highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared to 2°C, or more. For instance, by 2100, global sea level rise would be 10cm lower with global warming of 1.5°C compared with 2°C.  Moreover, coral reefs, already threatened, would decline by 70-90 percent with global warming of 1.5°C, whereas virtually all  would be lost with 2°C, according to the report. “Every extra bit of warming matters, especially since warming of 1.5°C or higher, increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes, such as the loss of some ecosystems,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group II. Limiting warming ‘possible' but we need to move faster “Limiting warming to 1.5°C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes,” said Jim Skea, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III. With that in mind, the report calls for huge changes in land, energy, industry, buildings, and transportation-use and across cities everywhere. Global net emissions of carbon dioxide would need to fall by 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, and reach "net zero" around 2050. Allowing the global temperature to temporarily exceed or ‘overshoot’ 1.5ºC would mean a greater reliance on techniques that remove CO2 from the air to return global temperatures to below 1.5°C by 2100. But the report warns that “the effectiveness of such techniques are unproven at large scale and some may carry significant risks for sustainable development.” “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C compared with 2°C would reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being, making it easier to achieve the United Nations ( ),” said Priyardarshi Shukla, Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III, referring to the 17 Goals adopted by UN Member States three years ago to protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. 'Can't fail' moment in Katowice The new report will feed into a process called the ‘Talanoa Dialogue,’ in which parties to the Paris accord will take stock of what has been accomplished over the past three years. The dialogue will be a part of the next conference of States parties, known by the shorthand , which will  meet in Katowice, Poland, this December. The UN Secretary-General said that the Katowice conference was a "can’t-fail moment." "The international community must emerge with critically important implementation guidelines for operationalizing the Paris Agreement," he said, adding that all countries now needed to "heed the counsel of the world’s top scientists: raise ambition, rapidly strengthen their national climate action plans, and urgently accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement."

129-> Disasters: UN report shows climate change causing ‘dramatic rise’ in economic losses
Climate-related and geophysical disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis have killed 1.3 million people over the last 20 years and left a further 4.4 billion injured, homeless or in need of emergency assistance, UN experts said on Wednesday. The , published by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ( ), also show that people in low- and middle-income countries are seven times more likely to die from natural disasters than those in developed nations. “This puts a big emphasis on the need to…make sure that we curb greenhouse gas emissions,” said Ricardo Mena, UNISDR chief, in charge of implementing the . This puts a big emphasis on the need to…make sure that we curb greenhouse gas emissions -  Failing to do this, risks letting climate-related hazards get out of control, he told journalists in Geneva, before calling for greater investment in disaster risk-reduction measures, “so that we do not allow for countries to create new risk”. In terms of the impact of disasters on the global economy between 1998 and 2017, affected countries reported direct losses of $2.908 trillion. That’s more than twice what was lost in the previous two decades. Illustrating the growing threat from climate change, extreme weather events now account for 77 per cent of total economic losses, $2.245 trillion, the report notes. This represents a “dramatic rise” of 151 per cent compared with losses reported between 1978 and 1997, which amounted to $895 billion. Poorer countries most vulnerable, worst-hit The increased vulnerability of poorer countries to disasters is illustrated by the fact that, in the last 20 years, only one officially high-income territory – the island of Puerto Rico – has featured in a league table of the top 10 economic losses as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Last September, devastation in the US-dependency caused by Hurricane Maria contributed to overall losses since 1998, of more than $71 billion; the equivalent of 12.2 per cent of Puerto Rico’s GDP. Apart from Cuba, which is classified as an upper-middle income country in the 20-year review, the other top 10 worst-hit nations, as a percentage of their output, are all lower-income. Haiti – where a deadly 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck the north-west of the island just four days ago – recorded the highest losses, at 17.5 per cent of GDP. In terms of fatalities from disasters, the report indicates that more than 747,000 people – 56 per cent of the total - died in the last two decades during major seismic events, a total of 563 earthquakes and related tsunamis. Overall, however, more than 90 per cent of all disasters in the last 20 years were in fact floods, storms, droughts and other extreme weather events. Heatwaves are next climate change 'explosion' Heatwaves are an increasing global threat for which solutions need to be found in the next five to 10 years, warned report co-author Professor Debarati Guha, from the Institute of Health and Society (IRSS), part of the Université Catholique de Louvain ( ). “The next one that is going to hit us with an explosion is heatwaves,” she said. “It’s going to be both in poor countries, remember, human beings have a limit, a thermal resistance limit…it is also going to be a huge problem in the wealthier countries.” “We emphasize the need to reduce existing risk to strengthen the resilience of people and nations. Otherwise the success of the (SDGs) is going to be a very elusive target”, UNISDR’s Ricardo Mena said.

130-> ‘We face a global emergency’ over oceans: UN chief sounds the alarm at G7 Summit event
Unless there is a change of course, the amount of plastic waste in the world’s oceans will outweigh the fish that live in them, by 2050, said the United Nations Secretary-General on Saturday, declaring that the world now faces a “global emergency” over the oceans. “The facts are clear.  Our oceans are a mess,” said António Guterres at an outreach event, that was part of the Group of Seven - or G7 - Summit of industrialized nations, taking place over two days, in Charlevoix, Canada. The G7 group of advanced economies, consists of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. “Plastic waste is now found in the most remote areas of the planet.  It kills marine life and is doing major harm to communities that depend on fishing and tourism,” he added. Pointing out that one mass of plastic in the Pacific is now bigger than France, Mr. Guterres welcomed the G7 Plastics Charter, agreed on Saturday, which is being seen by some observers as a Paris-style watershed moment for cleaning up ocean garbage, referencing the 2015 Agreement on climate change. “But we all need to do so much more,” Mr. Guterres underscored, “not just on plastic waste but on all ocean issues.” “Make no mistake, we are in a battle. And we are losing on every front,” he stressed. The UN chief painted a picture of fish stocks being crippled by overfishing, vast coastal dead zones from pollution and untreated waste being discharged into the sea. “And, to compound these issues, we have the growing impacts of climate change,” he asserted. Ocean acidification is disrupting the marine food chain and record-level ocean temperatures are killing coral reefs and creating fiercer, more frequent storms. Moreover, 40 per cent of the world’s population lives within 100 kilometres of a coast – leaving them vulnerable to storms, sea level rise and coastal erosion. Low-lying island nations and many coastal cities are in jeopardy of inundation, the Secretary-General spelled out. “Thankfully,” continued Mr. Guterres “we have a battle plan.” “Our guide is the [SDGs], and especially Goal 14 with its 10 targets from addressing marine pollution and acidification, to ending overfishing and protecting ecosystems,” he elaborated. “Our legal framework is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea – the world’s ‘constitution for the oceans,’” he added. Mr. Guterres noted that while last year’s Ocean Conference at UN Headquarters registered more than 1,300 commitments and partnerships, none of the initiatives and declarations are worth anything “unless we accept that we face a global emergency.” “And that is why I am here today.  To sound the alarm.  To inject a sense of real urgency in your deliberations and decision-making,” he said. “Your leadership is needed now, more than ever – on combatting land-based pollution; on creating marine protected areas; on reviving fisheries; on building the resilience of coastal ecosystems and communities, and, especially, on climate change,” he added. He flagged that if our seas and oceans are not protected, and we lose the battle against climate change, all the assumptions on which our policy-making has been based “will be worthless”. “Take seriously these threats to our global environment and understand that our collective future and security is at stake,” he concluded.

131-> UN highlights urgent need to tackle impact of likely electric car battery production boom
Demand for raw materials used in the production of electric car batteries is set to soar, prompting the UN trade body, UNCTAD, to call for the social and environmental impacts of the extraction of raw materials, which include human rights abuses, to be urgently addressed. Electric cars are rapidly becoming more popular amongst consumers, and predicts that some 23 million will be sold over the coming decade: the market for rechargeable car batteries, currently estimated at $7 billion, is forecast to rise to $58 billion by 2024 . The shift to electric mobility is in line with ongoing efforts to reduce the world’s dependence on fossil fuels, and reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change, but a from UNCTAD, warns that the raw materials used in electric car batteries, are highly concentrated in a small number of countries, which raises a number of concerns. Drilling down in DRC, Chile For example, two-thirds of all cobalt production happens in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). According the UN Children’s Fund ( ), about 20 per cent of cobalt supplied from the DRC comes from artisanal mines, where human rights abuses have been reported, and up to 40,000 children work in extremely dangerous conditions in the mines for meagre income. And in Chile, lithium mining uses nearly 65% of the water in the country's Salar de Atamaca region, one of the driest desert areas in the world, to pump out brines from drilled wells. This has forced local quinoa farmers and llama herders to migrate and abandon ancestral settlements. It has also contributed to environment degradation, landscape damage and soil contamination, groundwater depletion and pollution. Climb the value chain Noting that "the rise in demand for the strategic raw materials used to manufacture electric car batteries will open more trade opportunities for the countries that supply these materials”, UNCTAD's director of international trade, Pamela Coke-Hamilton, emphasised the importance, for these countries, to “develop their capacity to move up the value chain". In the DRC, this would mean building processing plants and refineries that would add value and, potentially, jobs within the country. However, for various reasons (including limited infrastructure, financing and a lack of appropriate policies), refining takes place in other countries, mainly Belgium, China, Finland, Norway and Zambia, which reap the economic benefit. The report recommends that countries such as DRC provide “conducive environment to attract investment to establish new mines or expand existing ones”. Diversify and thrive UNCTAD also recommends that the industry find ways to reduce its dependence on critical raw materials. For example, scientists are researching the possibility of using widely-available silicon, instead of graphite (80% of natural graphite reserves are in China, Brazil and Turkey). If the industry manages to become less reliant on materials concentrated in a small number of countries, says UNCTAD, there is more chance that prices of batteries will drop, leading to greater take-up of electric cars, and a shift away from fossil-fuel powered transport. As for the environmental consequences of the batteries themselves, the report recommends the development of improved, more sustainable mining techniques, and the recycling of the raw materials used in spent Lithium-Ion batteries, a measure that would help deal with the expected increase in demand, and also create new business opportunities.

132-> UN aid teams scramble to reach ‘most remote places’ cut off by Cyclone Kenneth in Mozambique
With heavy rains expected to continue in the coming days across northern Mozambique, access to the most remote areas affected by Cyclone Kenneth “remains difficult” the UN warned on Tuesday. Humanitarian affairs coordination office, , reported that heavy rains had paused in the morning around the coastal city of Pemba, with aid workers going flat out to prepare relief flights – including medical supplies – to the island of Matemo, one of the worst-hit by the cyclone. “Certainly the impacts of , just as the impacts of Cyclone Idai, are intensified because of and because of sea-level rise.” , , , and provide the latest updates on the situation in northern . “Emergency staff will also do further damage and needs assessments while they can, as more rain is expected in the coming days, turning the response into a start-stop operation”, said OCHA Spokesperson, Jens Laerke, briefing reporters in Geneva. The Government of Mozambique is reporting that at least 38 people died during the second massive cyclone to hit southern Africa in six weeks, following on from the devastating impact of Cyclone Idai. Kenneth partially or fully destroyed nearly 35,000 houses, close to 200 classrooms; and at least 14 health facilities have been hit, OCHA reported. Around 21,000 people are now sheltering in accommodation centres, after their villages were wiped out, said Mr. Laerke, adding that some staff who had made an aerial survey, said that “some villages looked like they had been bulldozed.” For the initial response, $10 million has been released for Mozambique by the head of OCHA, together with $3 million for the hard-hit Comoros Islands. Spokesperson for the UN refugee agency ( ), Charlie Yaxley, said that “access to the most remote places remains difficult”, with reports that some remain “completely isolated and in need of rescue”. Although the northern areas hit by Kenneth are less populated than other parts of the country, the damage and flooding had been “extensive”. Drawing on eye witness accounts from UNHCR teams on the ground in Pemba since the weekend, he said parts of the city had been completely flooded. “In the most deprived areas, houses had collapsed, and flash floods left mud and trash all over the streets…Communities are organizing themselves to clean up streets and remove the sand and muck brought by the storms. Despair is evident.” Thousands reached by World Food Programme In the worst affected areas “people have lost everything” said Herve Verhoosel, Spokeperson for the World Food Programme ( ), noting that thanks to early positioning of supplies, the agency has already reached 11,500 beneficiaries, beginning on Saturday morning. “The ravages caused by the cyclone are compounded by the impact it has on agriculture, livelihoods and the food and nutrition security situation”. With preliminary Government assessments showing 31,300 hectares of crops lost, hitting at the peak of the harvest season, “the short/mid/longterm availability of food is worrisome”, added Mr. Verhoosel. He said the agency had already been providing food distributions and nutrition support in some affected districts since last year. “WFP is already working in Mozambique to increase resilience to climatic shocks…This focus becomes even more crucial, and additional funding in that regard after the emergency, will be essential to ensure we can help the country recover”, he added.

133-> On Day four of UN Assembly debate, leaders from vulnerable island States turn out in force to plead for climate action
From the Caribbean Sea to the Pacific and Indian Oceans, leaders from island States most threatened by global warming took the podium of the United Nations General Assembly on Friday, the fourth day of its annual general debate, to plead for increased aid to resolve a problem not of their making and call for reform of a financial quirk that punishes them for the progress they make. Island States have spoken on previous days, but on Friday a total of 10 island leaders took turns explaining to world Heads of State and Government not only the catastrophic impacts of climate change caused by centuries of industrial pollution from northern nations, but the disadvantages they face in the financial domain as soon as they improve the lot of their people. A jumble of acronyms, but little action As soon as a country from the status of low income country – or (LDC) in UN parlance – with an annual per capita gross national income (GNI) below $1,005, to middle-income country (MIC), with a GNI between $1,005 and $12,235, it loses access to concessionary financing, as St. Lucia’s Prime Minister Allen Michael Chastanet , noting the acronyms weighing down his Caribbean State. “I stand before you today as a leader of a – a SIDS, which is also a middle- income country – a MIC,’ he said. “The world acknowledges our ‘acronyms,’ but little or nothing changes… We continue to struggle under the weight of international frameworks that do not provide an enabling environment for my country to chart an effective sustainable development path, or even to be able to take control of our own destiny.” Paris Accord can help turn the tide to fund climate action From the Pacific island nation of Samoa, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, said it was a for the world to act decisively and collectively, calling for full implementation of the that seeks to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. “Climate change poses the single greatest threat especially to small Island developing states like Samoa, not through our doing or choice,” he said, alluding to the fact those most vulnerable to climate change’s impact are those who contributed least to global warming. “The Pacific region is already facing the destructive impacts of climate change and disasters – cyclones, floods, droughts. Sea level rise and ocean acidification are taking their toll on the health and the wellbeing of our peoples, environment and economies. Disaster-related economic losses in Pacific island countries as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) are higher than almost anywhere else in the world,” he added. “The United Nations remains our last best hope to provide the political will and the necessary commitment to turn the tide against climate change.” From the Indian Ocean, Prime Minister Pravind Kumar Jugnauth of Mauritius of the issue. “As we have seen in California, the Carolinas, the Philippines, China, Europe and elsewhere, the frequency of extreme weather events demonstrates that the impacts of climate change can affect every country on every continent. Hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires are becoming deadlier,” he warned. “Without a renewed global commitment to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects we will fail to meet the targets of the , and endanger our planet as well as our own survival.” On cue, Tropical Storm Kirk barrels down on the Caribbean Prime Minister Hubert A. Minnis of the Bahamas the enormous dangers facing the Caribbean islands, with economies dependent on tourism under dire threat. “We see this in rising sea levels, the loss of coral reefs, the increased volume of acid in our oceans, and more severe and frequent hurricanes and typhoons,” he said. “Tourism is the world’s largest industry. It is also the lifeblood of the Bahamian economy. Millions of tourists travel to the Bahamas annually because of our beautiful turquoise waters and biodiversity,” he added, stressing the vital importance of the sustainable use of the world’s seas and oceans free from pollution, especially of plastics. We see this in rising sea levels, the loss of coral reefs, and more severe and frequent hurricanes and typhoons  For fellow Caribbean leader, Prime Minister Timothy Harris of St. Kitts and Nevis, it was the unfairness of island States from elsewhere. “Climate change is largely the consequence of actions of more developed countries, their carbon emissions and harmful lifestyles. Yet SIDS pay an unfair price ­– a price so high that, for many of us, climate change presents an existential threat.” He too criticized the financial quirk that punished middle-income countries for their progress. “We reiterate our calls for the international community to address with urgency the sterile measure of per capita income now employed,” he said. “The international community cannot on the one hand claim to help SIDS while in the same vein classify us as middle- and high-income countries based on archaic financial models that ultimately deny access to critical developmental assistance and hinder investment financing.” It was a theme taken up by fellow Caribbean leader, Prime Minister Mia Amor Mottley of Barbados. “Barbados, the Caribbean and other small islands have had to that our percentage in trade of goods and services is miniscule, but we are bound by the same rules that apply to those who dominate and can distort global trade,” she said. “Small States like mine were shepherded out of agriculture and told that services were the route we should use for development. My country, for example, tried financial services pursuant to double taxation treaties, utilizing due diligence, operating a clean jurisdiction that is not a tax haven and complying with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) requirements. “Now we are being told our tax practices are harmful and unfair competition to those who still enjoy the bulk of the revenues in global trade and service.” As if pre-planned to highlight climate change’s devastating effects, Tropical Storm Kirk churned past her country even as she addressed the Assembly, and she left UN Headquarters to return home. [We] strongly urge the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses to take urgent actions in reducing this harmful emission. Reduce now or regret later  But before she departed, Mrs. Motley, the island nation’s first woman Prime Minister, used the podium to make a fervent appeal for recognition of women’s role in humanity’s progress. “This United Nations must show leadership in recognizing the talents and contributions of women to human civilization and progress,” she told the Assembly, explain that women have value and give much, whether they labour over smoking wood fires; whether [they] are trapped in poverty because of a lack of opportunity, equality and respect; whether they lead countries; whether they stay at home to care for families; or whether they come to the UN.” Reduce now or regret later In the exponentially vaster Pacific region, Fijian Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama . “I meet thousands of Fijian women, men and children every year who have suffered from the latest wave of climate-related impacts; the cyclones, the flooding, the prolonged droughts, and the steadily rising seas, he said. “I meet with the farmers whose crops have been washed away, the teachers and students who have lost their schools and the families whose homes have been destroyed. They want their Prime Minister to demand that the world take action on their behalf.” Fellow Pacific Islander, Prime Minister Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas of Vanuatu with the aid they pledged for climate mitigation. “The Governments of the industrialized countries promised to release $100 billion a year in climate funds for vulnerable countries by 2020,” he said. “We demand that the highest priority be accorded to these pledges and a concrete road plan to mobilize and constitute the promised funds be put in place in the shortest possible time, because climate change is raging fiercely.” Solomon Islands Prime Minister Ricky Nelson Houenipwela also in climate change action and appropriate financial support. “Solomon Islands joins other Pacific island States in strongly urging the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses to take urgent actions in reducing this harmful emission. Reduce now or regret later,” he warned. Though their focus was on the potential climatic catastrophe looming over them, this is not to say that the island speakers ignored other world crises including conflict, security and development that figured in the speeches of scores of other world leaders who mounted the podium on day four.

134-> Tackling climate change is ‘global responsibility of our time,’ Dominica Foreign Minister tells UN Assembly
Climate change results from “an economic calculus” that pushes global destruction, Francine Baron, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Dominica told the United Nations Assembly on Saturday, stressing that “it must be accepted as the responsibility of our time.” Noting that poverty, inequality and violence are also shared responsibilities, she maintained that “their modem-day manifestations are wrapped up in climate change.” Saying that it arises from activities that support and reflect inequalities, she emphasized that “it is the poor who suffer most.” “Much violence stems directly from climate-change-induced scarcity of things, like water, or productive lands,” she elaborated, citing climate change as “the main symptom of our world’s broken economy, society and humanity.” Ms. Baron noted that the global community has neither agreed on an implementation plan for the in 2015, nor mobilized the agreed-upon $100 billion annually to assist the most vulnerable in adapting and mitigating against harmful climate change effects. “While we have failed to live up to these commitments, arctic ice shelves continue to melt at an alarming rate,” she explained. “The oceans continue to get warmer; hurricanes and storms continue to develop and threaten our countries, drought becomes more severe and flooding more pronounced.” The Foreign Minister warned against perpetual pontification on the subject while punishing rains wreck lives and livelihoods – but urged instead to use our collective efforts to arrest it. “It is no secret that the lack of motivation by some countries to take the required actions, is rooted in this economic truth: that those who gain most from the activities that create climate change, remain the most removed from its dire consequences,” Ms. Baron underscored. Last year, she said that Hurricane Maria unleashed 180 miles per-hour winds that brought Dominica to its knees. Immediately afterwards, “our people, raised their battered and wounded selves and began the daunting task of search and rescue, clearing roadways and quickly moved thereafter into a rebuilding mode.” After international experts completed Dominica’s post-disaster needs assessment, they concluded that in a few hours, a single hurricane “caused loss and damage equivalent to 226 per cent of our country s GDP [gross domestic product],” while “a mere two years prior, a tropical storm, had wiped out the equivalent of 90 per cent” of it. The cost of building a resilient nation, “comes with a price tag far in excess of what small developing States, like Dominica, are able to meet singlehandedly,” she flagged. “As I speak to you this minute, dangerous storms are gathering in the western Atlantic,” she said. “As climate change warms the seas and feeds the rainstorms, the risk of future loss and damage grow.” Arguing that climate change is not “a freak of nature,” but man-made, she encouraged the global leader to let history record what was done, not was said; what efforts were made to globally end climate change and to reduce local vulnerabilities. “We, together, must grasp this moment,” concluded the Foreign Minister. .

135-> Action needed to end deadly clashes between African herders and farmers: UN chief
The United Nations stands ready to support efforts to resolve deadly clashes between farmers and nomadic herders in areas of West and Central Africa, the head of the global organization said on Thursday. More than 80 people in central Nigeria were killed in land disputes between the two sides this week. However, this has been a long-standing issue with similar incidents occurring in other countries in Africa, causing more than 1,000 deaths over the past year alone, according to media reports. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, expressed deep concern over the mounting violence, as well as the resulting banditry, extortion and cattle rustling. “He condemns the resulting loss of life, property and livelihoods, as well as population displacement, which undermines peaceful coexistence between communities in many of the affected countries. It is also detrimental to regional stability,” the statement said. The UN chief urged all concerned governments, regional organizations, civil society and other parties to work together to find solutions to the conflicts. He underlined the readiness and commitment of the UN to support national and regional efforts in this regard.

136-> Fisherwomen of Lake Chad show optimism in face of multiple challenges
It’s eight o’clock in the morning and fifty-year-old Falmata Mboh Ali paddles her small dugout canoe to the shores of a tributary of Lake Chad in Bol, a small town 100 miles north of the capital of Chad, N’Djamena. In her nets she has perhaps fifty fish, a good enough catch, given she started fishing just five hours earlier. But, it is not sufficient to feed her eleven children. “I can sell this fish and use that money to buy grain to feed my family,” she said, “but the grain doesn’t go far. I have been fishing for twenty years and it is becoming more difficult to catch fish.” Fishing has traditionally sustained communities in the Lake Chad Basin area, supporting nearly 30 million people living along its shores in Chad, but also Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger. However, the once huge lake which covered 250,000 km2 has now shrunk to one tenth of its original size, largely due to unsustainable water management and the corrosive effects of climate change. With fish now more scarce, and fishermen needing to travel further to find them, the United Nations Development Programme ( ) has stepped in to offer support. “We have been helped by a project which has supplied new nets, so my catch is increasing,” said Falmata Mboh Ali, “so I am hopeful that my family’s life can improve.” The precarious situation local people now find themselves in has been compounded by insecurity related to the activities of the Islamist Boko Haram terrorist group, across the whole Lake Chad region. The insurgency the group has mounted in north-eastern Nigeria and neighbouring countries has displaced more than 2 million people and led to humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that around four million people don’t have enough to eat. And if more refugees flee into Chad from the conflict in the Central African Republic, the food and nutrition crisis is likely to worsen. Perhaps not surprisingly the Lake Chad region is amongst the poorest in the world, where access to food, health services and education is extremely low.   Fisherwomen including Falmata Mboh Ali, explained the challenges they face to a high-level joint United Nations-African Union delegation, visiting Bol on Thursday; a visit which also included the Foreign Minister of Sweden, Margot Wallström. The African Union Special Envoy for Women, Peace and Security, Bineta Diop who was part of the mission said: “The challenges are great but we can act. Gender roles are changing, women now go out to fish, when before it was men, so they are playing a bigger role in society.” The steps being taken by fisherwomen are small but significant, according to the UN , Amina Mohammed, who is leading the delegation to Chad. “Women’s economic empowerment is a critical tool for their access to leadership and decision-making positions,” she said. “I encourage the women to take part in all political, peace, security and development processes that will sustain their communities.” The UN and the wider international community is supporting efforts by countries in the Lake Chad Basin to regenerate the region. Ultimately, it’s hoped that Lake Chad itself could be given new life with rising water levels, allowing fisherfolk to carry out their traditional activities of years gone by, while providing them with a more secure and stable economic and political future.

137-> Climate experts pledge to scale up high-altitude fight against mountain melt
The UN’s weather watchdog and partners committed on Thursday to a new initiative to ramp up observation and prediction technology that will help address the challenges of climate change, melting snow and ice, and water-related hazards. In a call for action at the end of this week’s to tackle the global warming causing glaciers to retreat, along with snow fields, permafrost and associated ecosystems - collectively called the cryosphere - the World Meteorological Organisation and partners announced they would step up commitments on the issue of water security and natural disasters linked to melting ice in mountain regions. and development are creating an unprecedented crisis in our high mountain system that threatens the sustainability of the planet.  There is great urgency to take global action now."  Call for Action issued at   Changes across the world’s peaks are altering the cryosphere, and impacting the flow of freshwater, which meets the needs of more than half of humanity – they are, in effect, “water towers of the world”. In addition, the problem of disappearing ice caps is stretching from mountainsides to urban communities downstream, as glacial melt-dependent pastures becomes parched, and avalanches, floods and other disasters snuff out lives and weaken local economies. pledged to lead the effort to stop the trend at the conclusion of the three-day in Geneva, to address these changes to water systems and supply. To improve high mountain observations that could better-forecast potential disasters and prompt lifesaving action, WMO will provide leadership and guidance in an Integrated High Mountain Observation and Prediction Initiative as part of its call to action, entitled “Avoiding the Impending Crisis in Mountain Weather, Climate, Snow, Ice and Water: Pathways to a Sustainable Global Future.” The initiative to boost climate disaster prediction and resilience is a tool that will help in “tackling the climate crisis, evaporating snow and ice, and water-related stress.” WMO said that sustainable mountain development and ecosystem conservation should be “integral” in international development policy, and in addition, more transboundary data sharing and prediction communications will be critical in safeguarding high mountain regions. More than 150 summit participants from around the globe highlighted the natural hazard and water insecurity impacts of glacial snow melt in their communities. In Switzerland, glaciers have lost 10 per cent of their volume in the last five years, two per cent of which diminished in the last year alone. By the end of the century, 90 per cent of the nation’s remaining 4,000 ice sheets may melt, the Swiss Federal Councillor revealed. The summer of 2019 saw such intense heat waves, the equivalent of Switzerland’s annual drinking water consumption melted from its glaciers in just 15 days. Water security is becoming “one of the greatest challenges of the world’s population” the summit declaration says, “and the uncertainties on the availability of freshwater from mountain rivers is a significant factor of risk for local and downstream ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, food production, fisheries, hydropower production, transportation, tourism, recreation, infrastructure, domestic water supply, and human health." International observations show an acceleration in the retreat of 31 major glaciers in the past two decades. But lack of sufficient data hinders reliable monitoring. The summit noted the scarcity of meteorological, cryosphere and related observations in mountain regions, but stressed the potential of space-based surveillance. A September by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , outlined the growing burden of the changing climate, its strain on water systems and the impacts on various species, livelihoods and economies, which served as the springboard for the summit dialogue.

138-> Fragile countries risk being ‘stuck in a cycle of conflict and climate disaster,’ Security Council told
Climate change ­– and the shortages of water and food that come from it – is becoming increasingly linked to conflict, a senior United Nations official told the Security Council on Wednesday, warning that countries most vulnerable to drought and crop failure are also most vulnerable to conflict and fragility. “Climate change is inextricably linked to some of the most pressing security challenges of our time,” said Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed during a intended to deepen understanding of climate-related security risks. “Fragile countries are in danger of becoming stuck in a cycle of conflict and climate disaster. Where resilience is eroded, communities may be displaced and exposed to exploitation,” she added. Ms. Mohammed is just back from her trip to Africa’s Lake Chad Basin with Margot Wallström, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Sweden, which chaired today’s Council meeting. Where resilience is eroded, communities may be displaced and exposed to exploitation -  The region is “experiencing a crisis brought on by a combination of political, socio-economic, humanitarian and environmental factors,” Ms. Mohammed . She noted that the drastic shrinking of Lake Chad by more than 90 per cent since the 1960s has led to environmental degradation, socio-economic marginalization and insecurity affecting 45 million people. Exacerbated competition over scant resources and the vicious cycle of risk and vulnerability have decreased the resilience of populations to cope with humanitarian crises. Declining economic activity and agricultural loss have led to a lack of employment opportunities across the region. The resulting socio-economic marginalization, she said, has exposed populations, in particular the young, to the risk of violent extremism and provided breeding ground for recruitment by groups such as Boko Haram. The Boko Haram insurgency in north-east Nigeria and neighbouring countries of Cameroon, Chad and Niger, has left over 10 million people displaced and resulted in massive destruction of basic infrastructure, health and educational facilities, commercial buildings, private houses and agricultural assets. “The multidimensional nature of this crisis underlines the complex relationship between climate change and conflict,” she stressed. “We must understand climate change as one issue in a web of factors that can lead to conflict. Within this web, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, applying additional stress on prevailing political, social and economic pressure points,” she added. The Deputy Secretary-General said that over the last 18 months, the has also recognized the adverse effects of climate change on stability in other geographical areas, including West Africa, the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. The UN system is increasing climate-related security risk assessments and management strategies, she noted. For example, the Secretary General’s forthcoming report on the UN Office for West Africa and the Sahel will report on recent developments involving the climate-security nexus in the region. The recalibrated UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel is similarly climate-oriented, she said. Ms. Mohammed also emphasized the importance of supporting programmes that place women and Youth at the heart of efforts. “Desertification means women must travel larger distances to fetch water and food, forcing them to miss out on education and economic opportunities in the long term. Youth without jobs will take alternate route to terrorism,” she said. In conclusion, she warned that climate change is moving faster than responses, urging the Security Council to do its part to help humankind keep pace. Also addressing the Council was Hassan Janabi, Iraq’s Minister of Water Resources, who said that major river basins in Iraq and the rest of the region are subject to the greatest ever threat, resulting from climate change, as well as competition for shared water resources. He said the absence of implementable bilateral and multilateral agreements or regional frameworks for the equitable use of shared water is contributing to potential conflicts that could and should be avoided. Iraq fully supports diplomatic means to solve water scarcity issues, including through “water diplomacy” and similar initiatives intending to maintain the security of the planet with a view to creating an environment of trust and cooperation, he added. Hindou Ibrahim, International Indigenous People Forum on Climate Change, said that the Security Council must address climate change as a security risk. She said that in the Sahel, where 90 per cent of the economy relies on agriculture and pastoralism, a heat wave and drought has the potential to immediately hurt the economy and the people. At the regional level, she added, climate change contributes to reinforcing terrorist groups as they take advantage of poverty to recruit the youngest and most fragile. Sweden’s Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom chaired the debate.

139-> Dress the world in wood, UN says in its ‘Forests for Fashion’ initiative
The fashion industry is valued upward of 2.5 trillion dollars, and employs some 75 million people globally – so it makes good sense to shift textile production from fossil fuel-based synthetic fibers to renewable, biodegradable textiles, made from wood, according to a new United Nations initiative that aims to make forests literally more fashionable. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (ECE)- ’s (Food and Agriculture Organization) “Forests for Fashion” initiative, links forest-based materials from sustainably managed forests, with the world of fashion. “Sustainability of a society is both an individual and a collective responsibility,” said UN Development Programme ( ) Goodwill Ambassador Michelle Yeoh, at UN headquarters on Monday. “The fashion industry is responsible for producing 20 per cent of global waste water and 10 per cent of the global carbon emissions – more than the emissions of all international flights and maritime shipping combined,” said the star of the movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In addition, the textiles industry has recently been identified as a major polluter, with estimates of around half a million tonnes of plastic microfibers ending up in the world’s oceans as polyester, nylon or acrylic are washed each year. “Fashion is often a synonym of dangerous working conditions, unsafe processes and hazardous substances used in production,” she continued, citing the cruel abuses of modern slavery and child labour. Although the for Sustainable Development and the ( ) are an ambitious blueprint for governments, Ms. Yeoh stressed that everyone must make a conscious choice to change habits and plan for the future. “Today we count around 3.2 billion people in the global middle class,” she said. “By 2030, this number will rise to about 5.4 billion with the major part of the growth occurring in Asia. The 2.2 billion people entering the global middle class will aspire to a similar lifestyle as we know it today – which includes a similar consumption pattern with respect to clothing.” Calling fashion “a major development challenge,” Ms. Yeoh sees clothing as “an essential element for the transition towards sustainable societies.” While acknowledging the need for governments’ involvement in shifting the fashion industry to in the right direction, she put the main onus on individuals to start the fashion “revolution”. “Many of us would also think that forests are best left untouched, however is often by adding value to their products that we can best protect them, and in many cases restoration efforts can be coupled with productive forests,” she attested. Moreover, forests can create productive ecosystems, to support local and rural communities. According to the UNDP envoy, ‘forest fibers are already a reality and textile businesses are growing or buying large forest extensions.” “New fibers are highly sustainable, their carbon and ecological footprints are low, and there are different fast-growing species suitable for different places and climates,” she indicated. “Let’s face it,” concluded Ms. Yeoh, “changing the production and consumption patterns of the fashion industry will have a domino effect on many aspects of development and provide a visible and meaningful contribution to the achievement of the .”

140-> ‘Do everything in your power to tackle climate change’ UN chief urges on Mother Earth Day
Marking , the UN on Monday debated how best to build “an equitable and sustainable future” for all, through enhanced education and , on the road to a key international summit on the issue due to take place in September. Billed officially as an Interactive Dialogue on Harmony with Nature, the UN session involved Member States and top officials discussing the need to take urgent action against the pace of global warming, in line with the 2015 , to keep carbon dioxide emissions to well-below two degrees Celsius. This video is a poignant reminder of the urgent need to protect the planet. On & every day, take in every way you can.  In a tweet to mark Earth Day, UN chief António Guterres said it was vital “every day” to “commit to taking better care of our planet. Please do everything in your power to tackle climate change – the defining issue of our time”, he said. “Climate change is one of the largest threats to sustainable development globally,” said the concept note prepared for the General Assembly meeting, “and is just one of many imbalances caused by the unsustainable actions of humankind, with direct implications for future generations.” President of the General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa, said that taking care of nature was, in essence, “taking care of people”. She also noted the importance of respecting life-cycles of the natural world, and contributing to biological diversity so that the world can “continue and prosper”. “We are the last generation that can prevent irreparable damage to the planet and to its inhabitants” she tweeted. “We are at a crossroads; this is the moment in which we decide the path we wish to take, to avoid reaching a point of no return in global warming. We already know the results of inaction.” The international day recognizes a collective responsibility, as called for in the 1992 Rio Declaration, to promote harmony with nature and the Earth to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations of humanity. It also provides an opportunity to raise public awareness around the world to the challenges regarding the well-being of the planet and all the life it supports. To boost ambition and accelerate actions to implement the on Climate Change, the UN Secretary-General will host the on 23 September, to meet the climate challenge.

141-> Small and sustainable: 'Tiny Houses' could be solution to world’s housing problems
They’re small, self-sustaining – and they could revolutionize the way we think about housing around the world, as building materials become scarcer. Measuring just about 22-square-meters, or some 200-square-feet, a demonstration unit for the eco-friendly and affordable housing, debuted on the UN Plaza in New York this week. This structure is a type of “tiny house” which is traditionally comprised of one room with a loft or pull-out bed, complete with hidden storage, and condensed amenities, such as a kitchen, that maximize the space available to live in. The design, created by and the Center for Ecosystems in Architecture at Yale University in the United States, in collaboration with , is meant to get people thinking about decent, affordable housing that limits the overuse of natural resources and helps the battle against destructive climate change. The design is created specifically to be compatible with New York’s seasonal climate of cold winters, and hot summers. New designs have also been drawn up to suit the climate in Quito, Ecuador, and another major world capital, Nairobi, in Kenya. The design was created in collaboration with Gray Organschi Architecture. Can modern living be sustainable? This “tiny house” could revolutionize how we live. , ,    — UN News (@UN_News_Centre)

142-> FROM THE FIELD: Weather reports come to aid of Uganda’s farmers
Farmers in Uganda are keeping their crop yields high, thanks to improved weather data supplied by the UN Development Programme ( )-backed push to modernize climate monitoring systems. The majority of farmers in the East African country rely on rain to grow crops, but as that rainfall becomes less reliable and drought conditions increase, agricultural production has suffered. These changing weather patterns across the region are testing age-old farming practices, and making it harder for some growers to make a living and feed their families. The Government of Uganda has responded by embarking on an ambitious plan to revolutionize its weather, water, and climate monitoring systems in order to provide farmers with better information about growing conditions. It’s hoped the initiative will help build resilience when rainfall fails to arrive. to see exactly how the climate information is helping Ugandan farmers.

143-> Nigeria floods: Guterres ‘deeply saddened’ by loss of life and rising need
The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Thursday he is “deeply saddened”, as the Government of Nigeria announced that some 200 people have died, and a further 1,310 injured, due to flooding across a dozen states. Overall, around two million have been affected. Nigeria’s two main rivers, the Niger and the Benue, burst their banks after heavy rains began in August, and the country has been experiencing large-scale floods ever since. A state of national disaster has been declared in the four most-affected states of Kogi, Niger, Anambra and Delta. More than 561,000 people are internally displaced as a result and  over 350,000 need immediate help - especially temporary shelter, food, safe drinking water, household items and medical care. In addition, more than 150,000 hectares of farmland are entirely inundated which raises serious medium-term food security concerns, as to how farmers will be able to replant vital crops. Close to 80,000 houses were damaged including 18,000 completely destroyed, and more than 320 roads and bridges are impassable. In the most affected areas, children have not been able to go to school for weeks. The Secretary-General extended his condolences to the families of the victims and to the Government and people of Nigeria and wished the injured a speedy recovery, stressing that the UN stands in solidarity with the country during this difficult time and “ready to support as required”. the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), activities conducted so far by the United Nations include: needs assessments; the provision of emergency medical care as well as disease control for cholera and malaria, by the World Health Organization ( ); and distributions of hygiene or “dignity” kits, for women and girls by the UN sexual and reproductive health agency ( ).

144-> Scientists from UN-run climate change panel to present key global warming report for world leaders
Scientists from the United Nations-run Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) and representatives from its 195 member governments, are meeting in South Korea, to reach agreement over a key summary for policymakers into the impact of a 1.5 degree Celsius increase in global warming, above pre-industrial levels. In 2015, the to combat climate change set a long-term goal of keeping global average temperatures to well below 2°C, and pursue efforts to limit the increase to  1.5°C. With relatively little known about the impacts back in 2015, the , which is co-sponsored by the World Meteorological Organization ( ) and United Nations Environment Programme ( ), was commissioned to prepare a report that would define the likely risks and challenges of living in world which is either 1.5 degrees warmer, or 2 degrees. Opening the week-long meeting, IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee “Three weeks ago in New York, the UN Secretary General described climate change as the great challenge of our time. But, he also noted that, thanks to science, we know its size and nature. Science alerts us to the gravity of the situation, but science also, and this special report in particular, helps us understand the solutions available to us.” Underscoring the importance of climate action, South Korea, which is hosting the meeting, has experienced its hottest summer on record, with temperatures in some parts of the country topping 40°C for the first time on record. Addressing the delegates, Deputy-Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova said, “This year is, yet again, expected to be one of the warmest years. We have witnessed extreme weather ranging from record heat in northern Europe and historic flooding in Japan, India, southeast Asia and the southeastern United States. The consequences were devastating, but advance predictions helped save many lives.” Subject to approval, the IPCC will release the Summary for Policymakers of the report at a press conference on 8 October. The full report is due to published in time for this year’s climate conference, , due to be held in Katowice, Poland in November.

145-> Help African farmers cope with climate change threats, UN food agency urges
African farmers need help to cope with the threats of climate change, with national policies that protect them and make them resilient, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, has declared, following a major conference on food security in the continent. In a statement released on Tuesday, at the conclusion of the high-level Africa Food Security Leadership Dialogue, in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, the stated that building resilience is one of the agency’s priorities in Africa, and is key to meeting the challenge of feeding over two billion by 2050. Small-scale food producers and their families, says the UN agency, are particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change, but they have always been innovators: "What they need are policies that protect them and increase their resilience to climate change”, Helen Semedo, FAO's Deputy Director-General, told the conference. “They need access to information, technology, and investment, and they should be brought to the conversation on innovation". According to the latest FAO data, hunger is on the rise in almost all parts of Africa, and the continent has the highest prevalence of undernourishment in the world, at almost 20 percent. The situation, which is attributed mainly to conflict and climate change, is particularly acute in Eastern nations, where almost one-third of the population struggles to find enough to eat. On Monday, participants – who heard that adaptation to climate risks is possible if there is immediate and bold action taken to build resilience – endorsed a commitment to do more to help African countries to improve their food security. The aim of the Leadership Dialogue is to engage governments and key development partners, and bring about unified action for Africa's agriculture and food systems in response to climate change.

146-> ‘Brutal weather’ continues as Rohingya refugee children endure devastating rainfall in Bangladesh
Heavy flooding and landslides in the Rohingya refugee camps of Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh, has left thousands of children and families in an increasingly dire situation with critical infrastructure damaged or destroyed, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) warned on Tuesday, while scaling up relief efforts to those vulnerable children. Brutal monsoon rains are putting Rohingya refugee children at risk. We're scaling up our response. 👇 “Conditions in the camps and host community are deteriorating rapidly because of the brutal weather”, said Alain Balandi Domsam, acting Bangladesh Representative, while stressing that “the humanitarian needs here are only likely to grow over the coming days with more downpours expected.” According to UNICEF, vital infrastructure that children rely on such as learning centres and health facilities have been damaged or destroyed. To date, five UNICEF-supported centres have been heavily damaged, with over 750 partially damaged, interrupting the education of more than 60,000 children. In addition, the risk from waterborne diseases is also growing. At least 47 water distribution points and networks, and over 600 latrines have been affected or damaged, increasing the risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD). “Ensuring that children and families have access to safe water and sanitation is absolutely crucial to protecting them,” said Berta Travieso, Acting Chief of UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office. World Food Programme also scaling up Meanwhile, the World Food Programme ( ) is also scaling up assistance to those displaced in the Cox’s Bazar affected by devastating rains. The agency has prepositioned 65 metric tons of high energy biscuits in refugee camps; emergency supplies for more than 160,000 people. As of 8 July, WFP has assisted 6,000 people with extra food assistance and is racing to stabilise slopes vulnerable to landslides. "Considering the damage wrought by these heavy rains", said WFP Senior Spokesperson, Herve Verhoosel, "it is easy to imagine the devastation that thousands of Rohingya refugees may have faced if teams had not been on the ground completing these preparedness projects before the monsoon season arrived. "Almost two years after the 2017 influx of Rohingya refugees", he added, "the situation remains critical. Vulnerability to food insecurity remains high and would rapidly deteriorate if humanitarian assistance were to cease or decrease". More than 500,000 Rohingya children are in need of humanitarian assistance in Cox’s Bazar overall, and 80 percent of the refugees - who fled brutal violence and grave human rights abuses nearly 2 years ago, carried out by Myanmar security forces - are entirely dependent on WFP food assistance. UNICEF has appealed for $152.5 million to support the work for refugee children and those affected in host communities in 2019. The current funding gap is US$68.7 million. It also costs WFP $24 million every month to feed those sheltering in what is the world’s largest refugee operation.

147-> FROM THE FIELD: ‘Eco-warriors’ fight climate change in South Africa
Schools in South Africa have been designating students as “eco-warriors” as part of an initiative supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), to drive environmental and climate change awareness amongst the young and old in their communities. The youthful warriors have supported rubbish clean-up campaigns around their schools, eliminating over 1000 illegal dumping sites. Other students have established agricultural co-operatives and learnt how to farm sustainably in the face of the effects of climate change and the degradation of the environment.

148-> Weekly migration of 1.4m to cities can contribute to ‘disasters’
The migration of some 1.4 million people every week to cities around the world “can strain local capacities, contributing to increased risk from natural and human made disasters’” according to the United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. In his message for , celebrated annually on 31 October, Mr. Guterres stressed that “hazards do not need to become disasters.” “The answer is to build resilience – to storms, floods, earthquakes, fires, pandemics and economic crises,” he said. Mr. Guterres explained that cities around the world are doing just that, forging new ways to increase resilience and sustainability. The capital of Thailand, Bangkok has built vast underground water storage facilities to cope with increased flood risk and save water for drier periods. In Quito, the capital of Ecuador in South America, local government has reclaimed or protected more than 200,000 hectares of land to boost flood protection, reduce erosion and safeguard the city’s freshwater supply and biodiversity. The UN chief also indicated that the city of Johannesburg in South Africa “is involving residents in efforts to improve public spaces so they can be safely used for recreation, sports, community events and services such as free medical care.” Risks are multiplying was established by the UN to promote the international community’s interest in global urbanization, push forward cooperation among countries in meeting opportunities and addressing challenges of urbanization, and contributing to sustainable urban development around the world. Maimunah Mohd Sharif, Executive Director of the UN Human Settlements Programme ( ), the importance of investing in resilience or face growing “economic, social, political and human” risks. “It has been estimated that without action on climate change – which accounts for just one facet of resilience – some 77 million urban residents risk falling into poverty,” she warned, elaborating that human-made and environmental threats ranged from droughts, floods and fires to economic shocks, disease outbreaks, war and migration. “Investing in resilience is a wise investment,” the UN Habitat chief said. The theme of this year’s commemoration, , focuses on the need to preserve human life and limit damage and destruction while continuing to provide infrastructure and services after a crisis. A range of UN-backed international agreements, including the , the on climate change, the and the provide “a roadmap for a more sustainable and resilient world,” according to the UN Secretary-General. How vulnerable is your city? The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, , published new research on Wednesday, showing that close to three in five cities worldwide with populations over 500,000, are "at high risk of a natural disaster". It's data booklet, , found that 679 our of 1,146 cities of over half-a-million, were vulnerable to either cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions - or a combination of these dangers. Some large cities are exposed to four or five different natural disaster risks.

149-> Inclusion, empowerment and equality, must be ‘at the heart of our efforts’ to ensure sustainable development, says UN chief
The world’s people are demanding “transformative change that is fair and sustainable,” Secretary-General said on Tuesday, calling on government leaders to use the upcoming slate of key United Nations meetings in September to “kickstart a for people and planet.” His call for concrete action was the cornerstone of his address to the (HLPF) – the main UN platform monitoring follow-up on States’ actions towards the (SDGs). Mr. Guterres that the HLPF was “zeroing-in” on the power of SDG action “to support empowerment, equality and inclusion”, and urged the participants to “ratchet up the ambition and highlight the imperative of inclusion”. “The evidence is clear:  Development is not sustainable if it is not fair and inclusive – and rising inequality hinders long-term growth,” he said. Alongside the impacts of globalization and rapid technological change, “inequality raises economic anxiety, erodes public trust, and undermines social cohesion, human rights, peace and prosperity”, according to the UN chief. Meanwhile, “mounting evidence” illustrates the “transformative results of equality and inclusion”, particularly of women, in higher gross domestic product, greater stability, and enhanced private sector performance and institutional effectiveness, he pointed out. “For all these reasons, the places the goals of inclusion, empowerment and equality, leaving no one behind at the heart of our efforts”, Mr. Guterres stated. Yet, four years after its adoption, “we are not yet on track and must step it up”, he said, citing extreme poverty, inequality, global unemployment, gender inequality and climate change, among others. Agenda 2030 and the ‘Inclusion Imperative’ And in all these areas, he acknowledged, “the poorest and most vulnerable people and countries will suffer the most”. The UN chief drew attention to “four key conclusions” to advance the “Inclusion Imperative”, beginning with "dramatically" scaling up SDG investments as "our best tool of prevention". Five high-level critical meetings in September: Secondly, he emphasized that “global climate action must be advanced in a manner that reduces inequality”, including by shifting to a greener economy that could create 24 million jobs globally by 2030 while safeguarding the 1.2 billion jobs that depend on a stable and healthy environment. Next, he said that “We must step up implementation of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration”, as people whose contribution to sustainable development, in countries of origin and destination, “is absolutely critical”. And fourth, leaving no one behind and achieving the SDGs “is inherently linked to human rights, diplomacy and prevention”, according to the UN chief, who reinforced the need for “a strengthened global commitment to end conflicts and displacement and tackle root causes”. He stressed that the conclusions emerging from the Forum “are rooted in the pressing need to address the Inclusion Imperative and provide us with important insights as we look ahead to September”. 'We can do better' In her opening remarks, Inga Rhonda King, President of the Economic and Social Council ( ) summarized the first five days of the Forum, saying that countries had been mobilized around the 17 SDGs, voluntary national reviews had been shared by 142 countries, SDG progress had been tracked and children had spoken about the future they want. While acknowledging the hard work of many countries, she contended that “we need to do more, to do it faster and to be more transformative”. She urged the participants to “understand how we can do better, advise each other and forge new partnerships”, noting that “our conclusions will reverberate in the September SDG Summit.” Ms. King assured the group that their ideas would be included “on how to make this Forum even more vibrant and action-oriented” during the upcoming General Assembly. “I hope that our discussions will encourage our Heads of State and Government to come back in September ready to announce ambitious acceleration actions”, she said in closing. 'Make it count' “ ” on the , General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa, opening the Ministerial Segment. “Let’s use the coming days to lay the groundwork not only for the SDG Summit, but indeed for the whole of high-level week”, she said, referring to the Assembly’s annual general debate, and adding that we have “five days to make it count”. Ms. Espinosa underscored the import of addressing urgent challenges “as they pave the way for longer-term risks and opportunities”, including the need to be “fully inclusive” and to empower girls and women. She detailed that she has been working with Member States to ensure their contributions to the 2030 Agenda, including the preparations for this HLPF and September’s SDG Summit. “That has been the overarching vision and the driving force” behind the “priorities set out for this session”, she explained. Ms. Espinosa also encouraged participants to use the September high-level week, at which time five summit-level meetings will be convened, “to be more ambitious and to announce accelerated measures and specific steps that respond to the urgency of the challenges we face”. Those meetings “represent a key opportunity to demonstrate that multilateralism works – that it can deliver tangible benefits to people’s lives”, Ms. Espinosa spelled out. The goals under review at the Forum focus on education, economic growth, inequality, climate change and peaceful, just and inclusive societies. Diplomatic achievements of the century Together with the on climate change, the 2030 Agenda is one of the “most important diplomatic achievements of this century”, Ireland’s former president Mary Robinson told the Forum. Pointing out that both concluded in 2015, she called them “tangible proof of the benefits of multilateralism and a rebuke to the narrow agendas of nationalism, isolationism and self-interest”. If implemented in full, the Chair of the Elders – a group of independent global leaders founded by Nelson Mandela who work for human rights and a sustainable future – maintained they are “a pathway to a world where poverty, inequality and conflict will not blight the life chances for millions of people currently denied the opportunity to enjoy their fundamental rights and freedoms”. Noting the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) report, she reminded the meeting that staying at or below 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial standards was “the only safe level for the whole world” because warming to 2°C would “cause considerable risk to the planet”. “We can no longer afford to regard the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Climate Agreement as voluntary”, flagged Ms. Robinson, citing a UN report in May detailing the loss of biodiversity and potential extinction of one million species. She stressed that the full implementation of both reports has become imperative “to secure a liveable world for our children and grandchildren”. “We have a global crisis and we must treat it as such”, she stated, saying that the HLPF “provides an opportunity to take an honest look at what all States have achieved and what more we need to do on the SDGs, so that when world leaders convene in New York in September for the SDG Summit, they can come with more than just words”. A former UN High Commissioner of Human Rights, Ms. Robinson underscored the importance of working together, saying: “We will not overcome the key existential challenges facing our world today, from nuclear weapons to climate change, if we spurn cooperation”. “This High-Level Political Forum is a moment to be bold and to demand real ambition from leaders”, she asserted, adding that “playing safe or doing business as usual will not deliver the results the world needs”. Limit global warming Delivering the final keynote speech, Chair Hoesung Lee stated that “climate action and sustainable development are inseparable” and presented three points of linkages between the two. First, he flagged that “the current warming is already producing negative impacts on natural and human systems, seriously impeding progress toward some SDGs”. Second, he noted the “ambitious” climate goal of limiting global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius “creates a trade-off for some SDGs and balancing the goals will be a challenge”. And finally, he detailed that while climate actions produce “new opportunities for the economy, environment and society”, they are contingent upon “international cooperation, with social justice and equity being core aspects of climate-resilient development pathways”. Mr. Lee informed the HLPF that currently, the global average temperature is one degree Celsius higher than the preindustrial level, noting, however, that “the warming is not uniform”. “Most land regions are experiencing warming greater than this one-degree average”, he said, spotlighting that “the Arctic temperature is two to three times higher”. Moreover, he conveyed that “up to 40 per cent of the world’s population lives in areas where the warming already exceeds 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial level for at least one season”, which has caused notable disruptions in human livelihoods. In summary, Mr. Lee advocated for collective efforts “at all levels”, to limit global warming to 1.5C, which should take into account equity and effectiveness, “to strengthen the global response to climate change and achieve sustainable development and poverty eradication”. “The result will be a cleaner, sustainable, more productive, and stronger global economy”, he concluded. According to IPCC, by limiting warming to 1.5 degrees rather than 2 degrees C, we will have: The number of possible partners on the Global Goals journey are “legion”, according to the SDG Advocate, including bankers and investments bankers, insurance companies and pension providers “who are starting to see that sustainable investment can be profitable and will be the key to financing the future of the Goals”. Singling out rising global hunger, greenhouse gas emissions and lack of essential health services, his next key word “urgency” pressed for a harder focus on all SDG targets, “to exploit their deadlines”. “They make urgency real and tactile and measurable”, Mr. Curtis stressed. “That’s what they’re for”. His third word was “opportunity”. “This is what the Goals give us”, he said, “a unique opportunity”. The SDG roadmap can guide us, “negotiated with the passion and determination and imagination” to end inequality and injustice, he argued. In closing he said “now” was the moment “to go for broke with deep urgency, with radical partnerships and with a sense of this unique human opportunity.” “And you are the generation of people with power in the United Nations and power in every country in the world, who could and must make it happen”, concluded the SDG envoy. Three little words Screenwriter for Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones's Diary, among others, SDG Advocate and renowned filmmaker Richard Curtis delivered a keynote speech underscoring that the UN “carries their hopes and dreams for a better world”. He selected “three key words” surrounding the SDGs, beginning with partnership. “There are so many possible partners for the Goals”, Mr. Curtis said. “No-one denies we’re all in a boat on a wild sea” with everyone’s skills available: “Some to build the boat, some to guide it, some to row the boat, some when the boat sinks, like [Syrian swimmer] Yusra Mardini, to grab the ropes and swim the boat to safety”.

150-> Plastic-busting fungi may help tackle pollution, climate change: UN Environment
When it comes to helping green our world, organic mushrooms from the local market may be just the tip of the iceberg. A new United Nations-backed report reveals that fungi could help ween the world off its plastic addiction, by degrading polyurethane in just a matter of weeks. According to the first-ever report, Scientists at London’s Kew Botanical Gardens reported that these organisms have the potential to break down waste plastic – an important advance in a world where momentum is building to of plastic that is killing marine life and polluting the ocean. Every year, at least eight million metric tonnes of plastic end up in the sea, sometimes decomposing into tiny microplastics that make their way into our food chain. Senior Kew Gardens Scientist Ilia Leitch, said that other fungi and microorganisms are also being explored for their potential to degenerate different types of plastic, explaining that “by understanding how the fungi break down these bonds and what the optimal conditions are, you can then increase the speed at which they do it.” In the meantime, the Kew Gardens report showcases the kind of pioneering thought that will be at the heart of the fourth UN next March, on “innovative solutions for environmental challenges and sustainable consumption and production.” Noting that there may be as many as 3.8 million fungal species, with only 144,000 named, the authors – a team of some 100 scientists from 18 countries – argue that further research into these organisms could provide answers to some of humanity’s greatest challenges. The report spells out that advances in their agricultural applications could translate into improved food security, environmental sustainability and increased production revenues. In addition to recycling nutrients and helping crops to grow efficiently, fungi also provide compounds that produce antibiotics, immune-suppressants and statins that block cholesterol-producing liver enzyme action. According to ( ), there is that climate change is affecting the ranges of species and biodiversity in ways that are still not comprehendible. Fungi themselves are also under threat, particularly in high latitudes areas where average temperatures continue to rise, such as the Arctic. These changes are already affecting fungi reproduction, geographic distributions and activity, with possible knock-on effects for our ecosystems. “Species react differently to climate change, which disrupts the delicate interaction between them,” says Niklas Hagelberg, a UNEP climate change and ecosystems expert. “This further complicates conservation; we need to quickly add climate change to our ecosystem management effort.” Ahead of next year’s assembly, UNEP is urging people to “think beyond and live within,” a motto that is aimed at tackling environmental challenges and assuring a prosperous future – that may include a role for fungi, that was unthinkable just a few years ago.

151-> In Mozambique, it’s ‘a matter of the heart’ says Guterres, lauding the cyclone-struck nation’s ‘undeniable moral authority’
Arriving in Mozambique to express solidarity and see for himself the damage wrought by two back-to-back cyclones earlier this year, UN chief on Thursday said “undeniable moral authority” lay with its people, who had borne the brunt of a disaster linked inexorably to climate change, and a warming world. “For me, visiting Mozambique is a matter of the heart”, after meeting President Filipe Nyusi, recalling previous trips as Portugal’s Prime Minister, as High Commissioner for Refugees, and now as Secretary-General, where he “always felt at home” among friends, “I would even say, among brothers.” It was clear that , which affected well over two million Mozambicans when they struck with deadly force last March and April, were natural disasters made worse by chaotic extremes of weather: “Despite that, Mozambique does not really contribute to global warming, but it is at the forefront of the victims of global warming”, said Mr. Guterres, who hours earlier, had received a warm welcome on the Tarmac of the capital Maputo’s main airport. The international community must ‘double its efforts’ Mr. Guterres said the vulnerability of the impoverished southern African State gave its people “the right to demand strong solidarity and strong support from the international community both in response to the dramas created by the storms that plagued the country, and in preparing the country for the reconstruction and preparation for future situations.” Mozambique is still recovering from devastating cyclones that hit in Spring 2019. chief is visiting the country, as UN agencies provide humanitarian aid & help with reconstruction. UN agencies which have been leading the relief and recovery effort in support of the Government, consider the nation “an absolute priority”, he added. He praised the very effective organization thus far, and “the extraordinary courage” of the people. With the initial relief and recovery effort now behind them, he said they were now “launching the reconstruction process with what is now called resilience, that is, the ability of communities to be armed to better withstand these catastrophes in the future.” The UN would be “with the Mozambican people in all these phases. Naturally, asking the international community to support the people of Mozambique, and support Mozambique [to address the] scale of the problems of both response and reconstruction”, he added. Less than half of the $3.2 billion requested by the Government at a recent pledging conference in Mozambique had been pledged, and a UN appeal for $280 million in aid was also “far from being fully funded.” "More aid and more support will be needed from the international community in Mozambique to respond effectively”, said the UN chief. “And not just more support, but the swift implementation of that promised support. That is another crucial issue, regarding the solidarity of the international community. We must not only support, but support on time.” President Nyusi commends UN solidarity President Nyusi, in his remarks to reporters alongside the UN chief, thanked Mr. Guterres and the UN, saying, they "were the first person and the first institution to join the Mozambicans”, in the aftermath of the natural disaster. He highlighted the work of several UN agencies, and added that they "worked to save more lives and mitigate the suffering of Mozambicans." The President also attributed some of the help the country has received, directly to the UN and Mr. Guterres, saying they were "a result of the appeals that the Secretary-General did personally, but also as an institution." Beira visit on Friday, the eye of the storm Right upon arrival in Maputo on Thursday for his two-day visit, the UN chief was warmly received with a military parade, traditional dances and the presentation of flowers by a group of children. He has also participated in a meeting about fighting discrimination against persons with albinism. He heard directly from several experts and children living with albinism regarding the issues they have to deal with. On Friday morning, the UN Secretary-General will visit Mozambique’s second-largest city, Beira, which was most affected by cyclone Idai. The UN estimates that 90 per cent of all of Beira’s infrastructure has been damaged. In the large coastal city, Mr. Guterres will meet local authorities, visit one of the affected schools, hold a meeting with people with disabilities, a women’s group and also visit a resettlement camp. Speaking in Portuguese, the UN chief noted that "Mozambique almost does not contribute to global warming, but it is at the forefront of the victims of this global warming." “This gives it the right to demand strong solidarity and strong support from the international community, both in the response to the traumas created by the storms that plagued the country and in preparing for the reconstruction and preparation for future situations”, he added.

152-> Healing of ozone layer gives hope for climate action: UN report
The findings of a new UN-backed , released on Monday, showing the ongoing healing of the ozone layer, are being hailed as a demonstration of what global agreements can achieve, and an inspiration for more ambitious climate action to halt a catastrophic rise in world temperatures. The study, “Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2018”, is the latest in a series of reports, released every four years, which monitor the recovery of ozone in the stratosphere, a layer that protects life on Earth from harmful layers of ultraviolet rays from the sun. It shows that the concentration of ozone-depleting substances continues to decrease, leading to an improvement in the layer since the previous assessment carried out in 2014. Ozone in parts of the stratosphere has recovered at a rate of 1-3 percent since 2000 and, at projected rates, Northern Hemisphere and mid-latitude ozone is scheduled to heal completely by the 2030s, followed by the Southern Hemisphere in the 2050s and polar regions by 2060. This is due to internationally agreed actions carried out under the historic Montreal Protocol, which came into being over 30 years ago in response to the revelation that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances – used in aerosols, cooling and refrigeration systems, and many other items – were tearing a hole in the ozone layer and allowing dangerous ultraviolet radiation to flood through. Next year, the Protocol is set to be strengthened with the ratification of the , which calls for the future use of powerful climate-warming gases in refrigerators, air conditioners and related products to be slashed. “The Montreal Protocol is one of the most successful multilateral agreements in history for a reason,” said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment. “The careful mix of authoritative science and collaborative action that has defined the Protocol for more than 30 years and was set to heal our ozone layer is precisely why the Kigali Amendment holds such promise for climate action in future.” The findings provide a ray of hope, less than a month after the , or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), released a watershed which described the devastating effects of a 2°C temperature rise compared to pre-industrial levels, described by as an "ear-splitting wake-up call." The writers of the report found that, if the Kigali Amendment is fully implemented, the world can avoid up to 0.4 percent of global warming this century, meaning that it will play a major role in keeping the global temperature rise below 2°C.

153-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: inclusion in development, Asia monsoons, Ebola risk for youth, obesity and Yemen latest
In today’s Daily Brief: Inclusion resonates widely at development meeting, UN offers help after monsoons devastate Asia, DR Congo Ebola effecting children, obesity plagues island communities, Yemen’s warring parties agree to ceasefire for key port Inclusion, equality resonate widely at key UN development forum At the opening of the Ministerial Segment of the UN High-Level Political Forum (HLPF), UN said that development is not sustainable if it is not fair and inclusive – warning that rising inequality hinders long-term growth. The Secretary-General said that for development to be fully inclusive, countries must “dramatically” scale up public and private investments for the (SDGs); take global climate action that reduces inequality; and strengthen commitments to justice, gender equality and human rights. General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa pointed out that “we have eleven years to deliver” on the , urging the HLPF over the next five days “to make it count”. For our full coverage, click . UN ‘stands ready’ to help South and South-East Asia amid monsoon rains, flooding expressed sadness “over the loss of life, displacement of people and destruction of property” caused by heavy monsoonal rains and flooding across South and South-East Asia – most notably in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Myanmar. According to a statement issued by a UN spokesperson, he extended his condolences and solidarity to the families of the victims, the Governments and people of the affected countries and wished those injured a speedy recovery. The UN “stands ready to work with the authorities in the affected countries as they respond to the humanitarian needs resulting from this ongoing monsoon season”, he concluded. Read the statement . UNICEF warns of higher risk to youngest children Ahead of a key expert UN meeting to decide whether to declare the ongoing Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) an international health emergency, UN Children’s Fund that the epidemic “is infecting more children” than earlier outbreaks. To date, there have been more than 2,500 cases of infection and nearly 1,670 people have died in the DRC provinces of Ituri and North Kivu, making it the worst outbreak the country has ever faced and the second largest epidemic on record. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization ( ) confirmed that an emergency meeting on the outbreak will take place on Wednesday afternoon in Geneva to decide whether the situation warrants declaring an international emergency. Small island communities combat obesity Obesity among populations of small island developing States is a health emergency made worse by climate change, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) said on Tuesday. According to the agency, one-in-two adults is obese in many small island communities in Polynesia and Micronesia, while on average, obesity levels in people from small island States are 60 per cent higher than elsewhere. Citing climate change as a key factor in degraded land and ocean resources, believes that this has led to dependence on imported foods that are “ultra-high” in salt, sugar and fat – and “extremely high levels of overweight and obesity". Yemen’s warring sides agree Red Sea port ceasefire The UN has announced that a deal has been reached with both parties at war over the key Red Sea port of Hudaydah in Yemen. In a statement, the UN said that it had brought together delegations from the Government of President Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi and Houthi opponents, on board a vessel “on the high seas off Hudaydah”. This was their first face-to-face meeting since February, the UN statement continued, adding that the belligerents “took stock” of their earlier agreements on the redeployment of forces from Hudaydah.

154-> Every bite of burger boosts harmful greenhouse gases: UN Environment Agency
Even though meat production is known to be a major contributor to climate change and environmental destruction, worldwide demand for meat continues to rise, said UN environment agency, , in a statement released on Thursday. According to , As humans, meat production is one of the in which humans leave their footpreing on the planet. Despite this fact, the global meat industry continues to grow, with the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) predicting a 76 per cent in global meat consumption by 2050: more meat will be eaten than ever before in our history. Beef bonanza creates negative consequences This is bringing about a wide range of negative consequences for the planet: meat production contributes to the depletion of precious water resources – around 1,695 litres is needed to produce just one quarter-pounder burger – and according to the Yale School of Forestry, cattle ranching is the largest driver of deforestation in every Amazon nation, accounting for 80 per cent of total clearance. Raising animals takes up about 80 per cent of agricultural land, but only contributes to 18 per cent of the world’s calories. Whilst admitting that it is unrealistic to expect the world population to cut meat from its diet overnight, James Lomax, Sustainable Food Systems and Agriculture Programme Management Officer at UN Environment, is calling for an ecological balance to be struck: “Reducing intensively farmed meat consumption is good for people and the planet. That means eating a sustainably reared or alternative burger or steak now and then, rather than an intensively-farmed mass-produced version three times a week.” There is also a known cost to human health, especially when it comes to eating processed meat: Antibiotics used to rear livestock and keep animals disease-free often end up in our food, particularly products sold by fast-food chains, contributing to antibiotic resistance in humans. Plant-based diets, growing in popularity However, alternatives are slowly but surely becoming more popular – with research reportedly predicting that plant-based food diets will become more common-place – including a small but growing trend for meat-free “meat.” Two companies making headlines, and money, in this space are US-based Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, both of which have received the UN’s highest environmental honour, the award. These innovators, described by UNEP as “plant-based revolutionaries,” invested in research to strip the basic building blocks of meat down to protein, fat, water and trace minerals, recreating meat entirely from plants—at a fraction of the cost to the environment. According to a study by Beyond Meat and the University of Michigan, Americans – who eat an average of 3 burgers per week – could save the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by 12 million cars, simply by swapping one of those weekly meals with a plant-based alternative. Plant-based “meat” production also uses up to 99 per cent less water, up to 95 per cent less land, and generates up to 90 per cent fewer harmful emissions than regular beef burgers, whilst consuming nearly half the energy. The UNEP statement is part of a series of discussions being generated by the agency, urging people to “Think Beyond and Live Within,” during the build up to the 2019 , which will take place in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, between March 11 and 15.

155-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Cows, coffee and sustainable farming
Small-scale farms in Panama are helping to heal land degraded by extensive cattle ranching and extreme rainfall or drought associated with climate change, thanks to a project supported by the UN Development Programme, ( ). The farms are combining trees, food crops, fodder for animals and cattle rearing, a type of farming known as silvopastoral agriculture or agroforestry. In the Azuero Peninsula region of the Central American country, which is dominated by a tropical but relatively dry forest, farmers like Dolores Solís have adopted silvopastoral techniques which improve food security and promote reforestation, as well as the sustainable use of water and land. Mr. Solís has been growing coffee, sugarcane and plantains as well as raising cattle. about how famers are contributing to building a more resilient environment in Panama.

156-> United States: UN chief ‘deeply saddened’ by deadly California wildfires
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed “deep sadness” over the loss of lives and damages caused by devastating wildfires in the state of California in the United States. In a issued by his office, on Monday, the extended his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims. “He stands in solidarity with the Government of the US,” added the statement. According to news reports, 42 people have been killed in the Camp Fire, named after the Camp Creek Road, near where the blaze began, in northern California, north of the state capital, Sacramento. Thousands of homes continue to be at risk. There are fears that the death toll could rise as firefighters and emergency responders are still searching for missing people, many of whom are residents of the town Paradise, which has been almost entirely incinerated. High winds are expected throughout the day in the area, according to reports. Meanwhile, two new fires are said to have started in southern part of the state, about 64 kilometres (40 miles) from Los Angeles. At least two lives have been lost in these fires, according to reports. The coastal suburb of Malibu, home to many celebrities and Hollywood stars, has also suffered extensive fire damage.

157-> Only one in five countries has a healthcare strategy to deal with climate change
Protecting people’s health from climate change dangers such as heat stress, storms and tsunamis has never been more important, yet most countries are doing too little about it, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. In its first global of more than 100 countries, the UN agency found that while around half of them have developed a strategy on the issue, fewer than one in five is spending enough to implement all of their commitments. “Climate change is not only racking up a bill for future generations to pay, it’s a price that people are paying for now with their health”, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization. “It is a moral imperative that countries have the resources they need to act against climate change and safeguard health now and in the future.” Of the countries that conducted an assessment of climate risks to people’s health, the most common risks were heat stress, injury or death from extreme weather events. Food and water security issues, along with vector-borne diseases, such as cholera, dengue or malaria, also featured. Despite the countries’ findings, about 60 per cent reported that the data had “little or no influence” on the allocation of human or financial resources to make the changes needed to protect people’s health. Mainstreaming health in national and international climate processes could help access the necessary funds, suggested. It noted that while two-thirds of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the 2015 mention health as part of efforts to combat change and accelerate actions needed for a sustainable low carbon future, “this has not resulted in the necessary level of implementation and support”. Previous from WHO has found that reducing carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement could worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. The Paris Agreement could become the strongest international health agreement of the century -  But many countries are not able to take advantage of this potential, the UN agency insisted, based on data showing that fewer than one in four can demonstrate collaborations between health and the key sectors driving climate change and air pollution, namely transport, electricity generation and household energy. By way of contrast, the highest level of collaboration on health and climate policy issues is in the water, sanitation and wastewater sector (45 out of 101 respondents), followed by agriculture (31 out of 101 respondents) and social services (26 out of 101 respondents). Prioritize health, resilience The health gains that would result from cutting carbon emissions are rarely reflected in national climate commitments, WHO also noted, with only one-fifth of countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), mentioning health in the context of emissions reductions and only one in 10 NDCs citing the expected health gains. “For the Paris Agreement to be effective to protect people’s health, all levels of government need to prioritize building health system resilience to climate change, and a growing number of national governments are clearly headed in that direction”, said WHO's Dr Maria Neira, Director at the Department of Environment for Climate Change and Health. “By systematically including health in NDCs – as well as National Adaptation Plans, climate finance pledges, and other National Communications to the (the UN Climate Change Secretariat) — the Paris Agreement could become the strongest international health agreement of the century.”

158-> At UN, youth activists press for bold action on climate emergency, vow to hold leaders accountable at the ballot box
Students and young activists on Saturday threw down the gauntlet to world leaders heading to United Nations Headquarters next week for , demanding that they “stop wasting time” and work harder to curb carbon emissions, “or we will vote you out.” “We have been waiting for you!” , the UN Youth Envoy, said, welcoming the boisterous crowd of young climate leaders, who made it clear from the very start of the that global political leaders are now on notice: they must make radical changes to shift the world away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy, protect our oceans, and promote sustainable consumption. This first-ever UN follows Friday’s global ‘climate strike’, which saw millions of young people from across the globe walk out of school and jam streets in major cities, from New York to New Delhi and Santiago to San Francisco, waving protest signs with slogans like: “Every disaster movie starts with a scientist being ignored”; and “I’m ditching school because you’re ditching the planet.” A group of young climate activists took the mic Saturday at the first-ever youth . Panelist encouraged her fellow change-makers that recent demonstrations are proof that “we are unstoppable.” Finally, a seat at the climate action table On Saturday, Ms.Wickramanayake said: “Climate change is . Millions of young people all over the world are already being affected by it. If we don’t act now, the impact will be severe.” She praised the cliamte strike movement, saying: “We have seen how you organize your communities … Your peers and even your parents.” And after demanding for years that their voices be heard on climate, she said: “Imagine the power of the movement you have created! The leaders are now asking for a seat at table!” The Summit, aiming to be different from the usual speaker-by-speaker UN meeting, took the form of a series of lively discussions and Q & A sessions, led by moderators and young people in sneakers rather than UN representatives. Even served as “keynote listener” to a panel of young people who were not only at the frontlines of the climate emergency, but also coming up with innovative ways to combat the crisis.  The over 600 attendees included 100 ‘ ’ winners, outstanding young climate champions chosen from around the world will receive support to participate, “Yesterday, millions of people across the globe marched and demanded real climate action, especially young people,” said , the 16-year-old Swedish climate activist who helped ignite a global movement. “We showed that we are united. And that we young people are unstoppable,” she encouraged fellow participants, ahead of her address to world leaders on Monday at the Secretary-General’s . 'Enouth is enough: No more fossile fuels!' Giving the front-line perspective, Fijian climate change action advocate Komal Kumar said her homeland was suffering greatly from the impact of a climate crisis it had contributed very little to creating. But people from her generation worldwide were “living in constant fear and climate anxiety … Fearing the future.” “Things are black and white for us: We are not insurance policies, we are human beings, we are communities. Is it too much to ask you to walk the talk, are we really looking forward to false hope?” she asked. “We demand action. Stop wasting time. Stop hindering the work [towards a sustainable future] for short term profits. Engage young people in the design of adaptation plans,” said Ms. Kumar, who warned: “We will hold you accountable. And if you do not remember, we will mobilize to vote you out.” Wanjuhi Njoroge, an activist from Kenya, highlighted progress on restoring the country’s forest cover and said that overall, youth-led climate initiatives “will cause a revolution. [And as such], we must be allowed to influence [climate] decisions. Member States must respect our freedom of expression, including online.” “This is the time for us to work together. I invite all of us to be the hummingbird that puts out the forest fire, as everyone else said it was impossible.” Thanking the UN for “including the voices of our generation in the process of building paths towards a more habitable planet,” young Argentinian climate activist Bruno Rodriguez declared climate change “the political crisis, cultural crisis of our time. Enough is enough. We don’t want fossil fuels anymore.” “The science is clear; our world leaders have an obligation to make radical change,” he stressed, adding that young climate changemakers are building a new “collective consciousness.” Turning to the Secretary-General, Mr. Rodrigues said: “Let’s stop asking world leaders to just listen to science and demand they act on science.” The day’s programme culminated in unveiling the State of Youth Platform and the ActNow platform that encourages people to take action on climate action. UN took part in a Town Hall with the participants and high-level representatives from Governments and civil society. “Never before in history has the United Nations offered at a political summit,” said Ms. Mohammed, stressing that: “This is testament to the fact that your generation is leading on climate action and drawing worldwide attention to the climate emergency in a way that was impossible to imagine just a little over a year ago.” My generation has a huge responsibility – UN chief Guterres For his part, Mr. Guterres, leaving his usual formal tie behind and opting for an open collar, that “one of the problems of world leaders [is that] they talk too much, and they listen too little. And … It is in listening that we learn. It is in giving the possibility for all those that represent today's world to speak and to have their voices be part of decision-making processes that we can move forward.” While he painted a dire picture of the impacts of the climate emergency ­– from droughts in Africa to bleaching coral reefs and heatwaves elsewhere – the Secretary-General said he saw “a change in momentum” ahead of Monday’s Climate Action Summit, due to movements like those spearheaded by Ms. Thunberg, other grassroots activists and initiatives being undertaken “at the village level.” “I encourage you to go on … To keep your mobilization, and more and more to hold my generation accountable,” said the UN chief, adding: “My generation has largely failed until now to preserve both justice in the world and to preserve the planet. My generation has a huge responsibility. It is your generation that must make us be accountable to make sure that we don't betray the future of humankind.” The Climate Action Summit will kick off a series of high-level events at UN Headquarters next week to drive . These meetings, running alongside the ’s annual general debate, will see world leaders discuss progress on the (SDGs), universal healthcare for all, and securing a broad-based development partnership for small island developing States.

159-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: climate crisis reports, renewal in Iraq, Zimbabwe’s hunger crisis, Disabilities Day
A recap of Tuesday’s stories: New climate change reports on human health and global warming; Zimbabwe’s ‘worst hunger crisis in a decade’; protests and civil unrest show ‘renewed sense of patriotism’ in Iraq; UN ‘determined to lead by example’ on disability rights. Only one in five countries has a healthcare strategy to deal with climate change Protecting people’s health from climate change dangers such as heat stress, storms and tsunamis has never been more important, yet most countries are doing too little about it, the World Health Organization ( ) said on Tuesday. In its first global of more than 100 countries, the UN agency found that while around half of them have developed a strategy on the issue, fewer than one in five is spending enough to implement all of their commitments. Meanwhile, the World Metereological Organization ( ) warned that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and more deadly. In its , released on Tuesday, WMO concludes that concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, which hit record levels last year, also continued to rise in 2019. Full coverage of the WHO report and our story on the preliminary WMO findings . Protests and civil unrest show ‘renewed sense of patriotism’ in Iraq, UN envoy tells Security Council After decades of sectarian strife and conflict, “a renewed sense of patriotism has taken hold”, the head of the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq ( ) told the on Tuesday Briefing from Baghdad, Special Envoy said that “out of love for their homeland”, thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets, asking for their country to reach its “full potential for the benefit of all Iraqis”. “However”, she lamented “they are paying an unimaginable price for their voices to be heard”, pointing out that since 1 October, over 400 people have been killed and more than 19,000 injured. ’s our full coverage. Zimbabwe ‘facing worst hunger crisis in a decade’ Zimbabwe is facing its worst hunger crisis in a decade with half of the population – 7.7 million people – food insecure, the World Food Programme ( ) said on Tuesday. The alert follows last week’s from a UN-appointed independent rights expert that the country – once seen as the breadbasket of Africa - is in the grip of “man-made starvation”. Check our story . Qatar’s past ‘vital’ to understanding present discrimination: UN independent rights expert The “inequality and discrimination” confronting certain racial, ethnic and national groups in Qatar is partially influenced by the State’s history of slavery and its contemporary legacies, a UN independent expert said on Tuesday, after concluding an official visit to the country. Although Special Rapporteur commended the Government for its commitment to break from the past and fulfil its international human rights obligations in combatting discrimination and inequality, she maintained that “immense power imbalances” persist. “Imbalances rooted in the (sponsorship) system that historically structured labour relations and conditions of residency for low-income workers in Qatar” are evident between employers and migrant workers, she during her visit between 23 November to 1 December. The independent rights expert lauded reforms designed to improve conditions for domestic workers, but urged further action, saying that more must be done to protect Qatar’s hundreds of thousands of low-income workers from discrimination. “Many people’s enjoyment of human rights is greatly affected by their national origin and nationality”, upheld Ms. Achiume, adding that she had “serious concerns of structural racial discrimination against non-nationals” there. UN ‘determined to lead by example’ on disability rights: Guterres The UN is determined to lead by example when it comes to the rights of people with disabilities, said in a message to mark the , which falls on 3 December. This year, in June, the UN chief launched a , to raise the Organization’s standards and performance. It provides a foundation for sustainable and transformative progress on disability inclusion across the United Nations. At UN Headquarters in New York, the Day was marked by an official opening ceremony, a panel discussion on new initiatives for disability inclusion, and an event on the theme of ‘sport for all for peace and development’. In his opening remarks at the opening ceremony, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly, described sport as an enabler and means of empowerment for people with disabilities, and encouraged UN Member States, the private sector, and civil society to use sports as a “medium to promote the dignity of all people”.

160-> COP24: UN climate change conference, what’s at stake and what you need to know
As global temperatures continue to rise, climate action is lagging and the window of opportunity is closing. On Sunday, the United Nations will kick off critical negotiations on how to address the problem collectively and urgently, during a two-week climate change conference in Katowice, Poland, known as “ ”. Thousands of world leaders, experts, activists, creative thinkers, and private sector and local community representatives will gather to work on a collective action plan to realize critical commitments made by all the countries of the world in Paris, three years ago. UN News put together this guide to COP 24 to answer some of the biggest questions you may have and make sure you’re all caught up, with a ringside seat on the action. 1. The basics: UNFCCC, UNEP, WMO, IPCC, COP 24, Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement... can someone please make sense of all this? These acronyms and place names all represent international tools and terms that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. They all play a specific and different role in focussing us all on achieving environmental sustainability. Here’s how it fits together: In 1992, the UN organised a major event in Rio de Janeiro called the Earth Summit, in which the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) was adopted. In this treaty, nations agreed to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, the treaty has 197 signatories. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a “conference of the parties” – a COP – is held to discuss how to move forward and, since there have been 23 COPs so far, this year’s will be the 24th, or “COP 24”. Because the had non-binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries and no enforcement mechanism, various “extensions” to this treaty were negotiated during these COPs, including: the famous in 1997, which defined emission limits for developed nations to be achieved by 2012; and the , adopted in 2015, in which all countries of the world agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. Two agencies support the scientific work of the UN on climate change: the UN Environment Programme ( ) and the World Meteorological Organization ( ). Together, they set up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) in 1988, which is made of hundreds of experts, dedicated to assessing data and providing reliable scientific evidence for the climate action negotiations, including the upcoming ones in Katowice. 2. The UN seems to be having a lot of conferences and summits on this subject… Is any of it, well... fruitful? These meetings have been vital to find a global consensus on an issue that requires a global solution.  Although progress has been much slower than needed, the process -- which has been as challenging as it is ambitious – has worked to bring all countries with very different circumstances, together. Progress has been made every step of the way. Some of the concrete actions taken so far prove one thing: climate action has a real positive impact and can truly help us prevent the worst. Here are some notable achievements so far: - have managed to bring their greenhouse gas emissions down to the levels required to curb global warming. - There are at least in the works; charging those who emit carbon dioxide per tonne emitted. - In 2015, committed to donating US$100 billion a year for climate action in developing countries. So far, over $70 billion have been mobilised. 3. Why is everyone talking about the Paris Agreement? The Paris document – which provides the world with the only viable option for addressing climate change – has been , and entered into force in November 2016. The commitments contained in it are significant: - Limit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. - Ramp up financing for climate action, including the annual $100 billion goal from donor nations for lower-income countries. - Develop national climate plans by 2020, including their self-determined goals and targets. - Protect beneficial ecosystems that absorb greenhouse gases, including forests. - Strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. - Finalize a work programme to implement the agreement in 2018. The United States, which joined the Agreement in 2016, announced its intention in July 2017, to withdraw from it. However, the nation remains a party to the Agreement at least until November 2020, which is the earliest that it can legally request to withdraw from it. 4. Why is +1.5°C a critical line? According to , keeping global warming to no more than 1.5°C global average over pre-industrial levels, will help stave off devastating permanent damage to the planet and its people, including: the irreversible for animals in the Arctic and Antarctic; much more frequent instances of deadly ; that could affect over 300 million people; the which are essential for entire communities and marine life; sea level rise which is threatening the future and economy of entire , etc. All in all, the UN estimates that 420 million fewer people could be affected by climate change if we manage to stick to a 1.5°C increase, instead of 2°C. We are still far from turning the corner toward a carbon-neutral future, and the need to move forward is greater than ever. The data tells us it is still possible to limit climate change to 1.5°C, but the window of opportunity is closing and it will require unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. 5. So why is COP 24 important? This year’s COP in Katowice, Poland, is particularly crucial because 2018 is the deadline that the signatories of the agreed upon in order to adopt a work programme for the implementation of the Paris commitments. This requires the singular most important ingredient: trust between all countries. Among the many elements that need to be ironed out is the financing of climate action worldwide. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, the world cannot afford to waste more time: we must collectively agree on a bold, decisive, ambitious and accountable way forward. 6. What evidence will be used for the negotiations at COP 24? The discussions will be based on scientific evidence gathered over the years and assessed by experts. Namely and primarily the following reports: - October’s “wake up call” , by the . - , by . - , by the . - , by the WMO and UNEP. 7. How can you follow the discussions at COP24? There are many ways you can keep up to speed on the action: - Subscribe to our so you can receive daily UN News highlights from Poland; - Check regularly, as it will collect all the top stories filed from Katowice. - Follow the hashtag on Twitter;  8. How can you participate in the discussion and do your part for climate action? You can join the which will recommend everyday actions to save the planet and tally up the number of actions taken to measure the impact that collective action can have. By sharing your climate action efforts on social media, you can help encourage more people to act as well. In addition, the , launched by the Secretariat, ensures you can contribute directly to the conversation at COP 24. So make sure to and speak up!  9. What are some examples of initiatives that the UN is supporting to tackle climate change? As the UN is mainstreaming environmental sustainability across is work, UN News has been highlighting some examples of projects, supported by or the UN Development Programme ( ), that show the pathway to climate action: in , farmers and entrepreneurs can cut emissions, one bog at a time; in the , tens of thousands of drought-resistant trees are being planted; in , the reintroduction of smallholder cocoa production in Guatemala is helping address both economic and environmental problems; in , the power of traditional knowledge is being harnessed to support livelihoods and nature preservation; in , a new generation of green infrastructure is being built; in the , small behavioural change is leading to great impact. 10. Why is the UN also planning a Climate Change Summit in 2019? To build on the outcomes of COP 24, and to strengthen climate action and ambition at the highest possible levels, UN is convening a next September. In advance of the 2020 deadline for countries to finalize their national climate plans, the Summit is designed to focus on practical initiatives to limit emissions and build resilience. The Summit will focus on driving action in six areas: transition to renewable energy; funding of climate action and carbon pricing; reducing emissions from industry; using nature as a solution; sustainable cities and local action; and climate change resilience.

161-> In The Bahamas, Guterres sees impact of ‘Category Hell’ hurricane, ‘powered by climate change’
The UN chief saw for himself the deadly power of Hurricane Dorian on the shattered islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama on Saturday, describing it as more like a “Category Hell” disaster, than the official Category 5 designation used by meteorologists. Dorian was “Category Hell”, said , “but he was not powered by a devil. We have always had many hurricanes, but now they are more intense, and more frequent, and they are powered by climate change.” It’s impossible not to be horrified by the level of destruction caused by in the Bahamas. In the era of the climate crisis, natural disasters have become more frequent and devastating. It’s time to change course and implement strong now. He said it was key for the international community to learn two things from the monster storm which struck on 1 September, killing at least 50 people, while around 1,300 are still reported missing: “We need to stop climate change, we need to make sure that we reverse the present trend when climate change is running faster than we are, and second, that countries like The Bahamas that do not contribute to climate change - but are in the first line of the devastating impacts of climate change - deserve international support, to be able to fully respond to the humanitarian emergency, but also for the reconstruction and the building resilience of the communities on the islands.” Although Tropical Storm Humberto brought ominous new rainfall to the island nation over Friday night, before moving away, the UN chief – who spent much of the day talking to Bahamians and showing solidarity with those affected – was able to visit what one Government minister later described as their “ground zero”, of Abaco and Grand Bahama, on Saturday morning. Taking to Twitter, he said he was “horrified” by the level of devastation. “I’ve never seen anything like this” he noted, despite spending 10 years in some of the most crises-ridden parts of the world, as head of UN refugee agency, . ‘This kind of systematic destruction is unique’ Mr. Guterres spoke after surveying the scene, to international emergency responders and Bahamians involved in the Government relief effort in Abaco: “I have to say that I have seen in my life in different capacities, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, cyclones, I don’t remember seeing such a systematic level of devastation. Even when I came two years ago to Dominica...This kind of systematic destruction is unique.” Thanking all of the search and rescue workers from nations far and wide, international NGOs and UN agencies on the ground, he said that the destruction he had witnessed was “a demonstration of how dramatic natural disasters are becoming, increasing in intensity and in frequency and how vulnerable countries like the Bahamas are in relation to these natural disasters.” “It is clear that this acceleration is very much linked to human activity, triggering climate change and of course the Bahamas are not contributing much to climate change...So this solidarity is absolutely essential, and the international community needs to be able to express it very strongly.” He thanked them all for working “with an enormous determination, and enormous solidarity, and enormous generosity” in “very tough conditions.” The UN chief noted that although some sceptics of the aid effort expressed a view that middle-income countries like The Bahamas should not be supported in the face of disasters like Dorian, “it’s a wrong idea, especially with middle income countries that have high levels of vulnerability to external shocks, they are not responsible for.” Now is obviously still the emergency phase, he said, “but then there will be reconstruction, resilience, recovery; and this will require massive investments, from the Government, and international support of course will be absolutely essential”. The expectations of all Bahamians would need to be carefully managed, he noted, praising the extraordinary effort on the part of the Government and people, to deal with the devastation that will impact the economy and society for months to come. The international community has a “huge responsibility to support the Bahamas”, adding that as Secretary-General, he would be “saying that “everywhere I go”. As the UN chief left the capital of the island nation later on Saturday, one Government minister thanked him for speaking to the world about the reality Bahamians now find themselves in: “I really thank you on behalf of the Prime Minister and the people of our country, for taking the time, and coming and looking at ‘ground zero’ for yourself.”

162-> In visit to hurricane-ravaged Bahamas, UN chief calls for greater action to address climate change
World leaders attending the upcoming are being urged to show up armed not with speeches but with plans to achieve carbon neutrality, reduce emissions and improve adaptation. UN issued the charge on Friday during a visit to The Bahamas, which continues to reel from the onslaught of Hurricane Dorian. UN agencies are on the ground to support relief efforts in the affected islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama. The chief is in The Bahamas calling for more international support to overcome crippling impact of - it's another sign of , with most vulnerable worst hit: Speaking to l, Nassau, the UN chief expressed international solidarity with the Government and people of the island nation. “In some areas, more than three-quarters of all buildings have been destroyed, hospitals in ruins or overwhelmed, schools turned into rubble. Thousands of people will continue to need help with food, water and shelter, and many more facing the uncertainties of the future after having lost everything,” he said. Mr. Guterres noted that the climate crisis has generated “turbocharged” hurricanes and storms, which are occurring with greater intensity and frequency. And without urgent action, climate disruption will only get worse, packing what he described as “a triple punch of injustice.” “First, the worst impact is on countries with the lowest greenhouse emissions; The Bahamas are a very good example of that.  Second, it is the poorest and most vulnerable people in those countries who suffer most, and again, the same has happened with the communities in The Bahamas. And third, repeated storms trap countries in a cycle of disaster and debt.” While the financial cost of Hurricane Dorian has not yet been determined, Mr. Guterres estimated it will be in the billions of dollars. “The Bahamas cannot be expected to foot this bill alone. These new large-scale climate-related disasters require a multilateral response.  Climate financing is one element,” he said.  “We must reach the target of $100 billion per year from public and private sources, for mitigation and adaptation in the developing world, as rich countries have been promising for nearly a decade. And we must improve access to development financing. In cases like the Bahamas, I strongly support proposals to convert debt into investment in resilience.” Above all, Mr. Guterres called for greater global action. I was deeply moved by my visit to a shelter for people displaced by where I heard terrible stories from those who lost loved ones or have no place to go. I was also touched by the dedication & compassion of the humanitarians helping them.  “The entire international community must address the climate crisis through rising ambition and action to implement the . The best available science, as reported by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, says we must ensure collectively that global temperature rise does not go beyond 1.5 degrees.  And it says we have a window of less than 11 years to avoid irreversible climate disruption and that we must reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050,” he continued. “And this is why I am asking all leaders to come to the climate summit with plans, not speeches, in New York in one week’s time.” Shelter visit for evacuees from storm-hit islands for hurricane evacuees later in the day, the UN chief met many who were also refugees from Haiti, and higlighted the generous support that had been given to them by the Bahamian Government and people.  The presence of so many vulnerable refugees showed how important international support was, " in order to help the Bahamas cope not only with the impact of the storm, but also with need to be able to assist populations that are very vulnerable of foreigners living in the country, many of them undocumented". He reiiterated the need for climate action, now: " It is totally unacceptable that we go on subsidizing fossil fuels. It's totally unacceptable that such a large number of coal plants are being built in the world. It's totally unacceptable that we don't make an effort to put a price on carbon. If we don't reverse the situation we’ll see tragedies like this one multiplying and becoming more and more intense, more frequent." Asked what the UN's key role is in response to the hurricane now, he said that intensifying the international effort was key, "because there is a lot of immediate aid that's necessary and there is reconstruction that will require also that solidarity. And at the same time, we all need to do everything we can to reduce the risks that have had such a tragic impact in the Bahamas and (the) means to fight climate change effectively."

163-> Rise in Caribbean children displaced by storms shows climate crisis is a child rights issue: UNICEF
The number of Caribbean children displaced by storms has risen approximately six-fold in the past five years, the UN Children’s Fund ( ) reveals in a new released on Friday. Catastrophic tropical cyclones and hurricanes uprooted an estimated 761,000 children in the region between 2014 and 2018, which also was the hottest five-year period on record. John was separated from his home, friends and toys after Hurricane Dorian devastated parts of the Bahamas. UNICEF is helping children deal with increasingly extreme weather across the Caribbean.   The preceding five-year period, 2009 to 2013, saw some 175,000 Caribbean youngsters displaced. “This report is a stark reminder that the climate crisis is a child rights crisis,” said Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Children in storm and flood-prone nations around the world are among the most vulnerable to having their lives and rights upended. They are already feeling the impacts of climate change, so governments and the international community should act now to mitigate its most devastating consequences.” Put children at heart of climate action UNICEF recalled that the Caribbean was slammed by a series of catastrophic tropical cyclones or hurricanes between 2016 and 2018, including four Category 5 storms. The agency has been providing lifesaving assistance for children and families across the Caribbean affected by the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. More than 400,000 children were displaced that year alone. The report, , warns that without urgent climate action, displacement levels are likely to remain high in the coming decades. UNICEF is calling on Governments to put children at the heart of climate change strategies and response plans, and to protect them from its impacts. Authorities also are urged to provide displaced children with protection and access to education, healthcare and other essential services, among other recommendations.

164-> UN agency sounds alarm: Dwindling agrobiodiversity ‘severe threat’ to food security
To help ensure the most-consumed foods don’t disappear in the face of the climate crisis, farmers must cultivate crops able to resist environmental shocks and other stresses, the Food and Agriculture Organisation ( ) highlighted in a new set of conservation guidelines published on Thursday. , spotlights the need for food systems to be sustainable, but the lack of variety and increasing uniformity of crops may render them unsuitable for the changing conditions under which they grow. “It is worrisome that humans rely on only three crops - maize, wheat and rice - for 51 per cent of all plant-based food”, Assistant Director-General of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department at , Bukar Tijani, said in the publication’s foreword, highlighting that plants account for more than 80 per cent of the human diet. FAO documented the decline in agrobiodiversity noting the “genetic erosion” in crops reported by almost all countries, and highlighting that diversity within species is at least as important as diversity between species. “The more diverse a crop production system is, including within and among species, the more unlikely that it would be affected uniformly by biotic and abiotic stresses”, Mr. Tijani added. Farmer’s traditional varieties and so-called landraces (species that are locally-adapted to their environment) are more resilient than those with little genetic diversity, and yet, food producers are increasingly abandoning cultivation of traditionally-diverse varieties, for uniform types with higher yields. The erosion of crop diversity “poses a particularly severe threat to global food security and nutrition, potentially undermining our efforts to attain the goal of eradication hunger and malnutrition by 2030.” Systematic approach to farming FAO’s new recommendations identify actions for sustainable crop growth: from documenting existing plant genetic resources for agriculture, to mapping their actual and potential uses; promoting their retention, and providing farmers and local communities with information and support in relation to crop conservation and sustainable use, bearing in mind different countries and contexts. The importance of a systematic approach to these on-farm activities has been recognized by international organizations and instruments, the agency said in a press statement. The framework is the first of its kind to outline such an approach. The food management tool was launched at a side event of the in Rome. It will act as a compliment to the agency’s guidelines on , launched last year.

165-> Sustainable fishing staying afloat in developed world, sinking in poorer regions
More people than ever rely on fisheries and aquaculture for food, and income, but the seafood industry is facing a “dangerous” sustainability divide when comparing trends in the developed world versus those in poorer regions, the Food and Agriculture Organization revealed on Monday.  “Fisheries are facing an important crossroad and the world needs a new vision in the 21st century”, the UN agency lead with in a echoing the main message by it’s Director General, Qu Dongyu, at the opening of a on the matter, which opened Monday. By 2050, humans will be nearly 10 billion in number, and “land alone will not feed us”, Mr. Donguy explained, thus, the world will need to increasingly rely on aquatic species to eat. taking place from 18 to 21 November at ’s Rome headquarters, convenes researchers, business people and members of various other sectors to identify how to maximize food from the world’s rivers and oceans, without compromising the health of aquatic ecosystems. Noting a “dangerous trend” in the fishing industry, the FAO chief said that while fisheries in developed regions are increasingly sustainable, meaning fished populations are being replenished, and conditions for industry workers are improving, developing regions lagging behind. Achieving global sustainability in the seafood sector looks murky. With the concerning state of the world’s oceans and increasing demand for freshwater species keeping best practices at bay, FAO noted. Innovation is about stopping doing something old & starting something new. It's not just about technology, it's about our state of mind. -  We are starting Symposium off with a event to change state of minds about our oceans. Plastic pollution, the effects of climate change, habitat degradation, and overfishing are draining marine fish stocks, with one in every three stocks overfished, compared to one in ten 40 years ago. In addition, inland fisheries (in rivers or fish farms), are feeling the pressure of a growing demand on freshwater species. Worldwide, one billion people on fish as their main source of animal protein, according to the UN N World Health Organization , and in some small island states, people meet their protein needs exclusively from seafood. A person derives, on average, 20.3 kilograms of top-quality protein and essential micronutrients from fish every year, with a rise in 3 percent of global fish consumption since the 1960’s, according to FAO. As far as economies go, around the world, one in ten people depend on fishing for their livelihoods and are often the poorest in society. From the mid-1970’s, developing countries have increased their net trade benefits from fish from almost zero to over 40 billion dollars each year, FAO’s Director of Fisheries and Aquaculture, Manuel Barange, pointed out at the Conference. Some 95 per cent of people hinging on seafood for their livelihoods live in Africa and Asia, many struggling to make ends meet despite the degree of danger involved in the work. Commercial fishing was rated the second deadliest profession on earth in 2019. The FAO Director-General put forward three solutions to guide fisheries toward sustainability, including re-investing in marine and freshwater sustainability programmes, investing in ocean growth, and ensuring protection measures are met with effective management. “Treat the ocean with the respect it deserves, and it will forgive our foolish ways, and it will replenish  itself and do what it has done in the past - be the great provider of life on planet earth”, Peter Thomson, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for the Oceans, urged at the Sympsonium’s opening. Four of the ten targets under the UN Sustainable Development Goal to protect oceans, will mature come 2020, including illegal fishing, which the UN’s Special Envoy said begs cooperation from countries who haven’t signed FAO’s to stamp out the problem. Moreover, the coming year will be one “in which we create a new deal with nature” he highlighted, as a host of environmental protection events will take place: , the , the IUCN World Conservation Congress, and the UN Climate Change Conference By the Sympsonium’s end, participants are expected to present a technical document that synthesized the information and debate in each of the event’s sessions, to be table at the 34th session of the FAO Committee on Fisheries, set for July 2020. The document will form the platform for a high-level policy statement on the role, value and sustainability status of global and regional fisheries. “If we focus on our science, our innovation spirit, our technologies, we will secure and protect one of the oldest and most undervalued food industries,” the FAO chief said, urging for delegates to “aim big” and take “concrete” steps toward change.

166-> Nauru President warns of possible climate change ‘economic Armageddon’
Climate change is putting Pacific tuna fish stocks at risk, potentially creating an “economic Armageddon” for Nauru, President Lionel Aingimea warned the on Thursday. The President said tuna fishing generates $6 billion annually for the handful of small island developing States known as the Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), a 1982 accord on fisheries management. “This fishery is projected to disperse and disappear from the waters of the nine-member countries and territories of the PNA in the not too distant future: another victim of the climate crisis,” he told fellow world leaders. “Sea level rise is not only about an existential threat to our small and low-lying island. Climate change also threatens an economic Armageddon if the tuna fishery disappears.” Nauru, among the smallest countries on the planet, has been pushing for action to support small island developing States in the face of the climate crisis. President Aingimea reported on national projects that address sustainable development and climate action. For example, the and other partners are supporting the upgrade of the maritime port which will boost food and energy security, as well as the local economy. The President explained that currently ships bringing basic goods to the country must moor at sea while smaller vessels ferry their cargo to shore: a costly set-up which can be affected by unpredictable weather conditions. “The new port has the potential to become a hub of commerce for our small island and the wider Pacific. Value-added services for fishing and shipping vessels will become viable in Nauru. It will become far easier for ship crews to disembark, providing local business owners with more business opportunities. The port will also open new markets to our exports and facilitate development of new trade partners, new trade ventures, all of which will provide a more diversified and reliable revenue stream for our economy,” he said. Nauru is also advancing on the Higher Ground initiative, which will see houses and other critical infrastructure moved from coastal areas to the interior. President Aingimea described it as an “historic opportunity” to build resistance to climate change and sea level rise. “The new port facility and the Higher Ground initiative, along with an aggressive push on renewable energy and efficiency, serve as the major cornerstones of a sustainable development strategy that has the potential to create good jobs, generate new revenue streams, and radically improve our fiscal situation,” he said. “More importantly, those efforts will finally create a wealth of new opportunities for our youth: something that has gone missing in Nauru for a generation.”

UN food relief agency calls for additional funding in Central African Republic World Food Programme ( ) Spokesperson Herve Verhoosel, visited a food distribution site in the Elevages internally displaced refugee camp in Bambari, Central African Republic (CAR). During his visit to the camp, Mr. Verhoosel said that “multiple generations in each family now share a small “habitation” and that without the agency’s support, they would not know where their next meal would come from”. Looking at the bigger picture in the country, almost three million people in CAR require humanitarian assistance – nearly two in every three people – ranking it the third largest humanitarian crisis in the world, after Yemen and Syria, to the proportion of the total population in need of humanitarian assistance.  The agency warned that a further $35.5 million is needed by end of the year, to achieve its target of more than doubling its support across CAR by December 2020. Young migrant’s death should prompt Athens to move other youngsters to safety: UNHCR The UN has appealed to the authorities in Greece to do more to keep young migrants safe, after a 15-year-old Afghan boy died from knife wounds at an overcrowded shelter on Sunday evening.

As African countries gear up to implement an historic free trade agreement, the UN Secretary-General is urging leaders to pursue economic growth that benefits both people and the planet.  For 🏗️  see how partnered with to address the lack of qualified mechanics to service the automotive industry and equip vulnerable and women:  António Guterres made the appeal in his message for , observed annually on 20 November. The UN chief said industrial development is “of critical importance” for sustained and inclusive economic growth in African countries. While manufacturing on the continent has been growing faster than the world average, he said it will need to speed up. Launched last year, the African Continental Free Trade Agreement is expected to usher in a market of least $3 trillion and a consumer base of more than one billion. At the same time, the manufacturing sector is projected to double by 2025, creating millions of jobs. “I call on African countries to adopt a holistic approach to industrial policy, pursuing, through stronger multi-stakeholder partnerships, green and clean industrialization strategies that promote equitable economic opportunities and take into account the urgency of addressing the climate crisis,” said Mr. Guterres. The Secretary-General underscored international commitment to Africa’s sustainable development, with the UN General Assembly proclaiming the period from 2016-2025 . As a result, the UN Industrial Development Organization ( ) will scale up technical assistance to countries on the continent. The agency also will partner with other UN entities on initiatives in areas such as technology transfer, agribusiness value chain development, renewable energy and development of special economic zones and industrial parks.

170-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: call for emission cuts, AIDS in decline, cyber-conflict warning
A recap of Tuesday’s stories in brief: UNEP calls for emissions to be cut by more than half, AIDS down but thousands of children still missing out on treatment, UN chief warns of “digital divide” World on course for more than 3 degree spike, even if climate commitments are met: UN environment agency Even if countries meet commitments made under the 2015 , the world is heading for a 3.2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise over pre-industrial levels, leading to even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts, warns a report from the UN Environment Programme, released on Tuesday. The annual Emissions Gap Report, which compares where greenhouse gas emissions are heading, versus where they need to be, shows that emissions need to fall by 7.6 per cent each year over the next decade, if the world is to get back on track towards the goal of limiting temperature rises to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius. If the world warms by more than 1.5 degrees, we will see more frequent, and intense, climate impacts – as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), has demonstrated in several hard-hitting reports – such as the heatwaves and storms witnessed in recent years. ‘Access to a free and open Internet is at risk’ warns UN chief Unless countries work together to address gaps in digital access, as well as related social and political divisions, this generation will be remembered as the one that “ruined the early promise of the Internet”, the UN Secretary-General has warned. António Guterres was speaking on Tuesday at the Internet Governance Forum taking place in Berlin this week: “Connecting all the world’s people by 2030 must be our shared priority, not only for sustainable development, but for gender equality”, he said, highlighting the role of the Internet in achieving a more equitable future. With 2019 marking the 30th anniversary of the Berlin Wall being torn down, the UN chief expressed frustration that “not only are we still building physical walls to separate people, but that there is also a tendency to create some virtual walls in the Internet, also to separate people.” The only solution, he said, is a future with “one world, one net, one vision.” Germany playing a ‘leading role’ in climate action: Guterres During his visit to Berlin, Mr. Guterres took the to praise Germany’s “leading role” in climate action, lauding the country as a “model of global responsibility and universal values”, in remarks to the press. Germany is planning to be carbon-neutral by 2050, and the UN chief declared that he is counting on German leadership, when the European Council discusses its own 2050 carbon neutrality strategy. “Governments must adopt commitments that are much stronger than those in the Paris Agreement”, he said, “and climate action offers long-term economic and financial advantages for those who seize the opportunity”. The Secretary-General thanked the German chancellor for hosting a conference that will bring together all who have an influence in relation to the Libya conflict, and to achieve the conditions for a ceasefire, and a political process that leads to peace in the country. The conflict in Syria, and ongoing suffering of the Syrian people, were also mentioned by Mr. Guterres, who expressed hope that the UN-backed Constitutional Committee will allow the warring parties to start discussing an end to the fighting, and create conditions for a true political solution, led by Syrians, to emerge. HIV in decline, but thousands of children still being infected HIV infections are in decline worldwide and more people living with HIV are getting access to treatment, but still thousands of children are still “falling between the cracks”. That’s the message on Tuesday from the United Nations agency leading the fight against the disease, , in a report released ahead of on Sunday. The agency said that nearly two in three people living with HIV, an estimated 24.5 million out of 37.9 million people, now get treatment. That means that fewer people are dying of AIDS-related diseases, but there are still major concerns that a quarter of a million children aren’t getting the care they need. In a statement, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima also insisted that when people living with HIV actively participate in their own care, new infections drop and accessing treatment becomes easier. ISIL crime taskforce chief recounts ‘unspeakable treatment’ of terror group victims The leader of the special UN Investigation Team probing crimes committed by ISIL terrorists in Iraq (UNITAD), said on Tuesday that the courage being demonstrated by survivors coming forward “serves to underline the urgency” they need to carry on with their work. Karim Asad Ahmad Khan, told the that the “experiences and needs of the survivors of ISIL crimes, and the families of its victims”, were firmly at the centre of UNITAD’s mission. “I was humbled by the immeasurable strength of the women and girls I spoke to”, he said. “Despite suffering abduction, enslavement and unspeakable treatment, they were willing to reengage with these memories in order to assist in holding their abusers to account.” Mr. Khan said that key evidence collection has been completed in recent weeks, and he cited three-dimensional laser scanning of crime scenes in the Yazidi city of Sinjar, and “the successful use of social media crowdsourcing campaigns” to collect information on suspected ISIL members, that have generated thousands of responses. DNA profiles have also been retrieved from mass grave sites.

171-> Is the world ready to end the coal era and embrace clean energy?
Access to electricity has transformed the world, helping countries to develop their economies, and lifting millions out of poverty. However, this success has come at a great cost: the energy sector, heavily reliant on fossil fuels, is responsible for some – one of the so-called greenhouse gases, which trap heat in the atmosphere and warm the Earth – and almost two-thirds of these emissions come from coal. But, despite the United Nations calling urgently for an end to fossil fuels, hundreds of new coal-fired power stations are still being built, and hundreds more are in the pipeline. Is the world ready for a new era of clean, cheap and accessible energy for all? Kick the coal habit, and put a price on carbon, urges UN chief The UN is ramping up pressure on countries to end their reliance on coal, with unambiguously spelling out the Organization’s position in his recent declarations. The UN chief has called for taxes to be placed on carbon emissions, an end to the trillions of dollars’ worth of estimated subsidies for fossil fuels, and for the construction of coal-fired power stations to be halted by 2020, if we are to stand a chance of ending the climate crisis. Many countries, particularly developed economies, are starting to heed the UN’s message. However, Southeast Asia, one of the fastest-growing economic regions in the world, appears to be stuck on fossil fuels as the answer to its energy needs: In November, Mr. Guterres of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) group in Thailand that coal “remains a major threat in relation to climate change”, adding that countries in Southeast Asia are some of the most vulnerable to climate change. Asian development still fueled by coal According to studies by the , the region is expected to become a key driver of world energy trends over the next 20 years. Millions of people in Southeast Asia have gained access to electricity since 2000, and the region is on the way to achieving universal access by 2030. The UN-backed Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), has compiled data showing that the region has the third highest number of coal power plants in the pipeline after China and India. Indonesia, Viet Nam and the Philippines have the largest coal plant pipeline of all South East Asian countries, with Malaysia and Thailand not far behind. The wealthier Asian countries are also bankrolling coal beyond their borders: State-owned financial agencies in China, Japan, and South Korea are now, respectively, the largest sources of funding for coal plants in other countries: from SEforALL shows that China was the largest international source international source of finance for coal, committing more than $1.7 billion in 2015/2016. Coal is losing power Nevertheless, the world, as a whole, is slowly moving in the right direction, and the number of plants currently being planned is falling. The amount of permits of new coal plants has dropped to record lows, and over a thousand have been cancelled,  a reflection of a tougher economic climate for coal plant developers, and the growing consensus for the need to limit global warming, and protect human health. In September 2019, four years after the , a key UN climate conference at which countries committed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing, the UN Secretary-General convened a in New York, where many nations announced beefed-up measures to combat the climate crisis, including putting limits on the amount of electricity produced from coal-based sources. The UK, for example, is expected to completely phase out coal in the next few years, Germany – one of the world’s biggest users of coal – has agreed to stop by 2038, and eight other European Union countries have announced that they will put an end to coal use by 2030. Chile has pledged to close all of its coal-fired power stations by 2040, and South Korea will close 10 plants by 2022. A “Powering Past Coal Alliance”, made up of 32 countries, 25 regional, provincial and municipal level governments, and 34 business members,  announced new members, including Germany and Slovakia, at the conference, committed to speeding up the transition from coal-based to clean energy, and to lead global efforts to curtail coal use. Here comes the sun In addition, more and more countries, and businesses, acknowledge that the use of renewable energy is not only the right thing to do for the planet, it also makes economic sense. Technology already exists to enable the world to transition away from coal, and other fossil fuels; and also to connect the 840 million people who still don’t have access to electricity to clean, renewable energy sources. And it’s affordable. SEforALL research shows that renewables are now the cheapest form of new electricity generation across two thirds of the world — cheaper than both new coal and new natural gas power – and, by 2030, wind and solar will undercut coal and gas almost everywhere. Disconnect between words and actions However, even with the decline in coal use, and growth in the use of renewables, the transition to clean energy is not taking place quickly enough, and there is still a big gap between countries’ climate commitments, and their planned production of fossil fuels, as demonstrated by the 2019 report, the first of its kind, from the UN Environment Programme ( ) and research partners. The gap is largest when it comes to coal: countries are currently planning to produce 150% more coal in 2030, than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2°C, and almost three times more than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5°C. Governments’ continued support for coal, oil and gas extraction is a big part of the problem. We’re in a deep hole, and we need to stop digging.  “Despite more than two decades of climate policy making, fossil fuel production levels are higher than ever,” Måns Nilsson, head of the Stockholm Environment Institute, one of the organizations that produced the study, said in a press release. “This report shows that governments’ continued support for coal, oil and gas extraction is a big part of the problem. We’re in a deep hole, and we need to stop digging.” In 2020, the UN launches a , to kickstart efforts to achieve the goals that make up the . When it comes to energy, the goal is to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all: the challenge for the UN, and the world, is to rapidly speed up the move towards renewables, and kick the coal habit once and for all.

172-> UN chief urges ministers to provide ‘decisive leadership’ on climate action
With nations striving to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating impacts, efforts must focus on decarbonizing the global economy and building a more inclusive and resilient future, the UN Secretary-General Monday. Addressing the fourth Ministerial Meeting of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, via a video message, urged greater leadership and vision. “Your recovery plans will determine the course of the next 30 years”, he said. “We need speed, scale, and decisive leadership. I count on this coalition to rise to the challenge.” The meeting brought together top officials from around the world to discuss the impact of the pandemic on fiscal policies related to climate change. The Secretary-General called on the ministers to serve as models and advocates for a green recovery, noting the need for governments to align COVID recovery and stimulus plans with the goals of the on climate change. We need speed, scale, and decisive leadership. I count on this coalition to rise to the challenge -  “That means investing in green and decent jobs. Do not bail out polluting industries. End fossil-fuel subsidies. And take climate risks into account in all financial and policy decisions”, said Mr. Guterres, welcoming steps to embed climate goals into macroeconomic policies and recovery measures. Alongside, the UN chief also called for sharp and permanent cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. “Coal should not be part of any recovery plans”, he stressed. Mr. Guterres also called on finance ministers to commit to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, and to submit more ambitious nationally determined contributions before the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), to be held in Glasgow in November 2021, after being postponed this year due to the pandemic. “We need all of you, through your NDCs and Net Zero plans, to send a clear and unambiguous signal to markets that the decarbonization of the global economy is inevitable”, he added, referring to the – what each country will do to reduce national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Mr. Guterres also called on the ministers, together with central banks and financial regulators to ensure that every financial decision takes climate risks and opportunities into account. This includes improving the quality and quantity of climate-related financial disclosures, ensuring that the financial sector can measure and manage climate-related financial risks and creating approaches and frameworks for measuring portfolio alignment with the transition to net zero, he explained. In his address, the Secretary-General also underlined the importance of international cooperation and solidarity in recovery efforts. Noting their important role in national, regional and multilateral development finance institutions as well as in shaping their strategic direction, Mr. Guterres called on the finance ministers to use their “voice and voting power” to ensure that by COP26, these institutions agree to align their policies, portfolios and pipelines with the 1.5-degree goal of the Paris Agreement. “This will mean an end to new coal power plants and a phasing out of fossil fuel investments; more ambitious climate finance goals and targets; increased support for adaptation and resilience for the most vulnerable; and rapidly scaled up investments in renewable energy,” underlined Mr. Guterres.

Indigenous peoples in the Philippines are increasingly involved in the national conversation about protecting and conserving the South East Asian country’s key biodiversity areas, thanks to support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). It is estimated that some 85 per cent of these areas are home to indigenous communities, who live in direct contact with nature and who have the traditional knowledge and skills to protect the environment. But a combination of unsustainable tourism, poorly planned infrastructure development and the erosion of indigenous leadership in conservation, has meant that many habitats are under threat and biodiversity could be lost.

Thursday’s top stories: food security risk from climate crisis, fresh violence threat for millions of Syrians, UN chief urges “maximum restraint” in Jammu and Kashmir, calls for investigations into “brutal abduction” of Libyan politician. ‘Unprecedented’ climate change impact puts global food security at risk: new UN report The “unprecedented” impact of climate change is increasingly putting the world’s food security at risk, a new UN study revealed on Thursday. The on climate change and land, from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), warned that more than 500 million people are living in areas affected by desertification, and are being negatively affected by the climate crisis. One way to cope with the changing climate, the report suggests, is to improve the way we produce and consume food, noting that almost a third of all food produced, is simply lost or wasted.

New wave of Idlib violence threatening millions of Syrian civilians, says UN official Following the collapse of the latest truce in the Syrian city of Idlib at the start of this week, a senior UN official urged Member States to increase their support for “critical humanitarian needs” in the country’s last opposition-held enclave. Najat Rochdi, the Senior Humanitarian Adviser to the UN’s Syria Envoy, said in a statement released on Thursday, that “a new wave of violence is again threatening the lives of millions of civilians who live in the Idlib area, more than a million of whom are children”. “During the lull in the fighting”, said Ms. Rochdi, “many civilians had returned to their homes and are currently in areas where heavy attacks have resumed putting them at great risk”. The senior UN official added that humanitarian actors are increasingly concerned by statements suggesting a possible military intervention, “which would have severe humanitarian consequences in an area that has already witnessed years of military activity, displacement, droughts and floods”.

Saudi women will be able to apply for passports. Those over 21 will be allowed to travel independently – without permission from their so-called guardians – by the end of this month. According to news reports, human rights advocates have welcomed the move, but have also noted that women still require the permission of a male relative to marry, or leave women’s shelters, and some rights activists remain on trial or in detention for campaigning to change the system.

UN chief appeals for ‘maximum restraint’ over Jammu and Kashmir, amid rising India-Pakistan tensions Responding to news that the Indian Governments has put Jammu and Kashmir – a territory disputed by India and Pakistan – under tighter central Government control, the UN secretary-General has called for “maximum restraint”. Pakistan argues that the removal of the territory’s special status, which has a majority-Muslim population, violates international law, according to news reports. In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Mr. Guterres said that he had been following the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, “with concern”, adding “the position of the United Nations on this region is governed by the Charter of the United Nations and applicable resolutions.” The UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) observes and reports on ceasefire violations along and across the Line of Control and the working boundary between the South Asian neighbours in Jammu and Kashmir.

UN Mission in Libya calls for investigation into ‘brutal abduction’ The UN Mission in Libya, , has the authorities to thoroughly investigate the “brutal abduction” of national politician Siham Sergawa, from her home in Benghazi. Ms. Sergawa was taken by a group of armed men, who injured her husband and a relative, on July 17. The Mission’s statement expressed its deep concern at Ms. Sergawa’s “continued enforced disappearance”, and complained that the reaction of the authorities provided little hope that she would be found. UNSMIL stressed that silencing the voices of women in decision-making positions will not be tolerated and reiterated its strong commitment to support their full participation in the country’s political life. Middle East and North Africa set to miss Sustainable Development Goals for young people Unless governments in the Middle East and North Africa prioritize peace and stability, the region will fail to achieve the UN’s , the UN Children’s Fund, , has said, launching a focusing on the goals related to children and young people. The UN agency stated that, without improved education and meaningful work opportunities, the region - which has the highest youth unemployment rate in the world - faces the “critical risk” of a record increase of five million out-of-school children, and a rise in youth unemployment of more than 10 per cent. Many young people feel that things are getting worse, says the report, with a deterioration in their quality of life over the last decade, and only half of them have confidence in their own governments. UNICEF is calling for an urgent boost in expenditure for early childhood care, quality education, gender equality and youth employment, in a bid to reach the Sustainable Development Goals.

176-> FROM THE FIELD: Weeding out Mexico’s unwanted beach invader
An invasive species of seaweed which has blighted tourist beaches in Mexico has become more aggressive due to the heating effects of climate change. But now, thanks to support from the UN Development Programme (UNDP), efforts are underway to hold back its advance and protect local ecosystems. Scientists say an increase in the temperature of the sea, caused by climate change has allowed the Sargassum weed to spread, filling coastal waters and blocking sunlight essential to the growth of indigenous sea grasses and other plants. The presence of the weed also warms the sea in localized spots. And, it’s estimated that nearly 40 million cubic tonnes of Sargassum is washing up on shores each year releasing harmful methane, a gas which absorbs the sun’s heat and leads to the warming of the atmosphere. about how is supporting the scientific community in Mexico to manage invasive species and protect biodiversity.

178-> FROM THE FIELD: Green wall of opportunities grows in the Sahel
An ambitious plan has got underway to plant a band of trees across the Sahel region of Africa, to hold back desertification and combat climate change, thanks to the support of the United Nations. Planting has begun in Burkina Faso on what is known as the Great Green Wall. It is hoped the line of vegetation will help the region’s people plant more crops and provide a secure source of food, improved health and thousands of new jobs. It could also help to break a cycle of migration which may force up to 85 million people to leave their homes by 2050. Climate change in the impoverished Sahel is already happening one and a half times faster than the global average, and the region is experiencing droughts every two years, rather than the typical 10-year cycle. But UN now agencies like the UN Development Programme are stepping up the humanitarian and development response. Read about how the Sahel could change course, and become a region of opportunities.

179-> Friday’s Daily Brief: UN chief meets cyclone survivors in Mozambique, Human Rights Council investigates Philippines state violence, UN weather agency tracks Arctic fires
In today’s Daily Brief: UN chief António Guterres condemns airstrikes on Syrian hospitals and meets survivors of Cyclones Idai and Kenneth in Mozambique; the UN Human Rights Council votes to investigate the “war on drugs” in the Philippines; and UN weather agency tracks fires…in the Arctic. UN chief meets survivors of devastating cyclones Meeting schoolchildren in Mozambique’s second city of Beira on Friday, UN learned that the homes of nearly every student had been destroyed by cyclones. The UN chief was on the final day of his visit to Mozambique, to see for himself the damage caused by Cyclones Kenneth and Idai, the most destructive to cross southern Africa in decades. Mr. Guterres promised the children whose school roof was ripped off by Cyclone Idai, will be rebuilt, and to continue their studies. He also met a group of disabled survivors and declared that the UN is committed to doing everything possible to help the most vulnerable people. He later visited the Mandruzi camp, which shelters 480 families displaced by the catastrophe and living in tents provided by UN agencies, where he told waiting media that the current situation underlines the gravity of the problem, and the need for international aid. Read our full story . One month of Arctic fires equivalent to Sweden’s annual emissions, says UN weather agency The climate crisis, which has led to unusually hot and dry conditions, is amplifying the risk of wildfires, particularly in the Arctic. The news comes from the latest World Meteorological Organization ( ) , which was released on Friday. Over 100 intense and long-lived wildfires have been tracked since the beginning of June. That month alone, the fires emitted 50 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is equivalent to Sweden’s total annual emissions. The UN weather agency warns that, as well as the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants such as particulate matter and toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, into the atmosphere. The WMO has produced an animation explaining some of the risks of wildfires, and what they are doing to improve forecasting, and help farmers adapt to the changing climate:  UN’s Guterres condemns ongoing airstrikes on Syria’s hospitals, medical workers Reports that airstrikes have hit several health facilities in north-west Syria have been strongly condemned by the UN Secretary-General. In a statement, António Guterres said that one of the damaged facilities included a large hospital in Maarat al Numan whose location was known to the warring parties. The development follows an escalation of violence since April in Idlib, the last opposition-held enclave in the country. Some three million people live there, many of them displaced by clashes between Government and opposition fighters. Mr. Guterres insisted that civilians and public buildings must be protected, in line with a 2018 de-escalation agreement overseen by guarantors Russia and Turkey, and insisted that those responsible for carrying out serious violations of international humanitarian law should be held accountable.

UN human rights office alarm over death sentences for 30 men in Houthi-held Sana’a The UN human rights office, , that it is deeply alarmed at death penalty sentences handed down to 30 men in Yemen’s capital, Sana’a, noting credible allegations of torture and ill-treatment. In an appeal to the de facto Houthi authorities in Sana’a to dismiss the likely politically motivated charges, OHCHR spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani said that most of the men were academics, students and politicians affiliated with an opposition movement. Sana’a, in the west of the Arabian peninsula State, has been under the control of the Houthis since late 2014, after they drove out forces loyal to President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. From March 2015 until end of June 2019, OHCHR has documented 7,659 civilians killed and 12,305 injured in the ongoing conflict, it said on Friday. Human Rights Council session votes to probe Philippines’ deadly ‘war on drugs’ The in Geneva has urged the Philippines Government to do more to prevent extrajudicial killings, linked to its campaign against illegal drug use. In a close vote, the 47-Member Council adopted a resolution which expressed concern that since President Rodrigo Duterte announced his so-called war on drugs in 2016, there have been allegations that thousands of people involved with the drug trade and drug use have been killed. The resolution – which was adopted on Thursday by 18 votes in favour to 14 against with 15 abstentions – also appeals to the authorities to investigate the deaths and to hold perpetrators accountable. The text also calls on the Philippines Government to cooperate with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights by facilitating country visits and “refraining from all acts of intimidation or retaliation” against rights experts.

180-> UN boosts humanitarian appeal to help tackle Zimbabwe’s ‘worst-ever’ hunger crisis
With Zimbabwe now experiencing its “worst-ever hunger crisis”, the UN food relief agency has revised its humanitarian appeal to step up food assistance to people most affected by drought, flooding, and economic stagnation. “Yesterday the humanitarian community launched an urgent appeal for funds to respond to the country's very difficult humanitarian situation”, World Food Programme ( ) Spokesperson Herve Verhoosel told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday. “WFP is set to increase aid, especially for drought-affected residents, but also to build community capacity to respond to climate shocks”. This morning we had productive, practical discussions w/ & his team about working together strategically to help solve the serious food security issues in . Our hope is to create a brighter future, one where every child can fulfill his or her dreams. Zimbabwe was once known as leading food producer in the region, one of the bread baskets of Africa, but its problems were exacerbated earlier this year when Cyclone Idai struck, affecting around 570,000 Zimbabweans, together with large parts of Mozambique and Malawi. The revised humanitarian appeal covers January 2019 through to April 2020, with a total requirement of $331.5 million need from this point onwards. More than one-third of the rural population, or some 3.6 million people, will be food insecure by October, and by January the figure is expected to increase to 5.5 million during the inter-harvest season, according to WFP. Moreover, most of Zimbabwe’s 60 districts will exhaust their maize stocks by October. “This accounts for 60 per cent of the rural population”, explained Mr. Verhoosel, adding that the UN agency is providing food assistance to 700,000 people in August. And “when crop stocks decline, we will scale up for the season between harvests and help 1.7 million people in October-December and two million in January-April, but only if funding allows it”, he added. WFP needs $173 million to implement its response plan in the next nine months consisting of a wide-ranging programme of humanitarian actions. The agency is asking the international community to quickly make the funds available. Mr. Verhoosel flagged that following an emergency response, “we need to think about the long term and continue building local capacity”. Citing that “the recent abandonment of the US dollar and other currencies for commercial transactions” has negatively impacted the economy, he said that while  the actual rates could be “even higher”, the official year-on-year inflation rate “reached 176 per cent in June, with food prices soaring by 252 per cent”. “Climate shocks such as cyclones or drought also have an immediate impact, especially on the rural population”, underscored the WFP spokesperson, calling on the international community to “respond favorably to this request for funds to respond to this urgent situation”.

181-> Heavy carbon dioxide emitters should take on greater responsibility, key UN development forum hears
Heavy carbon dioxide emitters should “take on greater responsibility” to address climate change, the head of China’s Xiamen Airlines told the United Nations High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF) in New York on Friday. He said that “as a representative of [the] aviation industry, we believe that it is very important to advance the ‘climate action’ of the [SDGs], and implement the ”, Zhao Dong said at Friday’s Discussion on SDG 13, climate action, citing that as the reason why two years ago he signed an agreement with the UN to make Xiamen “the first airlines in the world to support the SDGs”. With the adoption of the historic and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, world leaders agreed on an action blueprint to promote well-being and dignity for all on a healthy planet. As climate change unfolds globally, temperature shifts, seasonal changes and increasingly extreme weather events threaten this vision. Follow live! Learning, Training and Practice on “Practical Tools for Empowering people, access to and peaceful societies” Follow 🎥 More: … -   With climate action intrinsically linked across all spheres of life on Earth, SDG 13 is fundamental in achieving all the other SDGs. Therefore, strategically increasing climate action through the Paris Agreement and and managing trade-offs would be synergistically decisive for achieving both agendas. Aviation impact The impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events, present challenges for travel and the aviation industry. “I believe” Mr. Zhao stated, that “to reduce aviation emission globally, we must follow the guidance of the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] and the Paris Agreement and establish a governance model that is based on Nationally Determined Contributions and supplemented by international consultation and dialogue”. In his view, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), “falls short of fairness” in terms of Emission Growth and “exempting those left over by history”, placing the major responsibility of carbon emission reduction on developing countries. According to the UN International Civil Aviation Organization’s ( ) environment report, rising global temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions will affect an airplane’s ability to fly and rising sea levels will affect airports. After Xiamen signed the agreement with the UN, and under the guidance of the 17 SDGs, the airlines launched 12 major projects and 95 items classified into the four categories of “continuous safety, low-carbon operations, green services and benefits sharing”. Mr. Zhao told the participants that “as many as 70 energy-saving and emission-reducing measures are developed each year”, such as filling drinking water in accordance with passenger load factor and dynamically cleaning the engine. We look forward to more efficient and cost-effective clean energy solutions that will lead the aviation industry to sustainable development –  “Currently, we are looking for alternatives to plastic cabin supplies, such as bamboo pulp cups”, he elaborated. “In terms of low-carbon operations, Xiamen Airlines operates one of world’s youngest fleets, with an average age of only 5.7 years, which outperforms its counterparts in fuel efficiency and aerodynamic performance, hence effectively reducing carbon emissions”. By introducing 12 fuel-efficient Boeing 787s and 70 new-model airplanes equipped with the latest energy-saving engines, he flagged that Xiamen has “reduced carbon emissions by 20 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, compared to alternative models”. “For five years, our fuel consumption per ton-kilometers has decreased by 14.8 per cent, surpassing the global average improvement in fuel efficiency", the Xiamen chairman detailed. He also said that the airline has “the world’s only SDG livery airplane, called ‘United Dream’, with SDG “theme flights” that promote the Goals globally. In closing, Mr. Zhao said that in the future, “we look forward to more efficient and cost-effective clean energy solutions that will lead the aviation industry to sustainable development”.

182-> Coral reefs can’t wait for world to take action, urges UN, as Biodiversity Conference gets underway
Sounding the alarm about the urgent need to protect coral reefs from extinction within decades, a new coalition of organizations, including the Programme (UNEP), was in Egypt during the , to galvanize global leadership before it is too late. “It’s clear to anyone who puts their head below the waves that the fate of the world’s coral reefs is hanging in the balance,” said chief Erik Solheim. “At the moment these undersea explosions of colour and life face an extremely bleak future.” Coral reefs provide food and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people around the world, support more than a quarter of all marine life, and protect communities and coastlines from natural disasters — and if urgent action is not taken, they could be lost forever. Eight international organisations have joined forces to advocate for decisive action to protect these natural wonders: UNEP, the International Coral Reef Initiative, the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Vulcan Inc., the Ocean Agency, and the Secretariat of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity ( ). “The expectations for this coalition could not be higher. Coral reef protection must become a global priority. Coral reefs need a better deal,” said Mr. Solheim, who unveiled the new partnership in the Egyptian coastal resort of Sharm El Sheikh. Dozens of ministers whose countries are party to the CBD are gathering there, together with experts and representatives of civil society organisations, to start a two-year process to adopt a global framework for protecting biodiversity, including coral reefs, around the world. The conference, which opened on Tuesday and will continue until 29 November, is a platform for decision-makers from more than 190 countries to make commitments and step up efforts to halt the biodiversity loss and protect the ecosystems that support health, and food and water security for billions of people worldwide. In addition, governments, private companies, NGOs and inter-governmental organizations; indigenous peoples and local communities; youth and civil society; are expected to make pledges in support of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. The by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) published in October 2018 warns that, even if we collectively manage to stabilize global surface temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, 70 to 90 per cent of coral reefs will be lost by the middle of this century. Continued failure to take action on climate change will result in even greater losses, the report warns. However, climate change is not the only major threat that reefs face. Over-fishing, pollution and coastal development have all caused major coral loss over the last 30 years. Reducing those threats can help recover the most resilient reefs after impacts – such as bleaching events, caused by above-average sea water temperatures due to global warming. “I am delighted to see that the issue of coral reefs is receiving the attention it deserves. We are now approaching the 2020 horizon and need to sharpen the focus on strategies for effective coral reef conservation and to support people who depend on them,” said Prince Albert II of Monaco. “The International Coral Reef Initiative General Meeting, which I will be hosting in Monaco this December, will be an important step and my wish is that it will lead to the adoption of a practical, effective, ambitious and realistic program of action,” he added.

183-> World food security increasingly at risk due to 'unprecedented' climate change impact, new UN report warns
More than 500 million people today live in areas affected by erosion linked to climate change, the UN warned on Thursday, before urging all countries to commit to sustainable land use to help limit greenhouse gas emissions before it is too late.  🌍 Special Report on and Land: Land is where we live. Land is under growing human pressure. Land is a part of the solution. But land can’t do it all. press release ➡️ SPM ➡️  Speaking at the launch of a Special Report on Climate Change and Land by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) in Geneva, how the rise in global temperatures, linked to increasing pressures on fertile soil, risked jeopardizing food security for the planet. Humans affect more than 70 per cent of ice-free land and a quarter is already degraded, noted Valérie Masson-Delmotte, Co-Chair of one of three Working Groups that contributed to the bumper 1,200-page report. “Today 500 million people live in areas that experience desertification,” she told journalists. “People living in already degraded or desertified areas are increasingly negatively affected by climate change.” Plant-based food and fuels, key to climate change fight This soil degradation has a direct impact on the amount of carbon the earth is able to contain, Dr. Masson-Delmotte explained. Amid recent reports that more an 820 million people are undernourished around the world, Co-chair of another Working Group, Jim Skea, highlighted the fact that up to 30 per cent of food is lost or wasted. In future, countries should consider all options to tackle loss and waste, thereby reducing the pressure on land and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, including by growing plant-based, or so-called “bio” fuels, he said. “Limiting global warming to 1.5 or even two degrees (Celsius) will involve removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and land has a critical role to play in carbon dioxide removal,” Dr Skea insisted. “Agricultural practices can help build up carbon in soils, but it could also mean using more bio-energy with or without carbon capture and storage and expanding forests.” Produced by 107 scientists from more than 50 countries across all regions of the world – with more than half of the contributing authors from developing nations - the IPCC report provides a peer-based review of the latest research on land use today. According to the IPCC report, agriculture, forestry and other land use contribute to around a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, a fact that policy-makers should consider when considering how they should invest to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sectors is essential if we want to keep the load two degrees Celsius,” said Debra Roberts, Co-Chair of Working Group II, before cautioning that there were “limits to the scale of energy crops and afforestation that could be used to achieve this goal”. Reason for hope, if immediate action is taken The need for immediate action in the face of a warming planet was underlined by another Working Group Co-Chair, Hans-Otto Pörtner, who stressed that there was “no possibility for anybody to say, ‘Oh, climate change is happening and we (will) just adapt to it.’ The capacity to adapt is limited.” Despite the challenges many countries face from climate-change related pressures on land, positive action was needed now, Dr Pörtner maintained, amid estimates that the global population is set to reach around 10 billion by 2050. “There are some regions and some places, especially in the lower latitudes where vulnerability is extreme,” he said. “But even in those countries, when there is an emphasis on adaptation in their development strategies, mitigation should play a key role.” Before Thursday’s report launch, the text had to be assessed and approved by 195 Member States, a process that took longer than expected on Wednesday. In addition to the Special Report on Climate Change and Land, the IPCC plans to release its latest findings on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate next month, ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September in New York. The IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological Organization ( ) in 1988 to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments concerning climate change, its implications and potential future risks, and to put forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.

185-> ‘Invisible’ crisis of water quality threatens human and environmental well-being: World Bank report
Deteriorating water quality worldwide is slashing the economic potential of heavily polluted areas, according to a new World Bank report, released on Tuesday. It also warns that the “invisible crisis of water quality” is threatening human and environmental well-being. Smoke on the water In some regions, rivers and lakes are so polluted that they are literally catching fire. Prime examples include the Bellandur Lake in Bangalore, India, which has carried ash onto buildings up to six miles away. Many other bodies of water, however, are polluting less dramatically, but just as dangerously, with a toxic cocktail of bacteria, sewage, chemicals and plastics, sucking oxygen out of water supplies, and in effect, poisoning them. The World Bank’s study, sheds new light on the ways that this process is taking place, using the world’s largest global database on water quality, gathered from monitoring stations, remote sensor technology and machine learning tools. The report argues that without urgent action, water quality will continue to deteriorate, impacting human health, massively reducing food production and, consequently, stalling economic progress. Starved of oxygen The report’s estimation of a one-third cut in the economic potential of affected regions, due to low water quality, is based on Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), which is a measure of how much oxygen is needed to remove waste organic matter through decomposition, by bacteria that live in environments containing oxygen. Once the BOD reaches a certain threshold, economic growth in areas downstream of the polluted water drops by up to one-third, because of the negative impacts on health, agriculture and ecosystems. The nitrogen problem The use of nitrogen as a fertilizer in agriculture is singled out as particularly problematic when it comes to maintaining water quality. Nitrogen enters rivers, lakes and oceans where it transforms into substances known as nitrates. Nitrates are harmful to young children, affecting their growth and brain development. The study states that for every additional kilogram of nitrogen fertilizer per hectare that enters the water supply as nitrates, the level of childhood stunting can increase by as much as 19 percent, compared to those who are not exposed. This also has an impact on the future earning potential of affected children, reducing their earnings as adults, by as much as 2 percent Increased salinity in water, a consequence of more intense droughts, storm surges and rising water extraction, also comes under scrutiny, as a factor that is making land less agriculturally productive. The report estimates that the world is losing enough food to feed 170 million people each year – the equivalent of the population of Bangladesh – due to increase salinity, or salt content. In order to meet these challenges, the World Bank is calling for immediate attention to be paid to these dangers, which face both developed and developing countries, at a global, national, and local level. The report recommends a set of actions that countries can take to improve water quality, including improving environmental policies and standards; accurate monitoring of pollution levels; effective enforcement systems; water treatment infrastructure supported with incentives for private investment; and reliable, accurate information disclosure to households to inspire greater civic engagement.

More emergency shelter supplies and relief for thousands of victims of Indonesia’s recent earthquake and tsunami is set to arrive on the island of Sulawesi in the coming days, the UN refugee agency ( ) said on Friday, amid reports from staff that the devastation is “beyond imagination”. Three weeks since disaster struck, it is estimated to have killed more than 2,000 people, displaced 80,000 and destroyed nearly 70,000 houses. At least 680 individuals remain unaccounted for, says. In addition to the tremors and tidal waves, huge landslides turned the ground into liquid mud which washed over large areas. “Our staff described the effects of the earthquake and tsunami as ‘beyond imagination’ and ‘devastating’,” said Charlie Yaxley, spokesperson for UNHCR in Geneva. “Communities have seen their houses, schools and hospitals reduced to rubble. Entire villages have been decimated.” Mr Yaxley confirmed that UNHCR had delivered 435 tents to the hub at Balikpapan airport, on the neighbouring island of Borneo earlier on Friday. The relief items were delivered to Indonesian authorities, which assisted with transferring them to Sulawesi. Another 1,305 tents will be delivered to Balikpapan in “the next few days”, he added, noting that this initial consignment will provide “much-needed shelter” to around 6,500 of the most vulnerable. Far more material and psychological assistance will be required, however, and additional emergency tents, sleeping mats, mosquito nets and solar lamps will be delivered in the coming weeks. ‘Strong resilience’ of survivors continues “There remains a strong resilience, with people helping each other where they can and simply by sharing their stories,” Mr Yaxley said. “One woman said that she felt ‘lucky’ that she had only lost her father, and that her husband and son had survived.” The World Food Programme ( ) is also assisting with the relief effort after installing storage facilities at Palu airport in Sulawesi in early October. Another 10 “mobile storage hubs” are being set up around Palu and Donggala “to ensure the smooth flow and distribution of aid to where it is needed”, said in a statement. “WFP is due to have 40 trucks in operation in and around Palu by 20 October,” said spokesperson Hervé Verhoosel. “These trucks will be available to all partners through a common services agreement for transporting and distributing aid.” Palu in Central Sulawesi, is one of the worst-hit areas. Earlier this week, UNHCR staff went there to coordinate with local government and partners. In Petobo and Balaroa, “many people have not only lost their home, but even the land on which it once stood”, Mr Yaxley said. In answer to a question about aid workers’ access to Sulawesi, the UNHCR spokesperson insisted that the Government of Indonesia and humanitarian workers had been working “tirelessly” as first responders in the affected areas. “The Government is leading the response and they are coordinating that,” he said. “It’s Indonesian aid staff who are leading that as well. Our staff were on the ground earlier this week and they’ve had no issues with access to the affected areas.”

187-> Haiti: UN agricultural development fund supports hurricane-affected farmers with $11 million
With many rural areas in Haiti still recovering from the devastation caused by Hurricane Matthew in 2016, the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( ) announced on Thursday that it is investing $10.8 million help restore agricultural productivity in some the worst affected areas of the island nation. The funds will be distributed through the Agricultural and Agroforestry Technological Innovation Programme, known by its French acronym PITAG, extending its reach to eight additional municipalities in Haiti’s South Department, and spreading sustainable agricultural practices and technologies. "Haiti's rural population suffers from a , high environmental degradation and poor nutrition,” said Lars Anwandter, who leads 's programme in Haiti. Weak agricultural practices in Haiti have been compounded by a series of natural disasters. The most recent, Hurricane Matthew, which struck the south-western part of the tiny island nation on 4 October 2016, left 2.1 million people severely affected, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ). As of February 2018, some 622,100 are reportedly still in need of food security assistance. While the situation in Haiti has improved since the hurricane hit, deep-seated vulnerabilities persist. Over the past few decades, Haiti has seen its soils, water reservoirs and woods severely degraded. shows that 59 per cent of the total population lives below the poverty line and the figure rises to 75 per cent in rural areas. Today, Haiti produces only 45 per cent of the food that Haitians need. “[PITAG] aims to break this cycle and help small farm families improve their productivity, food security and income levels," said Mr. Anwandter. For example, the programme proposes the combinations of fruit trees and vegetable cultivations as a means to achieve larger harvests and feed more people, all in an environmentally-sustainable manner. The new technologies and practices endorsed by PITAG will be put in place through farmer field schools, a method of learning which involves community-based and peer-to-peer teaching programmes. After the training, small farmers will get tools, seeds and other inputs to practice the innovations they will have learned. Currently, PITAG – a $76.8 million programme – is already under way in many areas of Haiti thanks to financial support from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). With 65,000 small farming households targeted, the project focuses particularly on women, youth and other vulnerable groups.

188-> World’s 1.8 billion youth must ‘have a say in the future of the planet’
It is “crucial” that the world’s 1.8 billion young people have a say in the fight against climate change and ultimately “the future of the planet” according to the UN Youth Envoy . Young activists, innovators, entrepreneurs and change-makers are due to gather at UN headquarters in New York at the on Saturday 21 September to put pressure on global leaders to take action to prevent climate change. Ms. Wickramanayake will be there, and UN News asked her why young people are so important to the climate action debate. Why is it necessary to bring young people together to discuss climate change? There are 1.8 billion young people in the world today, that’s the largest number ever, so it is crucial that they have a say in the future of the planet, in their future. The school strike for climate action started by the young Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, in her home town, Stockholm, and the other strikes by young people around the world which followed, have shown that they are demanding action on climate and want to have a decisive role in the decision-making process. The time to respond with action is now. This Youth Climate Summit taking place at UN Headquarters will bring together the key leaders of the youth climate movement and provide a chance for them to engage with a wider global audience. Some 1000 young people from across the world will be attending the event in person and many more will be following online.   Is this an acknowledgement that those people in power, in other word adults, are not doing enough? It is clear that tackling climate change needs to involve all people, young and old, privileged and underprivileged, from developed and developing countries. Young people want and deserve a role in what should be a participatory process and the school strikes for climate action were born out of their desire to make global leaders aware of and act on their concerns. Just as the underlines that young people are the torchbearers of sustainable development, they are also the thinkers, doers and innovators who can realise this agenda. They have a stake in the future as this is the planet, they will inherit; it is they who will bear the impact of a changing climate. 🚨ATTENTION🚨 Across the 🌎 young ppl are leading action on crisis. Now they’re telling leaders📣, “It’s YOUR turn!” Be a part of a global voice for our future👉 share your 📽️ ahead of the Youth Summit &  Summit.  What do you think this youth summit can achieve? The Summit is a platform for young leaders and youth-led organizations to showcase the actions they are taking to slow down climate change with the aim of keeping to a 1.5 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures above pre-industrial levels. In May, I launched the “ ” challenge to young people to create innovative technology-based climate solutions. These include developing a platform to enhance the access of localized climate and market information, developing tech tools to boost the “circular economy,” an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the re-use of resources. The best ideas will be highlighted at the UN Secretary-General’s on 23 September. The youth Summit will also feature a strong intergenerational component that will carry forward into the Climate Action Summit and which will allow youth activists from both the global south and north to question world political leaders about addressing climate change. Providing young climate pioneers with an opportunity to engage with political leaders, including by asking bold and provocative questions, as well as proposing concrete solutions in a UN setting will be an important testament to fact that the voices of youth are being listened to. Beyond that, and more importantly, they are being responded to and they are influencing decision making at the highest levels. The youth summit is the United Nations Youth Strategy “Youth 2030” in action, where the first priority is engagement, participation and advocacy to amplify young peoples’ voices for the promotion of a peaceful, just and sustainable world.   What practical steps will come out of the interaction between youth and global leaders? The Youth Climate Summit will prioritize meaningful engagement with leaders from national governments, the private sector and civil society. It is hoped that a large number of countries around the world will commit to consulting youth when formulating and designing climate action policies, plans and laws. It is also expected that by facilitating these exchanges, corporate leaders will commit to working with, mentoring, as well as learning from, young entrepreneurs and/or youth-led companies, many of whom are in fact at the forefront of developing solutions to climate change. A key voice at the youth summit will, no doubt, be Greta Thunberg. How important is she? Young people think, feel and do things differently to older people and this is incredibly valuable as we face what the UN Secretary-General has called the “existential crisis” of climate change. Greta Thunberg is an incredibly inspirational model for young people the world over and a powerful symbol of their desire to take action to prevent climate change. It is no small feat to get the attention of world leaders in the way she has done, so in this sense she is creating a powerful climate action movement led by the world’s young people, which cannot be ignored. I am also very proud of the youth activists from the global south, who might not be getting as much media attention; such as Venessa from Uganda and Timothy from Fiji and thousands more who are vocal advocates for our common future and are Greta’s biggest allies around the world.

189-> COP24: A million lives could be saved by 2050 through climate action, UN health agency reveals
Taking bold climate action now, could help save a million lives and a lot of money by the middle of the century, said the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday, launching a special report as part of the ongoing climate conference in Katowice, Poland. As the world is coming together to define ways to move forward on climate action and the realization of the objectives defined in the , stressed that it’s not just the planet that would benefit -  an estimated one million lives could be saved through reductions in air pollution alone. “The is potentially the strongest health agreement of this century,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of . “The evidence is clear that climate change is already having a serious impact on human lives and health. It threatens the basic elements we all need for good health – clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter – and will undermine decades of progress in global health.” The also shows that the economic benefits of improved health would be twice as high as the economic cost of mitigating global warming, and fighting air pollution. The return on investment is even higher in countries key to tackling global emissions, such as China and India. Exposure to air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide every year and costs an estimated US$ 5.11 trillion in welfare losses globally. In the 15 countries that have the highest greenhouse gas emissions, the health impacts of air pollution are estimated to cost more than 4 per cent of GDP. By contrast, actions to meet the Paris commitment of keeping warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, would cost around 1 per cent of global GDP, said WHO.  The main driver of climate change is fossil fuel combustion which is also a major contributor to air pollution, and an important cause of poor health worldwide. When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost –  “The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs. The health burden of polluting energy sources is now so high, that moving to cleaner and more sustainable choices for energy supply, transport and food systems effectively pays for itself,” says Dr. Maria Neira, Director of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health for WHO. “When health is taken into account, climate change mitigation is an opportunity, not a cost.” Switching to low-carbon energy sources will not only improve air quality but provide additional opportunities for immediate health benefits. For example, introducing active transport options such as cycling will help increase physical activity that can help prevent diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The report includes recommendations for decision-makers on how to tackle climate action and public health issues at the same time, including: policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and air pollution; the mobilisation of mayors to effect local change; investment in “climate-smart” health facilities; and the leveraging of the health community as powerful public advocates for climate action. “We now have a clear understanding of what needs to be done to protect health from climate change – from more resilient and sustainable healthcare facilities, to improved warning systems for extreme weather and infectious disease outbreaks. But the lack of investment is leaving the most vulnerable behind,” said Dr. Joy St John, WHO’s Assistant Director-General for Climate and Other Determinants of Health.

190-> Greta Thunberg tells world leaders ‘you are failing us’, as nations announce fresh climate action
Speaking at the beginning of the UN’s Climate Action Summit on Monday, the 16-year-old acclaimed climate activist Greta Thunberg, was unsparing in her criticism of world leaders, telling them that they are still “not mature enough to tell it like it is”. The eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you.  She added, bluntly, “you are failing us, But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you, and if you choose to fail us, I say, we will never forgive you." Ms. Thunberg was speaking directly to dozens of Heads of State and Government, business leaders, and senior representatives from civil society from around the world, who lined up to promise far-reaching steps to beat climate change, at the day-long event, held at the Organization’s New York headquarters. The build-up to the Summit has included the of potentially catastrophic global warming, unprecedented for climate action, and a steady drumbeat of pressure from the UN Secretary-General, who that world leaders come to New York with “bold action and much greater ambition”. Launching the Summit, he added “We have had enough talk. “This is not a climate negotiation summit. You don’t negotiate with nature. This is a climate action summit.”  Mr. Guterres reiterated the urgency and importance of the situation, describing the man-made climate change as an existential threat when he warned “if we don’t urgently change our way of life, we jeopardize life itself”, but insisted that he is hopeful that this enormous global challenge can be overcome. The fact that so many governments, cities and businesses attended the Summit with enhanced climate commitments was testament, said the Secretary-General, to their leadership, and investment in a green future. And the solutions and technology already exist, he said, to deal with more than 70 per cent of today’s emissions. "Nature is angry - and we fool ourselves if we think we can fool nature because nature always strikes back - and around the world, nature is striking back with fury. -- at UN Summit  “This is not a climate negotiation summit. You don’t negotiate with nature. This is a climate action summit.” However, these solutions need to be implemented, and this will require “fundamental transformations in all aspects of society”, particularly the ways in which we grow food, use land, fuel our transport and power our economies. The UN chief went on to call for an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and for countries to shift taxes from salaries to carbon. Going beyond Paris Throughout the day, delegates explained what they were doing to better adapt to climate change and cut emissions, and improve on the commitments that they all made under the . Sebastián Piñera, the President of Chile, announced the creation of a “Climate Ambition Alliance”, bringing together countries prepared to commit to enhanced action by 2020, and work towards achieving zero net carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. The latter group comprises 65 countries, 10 regions, 102 cities, 93 businesses and 12 investors. To shift the world away from its current dependency on fossil fuels, the “Powering Past Coal Alliance” has been expanded to include 30 countries, 22 states or regions, and 31 corporations committed to spotting the building of new coal power plants in 2020, and rapidly transitioning to renewable energy. By the end of the Summit, delegates has heard many more pledges from Governments and the private sector, such as the International Development Finance Club’s announcement of $1 trillion to be mobilized for clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries, and a commitment by Small Island States to commit to carbon neutrality by 2030; and were told of major advances in energy efficiency and cooling, and a step up from leaders in shipping and heavy industry, who are aiming to be carbon neutral by 2050. “You have delivered a boost in momentum, cooperation and ambition’, said Mr. Guterres at the close of the conference, “but we have a long way to go”. The UN chief noted that December’s , Chile, will be the next critical milestone in the fight against the climate crisis.

191-> Ahead of UN summit, leading scientists warn climate change ‘hitting harder and sooner’ than forecast
Top climate scientists issued a report on Sunday showing that over the last several years, sea-level rise, planetary warming, shrinking ice sheets and carbon pollution have accelerated; a sobering call to action for political leaders headed to New York for summit-level climate change talks tomorrow at the United Nations. The landmark new report, which will be presented to the UN , underlines the glaring – and growing – gap between agreed targets to tackle global warming and the actual reality. Compiled by the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ), the report, , includes details on the state of the climate and presents trends in the emissions and atmospheric concentrations of the main greenhouse gases. Landmark multi-agency report underlines glaring – and growing – gap between targets and the reality. Shows urgency of fundamental socio-economic transformation to avert dangerous global temperature increase with potentially irreversible impacts. Among other findings, the report says that accelerating climate impacts from melting ice caps to sea-level rise and extreme weather were to blame for the record as the global average temperature increased by 1.1°C above pre-industrial (1850-1900) times and 0.2°C warmer than 2011-2015. It highlights the urgency of fundamental socio-economic transformations and carbon-curbing actions in key sectors such as land use and energy to avert dangerous global temperature increase, with potentially irreversible impacts. It also examines tools to support both mitigation and adaptation. The assessment from the world’s top climate experts and scientific organizations comes not just ahead of the UN summit, but also against the backdrop of last week’s global ‘climate strike,’ which saw millions of students across the world take to the streets to demand real action from politicians and big corporations to reverse the impacts of what UN has called a “climate emergency.” Swedish teen activist told hundreds of young people gathered at UN Headquarters on Saturday for the first-ever that “young people are unstoppable”  and echoed her young  compatriots who vowed to keep up the pressure on governments to make serious policy course corrections towards green energy and planet-friendly agriculture to seriously tackle climate change . Mr. Guterres told the young activists that he feared “there is a , between people and the planet.” Saying that there is no time to lose, with so many people around the world already suffering from the impacts of climate change, the UN chief has been bluntly telling  world leaders “ … come with concrete plans,” including carbon neutrality plans for 2050, options to tackle fossil fuel subsidies, taxing carbon and a possible end to new coal power sources after next year. Climate insights The findings presented by the report’s experts spotlight the sense of urgency. Amid growing recognition that climate impacts are hitting harder and sooner than climate assessments indicated even a decade ago, there is now a real risk of crossing critical tipping points, according to the scientists. For example, the report shows that the average global temperature for 2015–2019 is on track to be the warmest of any equivalent period on record. It is currently estimated to be 1.1°Celsius (± 0.1°C) above pre-industrial (1850–1900) times. Widespread and long-lasting heatwaves, record-breaking fires and other devastating events such as tropical cyclones, floods and drought have had major impacts on socio-economic development and the environment. Moreover, as climate change intensifies, cities are particularly vulnerable to impacts such as heat stress and can play a key role in reducing emissions locally and globally.  Against this backdrop, meeting the targets set under the 2015 requires immediate and all-inclusive action encompassing deep decarbonization complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and effort to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.​ “Strategies for mitigation and for upscaling adaptive risk management are necessary going forward. Neither is adequate in isolation given the pace of climate change and magnitude of its impacts,” says the report, which warns that to stop a global temperature increase of more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the level of ambition needs to be tripled. The scientists say that “only immediate and all-inclusive action encompassing: deep de-carbonization complemented by ambitious policy measures, protection and enhancement of carbon sinks and biodiversity, and efforts to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, will enable us to meet the .” “The scientific data and findings presented in the report represent the very latest authoritative information on these topics. It highlights the urgent need for the development of concrete actions that halt the worst effects of climate change,” said the Science Advisory Group to the Climate Action Summit, co-chaired by Secretary-General Petteri Taalas and Leena Srivastava, former Vice Chancellor of TERI School of Advanced Studies.

192-> To beat hunger and combat climate change, world must ‘scale-up’ soil health – UN
Healthy soils are essential to achieve ‘ ’ – and other (SDGs) – peace and prosperity, the United Nations agriculture agency chief underscored in Brazil at the . On Sunday, more than 2,000 scientists gathered in Rio de Janeiro under the theme “Soil Science: Beyond food and fuel,” for a week of exploring the increasingly complex, diverse role of soils; grappling with resilient agriculture practices to address environmental and climatic changes; and confronting threats to food security and sovereignty. “Soil degradation affects food production, causing hunger and malnutrition, amplifying food-price volatility, forcing land abandonment and involuntary migration-leading millions into poverty,” José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organizaation ( ), in a video message noting that approximately one-third of the Earth’s soil is degraded The FAO report had identified 10 major threats to soil functions, including soil erosion, nutrient imbalance, acidification and contamination. Mr. Graziano da Silva stressed the importance of sustainable soil management as an “essential part of the Zero Hunger equation” in a world where more than 815 million people are suffering from hunger and malnutrition. Soils and climate change “Although soils are hidden and frequently forgotten, we rely on them for our daily activities and for the future of the planet,” the FAO chief said, underscoring the important support role they play in mitigating or adapting to a changing climate. Mr. Graziano da Silva specifically pointed to the potential of soils for carbon sequestration and storage – documented in FAO’s . “Maintaining and increasing soil carbon stock should become a priority,” asserted the UN agriculture chief. He also noted how soils act as filters for contaminants, preventing their entry into the food chain and reaching water bodies such as rivers, lakes and oceans, flagging that this potential becomes limited when contamination exceeds the soils’ capacity to cope with pollution. In his message, Mr. Graziano da Silva noted the in which FAO works with governments and other partners to build technical capacity and exchange knowledge on sustainable soil management through the “Let us make soils a vehicle of prosperity and peace, and show the contribution of soils to achieve the ,” concluded the FAO Director-General said.

193-> ‘Global trust’ declining, ‘our world needs stepped-up global leadership’
On the eve of the G20 international forum in Argentina, and ahead of next week’s climate conference in Katowice, Poland, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for global leadership to be stepped up, “at a time of declining global trust.” In a press briefing on Wednesday, Mr. Guterres said that the meetings, both of which he is attending, come at a crucial moment: “Our world is obviously facing a crisis of confidence. Those left behind by globalization are losing trust in governments and institutions,” he told journalists at UN Headquarters in New York. “Inequality is pervasive and increasing, especially within nations. Trade disputes are escalating. And an undercurrent of geopolitical tensions is adding further pressure to the global economy.” The UN Chief outlined some examples of the stark, climate-related challenges the world is facing, such as Tuesday’s UN Environment – calling for a five-fold increase in climate action to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century – and the World Meteorological Organization’s that carbon dioxide levels have increased to levels not seen in 3 million years. Mr. Guterres made a passionate call for immediate action, pointing out that the social, economic and environmental costs of climate change dwarf the costs of acting now: “Failure to act means more disasters and emergencies and air pollution that could cost the global economy as much as US$21 trillion by 2050.” “On the other hand,” he added, “ambitious climate action will not only slow temperature rise, it will be good for economies, for the environment and for public health. Climate solutions represent opportunity, and technology is on our side.  They are wise investments in an equitable, prosperous and sustainable future.  Green business truly is good business.” Turning to the funding needed for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the Secretary-General recalled the to mobilize $100 billion per year for climate action in support of the developing world by 2020, and welcomed Germany’s Wednesday announcement to donate $1.5 billion to the Green Climate Fund: “the members of the G20 (group of industrialized nations) are responsible for more than three-quarters of greenhouse emissions. Yet it is equally true that G20 members have the power to bend the emissions curve. They also have the resources to provide the financing needed for both mitigation and adaptation.” Ahead of the opening of the G20 on Friday in Buenos Aires, Mr. Guterres has sent a letter to the Heads of State taking part, in which he warns of the “increasingly acute” threats to human prosperity posed by climate-change and rising inequality, and underlines the need to preserve and renew multilateralism in order to “redirect globalization towards sustainable development for all.” To achieve the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development, the UN’s blueprint to transform the world for the better, the Secretary-General outlines 7 areas for G20 leaders to prioritize: Implementing the , Financing for Sustainable Development, Climate Action, Sustainable Food Future, Gender Equality and Empowerment of Women, The Future of Work, and Migrants and Refugees. The letter ends with an appeal to the leaders to conclude with an ambitious communiqué that “responds to the challenges of our time and upholds the spirit of cooperation."

194-> Countries violate rights over climate change, argue youth activists in landmark UN complaint
The failure of governments to act on the climate crisis, constitutes a violation of children’s rights, according to a landmark complaint presented to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child by 16 youth activists. Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg at global inaction during Monday’s Climate Action Summit, and American Alexandria Villaseñor - who has been spending her Fridays on climate strike outside UN Headquarters in New York -  have been joined by others aged eight to 17, from a dozen different countries including Brazil, India, Nigeria, France and South Africa, in signing the complaint. The group alleges that under the , the Committee should order Member States to take action to protect all children from the devastating impacts of climate change. “Change needs to happen now if we are to avoid the worst consequences. The climate crisis is not just the weather. It means also, lack of food and lack of water, places that are unliveable and refugees because of it. It is scary”, said Ms. Thunberg, at a press conference hosted by the UN Children’s Fund, , on Monday at UN Headquarters. Although it supports their complaint, the agency is not a party to it and will not play any part in the Committee’s decision. “Thirty years ago, world leaders made a historic commitment to the world’s children by adopting the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Today, the world’s children are holding the world accountable to that commitment,” said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director Charlotte Petri Gornitzka. “We fully support children exercising their rights and taking a stand. Climate change will impact every single one of them. It’s no wonder they are uniting to fight back.” The complaint was filed through the Third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a voluntary mechanism which allows children, or adults on their behalf, to appeal directly to the United Nations for help if a country that has ratified the Protocol fails to provide a remedy for a rights violation. The UN agency added that it supports the child petitioners exercising their right to bring complaints via the communication procedure of what is known as the Third Optional Protocol. Last Saturday, students and activists met at United Nations Headquarters for the first-ever youth Climate Summit, demanding world leaders “stop wasting time” and work harder to curb carbon emissions. Adopted on 20 November 1989, the (CRC) is an international human rights treaty outlining the civil, economic, social, political and cultural rights of children - without discrimination of any kind. It is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history. Complaints filed under the CRC’s Third Optional Protocol are adjudicated upon by the Committee on the Rights of the Child – a group of independent experts. The Committee is able to receive complaints from children, groups of children or their representatives against any State that has ratified the Protocol.

195-> Forests ‘essential’ for the future, UN agriculture chief spells out in new report
Time is running out for the world’s forests, warns a new report by the United Nations agriculture agency, urging governments to foster an all-inclusive approach to benefit both trees and those who rely on them. Halting deforestation, managing forests sustainably, restoring degraded forests and adding to worldwide tree cover all require actions to avoid potentially damaging consequences for the planet and its people, according to the State of the World’s Forests 2018, referred to as . Forests and trees contribute more to human livelihoods than most people know – playing crucial roles in food security, drinking water, renewable energy and rural economies. Moreover, they provide income for some 20 per cent of rural households in developing countries as well as cooking and heating fuel for one-in-three people globally. “ ” said José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ). “Healthy and productive forests are essential to sustainable agriculture and we have proof of the significance of forests and trees for the quality of water, for contributing to the energy needs of the future, and for designing sustainable, healthy cities,” he added. This year’s report documents the importance of forests for the – ranging from tackling climate change to conserving biodiversity, reducing inequalities and improving urban habitats. “Trees and forests contribute to achieving multiple targets across the and need to be incorporated into strategies to achieve the ,” said Eva Mueller, FAO Forestry Director. This year’s report documents just how essential forests are for the Sustainable Development Goals ( ) – ranging from tackling climate change to assuring drinking water and improving urban habitats. Forests are critical to livelihoods  – José Graziano da Silva, FAO Director-General SOFO 2018 emphasizes the importance of clear legal frameworks on forest tenure rights; applauds the growing trend in local governance; and calls for effective partnerships to pursue sustainable goals. Given that deforestation is the second leading cause of climate change, the report calls corporate responsibility for zero deforestation “key.” While there is much work to be done, the publication points to numerous examples that indicate growing awareness and a gradual increase in sustainable practices to preserve the world’s forests. For example, more than half of paper is recycled today and by constructing wood panels from discarded materials, production has grown four-times faster than fresh timber requirements over the past two decades. What’s more, one-in-five people globally count on non-wood forest products for food, income and nutritional diversity – the mainstays of human life – generating more than $88 billion in income, according to SOFO 2018. While many of the world’s major watersheds have lost tree cover, the report notes a worldwide increase over the past 25 years in forest areas now managed for soil and water conservation. Further underscoring their value, wood fuel accounts for as much of the world’s renewable energy supply as solar, hydroelectric and wind power, and forests contain the equivalent of 142 billion tons of oil – roughly 10 times the annual global primary energy consumption. SOFO 2018 has been released prior to the , which will begin on 9 July in New York.

196-> Conflict diamonds and climate change: Cooperate, don’t compete over natural resources urges Guterres
The struggle over natural resources often lies at the heart of violent conflicts, fuelling strife in many parts of the world, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on Tuesday, urging governments and everyone with a stake in valuable resources, to think hard about how they are managed and exploited. The risks associated with preventing and resolving such conflicts are “only going to grow” with the increasing impacts of climate change, warned Mr. Guterres, briefing the . Citing the example of Africa – where 75 per cent of civil wars since 1990 have been partially funded by resources such as diamonds and valuable minerals – the UN chief highlighted the need for greater cooperation between civil society, governments and international organizations in regulating and controlling such assets. With the increasing impacts of climate change evident in all regions, the risks are only going to grow -  “Through certified extraction, production and fair-trade practices, and with a focus on aiding local communities, lawlessness can be countered, and tangible benefits brought to conflict-affected populations,” he said, noting the positive impact of what is known as the Kimberley process certification scheme, on curbing trade in conflict diamonds. In his briefing, the UN chief also emphasized that the wealth generated by shared natural resources, provides an incentive for cooperation and dialogue, such as in the Senegal River and Lake Chad basins in Africa; Lake Titicaca, in South America; or trans-boundary water management in Central Asia. “And, from my own experience, the Albufeira Convention, agreed during my time as Prime Minister of Portugal, continues to promote good relations and cooperation on water management between Portugal and Spain,” he added. Mr. Guterres also informed the 15-member Security Council of the Organization’s efforts to mitigate the fallout from competition, highlighting the UN’s work to address climate-related security risks, use of mediation over natural resources as a tool for conflict prevention, and partnerships at all levels. “We are [also] seeking to strengthen the capacity of women’s networks and organizations to effectively engage in mediation processes around natural resources and the environment, including in the context of climate change,” he continued, noting support schemes for Afro-Colombian women in Colombia on natural resource use, ownership, governance and benefit-sharing. In addition, a new UN system-wide guidance note to streamline the best approach to resolve conflicts over land use, has been recently finalized, said the Secretary-General. The guidance note follows , published by the UN Human Settlements Programme, .

197-> Actions not words: what was promised at the UN’s landmark climate summit?
UN Secretary-General warned leaders not to come to his landmark with beautiful speeches, but to present concrete plans for cutting harmful greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for carbon neutrality by 2050. So what, exactly, was promised at Monday’s all-day event at UN Headquarters in New York? Country commitments Many countries committed to upping their game, announcing emission cuts and other measures to fight climate change. France, for example, announced that it will no longer enter into trade agreements with countries whose policies run counter to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement; Germany committed to carbon neutrality by 2050; and China said that it was launching a partnership that could potentially unlock up to 12 billion tons of global emissions reductions each year, through nature-based solutions. Several countries signalled a move away from fossil fuels, with pledges to ban oil or gas exploration on their lands or off-shore waters, and the phasing out of coal as an energy source. Nations made financial commitments to the Green Climate Fund, the official financial mechanism to assist developing countries in adaptation and mitigation practices to counter climate change; and new initiatives were launched to protect 500 million additional people from the impacts of climate change. Profiting from sustainability The private sector had a chance to demonstrate how it can bring about real positive change, when 87 major companies - with a combined market capitalization of over US$2.3 trillion, over 4.2 million employees, and annual direct emissions equivalent to 73 coal-fired power plants - committed to setting climate targets across their operations. These businesses include well-known brands such as Burberry, Danone, Ericsson, Electrolux, IKEA, and Nestlé. A number of these companies (you can find the full list ), went a step further, by committing to “science-based targets”, which means that their corporate emissions cuts can be independently assessed. Speaking at the , Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, an Indian multinational conglomerate with over 200,000 employees, said that more and more business leaders are waking up to the fact that sustainability and profit go together, and that climate action represents the biggest business opportunity of the next few decades. In the finance sector, some of the world’s largest pension funds and insurers, responsible for directing more than $2 trillion in investments, have joined together to form the Asset Owner Alliance, which committed to moving their portfolios to carbon-neutral investments by 2050. The members of the Alliance are already engaging with companies in which they are investing, to ensure that they are decarbonizing their business models. Unlocking the power of nature Using the power of nature is believed to be one of the most ways to address the climate crisis. Strengthening natural ecosystems such as forests, for example, is one such solution: more forests means more capacity for carbon capture, and replanting mangrove forests provides an effective and cheap natural barrier against coastal floods and shoreline erosion. Monday saw the launch of several initiatives designed to boost nature-based solutions. These include the Global Campaign for Nature, which plans to conserve around 30 percent of the Earth’s lands and oceans by 2030; a High-Level Panel for the Sustainable Ocean Economy, which will build resilience for the ocean and marine-protected areas; and the Central African Forest Initiative promises to protect the region’s forest cover, which provides livelihoods for some 60 million people. Cleaning up cities It is now possible to construct buildings that are 100 per cent net-zero carbon emitters, and the initiative is pledging to make all buildings – new build and existing – net zero carbon by 2050. This could potentially lead to a $1 trillion investment in developing countries, by 2030. A total of 2000 cities committed to placing climate risk at the centre of their decision-making, planning and investments: this includes launching 1,000 bankable, climate-smart urban projects, and creating innovative financing mechanisms. Tackling traffic congestion and pollution is the aim of the Action Towards Climate Friendly Transport initiative, which includes actions to plan city development in a way that minimises travel, shift from fossil-fuelled vehicles to non-motorized and public transport, and increase the use of zero-emission technologies. A full list of the many initiatives announced during the Climate Action Summit can be found . A nine-track mind

198-> ‘Embrace the transformation’ to a carbon-neutral world by 2050, UN chief tells COP25
With millions of workers increasingly affected by the climate crisis the route to securing livelihoods in the future lies in a wholesale transformation of how we power the planet and manage our resources, the UN chief said on Thursday, at a COP25 climate action event focused on greener jobs. “We are still losing the climate race”, said in Madrid, “but we can choose another path, the path of climate action and well-being for people and planet”, which is about jobs, health, education, opportunities and the future. He maintained that the answer to the climate crisis “lies in transforming how we generate our power, design our cities, and manage our land”, but it also requires actions “consistent with making people’s lives better”. The enormous opportunities linked to are overlooked too often. Economic growth and tackling the climate crisis go hand in hand. The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now.   The agreed in 2015 included “a just transition” for people whose jobs and livelihoods are impacted by moving “from the grey economy to the green”, he noted, part of the (SDGs). “We can no longer refuse to face up to the climate crisis”, he spelled out, urging governments to commit, businesses to lead and people everywhere to “embrace the transformation that will bring us to a carbon-neutral world by 2050”. New Climate Economy Mr. Guterres spoke encouragingly about “enormous opportunities” linked to climate action. According to the UN chief, shifting to a low-carbon economy represents a $26 trillion-dollar growth opportunity that could create 65 million new jobs by 2030 – with solar, wind and geothermal energy already being the fastest-growing job creators in several economies. “The green economy is the economy of the future and we need to make way for it right now”, he stated, encouraging countries to re-train people so they can “switch careers with the concept that education now became a lifelong enterprise”. Stressing that the transition to a low-carbon future be “fair and inclusive”, he said that this means “a future of green and decent jobs…of thriving, resilient communities, cities and countries.” Climate Action for Jobs Meanwhile, the initiative, which the UN chief launched at the conference with  Guy Ryder, Director-General of the International Labour Organization ( ), puts job creation and livelihoods at the centre of national climate action plans, the UN chief enumerated measures to ensure inclusivity, such as assessing the employment, social and economic impacts of ecological transition and the potential of green jobs. We cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time --  He underscored that economic growth and tackling climate change are “mutually reinforcing”, adding that “failing to tackle global heating is a sure-fire recipe for economic disaster”. Cleaner, greener future for all Detailing the need to “reduce emissions 45 per cent by 2030 from 2010 levels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and stabilize global temperature rise at 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century”, Mr. Guterres said the Paris Agreement must be used as “our multilateral path forward”. Without achieving our climate goals, the Secretary-General maintained that only the richest would survive. And because “we cannot continue to have one foot in both the grey and the green economies at the same time”, he underlined that developed nations must fulfil their pledges under the Paris Agreement to mobilize at least $100 billion dollars a year for mitigation and adaptation in developing nations. Decisive challenge of our time For his part, ILO Director-General Guy Ryder told delegates that greening the world of work was “the defining and decisive challenge of our time.” He called for “a jobs-and-human-centred policy agenda for climate action, based on country-level assessments, innovative social protection and strong consensus” saying the initiative “can make a major contribution” to this. Moreover, it will focus on three inter-related, complimentary areas of advocacy and outreach; a policy innovation hub that will gather knowledge and generate innovative solutions; and capacity building and support for governments, workers’ and employers’ organizations. “The fight against climate change is inextricably linked with the battle for greater social justice”, he concluded.

199-> Monday’s Daily Brief: 'Waste to wealth' campaign, nuclear power and climate change, 'dangerous nationalism' a threat, Hammarskjöld latest
Waste can have a devastating effect on public health, the environment, and the climate, but cutting-edge innovation and technology can provide improved, cheaper solutions to the challenge, and help cities and communities to see waste as a business opportunity. This was the message marking World Habitat Day, on Monday, with a focus on waste management. Linked to the International Day, , the United Nations agency for human settlements, has launched a " " campaign, to address the increasing challenges of coping with solid waste. As part of the campaign, cities are invited to confirm their commitment to uphold a set of principles. These include assessing the quantity and type of waste, improving waste collection, ensuring cities are environmentally safe, and implementing waste-to-energy schemes. our full story. Hate speech and misguided nationalism present a serious threat to efforts to tackle statelessness, despite growing public awareness of the problem, UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said on Monday. Speaking at a meeting in Geneva aiming to convince more countries to assist the many millions of people around the world who live in nationless limbo, Mr. Grandi warned that much more action was needed, five years since launched its #IBelong campaign to end statelessness. To date, around 200 countries have pledged to work with on solutions to statelessness, which the UN agency aims to eradicate by 2024 Get the full story Following reports that the United States is withdrawing troops from northeast Syria, the UN warned on Monday against the further displacement of civilians from the war-torn region. Regional Humanitarian Coordinator, Panos Moumtzis, reportedly told correspondents in Geneva the UN had made contingency plans to assist civilians forced to flee south, if Turkish forces advance on Kurdish positions, following the US policy shift. He said any military operation had to take the effects on civilians into account, adding that the UN is “hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst”, according to news reports. US allies, the Syrian Kurdish militia, or YPG, are considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, with Ankara arguing for the creation of a so-called “safe zone” for civilians along the Syrian border, under its control. Mr. Moumtzis said that the concept had not worked in the past, referencing the massacre of Bosnian Muslims at the hands of Bosnian Serbs in Srebrenica, in 1995. UN chief renews call for answers in Hammarskjöld cold case The UN chief has said he is “deeply committed” to continuing the investigation searching for definitive answers over the tragic deaths of former Secretary-General, Dag Hammarskjöld, and 15 others traveling with him aboard a flight enroute to settle conflict in the Congo’s Katanga, in September of 1961. Mr. Guterres noted that according to a new report, the appointed investigator (Eminent Person) has received new information about possible causes of the plane crash in what was then Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, which claimed the lives of Mr. Hammarskjöld  and those onboard. The cause of the crash, whether accidental or as some believe, an assassination plot, continues to be debated. New information has surfaced regarding intercepts by Member States of communications surrounding the crash, the ability of Katanga’s armed forces or others to have staged an attack, and the presence of foreign paramilitary or intelligence personnel in the area; a rebel-held region of the Congo at the time. Mr. Guterres has expressed a need for renewed urgency in resolving once and for all the truth behind the cold case, despite noting that the Eminent Person leading the inquiry had noted the "excellent" cooperation on the part of Member States and private individuals, surrounding the investigation. In a attributed to his Spokesman, Mr. Guterres said “we owe this to Dag Hammarskjold and the members of the party accompanying him.” Without significantly increasing the use of nuclear power worldwide, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of reducing harmful emissions and fighting climate change, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( ), said on Monday. Cornel Feruta, the agency’s acting Director-General, spoke at the opening of the first-ever International Conference on Climate Change and the Role of Nuclear power in Vienna. The pointed out that nuclear power contributes around one-third of all low carbon electricity, producing practically no greenhouse gases, and some 10 per cent of the total electricity produced worldwide.

200-> Earth’s oceans and frozen spaces paying price for ‘taking the heat of global warming’
Our oceans and frozen spaces have been “taking the heat” for global warming for decades, climate experts , warning that without a radical change in human behaviour, hundreds of millions of people could suffer from rising sea levels, frequent natural disasters and food shortages. “The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive”, the report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) states. “Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea level rise, and coastal extreme events are becoming more severe.” 🌊 Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate Our Ocean and Cryosphere - They sustain us. They are under pressure. Their changes affect all our lives. The time for action is now. PR ➡️ SPM ➡️  According to the report on the ocean and cryosphere - the frozen parts of the planet - global warming has already reached one degree Celsius above the pre-industrial level. This temperature rise, which the 195-strong Member State body attributes to greenhouse gas emissions, has resulted in “profound consequences” for people and the planet. “The world’s ocean and cryosphere have been ‘taking the heat’ from climate change for decades, and consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, Vice-Chair of the IPCC. In total, 670 million people who live in the world’s high mountain regions and around the same number in low-lying coastal zones “depend directly” on the planet’s oceans and frozen resources, the IPCC notes. In addition, four million people live permanently in the Arctic region, and small island developing states are home to 65 million people. In a bid to protect them, their surroundings and livelihoods, the IPCC is calling for the introduction of measures to limit global warming “to the lowest possible level”, in line with the internationally agreed 2015 . “If we reduce emissions sharply, (the) consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable”, said Hoesung Lee, Chair of the IPCC. “The open sea, the Arctic, the Antarctic and the high mountains may seem far away to many people. But we depend on them and are influenced by them directly and indirectly in many ways – for weather and climate, for food and water, for energy, trade, transport, recreation and tourism, for health and wellbeing, for culture and identity.” According to the IPCC report, average sea level rise is now 3.6 millimetres a year. This is more than twice as fast as during the last century and levels could rise more than a metre by 2100 “if greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase strongly”. The result is likely to be more extreme sea level events that occur during high tides and intense storms. “Indications are that with any degree of additional warming, events that occurred once per century in the past, will occur every year by mid-century in many regions, increasing risks for many low-lying coastal cities and small islands”, the report states. Without major investments in adaptation, these low-lying zones would be exposed to escalating flood risks, and some island nations “are likely to become uninhabitable”. Glaciers could shrink 80 per cent, by 2100 Highlighting the importance of coordinated, ambitious and urgent action to mitigate the impact of global warming, the IPCC report also warns that glaciers, snow, ice and permafrost are declining “and will continue to do so”. In Europe, eastern Africa, the tropical Andes and Indonesia, smaller glaciers are projected to lose more than 80 per cent of their current ice mass by 2100, under worst emission scenarios. This is likely to increase hazards for people, for example through landslides, avalanches, rockfalls and floods, in addition to farmers and hydroelectric power producers downstream. “Changes in water availability will not just affect people in these high mountain regions, but also communities much further downstream”, said Panmao Zhai, Co-Chair of IPCC’s Working Group I. Sea ice getting thinner every month On sea ice, the IPCC report underscores that the extent of Arctic ice has declined every month, “and it is getting thinner”. If global warming can be kept to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the Arctic ocean would only be ice-free in September once in every 100 years, the study suggests. At two degrees Celsius, however, this would occur up to one year in three. “Some people living in the Arctic, especially indigenous peoples, have already adjusted their traveling and hunting activities to the seasonality and safety of land, ice and snow conditions, and some coastal communities have planned for relocation,” the report states. Permafrost ‘warming and thawing’ Turning to permafrost - ground that has been frozen for many years – the IPCC suggests that it is “warming and thawing and widespread permafrost thaw is projected to occur in the 21st Century”. Even if global warming is limited to well below two degrees Celsius below pre-industrial levels, around a quarter of the permafrost down to three to four metres depth, will thaw by 2100. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase strongly, there is a potential that around 70 per cent this near-surface permafrost could be lost. In writing the report, more than 100 authors from 36 countries assessed the latest scientific literature on the ocean and cryosphere, basing their findings on some 7,000 scientific publications. It will provide input for world leaders gathering in forthcoming climate and environment negotiations, such as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference (COP25) in Chile, in December.

201-> On World Day to Combat Desertification, UN shines spotlight on ‘true value’ of land
Land is not a limitless resource and ignoring its role in our everyday lives threatens food and water supplies, biodiversity and the security of us all, the United Nations agency that fights desertification worldwide has said. In a statement marking the , the head of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ( ) said that everyone needed to recognize the true value of land. “I would ask you: when you choose what to eat, what to wear or what to drive, think about how your choice impacts the land — for better or for worse,” said Monique Barbut, UNCCD Executive Secretary, in her for the day, marked on 17 June. Land-grabbing, unplanned urban sprawl, unsustainable agriculture and over-consumption can yield quick economic gains, but such short-sightedness eventually causes degradation and loss of critical ecosystem services due to unsustainable land use. As a result, a third of the world’s usable land has already severely degraded over the last 30 years, with 75 billion tons of soil from arable land lost annually, said UNCCD. However, the UNCCD says everyone can contribute to, and benefit from, investing in sustainable land management — as consumers, producers, corporations or governments. Farmers can invest in smart agriculture with higher yields but reduced pesticides. Policymakers and land managers can invest in sustainable land management while consumers can choose to spend on organic and fair-trade products that avoid ruining the land. “Let us work together to transform the way we consume, produce, work, and live together without compromising our current or future social, economic or environmental security. Without compromising the land on which it all depends,” said Ms. Barbut. The UN General Assembly established the World Day in 1994 to promote public awareness of land degradation and to draw attention to the implementation of the UNCCD — the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management. The World Day is observed annually on 17 June, the date the UNCCD was adopted. This year’s theme for the Day is “Land has true value — invest in it.” The campaign hopes to promote changes in behaviour and adoption of more efficient planning and practices, to ensure there are sufficient land resources for the world’s long-term sustainability and economic prosperity.

202-> FROM THE FIELD: Cultivating a response to disasters in Malawi
Farmers in Malawi who are struggling with the dual threats of climate change and an economic crisis worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, are learning how to more accurately predict the weather and prepare for the eventuality of natural disasters, thanks to a project supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). In recent years, East and Southern Africa have experienced an increase in floods, droughts and other severe and irregular climatic conditions which have wiped out crops and crippled the productivity of many farmers. But the UNDP and government-backed project is now providing three million Malawians with life-saving climate information and early warnings of extreme weather, as well as techniques they can adapt to grow crops which are more resilient to the change in climatic conditions. On the read more about how farmers are cultivating a new approach to the land.

203-> The 2010 – 2020 UN News Decade in Review, part two
With the 2020s now in full view, welcome to the second in our three-part series looking back at some of the major UN-related stories of the past decade. In part two, we take in the years 2014 to 2016, which saw the worst outbreak of Ebola ever recorded; new hope that the climate crisis could be tackled by world leaders, through the historic Paris climate agreement; a UN mission in Colombia to facilitate a much-awaited peace process; and the launch of the UN’s 2030 Agenda, a plan of action for people, the planet and prosperity.  In December 2013, in the village of Meliandou, in Guinea, a toddler named Emile Ouamouno died. It was a tragedy for his family, but the child’s death took on a much wider significance, when Emile was named as patient zero, in what became the worst outbreak of Ebola in history. The deadly, highly contagious virus spread rapidly through Guinea, as well as neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, to become known as the Western Africa Ebola Outbreak. the economies of the three countries came close to collapse, and health services were strained to their limits. Some 6,000 deaths were recorded that year, and whole communities paralysed by fear. By August 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), in order to ensure a coordinated international response, release international funding, and halt the further spread of the disease to other countries. It would take two years until the WHO was able to declare the PHEIC over, by which time it had recorded 28,616 cases of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and 11,310 deaths. A 2016 independent commissioned by WHO, noted that there had been a delay in identifying the unprecedented scale of the outbreak, and highlighted the importance of improved training for teams of health workers and improved communication between health networks. Sadly, since 2018, another part of Africa has been contending with the on record: more than 2,200 lives have been lost, amid some 3,300 confirmed infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The eastern part of the country, where the outbreak is centred, is also facing serious insecurity and violence, which is hampering efforts to contain the disease. Following in November 2019, the WHO declared that around a third of its Ebola response team in the Beni region had been temporarily relocated, a move that would, the UN health agency warned, make the further spread of the virus more likely. 🎥  Hopes were raised for the environment in December 2015, at the adoption of the on climate change. For the first time, practically all countries of the world pledged to combat the climate crisis and adapt to its consequences, which include the existential threat of global warming. Ban Ki-Moon, the then Secretary-General, the agreement as a “monumental triumph”, writing on social media that it “sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all.” The deal was adopted following two weeks of negotiations at the UN climate change conference, covering the areas deemed necessary for a landmark conclusion: mitigation, in order to keep temperatures no more than 2 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial levels; adaptation, so that countries can deal better with the impacts of climate change; and support, with finance available for the most vulnerable, and poorest nations. The adoption took place in a spirit of high emotion and hope, with tears in the eyes of many delegates. Mr Ban said that all of those involved should be proud of what they had achieved, but ended his remarks to delegates by noting that the Agreement is just the beginning, because “the work starts tomorrow”. Four years on, the deal is still seen as a key staging post on the long road towards a cleaner, more sustainable global economy, but there have been many indicators that not enough work has been done: a host of damning environmental reports and studies have shown continuing damage to the environment, due to man-made climate change, and the likelihood that if we continue on the current path, temperatures will soar well beyond the level of 1.5 degrees, and the consequences for many will be catastrophic. Mr Ban’s successor as UN chief, António Guterres, has made the climate crisis one of the central pillars of his mandate, instituting several initiatives that ensured the issue was given fresh momentum and focus, particularly in 2019 (more in the third and final part of our Decade in Review). 🎥  For the first 15 years of the 21st Century, many of the UN’s activities were guided by the , with eight objectives ranging from halving extreme poverty rates, to halting the spread of HIV/AIDS and providing universal primary education. By 2015, the target year for the goals, much positive work had been achieved, but a new vision was needed. This came in the form of the for Sustainable Development, which was officially launched in 2016, and was designed to build on the MDGs and complete what they were not able to accomplish. The Agenda set out a plan of action for people, the planet and prosperity, including the eradication of poverty, described by the UN as “the greatest global challenge, and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development”. 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were announced, with targets designed to bring about action in five main areas: People (eradication of poverty and hunger), Planet (protection from degradation and urgent action on climate change), Prosperity (ensuring prosperous and fulfilling lives for all), Peace (fostering societies free from fear and violence) and Partnership (in order to mobilize the means to achieve the Goals). At the launch of the Goals, the then Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon, said that the SDGs represent a “shared vision of humanity and a social contract between the world’s leaders and the people. They are a to-do list for people and the planet, and a blueprint for success”. In 2020 there will be just 10 years left to achieve the Goals and implement the Agenda, and the UN has launched a Decade of Action to speed up the process. This was announced in September 2019, at the first , which was convened at UN Headquarters in New York. Speaking at the closure of the two-day conference, Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said that she had drawn three concrete messages from the summit: a renewed commitment from world leaders to implement the Agenda, which she described as critical to respond to the world’s greatest challenges; an acknowledgement that the Goals are off track, and a determination to step up efforts to achieve them; and clarity on the task ahead, with a decisive decade left to “nurture more ambitious global action; local action; and people action”. Peace in Colombia On 24 November of 2016, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the signing of a peace agreement between the Government of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP), ending an armed conflict that had been ongoing for more than five decades, since 1964. Both parties requested the to establish a mission to monitor the compliance of the commitments stipulated in the agreement, such as the disarmament and reinstatement of ex-combatants into civil society. In March 2017, the UN Mission in Colombia began the process of verifying  the handing over of weapons from the FARC-EP, which successfully concluded on 26 September. In total, 8,994 weapons were delivered, including guns, assault rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers; as well as almost two million ammunition and 3528 antipersonnel mines. The Organization continues to support compliance with the Peace Agreement  through the UN Verification Mission in Colombia , approved by the Security Council in its 2017 resolution 2377. During his visit to the country in January 2018, UN said that the peace process was an “extraordinary” transformation that generated hope for the country's future . However, since the signing of the Peace Agreement and until the beginning of 2019, 163 murders of social leaders and human rights defenders in the country had been verified. A total of 454 cases were reported, most of which  occurred in areas abandoned by the former FARC-EP and where the State has a limited presence. The UN chief has said that the situation of indigenous leaders deserves special attention because there has been "a serious increase" in the number of murders, threats, cases of confinement, forced displacement and forced recruitment. He has also indicated his concern about the killings of more than 100 demobilized FARC. Mr. Guterres has flagged that much remains to be done to consolidate peace, which will require a coordinated effort  by the Government and state institutions, political parties, the private sector and civil society, with the accompaniment of the international community. 🎥

204-> Ambition, transformation, active citizenship: COP24 looks to next year’s big UN Climate Change Summit
With thousands gathered in Katowice, Poland, for the ‘ ’ meeting to chart the way forward for climate action, United Nations chief António Guterres his longer-term vision on Tuesday for the . “The Summit will focus on delivering three key outcomes: raising real ambition; transformative action in the real economy; and an unprecedented citizen and youth mobilization,” said the UN Secretary-General, speaking to a room full of reporters and change-makers attending the 24th Conference of the Parties ( ) of the UN Climate Change Convention ( ). Scheduled for 23 September 2019 at UN headquarters in New York, the event aims to galvanize support for urgent climate action at the highest political levels. “We are holding the event during the high-level week of the UN General Assembly to ensure we have as many heads of State and Heads of Government as possible in attendance,” he explained. The UN General Assembly usually attracts well over 100 national leaders to discuss and set the global agenda for the following year. “The outcomes of the summit will be your outcomes,” stressed Mr. Guterres who invited “all governments, businesses, sources of finance – public and private – and civil society organizations to join in the preparatory process.” Asked by a reporter if the UN was planning to engage in dialogue with fossil fuel producers in the oil, gas and coal industry, he noted that interactions have already started and although “the dialogue with the industry is sometimes difficult and complex,” these businesses were increasingly recognizing the need to switch and develop renewable energy strategies. The Summit will focus on driving action in six areas: transition to renewable energy; funding of climate action and carbon pricing; reducing emissions from industry; using nature as a solution; sustainable cities and local action; and climate change resilience. Last month, in order to lead the way to the Summit, the UN chief Luis Alfonso de Alba as his Special Envoy. Also present in Katowice for COP24, he explained that one of his highest priorities in the coming months will be strong and deep engagement with each and every party to the UN Climate Change Convention, as well as other stakeholders, to raise ambition. “The intention is not to have a negotiated outcome, but rather to incentivise highest level participation, to be very selective in what goes to the Summit in terms of ambition and innovation… and then have a summary of the discussions during the meeting itself,” said Ambassador de Alba. Paving the way, a special session of the UN General Assembly will take place in March.

205-> Human Rights Briefing: Updates on Egypt, Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia
Here’s a roundup of human rights news this Friday: UN’s Bachelet urges restraint over arrests of Egypt protestors; expert calls for ‘democratic shift’ in Zimbabwe; Human Rights Council agrees fact-finding mission to Venezuela; independent experts urge freedom for Saudi women's rights defender, after 500 days in prison. Bachelet expresses ‘serious concerns’ over due process in Egypt, following mass-arrests The UN human rights chief has expressed “serious concerns” over reports of a lack of due process, after authorities in Egypt made widespread arrests during protests last week. In issued on Friday, Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet, urged Egyptian authorities to respect the right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, “in full compliance with international norms and standards.” According to Egyptian civil society organizations, more than 2,000 people - including lawyers, human rights defenders, political activists, university professors and journalists - were detained before, during and after street protests that took place in a number of Egyptian cities on 20-21 September. “The UN Human Rights Office has received information that a number of those detained were subsequently released”, said the statement from . “Reports also suggest some of those detained were denied legal representation when appearing before the Public Prosecutor, and some have allegedly been charged with serious offences.” “I remind the Egyptian government that under international law people have a right to protest peacefully,” said Ms. Bachelet. “They also have a right to express their opinions, including on social media. They should never be detained, let alone charged with serious offences, simply for exercising those rights.” “I urge the authorities to radically change their approach to any future protests, including those that may take place today,” she added. News reports said that some protesters had once again taken to the streets in several cities across Egypt on Friday afternoon, calling for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to step down. Zimbabwe must act quicker on democratic reform, urges UN-appointed independent expert Zimbabwe should do more to embrace and safeguard democracy,  the UN-appointed independent expert on the said on Friday, at the end of his first visit there. In , Clément Nyaletsossi Voule expressed his support for the Government’s stated commitment to democratisation. But two years since Emmerson Mnangagwa became President, after the removal of long-term leader Robert Mugabe, Mr. Voule urged the authorities to go further in promoting people’s rights and engage in dialogue with all those affected by austerity measures. Mr. Voule’s comments come as UN aid agencies continue to warn of widespread food insecurity in the country, which has been left reeling by a slow-burning economic collapse made worse by drought and the impact of Cyclone Idai in March. According to a recent update by UN humanitarian coordination agency , some 5.5 million people in rural areas are now food insecure. Of this number, more than 3.5 million – around 40 per cent of people in the countryside - are expected to be in need of urgent humanitarian assistance by October. In addition, some 2.2 million people in urban areas are food insecure, the OCHA update noted. In his appeal, the Special Rapporteur cited concern over the “excessive” use of force by police and military during protests. Putting troops in the streets was becoming “commonplace”, he maintained, while also insisting that it was vital for police or military personnel who committed human rights violations to be held accountable. “To foster impunity is to foster distrust among the population, alienating them from the Government, and quashing their hopes of meaningful change in the future,” he said, before encouraging the authorities to engage in “genuine dialogue with the political class and the population, “including protest movements”. It was the “only way forward to resolve such a crisis”, he insisted, while highlighting the Government’s “unenviable challenge” of having to resolve a “profound and complex economic, political and social crisis”. Human Rights Council agrees on fact-finding mission to Venezuela The UN’s top human rights body agreed on Friday to dispatch a fact-finding mission to Venezuela, in response to grave concerns about killings and other abuses linked to the country’s ongoing political and economic crisis. The development follows a vote at the that was supported by less than half of the forum’s 47 Member States, including several South American countries, such as Colombia, Argentina and Peru. The resolution condemned the “widespread targeted repression and persecution on political grounds” in Venezuela, the “excessive” use of force against peaceful protests and during security operations. In addition, it highlighted arbitrary detention, torture, ill-treatment, extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances carried out by the Special Action Forces and pro-government civilian armed groups. At least 6,000 people have been killed in security operations since January 2018, the resolution maintained, while also urging the authorities to release all political prisoners immediately. This includes the 27 individuals identified by High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, earlier this month. Independent human rights experts urge Saudi Arabia to free Loujain Al-Hathloul A group of UN human rights experts on Friday urged Saudi Arabia to release Loujain Al-Hathloul whose arrest 500 days ago, marked the beginning of a crackdown against women human rights defenders across the country. In , the group of 15 independent experts – Special Rapporteurs and members of the UN on the issue of discrimination against women in law and practice – said that Ms. Al-Hathloul, “who was detained on spurious national security grounds, had been instrumental in the movement to allow women to drive, and the push to end male guardianship laws.” They noted that Saudi Arabia has since been commended widely by the international community, for its recent efforts to reform discriminatory legislation in these areas. “It is shockingly hypocritical that Ms. Al-Hathloul remains in prison for campaigning to change laws which have since been amended. Indeed, she should never have been imprisoned in the first place for exercising her fundamental rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.” the experts said. “In spite of recent improvements in Saudi Arabia’s male guardianship laws, it is imperative that the world does not lose sight of the human rights concerns which persist in the country, as human rights defenders have continued to express.” Ms Al-Hathloul, who was arrested in May of 2018, has said that she has been tortured while in prison, but no inquiry into her allegations has taken place. It is also alleged that she turned down a deal offering her freedom in exchange for recanting her statements, said OHCHR. Her last hearing, which was scheduled for April this year, was cancelled, and no new date has been set. UN human rights experts have raised their concerns with the Saudi Government over the crackdown on women rights defenders, on a number of occasions.

207-> Island nations on climate crisis frontline ‘not sitting idly by’
Small island nations are “not sitting idly by” but are emerging as “frontrunners” in the fight against climate change according to Fekitamoeloa Katoa ‘Utoikamanu, the UN High Representative for Small Island Developing States. On Friday, during the General Assembly’s big opening week, when countries will discuss progress made since the landmark SAMOA Pathway agreement was reached, five years ago. The 38 countries designated by the United Nations as , or SIDS, are amongst the most vulnerable countries in the world. Situated in the Caribbean, Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as well as the Indian Ocean and South China Sea, they are bearing the brunt of an increasingly extreme and unpredictable global climate. As well as the environmental challenges, SIDS face a unique set of issues relating to their small size, remoteness, and exposure to external economic shocks. Most island nations tend to confront similar constraints in their efforts to develop sustainably, such as a narrow resource base, small domestic markets and heavy dependence on a few external and sometimes remote markets. They also generally face high costs for food, which often has to be imported, as well as energy, infrastructure, transportation and communication. Those challenges are further complicated by the difficulties they face mobilizing development finance on affordable and appropriate terms. Ms. ‘Utoikamanu has been speaking to UN News about the challenges faced by SIDS. ? Island communities are on the frontlines of the climate emergency and often have little resilience to disasters. Earlier this month, the Bahamas, one of the wealthier SIDS, was devastated when Hurricane Dorian swept across parts of the Caribbean archipelago. On a , the UN Secretary-General António Guterres said it was “impossible not to be horrified with the destruction” he saw, dubbing the Category 5 hurricane, “Category Hell.” He added that the extreme weather had been “powered by climate change.” The Bahamas is not alone. Pacific island states have been particularly susceptible to climate-related changes. The melting of glaciers in the Arctic and Antarctic caused by higher global temperatures has led to rising sea levels which has significantly impacted low-lying island nations. In May, the Secretary-General Tuvalu and said that sea level rise in some Pacific countries is “four times greater than the global average”, adding that it poses “an existential threat to several island States”. Those climate shocks and the unique make-up of the SIDS means that many are finding it difficult to develop in a sustainable fashion and improve the lives of their citizens. The SIDS are the countries most affected by climate change but, given that they are generally producing little of the harmful greenhouse gases that are fueling climate change, they are also the countries least responsible for the problem. So, all nations, especially industrialized ones which have generated most of these harmful gases, have a moral responsibility to act. And while island nations are clearly on the frontline of the climate crisis, as global warming worsens, the effect is being felt around the world in developing and developed countries. So, it’s a global issue which concerns people everywhere. The greatest challenge faced by Small Island Developing States is the fall-out from climate change, and they need to not only adapt to this new threat but also find ways to develop sustainably. In short, they need to build both economic and environmental resilience. SIDS are not sitting idly by; many for instance are emerging as frontrunners in the pursuit of renewables-based energy systems building on abundant local and natural resources. While they recognize that they contribute little to greenhouse gas emissions, they recognize that they themselves can help set examples for the rest of the world. Here are some of the ways that organizations and individuals are, often with support from the international community, finding ways to respond effectively to the crisis. In the , farmers are adapting to dramatic shifts in the climate, namely a rise in temperatures and a reduction in rain fall. In , local conservationist Alfred Masul is working to build resilience to extreme weather and rising sea levels. He is protecting the fragile coast of his island home by planting mangrove trees, which will also encourage fish to return to local waters and provide a valuable source of food. In , which has been suffering from drought in recent years following a 30 per cent drop in rainfall, communities are learning to harvest rain water, an exercise which can build resilience and aid development by helping to shore up food security and create jobs. Climate-related disasters are growing in frequency and severity, so the risks facing people living on islands and to development overall will only intensify.  The global community will join the small island developing states at a high-level summit at the UN in New York to assess how SIDS are boosting sustainable development whilst confronting the new climate reality. They will focus on one key instrument, the , a blueprint for sustainable development for island nations which was agreed five years ago in the capital of the eponymous Pacific Ocean country. It is hoped that new steps will be taken on climate action, that the oceans and seas which surround the islands can be better conserved and that public health systems can be strengthened. The SIDS will also look at scaling up new opportunities for economic growth as well as the Pathway suggests “forging genuine and durable partnerships for sustainable development.”

208-> Cities: a 'cause of and solution to' climate change
Cities around the world are the “main cause of climate change” but can also offer a part of the solution to reducing the harmful greenhouses gases that are causing global temperatures to rise according to UN-Habitat Executive Director Maimunah Mohd Sharif. Ms. Sharif will be joining world leaders at United Nations headquarters in New York next week at the convened by the UN . is supporting one of the nine action tracks designated by the Secretary-General “Infrastructure, Cities and Local Action” under the leadership of the Governments of Kenya and Turkey. UN News asked the UN-Habitat Executive Director what role cities should play in slowing down climate change. Over half of the world’s population lives in cities, and this is likely to increase to over two thirds by 2030. Cities use a large proportion of the world’s energy supply and are responsible for around 70 per cent of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions which trap heat and result in the warming of Earth. Levels of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas, are at the highest levels ever, mostly due to the burning of fossil fuels for energy. The huge carbon footprint created by our cities results from poor planning and layout. Low-density suburban sprawl with little public transport and homes far from work and shops means more cars on the roads emitting carbon dioxide. In addition,most of the ever-increasing number of buildings still use fossil fuels for their energy needs. Cities, while being the main cause of climate change, are also the most affected. Most cities are situated near water putting them at risk from rising sea levels and storms. However, given their role as hubs of innovation and creativity, we also look to cities to provide us with answers. Energy, building, mobility and planning solutions and innovations in cities have the potential to deliver major emission cuts. Huge gains, in terms of reducing harmful gases, can be made by changing how we plan, build, manage and power our cities and towns. Well designed, compact, walkable cities with good public transport greatly reduce our per capita carbon footprint and are key to achieving many of the of which climate action is a key part. We urgently need to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produced by our homes and offices by moving to zero carbon buildings, which do not use any carbon for heating, lighting, cooling or electricity. They can manage this by becoming more energy efficient and using renewable energy sources. Changing how we plan, develop & run cities is . supports the development of sustainable urban & regional planning. These are opportunities to address climate, create low carbon communities & ensure livable cities. 👉  Our expanding cities, towns and villages can create buildings and infrastructure that are highly energy efficient and designed with the local climate in mind using innovative technologies. For example, most of the new buildings in the next 30 years will be in Africa and Asia which should move away from air conditioning and maximize natural ventilation. To power our cities we must generate clean, resource-efficient energy and move away from fossil fuels. Since 2009, the cost of renewable electricity has dropped both for solar and wind power and will keep going down as more of us use them. The extraction and manufacturing of materials for buildings such as steel and concrete and construction processes produce carbon dioxide so using low carbon infrastructure will also slash emissions. Transport also produces significant amounts of emissions. Cities need should not be planned around cars but people and should invest in zero-carbon public transport, footpaths and protected bike lanes. Electric public transport, powered through renewable energy could prevent 250 million tonnes of carbon emissions by 2030, as well as improving people's health, and lowering noise and air pollution in our cities. Organic matter emits methane as it decomposes, which is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the short-term, so it’s key to minimize organic waste by improving waste management methods and to take steps to capture and use the methane emissions from landfills. And in addition to the long-term solutions that require a change in the way our economies operate, we can all make personal choices to alter our lifestyle and consumption patterns. The effects of the recent changes in the planet’s climate, as well as expected future climate risks have pushed about a thousand cities worldwide to declare a climate emergency. Climate adaptation, whereby cities adjust to actual or expected future climate, is a sound investment. This can include early warning systems, climate-resilient infrastructure and housing, and investments in water resources.  The shows that investing US$1.8 trillion in climate adaptation can generate US$7.1 trillion in total benefits. Resilient shelter will only work if we have resilient communities. I have recently met the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Patricia Scotland, and other world leaders and we are committed to working together to ensure we build back better. Our focus on “Infrastructure, Cities and Local Action” is part of the larger UN-Habitat Strategic Plan to build climate resilience worldwide."  The least well off in our cities and communities will bear the brunt of climate change in the form of  floods, landslides and extreme heat. This is because they often live in inadequate housing in fragile locations like mountain sides or floodplains, with no risk-reducing infrastructure such as functioning storm drains. Globally, there are an estimated 880 million people living in informal settlements that are highly vulnerable to climate change. We are urging governments to plan better and build back better.  The whole world is threatened by climate change but developing countries are often hit the hardest. They often do not have the capacity to face extreme weather events and have insufficient governance frameworks to manage climate challenges.  Cities in developing countries also face barriers in accessing climate finance including a lack of focus on cities as a strategic priority.  Ultimately climate change does not respect borders – everyone will all be affected and we all need to act together to stop it now.

209-> New UN report launched to help ratchet up action to combat climate crisis
Ahead of global leaders’ arrival in New York for the Climate Action Summit on 23 September, the United Nations deputy chief has launched a comprehensive report on how the world can take swift and meaningful action to slow down climate change. “We know why tackling climate change is important”, said Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed on Wednesday. “The devastation wreaked by Dorian on the Bahamas, what the Secretary-General called a Category Hell hurricane, is a glimpse into one aspect of a future powered by climate change – a future with super storms that grow in intensity and frequency, where those countries with the lowest greenhouse gas emissions, continue to feel the worst impacts of the planet’s rising temperatures.” Informed by the perspectives of more than 130 Governments, , reveals that business as usual, is not good enough and requires more mitigation, adaptation and finance – all which must be done quickly. ‘Sling shot’ moment “When I look back on this Climate Action Summit, I want us to see it as a sling shot – that helped to change our common trajectory towards sustainability”, said Ms. Mohammed, building trust “between this generation of adults and the next – between our children and ourselves – that we are all working together to our fullest potential to tackle the climate emergency”. She recapped that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report stressed the need to ensure that “the global temperature rise does not go beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius” through “cutting emissions by 45 per cent by 2030”, warning that “we have very little time to take the decisions needed to get there”. Those decisions should be set out in each country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) on climate change, which she called “the cornerstone of the ”. The is facing its first major test when countries update & improve their national plans next year. New - report shows direction of action is promising, but pace isn't yet sufficient. Read the REPORT here:  The report, which was developed in partnership by the UN Development Programme ( ) and UN Climate Change treaty body ( ), “will help us to understand whether world leaders address the Climate Summit…with ‘concrete plans, not speeches’, as is the Secretary General’s call”, Ms. Mohammed said. She expressed her hope that in “ratcheting up the response to the climate crisis” countries will be ambitious, saying “ambitions plans, accelerated action, and mobilized societies” are all crucial. “As the Secretary-General has said about this Climate Action Summit – the race is on”, she concluded. “It is a race we can win; it is a race we must win”. Less talk, more action "We need to talk less, and we need to act more" the head of the United Nations Development Fund (UNDP) said at the launch. Fortunately, momentum has been building since the adoption of the Paris Agreement and most countries are committed to combatting climate change. Since that time, more and more key actors are aligning their plans, policies and projections with the Agreement. "Half of the world's population is engaged in a proactive transformation of their economies to low-carbon", said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. According to the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the necessary support, cities, regions and businesses can help countries surpass pledged emissions cuts and raise ambition. However, the report cuts to the bottom line, while momentum exists, “much more climate ambition” is needed as climate change is “fast outpacing us and needs an urgent response by all segments of society”. UNDP presented its scaled-up commitment of support, aimed at helping 100 countries enhance their NDCs by 2020. The launch concluded with a preview of ‘Mission 1.5’, an interactive digital media experience to help citizens to have a voice in the next generation of climate action – the mobilization effort.

210-> UN climate summit aims to speed up transition to cleaner, greener future
New measures to speed up the transition to clean energy and green economies are among the initiatives to be unveiled during the next week. Heads of State, representatives from the private sector, and the teenage activist Greta Thunberg are expected in New York to tackle what the UN considers the defining issue of our time. Amina J. Mohammed, the UN Deputy Secretary-General, outlined some of the expectations during a press conference on Tuesday. “The Summit will present practical and new measures to, one: speed up the transition from coal to clean energy and to cut the pollution that is harming our health,” she said, and secondly, “protect nature but also unlock the potential of nature to deliver on climate solutions”. Thirdly, she said it would “create cleaner, greener ways to work and move; speed up transition in key sectors from grey to green economies, safeguard people from the impacts of climate change already being felt right now, and help make sure that we leave no one behind.” The Climate Summit opens on Monday and is among five major UN events looking at issues such as health and supporting small island developing states. Marie-Claire Graf, the Swiss Youth Climate Activist, will participate in the historic Youth at the on 21 September. Today, she spoke at about the need to galvanize the bottom-up and include young people in the decision-making. It will be preceded by a Youth Climate Summit on Saturday, where participants from across the globe will showcase their solutions on how to combat the crisis. Luis Alfonso de Alba, the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Summit, said 100 young people will be travelling on carbon neutral, or “green”, tickets. “We provided support to 100 youth from different countries and they will be joined by a much bigger number: our expectation is more than 700 on the Saturday, and we will try to accommodate as many as possible in the General Assembly hall on Monday,” he said. Marie-Claire Graf from Switzerland is among the lucky advocates to receive a green ticket. “There is really no time to wait because I guess what is the biggest problem that we still think climate change is something which maybe happen in some years, but we are in a huge crisis which is existential…Take young people seriously and include them in decision-making bodies, so we don’t only be like somewhere on the agenda but we want to be seated at the table when decisions are made,” she told UN News in Geneva.

211-> COP24: Huge untapped potential in greener construction, says UN environment agency
Noting some progress in greening the global construction industry, the United Nations environment agency (UNEP) co-released a report on Friday at the climate conference in Katowice, Poland, sounding the alarm on the need for “dramatic action” to reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions. “It’s critical we have a big change over the next couple of years in how we do buildings and construction”, said Joyce Msuya, Deputy Executive Director of . “We only need to look at the current norms and quality of many buildings to see that we can do so much better,” she said, emphasizing that “we need to raise the bar in energy-efficient, green buildings and far better practice in construction.” Currently, buildings account for close to 40 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and 36 per cent of all energy consumption. In the report, which was co-authored by the International Energy Agency ( ), warned that “dramatic action will be needed by governments, cities and business if the global buildings and construction sector is to cut its carbon footprint in line with international agreements.” Titled ‘ , the report was presented against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations on how to move ahead with the implementation of the climate action agreement adopted in Paris, in 2015, when 197 parties committed to limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The development of new techniques, tools, products and technologies – such as heat pumps, better windows, stronger insulation, energy-efficient appliances, renewable energy and smarter design – has enabled emissions to stabilize over the past few years. There are other encouraging signs. Several property, construction, cement and steel-manufacturing firms are among the 500 companies (representing trillions of dollars in revenue) which have aligned their emission reduction targets with the ; and the 71-member private sector network, the World Green Building Council non-profit organisation, is advocating for all buildings to emit zero net emissions by 2050. There is huge potential to reduce the current level of emissions, but action has been too slow, environmentalists say. To meet the goals of the , the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction, hosted by UNEP, is targeting a 30 per cent energy use improvement in the buildings and construction sector. Buildings are ‘key driver of energy demand’ What will make things even more challenging, is that the number of new buildings is anticipated to grow rapidly in the coming years, especially in the urban areas of Africa and Asia. “Buildings are a key driver of energy demand, and developments within the sector such as the growing uptake of air conditioners are having a big impact on energy and environmental trends at the global level ” said Dr. Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, which is an autonomous intergovernmental organization. If we don’t make buildings more efficient, their rising energy use will impact us all, whether it be through access to affordable energy services, poor air quality or higher energy bills –  The new report highlights a major gap between the amount of money spent on energy efficient solutions and the rapidly growing amount invested in building construction and renovation. “If we don’t make buildings more efficient, their rising energy use will impact us all, whether it be through access to affordable energy services, poor air quality or higher energy bills,” warned Dr. Birol. In particular, the data raises a red flag over the sharply rising demand for cooling systems and air conditioners; linked with improving living-standards in developing countries coupled with rising temperatures in many parts of the globe, due to climate change. Since 2010, the energy used by cooling systems has increased by 25 per cent and there are now more than 1.6 billion air conditioning units in service. One of the commitments of the Paris Agreement is for countries to develop and scale-up their own national climate action plans but, to date, only 104 plans mention specific actions to enhance energy-efficiency in buildings, building codes and energy certifications. Very few tackle the issue of construction materials – such as steel and cement – and the carbon emissions involved in their manufacturing. Another area of action recommended by the report is the need for building standards to evolve towards buildings that are more resilient in the face of climate change and extreme weather events, such as storms and hurricanes, floods, high winds and soaring temperatures.

212-> Oslo leads the way in ‘Breathe Life’ campaign for cleaner cities in climate change era
Norway’s capital Oslo is paving a fossil-free, electrified, path in its push toward improving air quality, the United Nations Environment Programme has announced. The city is a global front runner when it comes to sustainability, having implemented methods of recycling waste into heat and electricity, and allowing cyclists precedence over private cars. The Executive Director of UN Environment Erick Solheim, said the capital city’s pollution reduction sets the example for “turning climate action into an opportunity.” A major contributor to dwindling emissions has been the city’s transition toward renewable fuel solutions. Oslo has the highest number of electric vehicles in the world per capita, which alone has decreased CO2 emissions by 35 per cent since 2012, . Benefits for drivers include reduced taxes, access to bus and taxi lanes, free travel on toll roads and public ferries, together with free municipal parking. All public transport in Oslo, and neighbouring Akershus, is to be powered completely by renewable energy by 2020.  Oslo is one among 42 cities taking part in Breathe Life, a campaign led by the World Health Organization ), , and the aimed at exploring clean air options and reducing pollutants to safe levels by 2030. The network of participating cities are spread across the world, each tailoring their approach to clean air issues locally. In Colombia’s Santiago de Cali, the city has focused on the reduction of agricultural burning along with transport emissions. While in the capital of Ghana, Accra, where long hours are spent near wood and charcoal cookstoves, the city has outlined strategies to improve household and ambient air pollution. Highlighting that such changes will improve the everyday lives of citizens, Mr. Solheim said, “I hope that other cities around the world will be inspired by what Oslo is doing.”

213-> At Davos, UN chief urges ‘big emitters’ to take climate action
The world is “doomed” in the face of climate change unless major industrial nations reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, UN Secretary-General António Guterres told business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday. The UN chief observed that while many smaller developing countries and the European Union have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, “the big emitters” have yet to act. I'm in Davos to deliver a strong message on . While our planet is burning, too many decision makers are fiddling. Every city, region, bank, pension fund & industry must completely reimagine how they operate and invest to avoid a point of no return. If the big emitters do not rally around the principle of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, “we will be doomed because they represent a very important share”, the UN chief said. “The G20 represents 80 per cent of the emissions that contribute to climate change.” Government action Mr. Guterres said Governments can take steps to help move the world towards a greener future, such as cutting subsidies for fossil fuels. “As a taxpayer, I can’t really accept the idea that my taxes are used to boost hurricanes, or to bleach coral, or to melt glaciers”, he stated. For the Secretary-General, climate change is the defining issue of our time, representing an “existential threat” to the entire planet and threatening development. Mr. Guterres said he is encouraged by private sector commitment to the environment, as evidenced by increasing numbers of financial institutions and asset managers making carbon neutrality a priority in their investments. Hope for ‘transformational decisions’ Similarly, cities, voters and young people have been mobilizing for action. “I am hopeful that it will be possible to mobilize both the private sector and public authorities in order to take transformational decisions in the way we produce our food, power our economy, move, support industry and plan our cities - the transformational changes that are necessary for us, to reach the objectives that the scientific community tells us it is absolutely essential to do”, he said.

214-> ‘Green economy’ pioneer Pavan Sukhdev wins 2020 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement
Renowned environmental economist and UN Environment Programme ( ) Goodwill Ambassador was awarded on Monday the 2020 Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, recognizing his groundbreaking ‘green economy’ work. Mr. Sukhdev, who received the award alongside conservation biologist Gretchen C. Daily, was the Special Adviser and Head of ’s , a major project launched by then-UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, to demonstrate that greening of economies is not a burden on growth but rather a new engine for growing wealth, increasing decent employment, and reducing persistent poverty. He was also appointed Study Leader (2008-2010) of the landmark initiative on ‘The Economics of Ecosystems & Biodiversity’ ( ), a global UNEP-hosted study. When the first TEEB report was published, during the peak of the 2008 global financial crisis, news outlets around the world began to dedicate headlines to the staggering cost of deforestation to the global economy. Congratulations to and Dr. Gretchen C. Daily - joint winners of the for Environmental Achievement 2020. Their groundbreaking work is helping global efforts to protect our planet’s and . The TEEB report would go on to become a foundation for the Green Economy movement – an achievement for which Mr. Sukhdev is being awarded the 2020 Tyler Prize. “This award is equally a recognition of UNEP and its vibrant and active TEEB community,” Mr. Sukhdev. But he stressed that: “You don't have to be an environmentalist to care about protecting the environment. Just ask a farmer who now must rent beehives to pollinate his crops, because there are no longer enough bees in wild nature to do the job for free. But bees don't send invoices, so the value of their services is not recognized.” , former UNEP chief who’s currently the Administrator, has said: “Pavan Sukhdev and Dr. Gretchen Daily have generated groundbreaking insights into the economic value of our natural environment – prompting decision-makers to implement new measures to protect our planet’s ecosystems and biodiversity. Having worked closely with Mr. Pavan over many years, Mr. Steiner added that he considered his work on the TEEB to be “truly transformative – it has generated a new narrative on the economic and social importance of nature’s services, and a new community of practice.” Mr. Sukhdev currently serves the World Wildlife Fund as President and Chairman of the Board, as well as Board Member for TEEB Advisory Board, Stockholm Resilience Centre, and the Cambridge Conservation Initiative. Often described as the ‘Nobel Prize for the Environment’, the Tyler Prize is administered by the University of Southern California. On 30 April 2020, Mr. Sukhdev and Ms. Daily and will deliver a public presentation about their work at the New York Academy of Sciences in New York City. In a private ceremony on 1 May, the Tyler Prize Executive Committee and distinguished members of the international environmental community will join to honour the two new Laureates during a ceremony at the Intercontinental Barclay Hotel in New York City.

215-> COP25: UN climate change conference, 5 things you need to know
is happening—the world is already 1.1°C warmer than it was at the onset of the industrial revolution, and it is already having a significant impact on the world, and on people’s lives. And if current trends persist, then global temperatures can be expected to rise by 3.2 to 3.9°C this century, which would bring wide-ranging and destructive climate impacts. That’s the stark warning from the international community ahead of the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP25, which gets underway in the Spanish capital, Madrid, on 2 December. So, just two months after the Secretary-General convened a major at UN Headquarters in New York, what can be expected from COP25? The Climate Action Summit in September was the initiative of the UN Secretary-General to focus the attention of the international community on the climate emergency and to accelerate actions to reverse climate change.  The Climate Conference (held in Madrid after the meeting was moved from Chile due to unrest there),  COP25, is the actual Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change, , which is tasked with making sure that the Convention, (and now the , which strengthens the Convention), are being implemented. . There is more evidence of the impacts of climate change, especially in extreme weather events, and these impacts are taking a greater toll.  The science shows that emissions are still going up, not down. According to the 2019  , levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high. This continuing long-term trend means that future generations will be confronted with increasingly severe impacts of climate change, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise and disruption to marine and land ecosystems. The UN Environment Programme ( ) has warned, in its 2019 , that greenhouse gas emissions reductions of 7.6 per cent per year from 2020 to 2030 are needed to meet the internationally agreed goal of a 1.5°C increase in temperatures over pre-industrial levels. Scientists agree that’s a tall order, and that the window of opportunity is growing smaller. The summit served as a springboard ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the , focusing global attention on the climate emergency and the urgent need to significantly scale up action. And leaders, from many countries and sectors, stepped up. More than seventy countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so.  More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world’s largest. Small island states together committed to achieve carbon neutrality and to move to 100 per cent renewable energy by 2030.  And countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11 billion trees. More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating the green economy. A group of the world’s largest asset-owners, controlling $2 trillion, pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050. This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world’s invested capital, some $34 trillion, for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide. It’s true that the UN is a very acronym-heavy place. These ones all represent international tools and agencies that, under the leadership of the UN, were created to help advance climate action globally. Here’s how they fit together. is the UN Environment Programme, the leading global environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda and serves as an authoritative advocate for the global environment. stands for World Meteorological Office, the UN agency for international cooperation in areas such as weather forecasting, observing changes in the climate, and studying water resources. In 1988 the UN General Assembly asked UNEP and the WMO to establish the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), which is made of hundreds of experts, in order to assess data, and providing reliable scientific evidence for climate action negotiations. All three UN bodies publish reports that, in recent years, have frequently made international headlines, as concerns about the climate crisis have grown. As for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), this document was signed at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In the treaty, nations agreed to "stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere” to prevent dangerous interference from human activity on the climate system. Today, 197 countries are parties to the treaty. Every year since the treaty entered into force in 1994, a “conference of the parties”, or COP, has been held to discuss how to move forward. Madrid will hold the 25th COP, therefore COP25. Because the had non-binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions for individual countries, and no enforcement mechanism, various extensions to this treaty were negotiated during recent COPs, including most recently the , adopted in 2015, in which all countries agreed to step up efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial temperatures and boost climate action financing. COP25 is the final COP before we enter the defining year of 2020, when many nations must submit new climate action plans. Among the many elements that need to be ironed out is the financing of climate action worldwide. Currently, not enough is being done to meet the three climate goals: reducing emissions 45 per cent by 2030; achieving climate neutrality by 2050 (which means a net zero carbon footprint), and stabilizing global temperature rise at 1.5°C by the end of the century. Because the clock is ticking on climate change, the world cannot afford to waste more time, and a bold, decisive, ambitious way forward needs to be agreed.

216-> India: Climate emergency message resonates at world’s largest literature festival – UN News special report from Jaipur
Against the backdrop of India’s famed “pink city” of Jaipur, the world’s largest literature festival hosted the UN’s top representative in the country on Monday, who told audience members attending a special session on the climate emergency, that the Organization is working flat out to slow the pace of damaging climate change. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. It is estimated that over 600 million Indians are likely to be impacted adversely by climate change if we don’t change course now. Jaipur is the capital of the picturesque, almost magical Indian state of Rajasthan. It is known as the Pink City due to the colour of the stone used for many of its glorious palaces and historic monuments. Acclaimed as the ‘greatest literary show on Earth’, the five-day Jaipur Literature festival attracts more than 400,000 book lovers; around 2,000 speakers addressing more than 200 sessions; and authors from 20 different countries. The books being discussed are penned in more than two dozen languages. Questioned over whether the UN is doing enough to resolve the climate crisis, the UN’s Resident Coordinator in India, Renata Dessallien, quipped that the Organization could not act as a “global police” force. “We are also not a global Government, so there are limits, to which the UN is mandated and on what it is able to do.” “In fact”, she added, “we are pushing the limits on many fronts. The best way to describe the United Nations is that we are the ‘world persuader’ – persuading people to do what is fundamentally right.” She lauded the UN’s pioneering role in the science relating to the impact of climate change, in the late 1980s, “when  a panel was established on climate change by the UN” known as the , which provides governments at all levels with trusted scientific information they can use to develop climate policies. “So the science is out there and as an inter-governmental body we bring the nation states together to address the problem that’s staring us in the face, validated by the science.” The session heard some startling stories of people living in India’s Ladakh region who are gravely affected by Climate crisis. Solar Energy Innovator, Educationist and Managing Director of Himalayan Institute of Alternatives in Ladakh, Sonam Wangchuk said: “Up in the mountains, across the Himalayas, particularly in Ladakh, our glaciers are melting and while we always had water shortages, now we are seeing droughts in the spring season. “I know at least two villages where people had to abandon the whole village due to water (shortages). These droughts are now accompanied by flash floods in autumn.” In 2006, while volunteering in one such village that was washed away, leading to many deaths, he had asked villagers when the last flash flooding had occurred, but “they didn’t remember. The same village had another flash flood in 2010, then in 2015 and then another one in 2017. So it’s now becoming as frequent as that.” He appealed to the people living in the plains and the cities to be responsible and “live simply” so that the people of the mountains in turn, can ‘simply live’. Managing Editor of online journal PARI,  Namita Waikar, who is chronicling the stories of how vulnerable populations across India are being most affected by climate change for the upcoming Human Development Report, chimed in with other first-hand accounts of how life is being adversely affected in the coastal cities. “In the rural areas, there are communities in Tamil Nadu where seaweed farmers are forced to change livelihoods due to fast disappearing seaweeds. “Similarly, in places like Delhi, inland fishing communities are catching dead fish. What they told me was heart breaking.” Fisherman told her that if they lay the net at night, all they catch are the “freshest of the dead fish” in the morning. Keeping sewage and industrial waste out of rivers and coastal areas in an urgent priority, she said” “Another fisherwoman said that some of the fish they caught earlier are now only seen on the Discovery channel. That clearly explains the gravity of the situation.” Writer, educator and filmmaker, Shubhangi Swarup, who is exploring ecology in her fiction, explained how she is integrating climate change themes into her work. “Our stories have become human-centric, self-obsessed and obnoxious. We don’t have appreciation of nature and universe in our stories. “So, I tried to write a novel where a geological fault line is the thread of the narrative. It begins with the Andaman (islands), goes to Myanmar, then Nepal and ends in Ladakh. While telling the story, I realised how ridiculous the political borders are when we are talking about solving local problems”, she said. Civil Society Activist, Apoorva Oza, reiterated the need to take profit considerations out of the climate change debate: “There’s this excessive focus on measuring everything in economic terms. When I write a proposal they ask me whether I’ll double the farmers’ income. All I can tell you is that they will protect nature, they’ll sustain the environment, they’ll not over-exploit groundwater. But I can’t guarantee that I can double their incomes. I can only guarantee their progress.” The session took a sombre turn when the famous Bollywood Actress and UN Advocate for Sustainable Development, Dia Mirza reached out to the audience and asked, “Do you have time? We just have a decade. Listen to women, listen to mothers, listen to children. And if you don’t understand science, just watch nature.” The message was clear: everyone is responsible for creating a more environmentally sustainable world – And the arts and cultural sector is no exception. As Moderator, Sameer Saran aptly concluded: “Since this festival is attended by the literati, stories come out of such places. If climate change becomes a part of these stories, we’ll be inspired to take better steps in mitigating climate change. Stories we tell about ourselves define our actions. And if our stories are green, then probably our future will also be green and prosperous.” The 13th year of the Jaipur Literature Festival saw a host of literary big-hitters in attendance, including Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Pulitzer Prize  Awardee Forrest Gander, Journalist Christina Lamb, the New Yorker journalist Dexter Filkins, Man Booker Prize winner Howard Jacobson, Elizabeth Gilbert and popular Indian writers like Shashi Tharoor and Javed Akhtar engaging in ideas, debate and dialogue.

217-> FROM THE FIELD: New sensors protect vulnerable Malawians against deadly lightning
The deadly threat of lightning strikes, as well as their damaging impact on a country’s development, has been recognized in a new project supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). There are more deaths from lightning in developing countries, especially in tropical electrical storm-prone regions, largely because more people work outdoors and fewer buildings are protected against strikes. In Malawi, UNDP has been working with government agencies to install eight lightning detection sensors across the southern African country which can warn people - particularly those who could be in danger like farmers and fishing communities - that a storm is on the way. .

218-> Suriname’s climate promise, for a sustainable future
Suriname has become the second nation globally to outline updated plans to fight climate change in the hope of ensuring that any future increase in the temperature of the planet does not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The South American country describes its new national plan as a “cost-effective pathway to decarbonization of substantiable economic development.” But what does this all mean in terms of global efforts to reverse the warming of the planet? Read on for an explanation. What are these plans and why are we hearing about them now? Globally, 196 countries, plus the European Union, originally signed up to the in 2015 which commits the international community to restrict global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” and aim, if possible, for 1.5C. It’s hoped that these ambitious targets will be met collectively by countries by setting distinct, individual or national goals known as Nationally Determined Contributions or . These NDCs are a key part of the Paris Agreement and are reviewed and updated every five years by the countries themselves. It’s now 2020, so all countries are expected to declare their amended NDCs. The Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean was the first nation to do so, Suriname is the second. Is Suriname a big emitter of the greenhouse gasses which lead to climate change? No, on the contrary Suriname stated as far back as 2014 that it had a carbon negative economy; that means that any global warming gasses it does produce, are offset by natural resources which absorb those gasses. The South American country is 93 per cent covered by forest, which acts as a massive carbon sink; in other words, all those trees capture, or suck in, harmful carbon dioxide gas removing it from the atmosphere. Less carbon dioxide means less warming. It’s significant on a number of levels, firstly as a statement that this small country is committed to fighting climate change but also as a reminder to other countries that they too must update their plans if the international community is going to reach the 2 degree Celsius target it agreed on in Paris five years ago. And many of the smaller developing countries and especially island states, or those with low-lying coastal areas, are keen to push forward the new commitments because they are particularly susceptible to climate change, even though they have contributed least to the problem. Suriname has a small population of just over half a million, and thus most infrastructure and economic activity is concentrated along its easily accessible Atlantic coast. This coastal zone has already experienced extensive erosion and has suffered damage from heavy rainfall, flooding, higher temperatures during dry seasons and high winds; the types of natural phenomena (and in some cases disasters) which are expected to worsen with climate change. Absolutely, in fact all countries, rich and poor, are aiming to develop in a sustainable way by growing their economies and the wealth and social well-being of their citizens while finding ways to reverse climate change and protect the environment. So, when Suriname talks of a “cost-effective pathway to decarbonization of substantiable economic development”, it commits to maintaining the “integrity of natural forest acting as a carbon sink” while diversifying its economy with the aim of creating the conditions for sustainable development. The significant difference between developing and developed countries is that the former, generally don’t have enough money to turn their plans into reality and that’s why richer countries and the private sector are being asked to step in and partner with the poorer countries. Suriname says its “NDC enhancement process” will cost US$696 million. Suriname’s updated NDCs focus on four key areas; forests, electricity, agriculture and transport. It is committed to maintaining 93 per cent forest cover but says “significant international support is needed for the conservation of this valuable resource in perpetuity.” Sustainable and “clean” electricity is also a priority and in its updated NDCs, Suriname has pledged to “maintain the share of electricity from renewable sources above 35% by 2030.” Agriculture is the cause of 40 per cent of the country’s total emissions but also provides a valuable source of income. At the same time, the sector is strongly impacted by climate change, so Suriname is focusing on the development of climate-smart farming. That includes water resources management, the promotion of sustainable land management; and adopting innovative technologies, for example converting biomass into energy. Transport is another large and growing source of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and plans have been announced to improve public transportation and introduce controls on vehicle emissions. It’s hoped and expected that more countries will update their NDCs during 2020 and present them at the (known as COP26) to be held in Glasgow in the UK in November. The UN has said that “in Glasgow, governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition – ambition on mitigation, ambition on adaptation, and ambition on finance.” Ultimately, the meeting should give a clear indication of whether the global community is on track to meet the 2 degrees Celsius target.

219-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Tunisia coastline in need of climate cash boost
Efforts to mobilize the cash needed to ensure that climate change does not lead to the irreversible damage of Tunisia’s coastline are being undertaken by the North African country’s government, with the support of the UN Development Programme ( ). Tunisia’s extensive coastal areas are a crucial part of its economy providing tourist dollars and opportunities for income-generating activities like fishing. However, a rise in the sea level, coastal erosion and an increase in the temperature of fishing waters caused by climate change are threatening habitats vital for both human activity and marine biodiversity. The government is now working with UNDP to secure the investment for coastal defence and other climate adaptation interventions, while regulating development in delicate and exposed coastal regions. about how Tunisia is adopting innovative strategies to protect its coastline and the livelihoods of its people

220-> Climate action ‘both a priority and a driver of the decade’: Guterres
Climate action will be both a priority and a driver of world affairs through the coming decade, United Nations Secretary-General chief António Guterres announced on Monday, during a speech at UN Headquarters in New York, in which he declared that the next ten years will be “crucial for achieving a fair globalization, boosting economic growth and building peaceful societies”. Mr. Guterres was addressing the UN Group of Friends on Climate, created by France and Morocco ahead of COP21 in order to foster global commitment to climate action. The Decade of Action begins, said the UN chief, with efforts to ensure that the next UN climate conference, set to take place in Glasgow in November, is a success, following the “disappointment” of COP25. “70 countries committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, including the European Union, but also many that have contributed least to the problem”, said Mr. Guterres. “That number represents less than one fourth of global emissions.  We must make this commitment universal”. Fossil fuel subsidies growing Mr. Guterres repeated his attack on fossil fuel subsidies, and the necessity for countries – particularly, but not only, in East, South and Southeast Asia – to break their addiction to coal. Many countries, he said, continue to put coal at the heart of their energy plans, and there is still no universally agreed price on carbon. This inability to kick the coal habit comes as the World Meteorological Organization ( ) analysis shows that 2019 was the second hottest year on record, and that ocean heating is at a record level. Positive private sector signs Despite the mixed political messages, Mr. Guterres said he took heart from the proactive reaction to the climate emergency from the private sector, which has seen many parts of the financial world taking part in initiatives to encourage sustainable development. An example is the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance, a UN-supported coalition of businesses worth trillions of dollars that will cooperate across borders, and even with competitors, to mobilize long-term finance. Key 2020 events Three key events taking place in 2020 were singled out for attention in the Secretary-General’s speech. The first, the Sustainable Transport Conference, which takes place in May, was described by the UN chief as a chance to “align our mobility systems with a climate-neutral world”. In June, the Oceans Conference will be an opportunity to “reverse and end the assault on the world’s marine ecosystems and resources, including the rising tide of plastics pollution”, and at the Biodiversity COP15  conference in October, the world must, said the UN chief, “move decisively towards an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework. Let’s not forget that one million species are in the near-term danger of extinction”. Strengthening the UN climate team Mr. Guterres announced that he has begun scaling up the UN’s ambitions, with his new Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance, the former Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, due to start in March, tasked with engaging business leaders on subjects including carbon neutrality, carbon pricing, disclosure of climate risk, and embedding climate into economic and financial priorities. “We need to push for transformation in the way the financial sector works”, said Mr. Guterres, “as a lever for more ambitious national government engagement and commitments”. The Secretary-General is also reshaping the climate team in his office, to better focus on a roadmap towards COP26 in Scotland, other 2020 climate priorities, and to reach the goals of the , during the Decade of Action.

221-> UN agriculture agency digs in to help forests and farms build resilience to climate change
Millions of small-scale farmers will be better equipped to withstand the negative impacts of climate change while at the same time improving livelihoods, thanks to a new global push by the United Nations agriculture agency announced during World Forest Week. On Friday, the Food and Agriculture Agency ( ) and partners launched the second stage of a successful international partnership that supports forest and farm producer organizations across Africa, Asia and Latin America during the gathering, known as . The , or FFF, began in 2013 as a way to help rural women’s groups, local communities and indigenous peoples’ institutions, among others, bolstering their technical and business capacities to fight climate change and improve food security. The initiative’s second phase is now being rolled out over the next five years across 25 countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa, from the original pilot group of ten. "These groups make up a large proportion of the rural poor and rely on farming, forests and agro-forestry systems to grow food and make a living. Rendering their lands resilient to climate change is key to their livelihoods and identity,” said Daniel Gustafson, 's Deputy Director-General for Programmes. The initiative scales up the effort to help forest and farm producers develop climate resilient landscapes, strengthen enterprises and generate work opportunities for women and youth, and encourage better policies to help the rural poor, according to FAO. Some 1.5 billion forest and farm producers make up 90 per cent of the world's farmers, which provide about 80 per cent of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa's food supplies. That adds up to 500 million family farms and 30 percent of forests in the global south. The FFF’s second phase will provide financial and technical support to strengthen organizations which represent forest and farm producers. It will also increase access to markets, finance and training – with a focus on vulnerable groups, such as women and youth. So that forest and farm producers can better manage their land to withstand climate impacts, FFF will roll out adaptation and climate resilience activities as well. "Forest and farm producers are more powerful when organized,” stressed Mr. Gustafson. “By building their capacity, the Forest and Farm Facility initiative will help more producers and their organizations withstand the effects of climate change, create opportunities for their most vulnerable members, access benefits, and influence policies to better address their needs," he concluded.

222-> UN chief outlines solutions to defeat ‘four horsemen’ threatening our global future
The start of the New Year finds the world facing four looming threats to human progress: surging geopolitical tensions, the climate crisis, global mistrust and the downsides of technology, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said on Wednesday. In a wide-ranging to the General Assembly, the UN chief outlined strategies to address what he called the “four horsemen in our midst”, and he urged countries to take advantage of the UN’s 75th anniversary year to secure a peaceful future for all people. “These four horsemen…can jeopardize every aspect of our shared future”, Mr. Guterres warned. “That is why commemorating the 75th anniversary with nice speeches won’t do.  We must address these four 21st-century challenges with four 21st-century solutions.” Geopolitical tensions. The climate crisis. Global mistrust. The dark side of technology. These "four horsemen" are looming threats in the 21st century. To meet them, we need a UN fit for the challenges of our age.  Global tensions mounting For the Secretary-General, global tensions are at their highest level in years, making the risk of fracture real. Although developments such as the formation of the Constitutional Committee in Syria and the recent Berlin conference on Libya are signs of hope, he stressed that “we have our work cut out for us”. Mr. Guterres underlined the central role of prevention in UN engagement in the peace and security dimension, and emphasized the need to focus on the root causes of crisis and upheaval. “We must strengthen our mediation capacity and our tools for sustaining peace, leading to long-term development”, he added. “We need to create the conditions for effective peace enforcement and counter-terrorism operations by our regional partners, under chapter VII of the Charter and with predictable funding. This is especially true in Africa, from the Sahel to Lake Chad.” Our planet is burning On climate change, the science is clear, Mr. Guterres stated. “Rising temperatures continue to melt records.  The past decade was the hottest on record.  Scientists tell us that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second.  One million species are in near-term danger of extinction. Our planet is burning”, he told ambassadors. Yet, in the midst of the crisis, some leaders “continue to fiddle”, he said, as evidenced by the outcome of the last UN climate conference, known as COP25, held in Madrid in December. But the Secretary-General is adamant that the climate battle can be won as people everywhere “get it”, while the overwhelming majority of scientists are clear there is still time to act. “At the next climate conference - COP26 in Glasgow - governments must deliver the transformational change our world needs and that people demand, with much stronger ambition – ambition on mitigation, ambition on adaptation, and ambition on finance,” he stated. A call for fair globalization The third horseman—deep and growing global mistrust—can be defeated through fair globalization, boosting economic growth and preventing conflict. Back in 2015, world leaders adopted an agenda to bring about a more just and fair planet for all.  This year, the UN has launched a to achieve the (SDGs) by the 2030 deadline. “Throughout the Decade of Action, we must invest in the eradication of poverty, in social protection, in health and fighting pandemics, in education, energy, water and sanitation, in sustainable transport and infrastructure and in internet access”, said the Secretary-General. “We must improve governance, tackle illicit financial flows, stamp out corruption and develop effective, common sense and fair taxation systems. We must build economies for the future and ensure decent work for all, especially young people. And we must put a special focus on women and girls because it benefits us all.” The Secretary-General also encouraged leaders to work to rebuild trust, including through listening to their citizens and harnessing ideas for change and other constructive solutions put forward by youth. Taming the ‘Wild West of cyberspace’ Bringing light to the dark side of the digital world will require action on several fronts, including in the labour market as automation will displace tens of millions of jobs in the next decade. The UN chief recommended that education systems be redesigned to address this reality by teaching people how to learn across the course of their entire lives. “We also must usher in order to the Wild West of cyberspace,” he said. “Terrorists, white supremacists and others who sow hate are exploiting the internet and social media. Bots are spreading disinformation, fueling polarization and undermining democracies. Next year, cybercrime will cost $6 trillion.” Mr. Guterres highlighted the UN as the platform to bring together governments, the private sector, civil society and others to counter what he called “digital fragmentation” through global cooperation. The “alarming possibilities” of artificial intelligence also must be addressed, and he appealed to countries to immediately ban lethal autonomous weapons, also known as killer robots. “Lethal autonomous weapons - machines with the power to kill on their own, without human judgement and accountability - are bringing us into unacceptable moral and political territory”, he warned.

The “race is on” in Indonesia to halt the illegal trade in wildlife and the loss of biodiversity according to the UN Development Programme (UNDP). The trade in wildlife in the South-East Asian country, which is estimated to be worth up to US$1 billion a year, has already led to the extinction of some animal species and disrupted the region’s ecological balance. Now, UNDP is working with the Indonesian government, conservation groups and local people, to reduce the illegal trading of animals and enforce wildlife protection. On Monday, the UN warned that, globally, one million species risk becoming extinct within decades. Read more about the measures being taken, :

225-> Act now to save children from rise in climate-driven extreme weather – UNICEF
Governments are being pressed by the United Nations Children’s Fund ( ) to act now to safeguard younger generations from the immediate and long-term impacts of so-called “extreme weather events.” The devastating floods in southern India, wildfires ravaging the western United States and the record-breaking heatwaves baking countries across much of the northern hemisphere, are putting children in immediate danger while also jeopardizing their future, the agency said in a press release issued on Friday. “In any crisis, children are among the most vulnerable, and are no exception,” said Ted Chaiban, Director of Programmes. “Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations. As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price.” These extreme weather events during June and July, causing injury, death, environmental damage and other losses. UNICEF stated that although individual weather events cannot specifically be attributed to climate change, their increasing frequency and severity correspond with predictions of how human activities are affecting the global climate. These conditions have numerous impacts on children. For example, they contribute to the increased spread of “childhood killers” such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea, UNICEF explained. Heatwaves put children at risk, with infants and younger children more likely to die or suffer from heatstroke, while floods threaten their survival and development through causing injuries or death by drowning, or compromising water supply and damaging sanitation facilities. Meanwhile, poor families are particularly affected by drought, which can lead to crop failure, livestock deaths and loss of income. “As the world experiences a steady rise in climate-driven extreme weather events, it is children’s lives and futures that will be the most disrupted,” Mr. Chaiban continued. “Therefore, it’s vital that Governments and the international community take concrete steps to safeguard children’s future and their rights. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.” UNICEF has proposed an “ .” It calls for strengthening health systems to respond to a changing climate and more extreme weather events. Other measures include increasing investment in climate resilient agricultural, water and sanitation services; educating children and young people about the issue of climate change, and reflecting their needs in national strategies and action plans.

226-> Greek wildfire tragedy: world must ‘step up efforts’ against deadly fire risk, says UN disaster reduction chief
Following the death of at least 80 people due to wildfires close to the Greek capital, Athens, in recent days, the top expressed her condolences and called for more investment in wildfire suppression and prevention across the world. in Greece as a “truly heartbreaking tragedy”, Mami Mizutori, who is also UN Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, passed on her “sincere condolences to the Greek government and people at this difficult time as the search continues for the missing.” The fire started on Monday afternoon, and quickly spread across the small resort town of Mati, 18 miles east of Athens. The death toll is expected to rise, and hundreds have also been injured. “We owe it to those who have lost their lives in Greece and elsewhere to step up efforts on wildfire suppression and prevention”, she added. “Investing in disaster response and preparedness are vital to this effort considering that global losses from wildfires reached record levels last year and few parts of the world are spared from this risk as climate change multiplies the threat.” Ms. Mizutori stressed that fire hazard must be given due consideration when national and local strategies for disaster risk reduction are being developed, to meet the 2020 deadline for reducing disaster losses, as outlined in the . According to a report by the European Union, forests cover more than a third of the total land area of Europe. Large forest fires have repeatedly affected the continent, especially Mediterranean countries, the report says, and “human activity (whether accidental, negligent, or deliberate) is one of the most common causes”. This year, Sweden has experienced major wildfires and 2017 saw a high number of deadly fires in Portugal, Spain and Italy. In recent years, the extent of areas devastated by fires in Europe, the western United States and south-east Australia has increased dramatically, according to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ( ).

227-> With rapid, far-reaching changes, world can prevent climate change worst-case scenarios – UN chief
Checking global warming and preventing some of the worst-case scenarios of runaway climate change “is still possible,” the United Nations Secretary-General said on Saturday, urging greater action and ambitions. “ rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society – especially how we manage land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities,” , at a ministerial meeting on climate finance, in Bali, Indonesia. “That means ending deforestation and planting billions more trees; drastically reducing the use of fossil fuels and massively increasing renewable energy; switching to climate-friendly sustainable agriculture.; considering new technologies, such as carbon capture and storage.” In his remarks, the UN chief made a particular call for “climate friendly” investments, particularly in the infrastructure sector, where over $90 trillion in investments is expected by 2030. “The next few years are critical [and] your leadership is needed,” Mr. Guterres told the ministers. ‘We cannot afford to ignore climate risk’ Highlighting enormous economic losses to climate-related disasters and projections that by 2050, climate change could reduce annual GDP in some South and Southeast Asian countries by up to 4 per cent, the Secretary-General underscored that climate risk cannot be ignored. “We need a new economic framework that integrates climate and disaster risk in all aspects of finance, planning and budgeting,” he said. We need a new economic framework that integrates climate and disaster risk in all aspects of finance, planning and budgeting Alongside, effective economic policy and fiscal instruments are also needed, he continued, urging a “meaningful price” on carbon and an end to fossil fuel subsidies to promote low-carbon and climate-resilient growth. He also called for “fundamental shifts” in climate financing, including government policies that can increase resources available for climate action. “Governments need to encourage their banks to support green financing and innovative financial instruments – such as green bonds – and debt instruments that can strengthen the resilience of vulnerable nations,” said the UN chief, calling also for the mobilization of private sector financing. In his remarks, he also called on countries to make full use of the upcoming to the (COP-24), to be held in Katowice, Poland, and to come out of the meeting with a robust framework that allows countries to operationalize and implement the on Climate Change. “I count on all leaders to call on their negotiators to resolve all sticking points and insist on progress,” he said.

228-> Deliver ‘significant results now’, UN General Assembly President tells COP25 climate conference
It is “imperative” that the climate conference underway in Spain delivers “significant results now”, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly (PGA), said on Tuesday. “Science is unequivocal on the urgency to act, both at global and national levels”, he told the conference to address the climate crisis - officially known as the 25th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ). Mr. Muhammad-Bande recalled the consensus reached through the to limit the rise in temperature to 2ºC above pre-industrial levels and efforts to hold it to 1.5ºC. And yet, if current trends in global emissions continue, they will cause further warming; and humans will face increasingly severe and extreme weather events. “Lands are being degraded. Forests, ecosystems and biodiversity are being lost. Our oceans are facing pollution, acidification and loss of coastal habitats”, he spelled out. Recurrent climate disasters are becoming global and borderless; causing unprecedented human and socioeconomic costs; and threatening progress in reducing global poverty and improving people’s lives. Let’s not ‘go down with the ship’ Risk reduction measures have the potential to “safeguard up to 280 million people at risk of displacement due to sea level rise”. “It is our decision: to go down with this ship or to change course immediately”, he underscored. “This is the time to act”. “We are defined by our actions, and every day we have a moral obligation to take action in favour of the next generation and beyond”, Mr. Muhammad-Bande concluded. “I am confident we will rise to this challenge”. Nuclear energy solutions Join us live from Madrid for the opening of the High-Level Segment of  On his first official trip as the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( ), Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted the role that nuclear power can play in the global transition to clean energy. “Variable renewables, such as solar and wind, are vital to the clean energy transition, but they alone cannot meet countries’ growing energy needs”, he , adding that nuclear energy can “provide the continuous, low-carbon power to back up increasing use of renewables”. Moreover, nuclear power can be “the key that unlocks their full potential by providing flexible support – day or night, rain or shine”, upheld the chief. And many States believe that it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve sustainable development and meet global climate goals without significant use of nuclear energy. He pointed out that “nuclear power provides around one-third of the world’s low-carbon electricity and already plays a significant role in mitigating climate change”. Out of time “Each year at COP we are told that the window of opportunity could close soon”, UN Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said on the urgency of climate action. “The window of opportunity is closing now,” she . “My message is this. We need your decisions. We need your leadership. We are out of time.” Action for the most vulnerable People around the world are being affected by one extreme weather event after another. But refugees, stateless people, and internally displaced often reside in climate change "hotspots", leaving them exposed to secondary displacements, according to the UN refugee agency, . So Tuesday saw the timely launch by 12 international organizations of the , agreeing to strengthen the capacity of developing countries to deliver high-quality weather forecasts, early warning systems and hydrological and climate services. The window of opportunity is closing now –  Pointing out that “the science is clear”, World Meteorological Organization ( ) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, told COP25 that “ambitious climate action requires countries to be equipped with the most reliable warnings and best available climate information services”. “The Alliance is the vehicle to collectively scale-up our support to the most vulnerable”, he concluded. For her part, Vice President for Sustainable Development Laura Tuck underlined the important role of the Alliance. “It’s good to see everyone formally coming together through this Alliance and committing to bridge the gap between developed and developing countries in the provision of hydromet and early warning services,” she said. “This will help ensure we are coherent, consistent, and efficient in the way we are supporting countries to prepare for climate risks and protect people.” COP25 will lay the groundwork for next year’s defining climate change conference, when countries must submit new climate action plans under the .

229-> Australia bushfire crisis: UNICEF offers help and support
Raging bushfires wreaking havoc across Australia have prompted the UN Children’s Fund, UNICEF, to offer its support to the Australian Government and its partners which are battling the “unprecedented disaster”. While acknowledging “the selflessness, professionalism and dedication” of first responders and all organizations working on the ground, issued a on Monday extending its condolences to the children and families affected by the fires that continue to devastate the country. Flagging its experience in providing crucial long-term support to children across the world through the three stages of relief, recovery and rehabilitation, UNICEF expressed it “very real desire” to assist Australia. “UNICEF has significant expertise and experience globally in responding to emergencies, including natural disasters”, the statement said. “From decades of work with millions of people around the world, we know that children are always among the most vulnerable in circumstances such as these”. In many situations, UNICEF added that climate change is making scenarios “worse and more enduring”. Looking out for children “Our recent experience in working with children and young people affected by the drought in New South Wales brings this current bushfire crisis into sharp focus and that is why UNICEF Australia is currently prioritizing internal resources, speaking with partners and other agencies to ensure that we can continue to be a back-up to first-responders and committing support where possible to the immediate and long term needs of children”, the statement spelled out. UNICEF upheld the vital importance that children who have lived through disasters “return to normal life as quickly as possible”, which is best done by resuming their education. “In the longer term it is also vital that the views of children are taken into consideration when decisions are being made”, which is why UNICEF Australia has been in discussion with the Fund’s international offices, and other local organizations and government agencies “to plan the provision of our support and expertise into the future”. Planning ahead As the situation continues to unfold, needs are yet to be fully determined. While a needs assessment is pending, key initiatives are likely to include assisting relief partners, said UNICEF, so that affected children may to return to school, provide them with psychosocial support and convene forums to ensure children’s voices shape future responses. Pointing out that in addition to those children who have been directly affected, the agency is also highly concerned for those children witnessing traumatic events relating to the bushfires through media and social media. We encourage all parents to consider talking to their children about what is happening and to take steps to make their children feel safe  –  “We encourage all parents to consider talking to their children about what is happening and to take steps to make their children feel safe”, UNICEF stated. On top of the toll taken on human lives and the destruction of thousands of homes, the months-long blazes have also killed millions of animals. Acknowledging that it may be a difficult time for some of its regular supporters directly affected or living in or near bushfire-affected areas, UNICEF Australia encouraged them to suspend donations to ensure they have the means to provide for their families. “The recovery process from such an unprecedented disaster will take a long time and UNICEF Australia calls for more child-centred responses and for the needs of children to continue to be prioritized”, the statement continued. As disaster response and planning should include children’s views and experiences, UNICEF Australia “intends to ensure that children who have been affected by this disaster are consulted as a consequence, and their views and opinions taken to decision makers”.

230-> 2019 second hottest year on record, UN confirms
Last year was the second warmest year on record, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) confirmed on Wednesday. “The average global temperature has risen by about 1.1°C since the pre-industrial era and ocean heat content is at a record level,”  Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. WMO confirms that 2019 is 2nd warmest year on record, based on consolidated data from , , , and Japan Meteorological Agency   “On the current path of carbon dioxide emissions, we are heading towards a temperature increase of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius by the end of century.” WMO analysis showed the annual global temperature in 2019 was 1.1°C warmer than in the period from 1850-1900, or the pre-industrial era. Only 2016 was hotter, due to a very strong El Niño which causes warming, combined with long-term climate change. Furthermore, average temperatures for the past five years and 10 years, respectively, were the highest on record. Since the 1980s, each decade has been warmer than the previous one: a trend the UN agency expects will continue due to the record level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. WMO added that 2019 and the past decade also were characterized by retreating ice, record sea levels, increasing ocean heat and acidification, and extreme weather, all of which have “major impacts” on human health and the natural environment. Meanwhile, the New Year began where 2019 left off, according to Mr. Taalas. “Australia had its hottest, driest year on record in 2019, setting the scene for the massive bushfires which were so devastating to people and property, wildlife, ecosystems and the environment,” he said. “Unfortunately, we expect to see much extreme weather throughout 2020 and the coming decades, fuelled by record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.”

231-> East Africa locusts threaten food security across subregion, alerts UN agriculture agency
Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia are dealing with desert locust swarms of “unprecedented size and destructive potential” that could spill over into more countries in East Africa, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) on Monday. Destroying hundreds of thousands of acres of crops, the outbreak is impacting the region’s food insecurity. The UN agency urged for a collective campaign to deal with the crisis, concerned over the risk that the swarms spill over into more countries in East Africa, “if efforts to deal with the voracious pest are not scaled up across the region”. Moreover, unusual climate conditions have favoured rapid locust reproduction. The agency stressed that as favourable breeding conditions continue, the increase in locust swarms could last until June. And left unchecked, the numbers of crop-devouring insects could grow 500 fold by then. Kenya has not faced a locust threat of this magnitude in 70 years, warned. The outbreak of desert locusts, considered the most dangerous locust species, has also affected parts of Somalia and Ethiopia, the likes of  which have not been seen on this scale in 25 years. South Sudan and Uganda are not currently affected, but are at risk, FAO added. In a press release issued on Monday, FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said the agency is activating fast-track mechanisms to support governments, warning that the situation is now of “international dimensions”. "Authorities in the region have already jump-started control activities, but in view of the scale and urgency of the threat, additional financial backing from the international donor community is needed so they can access the tools and resources required to get the job done," Mr. Qu said. Swarms potentially containing hundreds of millions of individual desert locusts can move 150 kilometres a day – devastating rural livelihoods. According to the UN agency, “given the scale of the current swarms, aerial control is the only effective means to reduce the locust numbers”. is assisting with forecasts, early warning and alerts on the timing, scale and location of invasions and breeding. Mr. Qu also warned the response must include efforts to restore people’s livelihoods."Communities in Eastern Africa have already been impacted by extended droughts, which have eroded their capacities to grow food and make a living. We need to help them get back on their feet, once the locusts are gone," FAO’s Director General said. The UN is seeking $70 million to urgently support both pest control and livelihood protection operations in the three most affected countries. Key facts on Locusts In addition, numerous desert locust swarms have been breeding in India, Iran and Pakistan since June 2019. And some have migrated to southern Iran where recent heavy rains have nurtured a breeding ground that could generate swarms in the spring. Egypt, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen are also seeing substantial breeding activity that could see locust bands expand into swarms in the coming months, added. The agency concluded that it stands ready to leverage its expertise and facilitate a coordinated response.

232-> Jordan flash flooding: UN chief ‘saddened’ by loss of life
The United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on Thursday that he was “deeply saddened by the loss of life and extensive damage” that occurred from large-scale flash flooding near the Dead Sea, in Jordan, which reportedly swept away a bus carrying pupils and staff on a school trip. According to news reports, at least 18 have been killed, and dozens of others injured. The victims were washed away by the floods in the Zara Maeen hot springs area, following heavy rains on Thursday. Many are being treated for serious injuries, and search and rescue efforts are ongoing. Mr. Guterres conveyed his “condolences and deepest sympathy to the families of the victims” and the Government of Jordan. He added that the “the United Nations stands ready to support ongoing rescue and relief efforts”. The Dead Sea valley is prone to flooding as it lies below sea level and flash floods tend to occur when rain water rushes down from the adjacent hills.

233-> UN human rights ruling could boost climate change asylum claims
The UN Human Rights Committee has determined that countries cannot deport people who have sought asylum due to climate-related threats. The historic ruling marks the first decision by a UN human rights treaty body based on a complaint filed by an individual seeking protection from the effects of climate change. Historic case opens door to asylum claims ➡️ UN finds that countries may not deport individuals who face climate change-induced conditions that violate the right to life. 👉  Ioane Teitota from the Pacific island nation of Kiribati lodged the complaint in 2015 after being deported from New Zealand when his asylum application was denied. Mr. Teitota argued that his right to life had been violated, as rising sea levels and other destructive effects of climate change had made his homeland uninhabitable. He said he was forced to migrate from the island of Tarawa, to New Zealand, due to impacts such as a lack of freshwater due to saltwater intrusion, erosion of arable land, and associated violent land disputes which had resulted in numerous fatalities. ‘New standards’ established While the UN Committee determined that Mr. Teitota’s right to life had not been violated as sufficient protection measures had been implemented in Kiribati, member Yuval Shany said: “Nevertheless, this ruling sets forth new standards that could facilitate the success of future climate change-related asylum claims.” The Committee further clarified that people seeking asylum are not required to prove that they would face immediate harm, if deported back to their home countries. Their rationale was that because climate-related events can occur both suddenly - such as intense storms or flooding - or over time through slow-onset processes such as sea level rise and land degradation, either situation could spur people to seek safety elsewhere. Additionally, Committee members underlined that the international community must assist countries adversely affected by climate change.

234-> At epicentre of Indonesia disaster, Guterres praises resilience of Sulawesi people
Standing amidst the wreckage of Balaroa, one of the worst hit areas of Palu, Indonesia, on Friday, António Guterres said it was “impossible not to feel heart-broken” at the destruction caused by the huge earthquake and tsunami that struck the island of Sulawesi two weeks ago. According to news reports, the village of Balaroa, virtually disappeared into a sinkhole due to the earthquake and around 70 per cent of the population lost their lives. Latest figures from the UN humanitarian affairs office ( ) say that around 2,000 died overall in the disaster, with 11,000 injured and 680 still officially missing. The UN chief, talking to reporters in Palu, said it was “the moment to express – and I want to do it on behalf of the UN and, I believe, the whole international community – full solidarity with the people of Sulawesi and the people of Indonesia, and an enormous admiration for the resilience that was demonstrated by the population impacted by this earthquake.” “Their courage, their spirit of solidarity is remarkable” he added, saying that the response led by the Indonesian government had been “very rapid and effective”. “As the UN, we are ready to support the government; we already have people on the ground. But the leadership must always be the leadership of the government of the country and the international community needs to be supportive of that effort.” Among the locals he met, were those recuperating at a Palu hospital, which had been partly destroyed in the disaster. He talked to some of the displaced who had either lost their homes, or were now too afraid to return. He also met families who had lost loved ones, as well as schoolchildren and their teacher, in a camp in Jalan Balaikota. 'The UN is with you' In several tweets from Palu, the UN chief had this message for locals across the devastated city and surrounding area: "To the many people I saw and spoke to - your strength and resilience are remarkable. The UN is with you." "I was deeply saddened to see so many people suffering in Palu amidst so much destruction," he wrote. Mr. Guterres travelled to the region with the Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla, and also met the Head of the Indonesian Disaster Management Authority, and governor of Central Sulawesi. On Saturday, he's taking part in World Bank-International Monetary Fund meetings in Bali, where he's discuss sustainable development and climate change. Watch the latest video below from the UN humanitarian affairs office, , on the scale of the recovery effort that lies ahead.

235-> World is ‘on notice’ as major UN report shows one million species face extinction
A hard-hitting report into the impact of humans on nature shows that nearly one million species risk becoming extinct within decades, while current efforts to conserve the earth’s resources will likely fail without radical action, UN biodiversity experts said on Monday. Speaking in Paris at the launch of the study – the first such report since 2005 – Director-General Audrey Azoulay said that its findings put the world “on notice”. At 1pm (CET) on Monday 6 May, the key findings of the  - the definitive global synthesis of the state of , ecosystems and 's contributions to people - will be launched via live webcast. 📹: Watch here:   “Following the adoption of this historic report, no one will be able to claim that they did not know,” the head of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization said. “We can no longer continue to destroy the diversity of life. This is our responsibility towards future generations.” Highlighting the universal importance of biodiversity – the diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems – Ms. Azoulay said that protecting it “is as vital as fighting climate change”. Presented to more than 130 government delegations for their approval at headquarters, the report features the work of 400 experts from at least 50 countries, coordinated by the Bonn-based Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( ). In addition to providing exhaustive insights on the state of nature, ecosystems and how nature underpins all human activity, the study also discusses progress on key international goals, such as the ( ), the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and the on climate change. The report also examines five main drivers of “unprecedented” biodiversity and ecosystem change over the past 50 years, identifying them as: changes in land and sea use; direct exploitation of organisms; climate change, pollution, and invasion of alien species. On at-risk fauna and flora, the study asserts that human activities “threaten more species now than ever before” – a finding based on the fact that around 25 per cent of species in plant and animal groups are vulnerable. This suggests that around one million species “already face extinction, many within decades, unless action is taken to reduce the intensity of drivers of biodiversity loss”. Without such measures there will be a “further acceleration” in the global rate of species extinction, which is already “at least tens to hundreds of times higher, than it has averaged over the past 10 million years”, the report states. It notes that despite many local efforts, including by indigenous peoples and local communities, by 2016, 559 of the 6,190 domesticated breeds of mammals used for food and agriculture were extinct – around nine per cent of the total - and at least 1,000 more are threatened. In addition, many crop wild relatives that are needed for long-term food security “lack effective protection”, the report insists, while the status of wild relatives of domesticated mammals and birds “is worsening”. At the same time, reductions in the diversity of cultivated crops, crop wild relatives and domesticated breeds mean that farming will likely be less resilient against future climate change, pests and pathogens. “While more food, energy and materials than ever before are now being supplied to people in most places, this is increasingly at the expense of nature’s ability to provide such contributions in the future,” the report states, before adding that “the biosphere, upon which humanity as a whole depends…is declining faster than at any time in human history”. On the issue of pollution, although global trends are mixed, air, water and soil pollution have continued to increase in some areas, the report insists. “Marine plastic pollution in particular has increased tenfold since 1980, affecting at least 267 species”, it says, including 86 per cent of marine turtles, 44 per cent of seabirds and 43 per cent of marine mammals. The 2019 Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is also the first of its kind to examine and include indigenous and local knowledge, issues and priorities, IPBES said in a statement, noting that its mission is to strengthen policy-making for the sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development. “The loss of species, ecosystems and genetic diversity is already a global and generational threat to human well-being,” insisted Sir Robert Watson, IPBES Chair. “Protecting the invaluable contributions of nature to people will be the defining challenge of decades to come. Policies, efforts and actions - at every level - will only succeed, however, when based on the best knowledge and evidence.”

237-> UN launches Facebook Messenger-powered bot to take on climate change
As world leaders and decision-makers get to work on mitigating climate change at the COP24 conference in Katowice, Poland, renowned broadcaster and natural historian Sir David Attenborough launched a new UN campaign to give individuals their say on the key global issue, via social media. Sir David announced the start of The People’s Seat initiative, enabling individuals around the world to unite to battle climate change, during the opening session of the crucial two-week on Monday. The UN’s new [this link opens in Facebook Messenger] is designed to fuel climate change understanding, and urges advocates to take personal action via the Facebook Messenger Platform. Sir David told delegates on Monday in Poland that “if we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilizations and the extinction of much of the natural world, is on the horizon.” Mr. Attenborough passionately for The People’s Seat, the UN initiative calling on people from across the globe to be part of the climate change dialogue: “In the last two weeks, the world’s people have taken part in creating this address, answering polls, creating videos and voicing their opinions,” he said. “They want you – the decision makers – to act now.” “The people are behind you, supporting you in making tough decisions, but they are also willing to make sacrifices in their daily lives. To make this even easier, the UN is launching the Act Now Bot. Helping people to discover simple everyday actions that they can take, because they recognize that they too must play their part,” he urged assembled officials. UN Under-Secretary-General of Global Communications Alison Smale welcomed the launch:  “This new social media tool, a Facebook Messenger bot, will help people learn about activities to reduce their carbon footprint, and show—and share with friends—how they are making an impact.  We all need to do things differently.” The innovative campaign was created with support from Facebook and Grey advertising company and harnesses advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to engage people in the growing movement to take climate action. The bot is a fully interactive and responsive chat bot which users can find on the page. It suggests everyday actions determined by the user’s interaction with the bot, that can be taken to preserve the environment and shared via the social platform to encourage collective action. The collective actions will be presented during the United Nations Secretary-General’s Climate Summit in New York in September 2019. The initiative comes as global decision makers are being asked to intensify efforts in the battle against climate change and to agree the implementation guidelines of the landmark 2015 . All this is evolving against a backdrop of conclusive new evidence by which found countries to significantly step up the necessary actions to fulfil the commitments made in Paris.

238-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: violence surges in Nigeria, anti-Semitism on the march, taxing pollution to tackle climate crisis, and more
Tuesday’s main stories include: thousands fleeing into Niger as violence surges in Nigeria; UN rights office condemns rise in anti-Semitic incidents; UN chief says tax pollution, not people for climate’s sake; North Koreans trapped in vicious cycle of corruption and bribery; Ebola latest from DR Congo. Violent attacks in Nigeria drive thousands of refugees into Niger An upsurge in violence in areas of north-west Nigeria beyond the reach of humanitarians, has forced thousands of people to flee to neighbouring Niger, UN refugee agency, , . Warning that some 20,000 people have been uprooted from their homes since April in Nigeria’s Sokoto and Zamfara states, the agency’s Babar Baloch told journalists in Geneva that is working with authorities in Niger to help the new arrivals. Today, Niger hosts more than 380,000 refugees and asylum seekers from Mali and Nigeria, in addition to its own internally displaced population. Anti-Semitism spread is not isolated, warns UN human rights office The UN human rights office the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in Europe and the United States, and called on governments to “redouble their efforts” to protect people from incitement to hatred and violence. The statement from follows “a significant increase” of anti-Semitism in Germany, where Jews in some areas have been advised not to wear traditional dress, to avoid drawing attention to their race and religion. In Austria, pictures of Holocaust survivors displayed in a street exhibition have also been vandalised “not once, but three times”, the human rights office said. Initially, swastikas were daubed on the survivors’ faces, before large sections of the prints were then cut out at the weekend. Most disturbing of all are acts of physical violence against Jews which have also increased in a number of countries in recent years, said, noting a “particularly sharp” rise in Germany and France. But it warns that the worst incidents have been in the United States, where 11 people were killed during an attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh last October, and where in April, a woman was killed and three others injured in another attack on a synagogue in California. Here’s from earlier this year on the steps being taken by the UN to address xenophobia. ‘Tax pollution, not people’, UN chief tells World Summit “We need to tax pollution, not people” and “end subsidies for fossil fuels”, told the World Summit of the R20 Coalition on Tuesday, a UN-supported environmental organization, founded by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The idea that subsidizing fossil fuels is a way to improve people’s lives could not be more wrong, said the UN chief in the Austrian capital, Vienna, because it means spending taxpayers’ money to “boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals: to destroy the world.” Mr. Guterres went on to call for the decarbonization of urban infrastructure, a halt to coal plants, and the promotion of sustainable consumption and production: “in short, we need a green economy, not a grey economy.” Our full story is . Audio of the UN Secretary-General at the R20 Austrian World Summit, below: North Korea traps people in deprivation, corruption, repression and bribery – UN rights office Bribery is the main way people in North Korea get food, healthcare, shelter and work, a UN human rights office report on Tuesday. Based on more than 200 first-hand accounts of escapees from the country, which is officially known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), the report says that the State-run public distribution system collapsed in the mid-1990s, forcing people to work in informal markets, where they have to bribe officials to avoid arrest. It also highlights “appalling” levels of hunger that affects around 10.9 million people – that’s more than 43 per cent of the population – with north-eastern and rural provinces worst-affected.

239-> Ensuring the ‘lungs of the planet’ keep us alive: 5 things you need to know about forests and the UN
Forests are vitally important for sustaining life on Earth, and play a major role in the fight against climate change. With the 2019 session of the United Nations Forum on Forests wrapping up on Friday in New York, we delve deeper into the subject, and find out what the UN is doing to safeguard and protect them. 1. Forests are the most cost-effective way to fight climate change Arguably, protection and enhancing the world’s forests is one of the most cost-effective forms of climate action: forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing roughly 2 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide each year.  Sustainable forest management can build resilience and help mitigate and adapt to climate change. Speaking at the 2018 UN climate conference ( ) in Katowice, Poland, Liu Zhemin, head of the UN’s Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), said that “forests are central in developing solutions both to mitigate and adapt to climate change, adding that “these terrestrial ecosystems have already removed nearly one third of human-produced carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. Through sustainable forest management, they could remove much more.” At this week’s meeting session of the UNFF, it was noted that forest-based climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, if fully implemented, could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 15 gigatonnes of CO2 a year by 2050, which could potentially be enough to limit warming to well below 2°C (the target set by the international community in 2015). Today, fossil fuels emit 36 gigatonnes every year. In addition, as renewable sources increasingly replace fossil fuels, forests will become more and more important as sources of energy: already, forests supply about 40 per cent of global renewable energy in the form of wood fuel – as much as solar, hydroelectric and wind power combined. 2. The goal of zero deforestation is close to being reached Significant progress has been made in international forest protection over the past 25 years. The rate of net global deforestation has slowed by more than 50 per cent, a credit to global efforts to sustainably manage existing forests, while at the same time engaging in ambitious measures to restore degraded forests and land, and to plant more trees to meet the demand for forest products and services. The goal of zero net global deforestation is close to being reached, bringing the world one step closer to the UN Strategic Plan for Forest’s target to expand global forest area by 3 per cent by 2030, an area of 120 million hectares, about the size of South Africa. 3. The biggest threat to forests is…agriculture Many people will be aware of the devastating effects that illegal and unsustainable logging has on forests, but the biggest global driver of deforestation is actually agriculture, because of the extent to which forests are converted to farmland and livestock grazing land: a key challenge is how to manage the ongoing increase in agricultural production, and improve food security, without reducing overall forest areas. A major , released in May, made headlines around the world with its headline figure of one million species at risk of extinction, warned against the destruction of forests, noting that this “will likely have negative impacts on biodiversity and can threaten food and water security as well as local livelihoods, including by intensifying social conflict.” 4. The UN’s growing role in forest protection The first time forests came to the forefront of the international agenda was at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, widely regarded as one of the landmark UN conferences. The Summit led to the adoption of Agenda 21, the first significant international action plan for achieving sustainable development, which noted the “major weaknesses in the policies, methods and mechanisms adopted to support and develop the multiple ecological, economic, social and cultural roles of trees, forests and forest lands.” The Earth Summit also saw the adoption of the Forest Principles which, although non-legally binding, was the first global consensus reached on the sustainable management of forests. The Principles called for all countries to make efforts towards reforestation and forest conservation; enshrined the right of nations to develop forests in keeping with national sustainable development policies; and called for financial resources to be provided for targeted economic policies. To better co-ordinate international efforts to put the principles into practice, an inter-governmental panel and forum were set up in the 1990s, to be replaced in 2000 by the UN Forum on Forests (UNFF), which meets every year at UN Headquarters in New York to monitor progress on the implementation of the six Global Forest Goals. The Goals set targets for the sustainable management of forests, and reduction of deforestation and forest degradation, and were developed as part the forest community’s response to the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development, the UN’s overall blueprint for economic progress that protects the environment and humanity. 5. This year’s top priorities: climate change and the real cost of deforestation One of the key take-aways from the 2019 session of the UN Forest Forum was that, too often, forests are under-valued, because it’s hard to put a clear monetary value on all of the positive contributions they make to the world. As a result, the true cost of deforestation and forest degradation is not taken into account when policy decisions are made on land use, such as decisions to clear forest land to use for commercial agriculture. The importance of financing was another important element of the session:  sufficient funding is an essential element in ensuring effective action to halt deforestation and forest degradation, promote greater sustainable forest management and increase the world’s forest area: despite the central role forests play in protecting the environment, only 2 per cent of funds available for climate change mitigation are available for efforts to reduce deforestation.

240-> UN chief outlines ‘intertwined challenges’ of climate change, ocean health facing Pacific nations on the ‘frontline’
Visiting Fiji for the first time as Secretary-General, António Guterres outlined two “fundamental challenges” facing leaders attending the Pacific Islands Forum on Tuesday, namely climate change and the world’s rising ocean, which threatens to submerge low-lying nations. “The Pacific region is on the frontline of climate change”, he said. “That means you are also our important allies in the fight against it”. The UN chief said that he was there “to see the region’s climate pressures firsthand, and to learn about the work being undertaken by communities here in Fiji and elsewhere to bolster resilience”. Noting that the last four years were the hottest on record, Mr. Guterres highlighted recent ice losses in Greenland and Antarctica, saying that “sea levels will rise a full meter by 2100”. In the Pacific specifically, he said that sea-levels are set to rise in some countries four times above the global average, posing “an existential threat to some island States”. Providing “ample evidence of the region’s vulnerability” the UN chief cited recent damage caused by Tropical Cyclones Gita, Josie and Keni as well as by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and other extreme weather events in the region. “Climate change will further worsen the risks”, he spelled out, noting that the salinization of water and crops is endangering food security and escalating the impact on public health. He maintained that climate change also brings “clear dangers” for international peace and security, pointing to the 2018 , which reaffirms climate change as the single greatest threat to the wellbeing of the Pacific. Mr. Guterres said that he recently appointed a task force to coordinate UN initiatives to address these challenges. “Military strategists see clearly the possibility of climate impacts increasing tensions over resources and mass movements of people”, he continued. “As coastal areas or degraded inland areas become uninhabitable, people will seek safety and better lives elsewhere”. Recalling that more than 24 million people in 118 countries and territories were displaced by natural disasters in 2016, he told Pacific leaders their islands and communities "are in the forefront of global climate negotiations”. He vowed the UN’s strong commitment “to supporting your response to climate change and reversing the negative trends that have put your cultures and very existence at risk”. There are 2 major challenges facing Pacific islands today: 1 > climate change, which wreaks havoc through extreme weather 2 > rising oceans, which threatens to submerge the islands. Here are the key takeaways from chief 's visit to Fiji: A warming ocean Climate change also threatens the well-being of the world’s ocean and seas, which are critical to the economies and traditions of the Pacific. “Oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, causing coral bleaching and reducing biodiversity” the UN chief told the Forum, stating that global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius would cause “severe damage to tropical reefs”. Moreover, if warming reached two degrees Celsius or more, “it would be catastrophic for marine life and humans alike” he said. “Food security would decline. Economic growth would suffer”. But seas and marine life are also under attack from other directions. Mr. Guterres painted a picture of overfishing; underwater deserts in effect, with no oxygen; seas filled with poison and trash, and species becoming extinct within decades. “Every year, more than eight million tonnes of harmful plastic waste end up in the ocean” he said. “According to one recent study, plastic could outweigh fish in our seas by 2050”. While many countries are finally rejecting single-use plastic, the UN chief underscored that “we must do even more” to address the unsustainable levels of stress on marine and coastal ecosystems. He commended Pacific countries for ensuring the adoption of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, saying that his Special Envoy for the Ocean, Fiji’s Peter Thomson, is promoting the SDGs and the outcomes of the UN Ocean Conference. Needed: ‘Urgency, will and ambition’ “To address the intertwined challenges of climate change and ocean health, we need smart and far-reaching steps” that require action aligned with the and the , which makes full use of tools, such as the Convention on the Law of the Sea, according to the UN chief. “We have the blueprints, frameworks and plans” he stated. “What we need is urgency, will and ambition”. Mr. Guterres spoke of his Climate Action Summit in September at UN Headquarters, as an opportunity “to scale up” pledges to halt emission increases 2020, and “dramatically reduce” them to net-zero emissions by mid-century. He also stressed the importance of gender diversity in decision making as climate change has impacts on women, citing as an example that food salinization affects the health of pregnant women and newborns. Pacific region leadership critical Come September, Mr. Guterres said that sustainable development will be centre-stage as SDG progress will be reviewed and finance mobilization discussed. He lauded Pacific countries’ commitment to promote their vision of a “Blue Continent” and maintained that their voices “remain crucial in global negotiations”. “The Pacific has a unique moral authority to speak out” he said. “It is time for the world to listen”. In his , the UN chief reiterated that because Pacific Island States are “leading by example”, they have “the moral authority” to tell the world that climate change needs to be reversed. While lauding some of the innovations mentioned over the last two day, Mr. Guterres warned that “we are not yet winning the battle in relation to climate change and we are not yet winning the battle in relation to oceans”. “We will not give up and we want the Summit that we are convening in September to be a reaffirmation of this objective and its feasibility and the request for the political will to be in place, especially from those countries that are contributing more to climate change” he underscored. Noting the linkages between climate change, oceans and development, the UN chief stressed that “we must mobilize the whole multilateral system” and “the international community” to address climate change “in the context of all the other problems that we are facing and all the other battles that we are not winning”. According to the UN chief, the Forum’s final message is “to clearly say, we are determined to address the challenge of climate change but it’s not only the Pacific that is at stake, it’s the whole planet and even the most developed countries in the world will face dramatic impacts.” “What we ask for is not solidarity, it’s not generosity, it is enlightened self-interest from all decision-makers around the world”, concluded the Secretary-General.

241-> Monday’s Daily Brief: #ClimateAction for the Pacific, Gaza blockade, attack in Burkina Faso
This Monday, top stories are: Gaza's aid dependency due to the ongoing blockade; a special focus on climate change and its impact on islands and people of the Pacific; UN condemnation after a deadly attack in Burkina Faso. Gaza blockade causes ‘near ten-fold increase’ in food dependency, says UN agency At a time when Muslims globally are observing the holy month of Ramadan, more than half the population in Gaza depends on the international community for food aid, the director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) on Monday, citing a “near ten-fold increase” in need. According to UNRWA, it must secure an additional $60 million by June to continue providing food to more than one million Palestine refugees in Gaza, including some 620,000 “abject poor” who cannot cover their basic food needs and are surviving on $1.6 per day. >> Read .

For this, he called on nations worldwide to make four pivotal shifts: 1/ tax pollution, not people; 2/ stop subsidizing fossil fuels; 3/ stop building new coal plants; 4/ focus on a green economy. >> Find out . Climate change ‘a threat to our human rights’, says Australian minority community In a related development, indigenous Australians are set to ask the UN Human Rights Committee to investigate its claim that the government is doing too little to limit climate change. According to reports, Torres Strait islanders in the north of the country say that global warming is a threat to their survival, thanks to rising seas, tidal surges and coastal erosion. They maintain that the lack of action by the authorities is a threat to their human rights. As part of their claim, the group is calling for the UN panel – which is one of 10 human rights committees that meet regularly throughout the year in Geneva – to call for Australia to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. UN condemns deadly attack on Burkina Faso church Senior UN officials, including have voiced their outrage at a deadly attack on a Catholic church in the north of Burkina Faso on Sunday, during which six people were reportedly killed by gunmen. According to media reports, the attack took place in the town of Dablo, situated in a region that has seen a spike in violence in recent months. The church was burned to the ground, along with other buildings including a health centre. >> Find .

242-> ‘Climate change is the battle of my life’, UN chief tells students living on the frontline in Fiji
The UN Secretary-General António Guterres saw the frontline of “the battle against climate change” for himself on Thursday, by taking to the tropical waters of the South Pacific off the coast of Fiji, on a solar-powered boat. Mr. Guterres was greeted on board the Uto ni Yalo, a traditional emission-free ship built as part of a naval fleet that combines the ancient craft of Pacific shipbuilding with modern materials and green technology. “As Secretary-General, I have many battles”, the UN chief tweeted. “As a grandfather, the battle against climate change is the battle of my life” adding “it’s a battle we’re not winning”. The ship, whose name means “Heart of the Spirit”, has circumnavigated the world twice, sailing over 80,000 nautical miles to countries in the Northern and Southern hemispheres to motivate community, corporate and policy commitments to protect the world’s islands and ocean spaces. Mr. Guterres held firmly to his belief that “we need stronger political will and urgent climate action to save our planet and our future”. He also participated in an interactive session with students at the University of the South Pacific on combating climate change, where he heard about their work and told them, “The world needs your generation to keep my generation accountable.” He assured them that the UN is committed to continue listening to their voices and opening pathways for meaningful participation in decisions that affect them. “Young people around the world are driving transformative climate action and MUST keep up the pressure on their leaders” he tweeted. “The determination of the students I met in Fiji is key to living at peace with our climate”. For their part, the students in Fiji told the UN chief that they want the world to know they are calling for urgent climate action. Earlier in the day, Mr. Guterres laid a wreath at the National War Memorial for the fallen peacekeepers in the Pacific region, where he tweeted that “Since the 1970s, Fijian peacekeepers have served in UN peacekeeping missions, [where] some have made the ultimate sacrifice”. He thanked Fiji “for its contribution to protecting the vulnerable”. As well as meeting Fiji's President Geogi Konrotti, where they planted a ceremonial coconut tree, the Secretary-General told a joint press conference with Prime Minister Josia Furek Benimarama that climate change was "a life battle for Fiji and the Pacific."

243-> Stop Tuvalu and ‘the world from sinking’ UN chief tells island nation facing existential threat from rising seas
Tuvalu “faces an existential threat from sea-level rise”, the United Nations chief said during his visit to the Pacific island nation on Friday whose highest point is less than five metres above the waves. “We must stop Tuvalu from sinking and the world from sinking with Tuvalu”, said in a tweet posted during his on-going trip to the South Pacific. Pointing out that Tuvalu is “on the extreme frontlines of the global climate emergency”, he noted that “rising seas threaten to drown this island nation – a sign of what’s in store for us all”. The chief met families in Tuvalu Friday "Whose homes & way of life are at risk because of relentless rising seas" is essential. "We must save Tuvalu - and save the world". At a joint press conference with Tuvalu’s Prime Minister, Enele Sosene Sopoaga, the UN chief told journalists: “You are on the frontline of the war on climate change because climate change is striking in Tuvalu in a more dramatic way than anywhere else in the world”. He professed his “enormous admiration” that the island nation has “decided to resist” and is implementing “a programme of adaptation and resilience that is something that the whole world should admire and support”. “But” stressed Mr. Guterres “it’s necessary that governments that are still causing the problems that affect Tuvalu, understand that they need to change”. He made clear they must alter energy and transportation policies,  along with the way they manage their cities and use fossil fuels “so that the impact of climate change on Tuvalu can be stopped”. “Climate change cannot be stopped in Tuvalu, it has to be stopped in the rest of the world”, the UN chief spelled out, saying that he will host the 2019 Climate Action Summit in New York “to make sure that all countries accept the commitment that we need to be globally carbon neutral by 2050 to limit the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees”. At the same time, Mr. Guterres expressed his “deep solidarity” and the UN’s “total support” to the government and to the people of Tuvalu in their determined efforts to preserve their country – “physically, culturally, in the economic and social dimensions, as a rich component of the Pacific and the international community”. “Nowhere have I seen the heartbreaking impacts of the global climate emergency more starkly than in Tuvalu, where I met families whose homes are threatened by relentless rising seas” he detailed. “We must take urgent to save Tuvalu — and save the world”, the Secretary-General tweeted.

244-> More than nine in ten children exposed to deadly air pollution
Air pollution is “stunting children’s brains” and affecting their health in more ways than was previously suspected, the World Health Organization ( ) said on Monday. In a call for concrete policy pledges from governments across the world to tackle the problem, the UN health agency that more than nine in 10 youngsters breathe air that is so polluted, “it puts their health and development at serious risk”. The findings – launched on the eve of the agency’s first on Air Pollution and Health in Geneva - include the estimate that 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air in 2016. Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives -  “The enormous toll of disease and death revealed by these new data should result in an urgent call to action for the global community, and especially for those in the health sector,” the WHO report says, noting that the impact of air pollution both inside and outside the home is worst in low and middle-income countries. Among the WHO report’s other findings are data indicating that pregnant women are more likely to give birth prematurely when they are exposed to dirty air. Their babies are also prone to be underweight and small, according to WHO, which also highlights how air pollution can trigger asthma and childhood cancer, while also hampering neuro-development. “Polluted air is poisoning millions of children and ruining their lives,” said WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Every child should be able to breathe clean air so they can grow and fulfil their full potential.” One reason why children are especially vulnerable to polluted air is that they breathe more rapidly than adults, absorbing more toxins, WHO says.   Youngsters are also more exposed to pollutants that stay closer to the ground at a time when their bodies and brains are still developing, the UN agency report continues, adding that newborns and young children are more susceptible to household air pollution in homes that use polluting fuels for cooking, heating and lighting. As part of its call for action from the international community, WHO is recommending a series of “straightforward” measures to reduce the health risk from ambient fine particulate matter, or PM2.5. These include accelerating the switch to clean cooking and heating fuels and technologies, promoting the use of cleaner transport, energy-efficient housing and urban planning. “Air pollution is stunting our children’s brains, affecting their health in more ways than we suspected,” said Dr Maria Neira, Director, Department of Public Health, Environmental and Social Determinants of Health at WHO. “But there are many straight-forward ways to reduce emissions of dangerous pollutants.” WHO is also supporting low emission power generation, cleaner, safer industrial technologies and better municipal waste management” to reduce community air pollution, Dr Neira added.

245-> UN chief calls for ‘enlightened self-interest’ from world leaders to save ‘the whole planet’ from climate change
Concluding a week-long visit to the South Pacific, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s decision-makers to make “enlightened” choices on climate action because “the whole planet” is at stake. “Over the past week, I have witnessed first-hand the impacts of climate change in the Pacific Island States”, the UN chief said in a statement concluding his visit to the region. “They contribute very little to the global climate emergency and yet, they are the ones that are being most affected”.  He did not mince words in saying that for some of them, “climate change is now an existential threat”. Pointing out that entire villages are being relocated, livelihoods destroyed and people becoming sick from climate-related diseases, Mr. Guterres lamented: “The risks are all too real”. He drew attention to his time in Tuvalu, where he saw “an entire country fighting to preserve its very existence”. And yet, the UN chief found “remarkable” that the countries facing these enormous challenges, have decided that “they are not giving up” but are instead “determined to find solutions”. Not only have they developed ways to increase their resilience and adaptation, but according to Mr. Guterres, “they are leading the way in reducing emissions and are an example that the rest of the world should follow”. In Vanuatu, his final stop in the Pacific, the Secretary-General tweeted that the vulnerable island State was one of “the most disaster-prone countries, made worse by the global climate emergency”. However, he added that he “saw first-hand how the Pacific island nation is facing threats with determined climate action”. Reiterating the powerful message that he has continued to underscore throughout his visit to the South Pacific, the UN chief stressed that “climate change cannot be stopped by the small island countries alone, it has to be stopped by the rest of the world” and that this requires the political will for “transformational policies in energy, mobility, industry and agriculture”. Mr. Guterres echoed the “three urgent messages” to world leaders that he had “consistently conveyed” throughout his visit to the Pacific, beginning with shifting taxes from salaries to carbon. “We need to tax pollution, not people,” he reiterated. Second, he flagged that countries must stop subsidizing fossil fuels. “Taxpayer money should not be used to boost hurricanes, spread drought and heatwaves, melt glaciers and bleach corals”, he asserted. And third, he argued against building new coal plants by 2020, saying “we need a green economy not a grey economy”. Mr. Guterres said that solidarity or generosity is not being sought, “it is enlightened self-interest from all decision-makers around the world” that is needed “because it’s not only of the Pacific that is at stake, it’s the whole planet”. “To save the Pacific is to save the whole planet”, concluded the Secretary-General.

246-> Fighting ‘existential crisis’ of encroaching desert sands
In a move described as a landmark decision, the Group of Earth Observations ( ) – a UN-backed partnership set up to improve Earth observation data-sharing and availability, to benefit all life – has launched a global initiative to reverse the “existential crisis” created by desertification and land degradation. The key thrust of the initiative will see so-called “quality data” transferred into the hands of national and local decision-makers, where it can be used more effectively on the ground. The UN Convention to Combat Desertification ( ) says that land quality is getting worse in nearly all of the world’s countries, 169 in all, with related consequences including loss of wildlife, the internal displacement of populations, and forced migration. Without urgent global and national climate action, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Latin America could see more than people move within their countries’ borders by 2050, increasing competition for dwindling space. In September, the UN body urged the GEO to support them in implementing the Convention: the outcome is the Land Degradation Neutrality Initiative, launched at the 2018 GEO Congress in Kyoto on Thursday. Land Degradation Neutrality is defined by the UNCCD as the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remaining stable or increasing. The new commitment brings together data providers from around the world to strengthen monitoring and reporting, allowing governments - at the touch of a button - to access quality data and manage land better. “Land degradation is an existential crisis. Until now, monitoring it in real time felt like an insurmountable challenge. No longer,” said Monique Barbut, Executive Secretary, United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. “With Earth observation datasets and the practical tools to use them readily available, decision-makers and land-users will have immediate and actionable information to scale up sustainable land management and planning. It is a first step to boosting our resilience,” she added. Working groups have now been set up, to focus on areas such as data quality standards and big data computing platforms. To date, 119 governments have pledged to take the measures needed to avoid, halt and reverse land degradation to ensure the amount of productive land stabilizes by 2030 and beyond.

247-> Mobile game aims to bridge gap between citizens and leaders on climate action
Millions of people worldwide will get to share their views on climate action through a UN campaign launched on Thursday aimed at connecting them with Governments and policy makers. The is built around an internet and mobile video game that educates people about climate policy and allows them to vote on possible solutions. The campaign was developed by the UN Development Programme ( ), alongside experts in game development, climate science and public polling. is not just a game. It's the world's biggest survey of public opinion on . Together with , we're connecting the world's 4.78 billion mobile📱users to through technology:  “Together with partners from across the private and public sectors, we have the ability with this campaign to in an innovative two-way discussion on solutions to the climate crisis, and increase ambition ahead of the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow later this year”, said , Administrator. Mission 1.5 takes its name from the collective effort to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as agreed by world leaders in 2015. Described as the world’s biggest survey of public opinion on climate change, it aims to give 20 million people a chance to have their say. A previous survey ahead of the Paris talks canvassed 10,000 people in 76 countries. Players will take on the role of climate policymakers who make decisions to meet the 1.5 degree goal. Afterwards, they will vote on key climate actions that they would like to see adopted. The data will be analyzed and delivered to Governments. The hope is that the game will bridge the gap between citizens and governments on climate action. “People often feel disconnected from the leaders that must make urgent decisions on the climate crisis,” said Cassie Flynn, UNDP Climate Change Advisor. “Mission 1.5 is a way to help people understand climate solutions and make their voices heard. In many ways, it is the People’s Climate Vote.”

248-> Protecting migratory species in a rapidly changing world
Many animals – including birds, fish and mammals – migrate along set routes in search of food or breeding grounds. How best to protect them in a rapidly changing world is the focus of a major UN wildlife meeting which opened in Gandhinagar, India, on Monday. The Thirteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, or , is taking place as the world faces the threat of losing one million species to extinction unless protective efforts are increased. Countries are meeting in India to discuss ways to protect migratory species in a rapidly changing world. This video shows how people living on Loktak Lake have taken steps to protect wetlands in the face of climate change and other challenges.  “COP13 comes at a critical time for wildlife conservation, with continued downward trends of habitat loss and species decline,” said CMS Executive Secretary Amy Fraenkel. “The conference will set in motion actions needed to better protect migratory species that rely on multilateral cooperation for their survival.” Welcoming migratory species home COP13, which runs through 22 February, is being held under the theme “Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home”. These creatures bring multiple benefits to humans, such as seed dispersal and pollination, and provide economic benefits and jobs such as in the tourism sector, for example. “These species move between countries without any passports or visas, but are messengers of peace and prosperity, and it is our responsibility to protect that,” said Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi in his keynote address. However, with increased warming and other weather extremes becoming the norm, migratory animals, as well as ecosystems, are also being affected. Delegates at the meeting will consider the need for guidance and other measures to mitigate the impact of roads, railways and other infrastructure on migratory species, which can injure or kill birds and other animals, increase pollution and cut through natural habitats. As countries work to prevent global temperature rise from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius, in line with the on Climate Change, they will also discuss ways to ensure biodiversity and migratory species are considered in national policies to promote renewable energy that is “wildlife-friendly”. Other deliberations will cover strengthening initiatives to combat the illegal killing and trade of migratory birds, and targeted action against aquatic wild meat, including from shark and ray species, which is a fast-emerging threat. “Super year” for nature COP13 kicks off what the UN Environment Programme ( ) calls “ ” for nature. Other events taking place in 2020 include the in June, a UN ‘nature summit’ in September and the UN Biodiversity Conference at the end of the year. Said deputy chief Joyce Myusa: “As we face the unprecedented crisis of species loss, 2020 is an important year to step up action to conserve species, protect ecosystems and make meaningful progress towards achieving the sustainable development goals. We must seize every opportunity we have, and the CMS COP is critical milestone in enabling biodiversity to flourish on this planet.” The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) – the UN’s environmental treaty – is the only global convention that protects these animals. It contains two appendices: one covering endangered migratory species, while the other lists animals with “an unfavourable conservation status”, requiring international action. A new report to be released at COP13 indicates that despite some success stories, the populations of most migratory species covered by the Convention are declining. Ten new species are expected to be added to the Convention, including the Asian Elephant, Jaguar and the Great Indian Bustard: the mascot of COP13. Meanwhile, 12 animals currently included in the appendices are showcased in the latest series of UN Endangered Species stamps, issued on Monday.

250-> Ten new migratory species protected under global wildlife agreement
Asian elephants, jaguars and great Indian bustards were among 10 new species added to a global wildlife agreement on Saturday. The Thirteenth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals ( ) concluded in Gandhinagar, India, with resolutions and decisions adopted to help conserve migratory species globally. “With COP13, the important role of CMS in protecting nature around the world has been strongly embraced”, affirmed CMS Executive Secretary Amy. In addition to Asian elephants, jaguars and great Indian bustards, all slated to receive the strictest protection under Appendix I, Bengal floricans, little bustards, antipodean albatrosses and oceanic white-tip sharks also made the cut. Meanwhile urials along with smooth hammerhead and tope sharks were listed as migratory species that would benefit from enhanced international cooperation and conservation actions. Moreover, 14 species were targeted for newly upon conservation plans. “CMS is uniquely positioned to address the conservation of migratory species and their habitats, and to contribute to reversing the trends of species and biodiversity loss worldwide”, Ms. Fraenkel said. Gandhinagar Declaration Maintaining and restoring ecological connectivity is a top CMS priority, especially in managing migratory species and their habitats – as evidenced by the newly adopted Gandhinagar Declaration, which was affirmed by 130 party countries. The Declaration calls for migratory species and the concept of “ecological connectivity” to be integrated and prioritized in the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which is expected to be adopted at the in October. Declining migratory species The first-ever report on the was presented at the conference. In highlighting that the populations of most CMS-covered migratory species are declining, COP13 agreed that a more comprehensive review be undertaken to understand the status of individual species and the threats they face. “The initial status report has been a real wake up call for the Convention, and Parties recognized, the importance of a more thorough analysis. CMS COP13 has given a clear mandate to prepare a flagship report on the status of migratory species which will give us a better idea of what is happening on the ground, and also provide a much needed tool for understanding where we need to focus our work,”  the CMS chief said. And the conference agreed on a number of cross-cutting policy measures to address threats to migratory species, such as integrating biodiversity and migratory species considerations into national energy and climate policy and promote wildlife-friendly renewable energy. Indian hosts During the conference, the first CMS COP to be inaugurated by a host-country Head of Government, three were named, seven were recognized and two sets of commemorative stamps were issued. In his opening address, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to focus on the conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway, and announced the establishment of an institutional research facility for the conservation of migratory birds and marine turtles, the reduction of pollution from micro-plastic and single-use plastic, and other things. As COP13 host, India will assume the role of COP Presidency for the next three years. “The spirit of ‘Athithi Devo Bhava’… will now resonate from Gandhinagar into the world: Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home!”, concluded Executive Secretary Fraenkel.

251-> UN deputy chief see first-hand toll of climate change on Zimbabwe’s natural habitat
Alongside the human population, Africa’s animals are suffering greatly from the effects of climate change, which United Nations Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed saw first-hand on Sunday in Zimbabwe. As global temperatures continue to rise and the world seeks solutions to stem the tide, the deputy UN chief visited Hwange National Park, which, at 14,651square kilometres, is almost half the size of Belgium. "We have seen what climate change is doing to our environment and livelihoods”, she said. “We saw how the park is hounded by climate change; the way in which Hwange is hot, the water, and even animal migration and people”. A privilege to visit ’s largest national park—its rich population of mammals & bird species are however being challenged by climate change. The Hwange team is taking action, including the introduction of solar pumped watering holes to counter climate-induced drought! With unreliable weather patterns resulting in less rainfall, Hillary Madhiri of the national parks and wildlife office said that more than 400 bird and 150 mammal species – 45,000 of them elephants – are suffering. Key issues include conflict between humans and wildlife, lack of water, loss of habitat, limited resources, population management and community partnerships to preserve the park. “It's quiet complex," the deputy UN chief observed. Mr. Madhiri maintained that of all the problems "climate change is our biggest challenge". He said that in spite of the park’s use of green technologies and sinking over 100 boreholes to save the animals from literally dying of thirst in the dry season, more still needs to be done. Ms. Mohammed commended the park's efforts to buffer nature against climate change. The Deputy Secretary-General is in Zimbabwe to attend the on sustainable development, which begins on Monday and runs in Victoria Falls until Thursday. Ms. Mohammed said she would participate in the discussion on the between the UN and the African Union. The focus will be on the elements needed to accelerate action on the ground for nations to achieve the goals of – Africa's master plan to transform the continent into a global powerhouse – and the – the blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet. "What a better place than Zimbabwe to show the kind of leadership that we would like to see in transforming Africa through the Agendas 2063 and2030," the UN deputy chief said.

252-> Warmer months ahead for many parts of the planet: UN weather agency
Many parts of the world can expect above average temperatures in the coming months even without the presence of an El Niño event to drive warming, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said on Monday. The UN agency published its latest on El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a naturally occurring phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific linked to heavy rains, floods, drought and other hazards. Above average temperatures are expected in many parts of the globe in the next few months, even without the presence of a warming , according to new WMO Update. Details  El Niño occurs due to fluctuations in the temperature of the ocean and atmosphere. While it has a warming influence on global temperatures, its opposite, known as La Niña, has the reverse effect. reported a 60 per cent chance of ongoing ENSO-neutral conditions through May, with prospects for an El Niño or La Niña at 35 per cent and five per cent, respectively. Above-average sea surface temperatures are likely across sizeable portions of the planet, with above-normal land temperature expected, particularly at tropical latitudes. Even ‘neutral months’ warmer The global warming trend also contributes to the above-average sea surface temperature and air temperature forecast, the agency added. “Even ENSO neutral months are warmer than in the past, as air and sea surface temperatures and ocean heat have increased due to climate change. With more than 90% of the energy trapped by greenhouse gases going into the ocean, ocean heat content is at record levels”, said WMO Secretary-General, Petteri Taalas. “Thus, 2016 was the warmest year on record as a result of a combination of a strong El Niño and human-induced global warming. 2019 was the second warmest year on record, even though there was no strong El Niño. We just had the warmest January on record. The signal from human-induced climate change is now as powerful as that from a major natural force of nature”, the weather agency chief added. WMO explained that El Niño and La Niña are not the only naturally occurring phenomena that drive global climate patterns. Others include the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), which has had a strong positive phase since last July but is now neutral. The “Indian El Niño”, as it also is known, was linked to drought that contributed to bush fires in Australia as well as above average rainfall in Eastern Africa, which is a major factor behind the current desert locust infestation devastating the region.

253-> Flagship UN study shows accelerating climate change on land, sea and in the atmosphere
A wide-ranging UN climate report, released on Tuesday, shows that climate change is having a major effect on all aspects of the environment, as well as on the health and wellbeing of the global population. The report, The Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, which is led by the UN weather agency (World Meteorological Organization), contains data from an extensive network of partners. It documents physical signs of climate change – such as increasing land and ocean heat, accelerating sea level rise and melting ice – and the knock-on effects on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security, and land and marine ecosystems. ‘Way off track’ to meet 1.5 degree target Writing in the foreword to the report, UN chief António Guterres warned that the world is currently “way off track meeting either the 1.5°C or 2°C targets that the calls for”, referring to the commitment made by the international community in 2015, to keep global average temperatures well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. A new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time.  Several heat records have been broken in recent years and decades: the report confirms that 2019 was the second warmest year on record, and 2010-2019 was the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850. The warmest year so far was 2016, but that could be topped soon, said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time”, added the WMO Secretary-General. In an interview with UN News, Mr. Taalas said that, there is a growing understanding across society, from the finance sector to young people, that climate change is the number one problem mankind is facing today, “so there are plenty of good signs that we have started moving in the right direction”. “Last year emissions dropped in developed countries, despite the growing economy, so we have been to show that you can detach economic growth from emission growth. The bad news is that, in the rest of the world, emissions grew last year. So, if we want to solve this problem we have to have all the countries on board”. Mr. Taalas added that countries still aren’t fulfilling commitments they made at the UN Paris climate conference in 2015, leaving the world currently on course for a four to five degree temperature increase by the end of this century: “there’s clearly a need for higher ambition levels if we’re serious about climate mitigation”. Australian wildfires spark global CO2 increase Mr. Taalas noted that 2020 has seen the warmest January recorded so far, and that winter has been “unseasonably mild” in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Ongoing warming in Antarctica saw large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier, with repercussions for sea level rise, and carbon dioxide emissions spiked following the devastating Australian bushfires, which spread smoke and pollutants around the world. Australia’s 2018-2019 summer was the hottest ever recorded, reaching a peak of 41.9 degrees centigrade on December 18. Australia's seven hottest days on record, and nine of the 10 hottest, occurred in 2019. The country was not the only place affected by extreme heat, or wildfires. Heat records were broken in several European countries, including France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Even Nordic countries saw record-breaking temperatures, including Finland, which registered a high of 33.2 degrees in the capital, Helsinki. Several high latitude regions, including Siberia and Alaska, saw high levels of fire activity, as did some parts of the Arctic, where it was previously extremely rare. Indonesia and neighbouring countries had their the most significant fire season since 2015, and total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010. The widespread impacts of ocean warming Greenhouse gas emissions continued to grow in 2019, leading to increased ocean heat, and such phenomena as rising sea levels, the altering of ocean currents, melting floating ice shelves, and dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. The ocean has seen increased acidification and deoxygenation, with negative impacts on marine life, and the wellbeing of people who depend on ocean ecosystems. At the poles, sea ice continues to decline, and glaciers shrunk yet again, for the 32nd consecutive year. Between 2002 and 2016, the Greenland ice sheet lost some 260 Gigatonnes of ice per year, with a peak loss of 458 Gigatonnes in 2011/12. The 2019 loss of 329 Gigatonnes, was well above average. Unprecedented floods and droughts In 2019, extreme weather events, some of which were unprecedented in scale, took place in many parts of the world. The monsoon season saw rainfall above the long-term average in India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar, and flooding led to the loss of some 2,200 lives in the region. Parts of South America were hit by floods in January, whilst Iran was badly affected in late March and early April. In the US, total economic losses from flooding were estimated at around $20 billion. Other regions suffered a severe lack of water. Australia has its driest year on record, and Southern Africa, Central America and parts of South America received abnormally low rains. 2019 also saw an above-average number of tropical cyclones, with 72 in the northern hemisphere, and 27 in the southern hemisphere. Some notably destructive cyclones were Idai, which caused widespread devastation in Mozambique and the east coast of Africa; Dorian, which hit the Bahamas and remained almost stationary for some 24 hours; and Hagibis, which caused severe flooding in Japan. The human cost The changing climate is exerting a toll on the health of the global population: the reports shows that in 2019, record high temperatures led to over 100 deaths in Japan, and 1,462 deaths in France. Dengue virus increased in 2019, due to higher temperatures, which have been making it easier for mosquitos to transmit the disease over several decades. Following years of steady decline, hunger is again on the rise, driven by a changing climate and extreme weather events: over 820 million people were affected by hunger in 2018. The countries in the Horn of Africa were particularly affected in 2019, where the population suffered from climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. The region suffered droughts, then unusually heavy rains towards the end of the year, which was a factor in the worst locust outbreak in the past 25 years. Worldwide, some 6.7 million people were displaced from their homes due to natural hazards – in particular storms and floods, such as the many devastating cyclones, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. The report forecasts an internal displacement figure of around 22 million people throughout the whole of 2019, up from 17.2 million in 2018. COP26: time to aim high “We have to aim high at the next climate conference in Glasgow in November”, said Mr. Guterres, speaking at the launch of the report at UN Headquarters in New York, on Tuesday, referring to the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), due to be held in the Scottish City in November. The UN chief called on all countries to demonstrate that emission cuts of 45 per cent from 2010 levels are possible this decade, and that net-zero emissions will be achieved by the middle of the century. Four priorities for COP26 were outlined by Mr. Guterres: more ambitious national climate plans that will keep global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels; strategies to reach net zero emissions by 2050; a comprehensive programme of support for climate adaptation and resilience; and financing for a sustainable, green economy. 'We will not fight climate change with a virus' The UN chief also addressed the ongoing spread of , in response to a question on its likely effect on the climate, given the resulting drop in economic activity and, consequently, emissions. Mr. Guterres firmly responded that "both require a determined response. Both must be defeated". Although emissions have been reduced, Mr. Guterres noted that "we will not fight climate change with a virus". In addition, he underlined the importance of not allowing the fight against the virus to distract from the need to defeat climate change, inequality and the many other problems the world is facing. Whilst the disease is expected to be temporary, climate change, added the Secretary-General, has been a phenomenon for many years, and and will  "remain with us for decades and require constant action".

254-> FROM THE FIELD: South Sudan's green shoots, highlight environmental recovery from war
Some 5,000 seedlings of trees indigenous to South Sudan are being distributed to schools, sports centres and other public meeting places by the UN peacekeeping mission in the country, UNMISS, as part of its commitment to countering climate change. Mango, lemon, guava, and teak trees were planted by school children in October at the Exodus Junior Academy in the capital, Juba. The headmaster of the school, Sokiri Ambamba George, said the trees will enhance his students’ understanding of the environment. Some of South Sudan’s natural habitat has been damaged during the 5-year long civil conflict there, but it’s hoped a commitment to peace by warring parties will enable the environment to recover as more tress are planted.  Those trees will help to reduce the harmful greenhouse gasses that are causing climate change.

255-> ‘Stay together and step up’ action to meet Global Goals, ECOSOC President tells development forum
We can realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 “if we all stay together and step up our actions”, Inga Rhonda King, President of the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ESOSOC), said on Thursday. “Even though the global picture is mixed”, she stated during the closing of the (HLPF), “we have made encouraging progress, sometimes despite political and other headwinds”. We aspire to realize the world we want in 2030. We understand the strategic importance of achieving the & halting . But to deliver, we need to move out of our comfort zones in pursuing new ways of collective action.   According to Ms. King, during the past two weeks, the chief global forum for reviewing successes, challenges and lessons learned on the road towards reaching the 17 SDGs, has mobilized and inspired action towards fulfilling the , and yet “we are currently not yet on track to achieve the SDGs by 2030”. “To deliver, we need to move out of our comfort zones in pursuing new ways of collective action”, she stressed, “and we need to adapt and transform at a much swifter pace”. The HLPF has heard how countries are pursuing the goals, including detailed plans from 47 seven nations who presented voluntary national reviews. “At a time of intense domestic pressures and significant challenges to multilateralism, their determination is an indication of the robust engagement and meaningful country ownership of the ”, the president underscored. Looking ahead, she pointed out that “we can expect that the SDGs will be more systematically incorporated in designing plans and policies, with a focus on interventions that have potential multiplier effects across the SDGs”. She also acknowledged the need to include SDG planning in national budgets as well as integrated financing strategies and to “enshrine them into our institutions and societies”. Empowerment, equality and inclusion The Forum also reviewed, analyzed progress and looked at the influence of, six individual SDGs in supporting empowerment, equality and inclusion. “You have heard from countries in special situations and delved into issues related to multidimensional poverty, inequality, education, prosperity, the planet, peaceful societies and international cooperation”, she said, adding that she will capture key messages and recommendations in her President’s summary. SDG goals under the spotlight: “The actions we projected will contribute to accelerating implementation”, Ms. King affirmed.  “They will help to enhance coherence and integration in our efforts at home and the world over”. ‘Ambitious decade of action’ Ms. King said it is “essential that we launch an ambitious decade of action that puts the world on a new trajectory for SDG achievement” to “kick-start a new phase of SDG implementation, with concerted, transformative action to end human suffering and protect our planet”. In September, she flagged that Member States and others can take the HLPF’s messages to the SDG Summit, Climate Action Summit and the high-level meetings on universal health coverage, financing for development and the SAMOA Pathway, an action strategy for Small Island Developing States. “Let us commit to take transformative actions between now and the 2020 summit on the UN anniversary”, she urged. She thanked all who contributed the Forum, especially the participants “for their unwavering commitment to ensure we deliver on the promises of the ”. “I look forward to seeing all of you tomorrow at the High-level Segment of , where we will have the opportunity to look out into the future and discuss visions and projections for the SDGs and as well as other related long-term trends and scenarios”, concluded Ms. King.

256-> Pedal power makes ‘positive impact on climate’, urges UN on World Bicycle Day
The simple, affordable, and environmentally friendly bicycle is not just a means of transportation, but also “a tool for development”, the United Nations said in a message on Monday commemorating World Bicycle Day. Taking to two wheels fosters “sustainable consumption and production”, and has a “positive impact on climate”, according to the UN. Moreover, biking enhances access to education, health care and sport; and the synergy between the bicycle and the cyclist raises a more intimate and immediate awareness of the local environment. Happy ! I am very honored to be here today w/ family & inspiring cycling advocates to celebrate the contributions of this humble machine to human health, social & economic mobility, road safety and !   According to the UN Environment Programme, even though the benefits of investing in pedestrians and cyclists can “save lives, help protect the environment and support poverty reduction”, the mobility needs of people who walk and cycle, mostly urban dwellers, “continue to be overlooked”. “The price paid for mobility is too high, especially because proven, low-cost and achievable solutions exist”, underscores ’s Share the Road Programme Annual Report 2018. “No-one should die walking or cycling to work or school”. The Programme continues to advocate for action, working with countries around the world to prioritize the needs of pedestrians and cyclists – a critical part of the mobility solution for helping cities break the link between population growth and increased emissions, and to improve air quality and road safety. According to the World Health Organization ( ), safe infrastructure for walking and cycling is also a pathway to greater health equity for the poorest urban dwellers, by providing transport “while reducing the risk of heart disease, stroke, certain cancers, diabetes, and even death”. A ‘crucial contribution’ UN Headquarters in New York marked the day with a special outdoor event, which General Assembly President María Fernanda Espinosa observed comes “at a crucial time” as there are only 11 years left “to avoid the worst impacts of climate change”. With 2030 marking the deadline for the (SDGs), she encouraged support for new technologies, adding that “we must also ensure we are harnessing existing tools, such as the bicycle”. “From reducing transport emissions and road deaths to tackling obesity and noncommunicable diseases, improving rural connectivity and empowering women and girls, bicycles can make a crucial contribution”, she stated. Noting that transport is the third-largest source of CO2, Ms. Espinosa cited studies showing that if just 10 per cent of city journeys were taken by bike, urban transport emissions would fall by 7 per cent. “It would also contribute to reducing air pollution – the theme for this year’s World Environment Day – helping to save the lives of some 7 million people a year”, she pointed out. “And I suspect there would be a significant boost – to the economy and to more peaceful societies - if people were not gridlocked in traffic.” “So, we must do more to integrate bicycles into urban and rural planning, infrastructure and design”, she urged. “And we must invest in education to promote the multiple benefits of cycling”. World Bicycle Day encourages: After speaking at the event, caught up with Phil Southerland, CEO and co-founder of Team Novo Nordisk, an American global all-diabetes sports team of cyclists, triathletes and runners. At just seven months old, Mr. Southerland was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Living in Tallahassee Florida, his parents were told that he would be dead or blind by age 25. Fortunately, at 12 years-old he discovered bicycling. While helping a friend in college to manage his own type 1 diabetes, Mr. Southerland realized the value of using the bike as a means to “show the world that exercise is the billion-dollar drug that never gets prescribed”. The athlete is living proof that “you can still chase your dreams with diabetes”.

257-> ‘Bicycle Kingdom’ makes a comeback, as China seeks solutions to tackle air pollution crisis
Cars have replaced bicycles as the primary means of transport in many Chinese cities but, with air pollution a major problem for the country, the bike is making a comeback, thanks to digital technology, and some 21st Century thinking. China was once considered to be the "Kingdom of the Bicycle,” with bikes dominating city streets across the country, but over the past four decades, China’s dramatic economic prosperity and urbanization has seen many people move to motor vehicles as their primary means of transport, contributing to a marked deterioration in air quality. In Hangzhou, a city in eastern China that was once described by the Italian explorer Marco Polo as “the finest and most splendid city in the world,” air pollution has had a devastating effect. According to backed by the World Health Organization ( ), Hangzhou’s air pollution is well over WHO’s safe level. However, in a bid to improve public health and the environment, the Hangzhou authorities have put a fresh emphasis on cycling, which, allied with digital technology, is helping to cut pollution: other cities are following their example. Over the past decade, the local government has been improving bike-friendly infrastructure, such as lanes and traffic signals created solely for cyclists, and has provided almost 86,000 public bikes. A smart card allows users to easily access all forms of public transport, from bikes to boats to buses. “All together there have been 760 million rides, that’s almost half the population of China,” says . “So far, more than 400 cities in China have adopted our project. Our dream is to promote our model across China and all over the world.” As a result of these initiatives, according to Tao, cycling has become a popular choice for both local citizens and tourists, and the efforts of the Government-run company have been rewarded with international recognition, including the International Ashden Award for Sustainable Travel in 2017. A mobile app that plants millions of trees As well as leading the Chinese cycling resurgence, Hangzhou is home to an innovative way to encourage more sustainable lifestyles, with an app that is helping to stop desertification, cut air pollution and plant millions of new trees. The “Ant Forest” mini-program, a Hangzhou-based project from giant Chinese payments and lifestyle app Alipay, incites users to make small, environmentally friendly decisions in their daily lives, such as cycling rather than driving to work, or recycling clothes. When users perform any carbon-reducing activities, they are rewarded with “green energy” points. As they accumulate enough virtual points, a real tree is planted. According to Ant Financial, more than 100 million trees have been planted, thanks to the low-carbon actions of 500 million individuals, roughly 5% of the world's population. Beijing’s fight to see through the haze Internationally, one of the best-known examples of harmful air pollution affecting quality of life in a city, is the Chinese capital, Beijing. Beijing’s remarkable development over the last two decades saw a significant, and visible, rise in air pollution, due to a combination of factors, including coal-related pollutants; the growth of motor transport, especially logistics freight trucks; heavy industry; and dust from buildings and roads, according to one of the main authors of a UN led report, . Fine particulates – tiny, invisible airborne particles – are largely responsible for deaths and illnesses from air pollution. The smallest, and deadliest, are called PM2.5 particles, which bypass the body’s defences and lodge in the lungs, bloodstream and brain. Business, public buildings and households account for around half of PM2.5 emissions. Today, fine particulate pollution in Beijing’s air is still 7.3 times the safe level the WHO’s annual safe level, but the local and regional governments have managed to improve the situation in recent years. By working together on a strategy to tackle the problem, by using the legal, economic and technological tools at its disposal, the concentration of fine particles in the air fell by one third, beating the target set by the State Council, China’s main administrative body. “Beijing has achieved impressive air quality improvements in a short amount of time,” said Dechen Tsering, Director of UN Environment’s Asia Pacific Regional Office. “It is a good example of how a large city in a developing country can balance environmental protection and economic growth,” she stressed. China is hosting the 2019 UN on June 05, with air pollution as the theme, The main events marking the day, will take place in Hangzhou.

The development follows ongoing conflict in and around the outskirts of Tripoli, instigated by the self-styled Libyan National Army forces of General Khalifa Haftar, who leads a parallel administration in the eastern city of Benghazi. UNHCR spokesperson Babar Baloch, descrived the situation at Zintan detention centre, south of Libya’s capital Tripoli, as follows: “Conditions in Zintan are dire… Toilets are overflowing and are in urgent need of repair. As a result, solid waste and garbage has piled up inside the cells for days and presents a serious health threat. Tensions amongst the detainees are rising as they become increasingly agitated and desperate. In total, 654 refugees and migrants remain held in Zintan.” On Tuesday, UNHCR reported that it had moved 96 people out of Zintan; they were from Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia, and included two newborns. WHO laments Ebola toll citing insecurity In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the World Health Organization has expressed frustration at insecurity challenges as the number of cases of Ebola virus disease has now passed 2,000. Since the beginning of the outbreak last August, more than 1,340 have died. The UN response has been hampered by attacks by armed groups, protests and demonstrations, including one in April that killed a medic, Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, in Butembo. WHO's spokesperson, Tarik Jasarevic, said: “This is another sad, frustrating milestone; the security is holding back the response…Every time there is an incident, whether some of them are major, some of them minor, some of them target Ebola responders, some of them don’t, but every time there is a security incident, we are not able to provide services and go into a community. We are not able to vaccinate, we are not able to treat those who are ill, we are not able to follow up on those who may have had access to the virus.” The development follows last week’s appointment of a UN Ebola response chief David Gressly, who is also deputy head of UN Stabilization Mission in the DRC, . Global efforts, women and girls…UN deputy chief highlights importance of UN values Continuing her trip to London, the UN Deputy Secretary-General, Amina J.

The values enshrined throughout the document must remain our benchmark and guide,” said Ms. Mohammed in her delivered at foreign affairs think-tank, Chatham House. Urging the world to move faster towards the 2030 , she noted that “without deep transformation, we risk catastrophic climate change; mass extinction of ecosystems and species; even higher levels of forced displacement; a major rollback of decades of development progress - and all of the political turmoil that accompanies social and economic disruption.” In another event on tackling inequality, she the importance of unlocking the power and potential of women and girls. “Gender equality is one of the critical social, economic and political priorities of our time. This should not be such a struggle.  After all, the benefits of gender equality are many and proven.” She urged countries to adopt “well-designed and targeted policies that enhance the opportunities of women to participate in economic activities and in political and public life” and added that “public spending on health, education and social protection should be increased to build the capacities that women and girls need to succeed in a technologically-driven 21st century.”

259-> Take action on air pollution to save lives, and the planet, urges UN chief
In a message to mark , celebrated on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres has emphasized the link between worsening levels of air pollution and the climate crisis. As well as claiming seven million lives every year, and damaging children’s development, the UN chief noted that many air pollutants cause global warming, which he has described as “an existential threat.” In his video address, the UN Secretary-General recalled his recent experience in the island states, which he visited last month to show solidarity with those suffering from the worst effects of climate change. Mr. Guterres said that he had seen first-hand the severe and worsening impacts of the global climate emergency. With the environment facing “unprecedented perils,” caused by human activity, the UN chief said that action to fight climate change is “the battle of our lives”, that we must win, by taxing pollution, ending fossil fuel subsidies, and halting the construction of new coal plants. China makes ‘significant strides’ to tackle poor air quality World Environment Day, widely celebrated in over 100 countries, is the United Nations day for encouraging international awareness and action to protect the environment. The theme for 2019 is air pollution, calling on governments, industry, communities and individuals to take action to explore renewable energy and green technologies, and improve the air quality in cities and regions across the world. Every World Environment Day has a different host country: this year's host is China, with the official celebration taking place in the eastern city of Hangzhou, in the presence of senior Chinese government officials and Joyce Msuya, Acting Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, ( ). Although the rapid development of many Chinese cities has led to poor air quality, and associated health problems for many citizens, the country has made in addressing the problem in recent years. In the Chinese capital, Beijing, which has become almost synonymous with air pollution, the concentration of fine particulates (the tiny, deadly elements largely responsible for deaths and illnesses) in the air, has fallen by a third over the past two decades, beating the target set by the State Council, China’s main administrative body. Speaking to UN News ahead of World Environment Day, Tiy Chung, Communications Officer for the Climate & Clean Air Coalition at , said that Beijing is “showing the way,” by taking the issue very seriously, and implementing strong policies. The city, he said, has taken a systematic approach based on good science, and coordinated successfully with surrounding cities and regions. Looking at other cities and countries, Mr. Chung is hopeful that the world is moving in the right direction. “We are getting at a mix of good policies and technologies.  Innovative low-emission technology is at the forefront of a new revolution driven by policies pushing for lower air pollution and de-carbonization of economy.” More information about the international events to mark World Environment Day can be found .

260-> FROM THE FIELD: Balancing Morocco’s indigenous culture and conservation
The delicate balance between indigenous farming practices and conservation in Morocco is under threat, but according to the UN, local communities in the Western High Atlas Mountains are finding ways to preserve traditions and still make a living from the land. The Amazighe, who live in the mountainous south of the country, have traditionally been able to conserve the unique biodiversity of the region and preserve their cultural heritage. However, climate change as well as the over-exploitation of medicinal plants – plus an exodus of young people - means their symbiotic relationship with the land may no longer be sustainable. The UN Development Programme (UNDP), with other partners, has supported the Amazighe to manage and protect the natural resources on which they rely. On celebrated on 5 June each year, , about how indigenous and local communities continue to coexist with the natural world.

261-> Taking fast road to ‘e-mobility’ central to a sustainable future: COP24
As the transportation sector continues to be a major culprit in the global rise in temperatures, the urgent need for clean solutions – in particular, powered by electricity or “e-mobility” – is being highlighted at the two-week in Katowice, Poland. The conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with the objective of adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the , when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2°C – and as close as possible to 1.5° – above pre-industrial levels. Transport emits a quarter of all greenhouse gases Globally, transport accounts for one quarter of total emissions – 8 gigatons per year, the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change ( ). This figure is 70 per cent higher than 30 years ago. It is estimated that over 1 billion passenger cars travel the streets and roads of the world today and, if we don’t take urgent action, by 2040, the number of cars on the road could double. The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity… But needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full – UN chief, António Guterres. “This is unsustainable, unacceptable and not compatible with the targets,” said José Mendes, Chairman of the Transport Decarbonization Alliance, a group of 20 countries, cities and companies committed to pushing for low-carbon transport. Planet and public health: protecting two birds with one stone When fossil fuels – oil, gas and coal – combust to power vehicles, that creates air pollution. This in turn causes health issues: according to a issued by the World Health Organization ( ) on Wednesday. Air pollution is now the fourth largest cause of death worldwide, with about seven million people dying each year from it.  “The true cost of climate change is felt in our hospitals and in our lungs,” said ’s Dr. Maria Neira, who the report to participants.  “The 2015 Paris climate agreement is really a public health agreement,” she told UN News in an interview. Electricity, yes, but only from renewable sources The first electric vehicles were produced and sold at the beginning of the 1900s and sales peaked in the early 1910s. But technological developments and the discovery of large oil reserves displaced the electric vehicle in favour of the combustion engine.  “Now, almost 100 years later, electric vehicles are coming back and need to increasingly displace the combustion engine in favour of reducing emissions and air pollution,” said UN , during a , held here at the conference in Katowice on Tuesday.  There is one major caveat, he warned the hundreds in attendance: “The growth in electric vehicles will have a significant impact on electricity demand – and this needs to be kept in mind,” he said, explaining that “if not managed carefully, the additional demand will create challenges across all sections of the energy system, particularly at peak times,” and that e-transport that is dependent on electricity made from fossil fuel combustion, could end up adding to the problem, not alleviating it.  To prevent this from happening, investments need to be made into creating electricity from renewable sources, not from fossil fuels, and ensuring a solid supply chain.  “The transition to e-mobility is clearly alive with opportunity,” said the Secretary-General. “But the transition needs to be carefully managed so that the world can yield all the potential benefits in full.” Smaller and bigger steps towards e-mobility “The growing awareness for clean air and climate change means that many governments around the world have begun embracing e-mobility,” said the UN chief during an event dedicated to electric transportation at COP24. “Many are putting in place the policy frameworks and infrastructure needed for sustainable transport. A growing number of countries and regions have announced plans to phase out fossil fuel vehicles and to shift to e-mobility,” he explained.  A recent report lists some of the ideas and commitments by countries and cities to hit the road towards e-mobility. These are just a few of them: •    The United Kingdom and France intend to ban all new sales of petrol or diesel vehicles after 2040; this is also being discussed in China. •    South Africa is targeting a 5 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 2050. •    The capital of Ecuador, Quito, is betting on electric bus fleets. •    South Korea’s Government plans to supply 1 million electric vehicles in the next two years. •    India is discussing the possibility of having 15 per cent of its cars to be electric by 2023.  At COP24, on Tuesday, various climate action stakeholders adopted a proposal by the United Kingdom and Poland named the , which the UN chief hailed as “an essential step towards a decarbonized transport system”, urging “all actors to support it”.  “If we get [electric mobility] right, then a decarbonized transport system will be part of the solution,” he stated.

262-> Zimbabwe: Droughts leave millions food insecure, UN food agency scales up assistance
Severe drought has rendered more than a third of rural households in Zimbabwe – or around 3.5 million people – dangerously food insecure, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) revealed on Friday. Citing the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee’s recently concluded Rural Livelihood Assessment, Spokesperson Herve Verhoosel, said that the situation was likely to last from now until September with a further deterioration into December that will widen the impact to more than 4.7 million people. Moreover, WFP said that the hunger period will peak at the height of the lean season, from January through March 2020, when 59 per cent of rural households, or over 5.5 million people, will be food insecure. “Given the scale and scope of the food insecurity in Zimbabwe”, Mr. Verhoosel said “WFP is planning to scale up to assist over two million people” by the peak of the lean season during early next year. Until then, teams will continue providing food assistance to the most vulnerable populations, while also helping communities to build resilience to climate change and future shock impacts. Over the next nine months, he said that WFP urgently requires $173 million to meet these needs. The Committee is a consortium of government, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations and other international organizations, and the Rural Livelihood Assessment provides key information for government and development partners on rural livelihood programming in southern African nation. WFP plays a key role in contributing financially and technically to the assessment. Cyclones, drought push Mozambicans deep into food insecurity And apart from the deadly cyclones that hit both Mozambique and Zimbabwe earlier in the year, Mozambique’s population has also suffered a rise in food insecurity, fueled by other extreme weather events, Mr. Verhoosel said. In January, tropical storm Desmond flooded the central provinces of Sofala, Tete and Zambézia. And in March, Cyclone Idai destroyed unharvested crops. Six weeks later, Cyclone Kenneth slammed the province of Cabo Delgado in the north. Since that time the area has been suffering through irregular rainfall patterns and cereal crops have been hit by pest infestations. Assistance aims to reach 1.2 million people – 900,000 of whom live in areas affected by Idai, 100,000 in areas affected by Kenneth and 250,000 people in areas affected by the drought. Mr. Verhoosel referenced a WFP report pointing out that “1.6 million people already face acute food crisis” in 63 districts. The most recent revision of the Integrated Classification of Food Security Phase, highlights the "difficult situation" the country of more than 29 million inhabitants faces, until its next harvest. While WFP had initially planned from July to October to help some 560,000 people each month in areas affected by cyclones and droughts, the rising need has sparked the agency to scale that number to 1.25 million beneficiaries per month. Based on current needs, including the response to drought and Cyclones Idai and Kenneth, WFP requires $102 million over the next six months to implement its recovery plan. To provide adequate and timely assistance, “resources must now be mobilized" in response to increased needs”, warned Mr. Verhoosel.

263-> Decade ending 2019 likely to be hottest on record
Exceptional global heat driven by greenhouse gas emissions mean this decade will most likely go down as the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization ( ) which released its on Tuesday. The agency also finds that 2019 is on track to be the second or third warmest year in history, with the global average temperature during January through October, roughly 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial era. The findings of ’s latest report are clear: Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent & more deadly. Our efforts so far have been inadequate. We need greater ambition from everyone now. “If we do not take urgent climate action now, then we are heading for a temperature increase of more than 3°C by the end of the century, with ever more harmful impacts on human wellbeing”, said Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “We are nowhere near on track to meet the target,” he added, referring to the 2015 international accord to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The report finds that concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, which hit record levels last year, also continued to rise in 2019. Additionally, sea level rise has increased due to melting of the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, while ocean heat is at record levels, with vital marine ecosystems being degraded. Several United Nations agencies provided input to the report, which also details how weather and climate have an impact on health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. Climate variability and extreme weather events are among key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger, which now affects more than 820 million people. “On a day-to-day basis, the impacts of climate change play out through extreme and “abnormal” weather. And, once again in 2019, weather and climate related risks hit hard”, said Mr Taalas. “Heatwaves and floods which used to be “once in a century” events are becoming more regular occurrences. Countries ranging from the Bahamas to Japan to Mozambique, suffered the effect of devastating tropical cyclones. Wildfires swept through the Arctic and Australia.” Record-setting temperatures are increasingly putting health at risk, according to input provided by the World Health Organization ( ).  Major heatwaves in Japan in late July to early August caused more than 100 deaths and some 18,000 hospitalizations, for example. About half the global population is now threatened by dengue as changes in climatic conditions are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit the dengue virus. Southern Africa has experienced extensive dry periods due to a delay in the start of the seasonal rains, the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) reports. As cereal output is forecasted to be around eight per cent below the five-year average, some 12.5 million people in the region will face food insecurity. Climate-related disasters are also increasing displacement.  Figures from the UN refugee agency, , reveal more than 10 million new internal displacements were recorded during the first half of the year, with seven million forced to move as a result of disasters such as cyclones and flooding. New displacements associated with weather extremes could more than triple, to around 22 million by the end of the year. The provisional report was released as governments meet in Madrid for the UN climate change negotiations, known as COP25. WMO will publish the final Statement on the State of the Climate, with complete 2019 data, in March.

264-> It’s time we took a seat ‘at your table’: Guterres calls on world youth to keep leading climate emergency response
Older generations have “failed to respond properly” to the climate emergency said the UN chief on Sunday, while the young are “stepping up to the challenge” and taking the lead to slow the destructive pace of global warming. was making the closing address at the UN-backed World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth, and Youth Forum, in the Portuguese capital Lisbon, Lisboa+21. You don't want to miss Day 2️⃣ at ! No matter where you are, join me today for the proclamation of Lisboa+21 Declaration. 🙌🏻 Here's how you can tune 📺  in 👉👉👉  The summit comes 21 years after the adoption of the Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes, and provides a place for national governments to talk about progress made with young people directly, and well as introducing new approaches to empowering youth in politics and decision-making. Building on an argument he has been making for some months now in the face of the existential threat posed by climate change, enshrined in the of 2015 to keep warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, the Secretary-General said that it’s “not enough to listen to young people and provide a seat at the table – we need to take a seat at your table”. Schoolchildren get it, more than global leaders Through the actions of inspiration young leaders such as Sweden’s Greta Thunberg who’s got classrooms striking for climate action across the world, Mr. Guterres said that “schoolchildren have grasped its urgency better than global leaders. They know the window of opportunity is closing; they are determined to beat this threat and they are making a big difference already.” The UN chief said Governments were listening, and “companies are starting to realise that a big carbon footprint is bad for their image, and even for their profits.” This is just the start, he added, saying that the energy and commitment of young people, such as the delegates in the audience in Lisbon, was making action a priority, “stepping up to the challenge.” “We need to create an enabling environment for young people, where they are seen not as subjects to be protected, but as citizens with equal rights, equal voices and equal influence, as full members of our societies and powerful agents for change.” He lauded the World Programme of Action for Youth, the focus of this weekend’s efforts in Portugal, saying that it was encouraging a wider focus on policy-making and programmes that are truly relevant to youth worldwide. “Policies on gender are particularly important since we cannot build strong, just and resilient communities and societies without the full participation and leadership of half of their members. Mr. Guterres told the hall he was hoping that many would be in New York in September, for not only the major Climate Action Summit, but also to help push along “more urgent and ambitious global action for implementation”. Value 'potential and promise' of youth: Wickramanayake With many senior UN attendees from multiple agencies, the UN chief’s , Jayathma Wickramanayake, spoke on behalf of the whole UN System, telling delegates that they represented “the largest-ever generation of young people” in human history, with 1.8 billion aged between 10 and 24. Around 90 per cent are in developing countries, noting that sustainable development could not be achieved, “unless we involve young people and create the conditions that allow them to reach their full potential.” “Young people should be valued for their potential and promise” she said, “not seen as a problem”. Addressing the ministers in the room, she said that when “implemented and adequately funded, robust youth policies can be instrumental in reducing inequality among young people and between youth and the broader community.” She said the , launched last year, was a holistic plan to “build the agency and advance the rights of young people and ensure their engagement” with the whole . She called on ministers and policy makers to work with the UN to deliver the youngest generations, a better future.

265-> World faces ‘climate apartheid’ risk, 120 more million in poverty: UN expert
Climate change “threatens to undo the last 50 years” of development, global health and poverty reduction, a United Nations expert said on Tuesday, citing the risk of a new era of “climate apartheid” where the rich buy their way out of rising heat and hunger. “Even if current targets are met, tens of millions will be impoverished, leading to widespread displacement and hunger,” said the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston. Underscoring that climate change will have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable, he added that “it could push more than 120 million more people into poverty by 2030 and will have the most severe impact in poor countries, regions, and the places poor people live and work.” My new report on and poverty is out today. It finds that climate change will have the greatest impact on those living in poverty, but also poses dire threats to democracy and human rights that most actors have barely begun to grapple with:  Even in the best-case scenario of a 1.5°C temperature increase by 2100, extreme temperatures in many regions will leave disadvantaged populations food insecure, with less incomes and worsening health. Moreover, many will have to choose between starvation and migration, he said. “Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves,” Mr. Alston flagged. “We risk a ‘climate apartheid’ scenario where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer.” Climate change carries immense implications for human rights, including to life, food, housing and water. It will also impact democracy said Mr. Alston, as governments struggle to cope with climate consequences and persuade constituents to accept the major social and economic transformations required – rendering civil and political rights vulnerable. “Most human rights bodies have barely begun to grapple with what climate change portends for human rights, and it remains one on a long laundry list of ‘issues’, despite the extraordinarily short time to avoid catastrophic consequences,” he asserted. “As a full-blown crisis that threatens the human rights of vast numbers of people bears down, the usual piecemeal, issue-by-issue human rights methodology is woefully insufficient”, the UN expert added. “States have marched past every scientific warning and threshold, and what was once considered catastrophic warming now seems like a best-case scenario,” Mr. Alston forecast. “Even today, too many countries are taking short-sighted steps in the wrong direction.” There is no shortage of alarm bells ringing over climate change –  States are even failing to meet their current carbon emissions reduction and climate financing commitments and continue to subsidize the fossil fuel industry with $5.2 trillion per year. “Maintaining the current course is a recipe for economic catastrophe,” Mr. Alston spelled out, noting that while economic prosperity and environmental sustainability are “fully compatible”, they require “decoupling economic well-being and poverty reduction from fossil fuel emissions.” This transition needs local policies to support displaced workers and ensure quality jobs. “A robust social safety net will be the best response to the unavoidable harms that climate change will bring,” Mr. Alston explained, saying that this “should be a catalyst” for states to fulfil “long ignored and overlooked economic and social rights”, including to social security and access to food, healthcare, shelter, and decent work. “If climate change is used to justify business-friendly policies and widespread privatization, exploitation of natural resources and global warming may be accelerated rather than prevented,” argued the UN expert. “There is no shortage of alarm bells ringing over climate change, and an increase in biblical-level extreme weather events appear to be finally piercing through the noise, misinformation, and complacency, but these positive signs are no reason for contentment,” Mr. Alston concluded. “A reckoning with the scale of the change that is needed is just the first step.”

266-> Amidst ‘high political tension’, UN chief appeals to G20 leaders for stronger commitment to climate action, economic cooperation
The annual G20 summit of leaders from the largest and fastest-growing economies, got underway on Friday in Osaka, Japan, against a backdrop of what UN Secretary-General António Guterres described as “a moment of high political tension”. “We have global warming, but we have also global political warming, and this can be seen in relation to trade and technology conflicts, it can be seen in relation to situations in several parts of the world, namely the Gulf”, he told reporters before addressing the summit, referring to recent around the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, which have heightened tensions between Iran and the United States. Turning to “uncertainties about the global economy”, he pointed to trade conflicts, high debt levels, potentially unstable financial markets and the risk of global growth slowdown. In the UN chief’s view, it “will be very difficult to have a breakthrough in relation to some of the most difficult challenges that the international community is facing”. ‘Rescue the planet’ The Secretary-General spotlighted the urgency of addressing as a main priority. Painting a picture of “heat waves in Europe, drought in Africa, storms happening also in Africa and the Caribbean” and a “multiplication” more intense, more frequent natural disasters “with worsening ” he repeated his passionate refrain that “climate change is running faster than what we are”. “All the analyses that can be made show the situation, in practical terms, is worse than what we could have forecasted, and the political will has been failing”, he said, calling it “a paradox that needs to be addressed”. Avowing his belief in climate science, Mr. Guterres cited the landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) report of last October, that by the end of the 21st Century, temperatures must not exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius  above pre-industrial levels. This necessitates the world reaching carbon neutrality by 2050, which requires more ambition by governments and others. He spoke about the UN’s September in New York where he will appeal to world leaders for a stronger commitment for climate action, including by “putting a price on carbon, ending subsidies to fossil fuels, [and] not accepting the idea that we still have an acceleration of the construction of coal power plants”, all of which are “absolutely essential to rescue the planet”. 2030 Agenda The is another main challenge where “we are lagging behind”, according to the UN chief. Countries need to do more, mobilizing their own internal resources, improving their governance, reducing corruption, implementing the rule of law --  “If we project the different (SDGs), the evolution since the beginning until now to 2030, we will be more or less at midway of what the international community has determined when the Agenda 2030 was approved”, he said, arguing the need to accelerate resource mobilization. “Countries need to do more, mobilizing their own internal resources, improving their governance, reducing corruption, implementing the rule of law”. Mr. Guterres highlighted that G20 nations represent 80 per cent of climate change emissions and appealed for a stronger commitment to international financial and economic cooperation. Iran, China, US and the digital economy After delivering his prepared text, the UN chief took questions on a variety of subjects, including rising tensions between the United States and Iran, where he reiterated his support for the ( ), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. “I have always believed and will go on believing that the JCPOA is a very important instrument…and it was a factor of stability, and that it will be very important to preserve it”, he stated. “Obviously, it is essential to de-escalate the situation in the Gulf” to avoid a confrontation that “the world couldn’t afford". When asked to what extent the UN chief held President Trump responsible for disagreements among the G20 leaders, he stressed the importance of dialogue between the presidents of China and the US, saying theirs was “probably the most relevant bilateral meeting that will take place”. On the digital economy, the UN chief spoke of the recently concluded on the digital cooperation, noting the “huge impact” that it – along with artificial intelligence – will have on the global economy. “We will see a massive destruction of jobs and the massive creation of jobs, but the jobs will be different,” he said, adding that there must be “a strong commitment” by countries to guarantee the education, social protection and job creation needed to “minimize the negative impacts” and “optimize the positive contributions of the fourth industrial revolution”.

267-> Friday’s Daily Brief: More climate action says Guterres, migrant children dangers, Ebola fight, record-setting weather
This Friday, we cover: UN chief appeals for stronger climate action commitment; report on migrant children deaths and disappearances; Ebola fight in DR Congo as violence goes on; and global over-heating. Amidst ‘high political tension’, UN chief appeals to G20 leaders for stronger commitment to climate action, economic cooperation The annual G20 summit of leaders from the largest and fastest-growing economies, got underway on Friday in Osaka, Japan, against a backdrop of what UN described as “a moment of high political tension”. “We have global warming, but we have also global political warming, and this can be seen in relation to trade and technology conflicts, it can be seen in relation to situations in several parts of the world, namely the Gulf”, he told reporters before addressing the summit, referring to recent around the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, which have heightened tensions between Iran and the United States. Find - One migrant child reported dead or missing every day, UN calls for more protection Around 1,600 children were reported dead or missing between 2014 and 2018 – an average of almost one every day – but many more go unrecorded, a new UN revealed on Friday. “Fatal Journeys 4”, from the International Organization for Migration’s Global Migration Data Analysis Centre ( ), in collaboration with the UN Children’s Fund, , highlights the need for better data on migrant deaths and disappearances, particularly for children; one of the most vulnerable groups of migrants. Read . Ebola fight ongoing, amid evidence of ‘several massacres’ in DR Congo The vital work of tracing people infected with deadly Ebola virus disease in north-east Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is progressing, despite evidence of “several” massacres in the affected area earlier this month, the UN said on Friday. In an update on the situation in Ituri and North Kivu provinces, nearly 11 months after the outbreak began, the World Health Organization ( ) reported 2,284 cases of infection so far, and 1,540 deaths. At the same time, the UN human rights office, , announced that a “robust” probe found that 117 people had been killed in “several massacres” involving multiple villages in gold-rich Ituri, between 10 and 13 June. Full . Earth set to experience its five warmest years on record While it’s perhaps no surprise to hear that the last five years may soon be announced as the warmest on record, UN experts have warned that higher concentrations of CO2 and other gases, will also fuel global over-heating for generations to come. The announcement by the World Meteorological Organization comes ahead of the Abu Dhabi Climate Meeting this weekend. Its objective is to take stock of progress made by countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and galvanize initiatives, in advance of September’s Climate Action Summit in New York, called by UN Secretary-General António Guterres. According to , global temperatures have risen to close to 1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial period, and time is running out to keep it to well under 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.

268-> Create conditions for ‘harmony between humankind and nature’, UN chief says on sidelines of G20 in Japan
The world needs to create conditions for “harmony between humankind and nature”, Secretary-General António Guterres said in Osaka, Japan, during a meeting on Saturday with the Foreign Ministers of China and France, on the margins of the G20 summit. “We need to rescue the planet” he spelled out. Mr. Guterres expressed his gratitude to both countries not only for their “climate action” but for their multilateral approach to climate change, which he said was “absolutely essential” to the success of the 2018 UN climate conference ( ) in Katowice, Poland, last December. However, he noted that the recently concluded UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) meeting in Bonn was not a success, saying that the realities on the ground today are “even more difficult” because of “political failing in some areas of the world”. “We need a boost in political will” asserted the UN chief. “I very much count on the determination of both China and France, both with the , both with climate action and with multilateralism, to allow for our capacity to overcome the present difficulties”. Looking ahead The Secretary-General spoke about the upcoming Climate Action Summit, which he is hosting in New York this September, “to raise ambition, to make sure that we are able to commit clearly to implement the decision that was taken in Paris for $100 billion per year” to boost the developing world’s capacity for mitigation and adaptation. At the same time, he hopes that the resources can be used to reform and replenish the , a mechanism he described as “essential for the finance of climate action”. We need a boost in political will --  Mr. Guterres informed the meeting that the UN Secretariat is “working very closely with the UNFCCC and [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], whose recent recent report he called  “a red alert”,  but also saw as  “a strong stimulus for action”. “We do believe that it's necessary to limit the growth of temperature at the end of the century to 1.5 degrees”, which “requires carbon neutrality midcentury…[and] an enhanced effort with the nationally determined contributions that will be reviewed in 2020” said the UN chief. Acknowledging “the difficulties and the problems each country has”, he expressed his gratitude to both France and China for their determination, “to increase, ambition and to make sure that the political will of the international community, in a multilateral way, will match the enormous challenge that we are facing”. “I very much count on the determination of your two countries to make sure that the Summit is a success, that the review of the nationally determined contributions will be a success, and that others that are more reluctant, that are more problematic, in the end will feel that they are involved”, concluded the Secretary-General.

269-> Keeping cool in the face of climate change
As global temperatures reach record highs, providing cooling systems which are effective, sustainable and which do not harm the environment is increasingly essential for everyday life. That’s according to Rachel Kyte, Chief Executive Officer of Sustainable Energy for All, and Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL). From the cold chain systems that maintain uninterrupted refrigeration during the  delivery of food and vaccines, to protection from extreme heat waves globally – access to cooling is a fundamental issue of equity, and as temperatures hit record levels, for some, it can mean the difference between life and death. UN News asked Rachel Kyte why she is so passionate about cooling. What is sustainable cooling? Cooling is essential to human health and prosperity. As the world rapidly urbanizes, warms and populations grow, cooling is an urgent development challenge that has important ramifications for our climate. It requires fast action to protect the most vulnerable, and is vital for economic productivity by allowing workers, farmers and students to work in comfortable environments. Yet as cooling needs rise, we must meet these challenges in an energy-efficient way, or the risks to life, health and the planet will be significant. At the same time, they provide equally important business opportunities for companies or entrepreneurs who can design and produce hyper-efficient cooling devices at affordable prices for this rapidly growing market. Why is this such an important issue? SEforALL’s “Chilling Prospects: Providing Sustainable Cooling for All” report shows there are more than 1.1 billion people globally who face immediate risks from lack of access to cooling.  These risks are issues of both development and climate change, as they pose problems for the health, safety, and productivity of populations across the world – especially countries in Asia and Africa where access gaps are the largest. This challenge offers business and entrepreneurs the opportunity of major new consumer markets which require super-efficient, affordable technologies to meet their cooling needs. How does cooling relate to the global goals? Sustainable cooling creates a direct intersection between three internationally agreed goals: the ; the ; and the Montreal Protocol’s Kigali Amendment – with one of the key goals of the amendment to limit consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a potent greenhouse gas used widely in air conditioners and refrigerators. As all countries have agreed to these goals, creating a national, hyper-efficient cooling plan that doesn’t risk a rise in emissions or peak energy demand will be critical to deliver sustainable cooling for all and meet global goals. A clean energy transition is already underway globally that can provide affordable, safe and sustainable energy for all. We must now incorporate cooling for all needs within this transition, while keeping us on track to reach our global climate and energy goals. Where in the world do people find it most difficult to access cooling? Based on the “Chilling Prospects” analysis, of the 1.1 billion people who lack access globally, 470 million people are in poor rural areas without access to safe food and medicines, and 630 million people are in hotter, urban slums with little or no cooling to protect them against extreme heatwaves. Nine countries have the biggest populations facing significant cooling risks. These countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America include: India, Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, Nigeria, Indonesia, China, Mozambique and Sudan.  With global temperatures only set to rise, providing these populations with access to sustainable cooling will be critical to ensuring their safety. To what extent does cooling contribute to global warming - especially in developed countries where air conditioning machines are widely used to cool high summer temperatures? It is estimated that cooling is now responsible for about 10% of global warming and growing rapidly. Future choices about refrigerants, the efficiency of cooling technologies, and how cooling is powered will have a significant impact on achieving the Paris Climate Agreement. Previous research indicates that by 2050, work hour losses by country due to excessive heat and lack of access to cooling are expected to be more than 2% and a high as 12%. With the destructive effects of climate change now being widely felt, government policy-makers, business leaders, investors and civil society must increase access to sustainable cooling solutions for all through benchmarking progress, access to cooling initiatives to protect the world’s most vulnerable populations from intensifying global heat and national cooling plans from government.

270-> 'Act now with ambition and urgency' to tackle the world’s ‘grave climate emergency’, UN chief urges UAE meeting
The world is facing “a grave climate emergency”, Secretary-General António Guterres told a climate meeting in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) capital of Abu Dhabi on Sunday, urging all participants to “seize this opportunity to take bold climate action”. “Climate disruption is happening now, and it is happening to all of us”, he warned. “It is progressing even faster than the world’s top scientists have predicted”. The UN chief lamented that it is “outpacing our efforts to address it” with each week bringing “new climate-related devastation” from floods, droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and superstorms. The increasing urgency posed by is in focus at a ministerial-level meeting in today and Monday, chaired by and intended to galvanize initiatives for September’s Summit  Because of climate change, “all around the world, people are losing their homes and being forced to migrate”, he informed the meeting, adding that the situation “will only get worse unless we act now with ambition and urgency”. Just last week, reports surfaced that “Himalayan glaciers are melting at double the rate since the turn of this century”, threatening water supplies throughout Central, South and East Asia, according to Mr. Guterres. Moreover, he pointed out that “Arctic permafrost is melting decades earlier than even worst-case scenarios”, threatening to unlock vast amounts of the powerful greenhouse gas methane. “It is plain to me that we have no time to lose,” Mr. Guterres said.  “Sadly, it is not yet plain to all the decision makers that run our world.” Even more worrying, he continued, “is that many countries are not even keeping pace with their promises under the .” Keeping global warming to 1.5 degrees at the end of the century will require “rapid and far-reaching transitions” in how we manage land, energy, industry, buildings, transport and cities, he stressed. “That is why I am convening the Climate Action Summit in September.” The Abu Dhabi meeting, which is in preparation for the September Summit, aims to take stock of progress across all the areas that the Summit is looking to promote, from industrial transition to nature-based solutions to climate finance for both mitigation and adaptation. Climate disruption is happening now, and it is happening to all of us --  “The Climate Action Summit is an opportunity for political, business and civil society leaders to set an example”, flagged the UN chief, “and here in Abu Dhabi, we are pointing the right direction”. “Our Summit must be open, inclusive and honest, and the work we take forward must be effective, just and fair – for those on the frontlines of the crisis today and especially for the generations to come”, the Secretary-General concluded. Thani Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment said: “We are here today, in a region known for its hydrocarbon economy … and yet, through forward-thinking policies, we have now made solar the cheapest source of power.”

271-> Heat stress spike predicted to cost global economy $2.4 trillion a year
An increase in heat stress at work linked to climate change is set to have a massive impact on global productivity and economic losses, notably in agriculture and construction, UN labour experts said on Monday. Highlighting that the world’s poorest countries will be worst affected, particularly in West Africa and South-East Asia, the International Labour Organization ( ) warned that the lost output will be equivalent to 80 million full-time jobs – or 2.2 per cent of total working hours worldwide - during 2030. The total cost of these losses will be $2.4 trillion every year, ILO’s Working On A Warmer Planet report maintains, based on a global temperature rise of only 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this century. “The impact of heat stress on labour productivity is a serious consequence of climate change,” said Catherine Saget, Chief of Unit in the ILO’s Research department and one of the main authors of the report “We can expect to see more inequality between low and high-income countries and worsening working conditions for the most vulnerable.” In the ILO report, heat stress is defined as generally occurring at above 35 degrees Celsius, in places where there is high humidity. Our latest report shows that 80 million jobs could be lost as a result of heat stress caused by global warming. Here's what you need to know. Excess heat at work is an occupational health risk and in extreme cases can lead to heatstroke, which can be fatal, the UN agency explains. With some 940 million people active in agriculture around the world, farmers are set to be worst hit by rising temperatures, according to the ILO data, which indicates that the sector will be responsible for 60 per cent of global working hours lost from heat stress, by 2030. Construction will also be “severely impacted”, with an estimated 19 per cent of global working hours lost at the end of the next decade, ILO says. Other at-risk sectors include refuse collection, emergency services, transport, tourism and sports, with southern Asian and western African States suffering the biggest productivity losses, equivalent to approximately five per cent of working hours by 2030. “The impact of heat stress on labour productivity is a serious consequence of climate change, which adds to other adverse impacts such as changing rain patterns, raising sea levels and loss of biodiversity,” Ms. Saget explained. Underlining how communities in the world’s poorest regions will suffer the most significant economic losses because they often lack the resources to adapt to increased heat, the ILO official insisted that this would lead to “more inequality between low and high-income countries and worsening working conditions for the most vulnerable, as well as displacement of people”. The economic losses of heat stress will therefore reinforce already existing economic disadvantage, in particular the higher rates of working poverty, informal and vulnerable employment, subsistence agriculture, and a lack of social protection, Ms. Saget added. To adapt to this new reality, ILO is calling for urgent measures by Governments, employers and workers, focusing on protecting the most vulnerable. These include adequate infrastructure and improved early warning systems for extreme weather events, and improved implementation of international labour standards in occupational safety and health to help tackle heat-related hazards.

272-> With Caribbean island life under threat, UN chief pushes to face ‘headwinds together’
To counter global challenges that are a particular threat to vulnerable island nations like those in the Caribbean, it’s vital to “face the headwinds together”, especially in the face of the destruction being wrought by climate change, the the annual Caribbean Community (CARICOM) conference in Saint Lucia on Wednesday. “The beauty of St. Lucia and the uniqueness of the voice and way of life of each of the Caribbean islands is threatened”, said on Wednesday at the Conference of Heads of CARICOM Governments gathered to focus on obstacles to sustainable development. Busy first day at opening day. Mr. Guterres recounted his visit to the South Pacific in May where he saw how “Pacific island nations are addressing the climate crisis” by focusing “a climate lens” on development investments. He also recalled his visit two years after Hurricanes Irma and Maria wreaked havoc in 2017, when “in only a couple of days”, years of “hard-won development gains” were destroyed in Barbuda and Dominica. “Hurricanes Ivan and Thomas – and the many others that came before Irma and Maria – are still etched in the memories of Caribbean people” he noted. As climate-related natural disasters grow in frequency and severity, the UN chief pointed out that “the risks to families and to development overall will only intensify”. What the Caribbean has endured makes “abundantly clear” the urgent need to “reduce global emissions and work collectively to ensure that global temperature rise does not go beyond 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels”, he continued, inviting government and private sector leaders to come with concrete plans to the UN Climate Action Summit in September, at UN Headquarters, which could result in a 45 per cent cut in greenhouse emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. “We must massively increase our ambition to advance low-emission and resilient development, including addressing loss and damage from climate impacts”, he stressed, saying “we need all hands-on deck”. We must massively increase our ambition to advance low-emission and resilient development --  ‘Act daily’ to counter plastic threat Mr. Guterres signalled the need to “act on a daily basis” to counter the “grave threat” that eight million tons of ocean-polluting plastics are posing to marine ecosystems and tourism sectors. “From plastic pollution to coastline erosion, more frequent extreme weather events, sea level rise and biodiversity loss, Caribbean States face immense pressure”, maintained the UN chief. He commended the “bold vision” of CARICOM leaders, to make the Caribbean the world’s first Climate Resilient Zone and drew attention to the creation of a Caribbean Resilience to Recovery Facility. When completed, it aims to provide a regional indigenous mechanism to source talent, experience and financial solutions for the region, to build resilient communities and nations. Economic constraints In addition to managing the recurrent and increasing costs of climate-related events, small island developing States (SIDS) overall, face a range of economic constrictions, from small domestic markets to heavy dependence on imports and high national debt constraints, according to the UN chief. “These challenges are further complicated by the difficulties SIDS face in mobilizing development finance on affordable and appropriate terms”, he said. The Secretary-General said he backed steps to improve access to development financing; eligibility for Official Development Assistance, including vulnerability criteria in addition to Gross National Income per capita; and speed and predictability of climate financing, especially SIDS. Mr. Guterres threw his “strong support” behind the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean’s (ECLAC) proposal to convert debt to investment in resilience, noting that “to achieve this and other global challenges, we must reaffirm commitment to multilateralism”. “We must face the headwinds together”, the Secretary-General underscored, “There is no alternative to cooperation and collaboration”. UN Summits in September •  Finance Summit to take stock of implementing the Addis Ababa Action Plan on financing for sustainable development. •  Mid-term review of the so-called SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action Pathway. •  High-level meeting on Universal Health Coverage. •  Climate Action Summit. He urged the leaders to “seize this historic opportunity to ensure that every Caribbean country, and all SIDS, receive optimal support to achieve the ”. The UN chief drew attention to five UN Summits in September where the “collective voices” of the Caribbean Sates can “be heard by the global community”. Moving forward In closing, he thanked CARICOM for its “strong cooperation” with the UN, welcomed the Counter-Terrorism Strategy for the region, developed with the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism, and recognized its leadership on key UN priorities, “not least climate change and financing for development”. Mr. Guterres commended Caribbean nations’ commitment to foster regional cooperation on fighting illegal drug trafficking and saluted their response efforts to the refugee and migration crisis in the wider region “as a result of the situation in Venezuela”. “Let us cooperate ever more closely in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people of the Caribbean”, concluded the Secretary-General.

273-> Key COP26 climate summit postponed to ‘safeguard lives’
With no end in sight to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the UN climate change talks which were due to take place in Scotland later in the year, have been postponed until next year. The decision was announced on Wednesday night by the advisory group to the COP26 talks, overseen by the UN climate change body, the , after talks involving the United Kingdom and other countries. has been postponed due to . This decision has been taken jointly by the COP Bureau of the with the UK and partners Italy. Tackling climate change remains a key priority for the UK and the international community.  UNFCCC said the postponement would better enable all parties to focus on important climate issues while allowing more preparation time. “The world is currently facing an unprecedented global challenge and countries are rightly focusing their efforts on saving lives and fighting ”, COP26 President-Designate and the UK’s Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma. UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, underscored that while COVID-19 is “the most urgent threat facing humanity today…we cannot forget that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity over the long term”. She said that when economies restart, it will provide a chance for nations to “recover better, to include the most vulnerable in those plans, and a chance to shape the 21st century economy in ways that are clean, green, healthy, just, safe and more resilient”. The President of the last COP, which ended up taking place in Spain, Chilean politician Carolina Schmidt, said the Bureau’s decision to postpone COP26 was “a needed measure to protect all delegates and observers”. “Our determination is to make sure that the momentum for climate ambition will continue”, she concluded. 'Foremost priority' “The need to suppress the virus and safeguard lives is our foremost priority”, UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said in a issued shortly after the announcement, on behalf of . Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  The Secretary-General maintained that efforts to increase ambition and action on climate change must continue, “especially as countries take measures to recover from this crisis”. The science on climate has not changed, he said, with emissions at a record high while global warming impacts compound the socio-economic challenges that this crisis will intensify. The UN chief stressed that “the COVID-19 crisis reinforces the importance of science and evidence informing government policies and decision-making”. The science makes clear that human behaviour is altering the planet’s ability to regulate itself, dramatically impacting lives and livelihoods. “This dramatic human crisis is also an example of how vulnerable countries, societies and economies are to existential threats”, he observed, adding that “countries must work to protect the health of people and the planet has never been more at risk.” Assuring the continuance of work involving UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Member States and other partners to “emerge from this global crisis stronger”, the statement closed with the assertion that “solidarity and greater ambition are needed now more than ever” to transition to a “sustainable, low carbon economy that limits global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius”.

274-> First Person: COVID-19 is not a silver lining for the climate, says UN Environment chief
Greenhouse gas emissions are down and air quality has gone up, as governments react to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the head of the UN Environment Programme ( ), Inger Andersen, has cautioned against viewing this as a boon for the environment. In this First Person editorial, Ms. Andersen calls instead for a profound, systemic shift to a more sustainable economy that works for both people and the planet. “The global pandemic, which has already caused unimaginable devastation and hardship, has brought our way of life to an almost complete halt. The outbreak will have profound and lasting economic and social consequences in every corner of the globe. In the face of such turmoil, as the Secretary-General has indicated, will require a response like none before – a “war-time” plan in times of human crisis. And as we inch from a “war-time” response to “building back better”, we need to take on board the environmental signals and what they mean for our future and wellbeing, because COVID-19 is by no means a “silver lining” for the environment. Visible, positive impacts – whether through improved air quality or reduced greenhouse gas emissions – are but temporary, because they come on the back of tragic economic slowdown and human distress. Visible, positive impacts are but temporary, because they come on the back of tragic economic slowdown and human distress  The pandemic will also result in an increase in the amounts of medical and hazardous waste generated. This is no one’s model of environmental response, least of all an environmentalist’s. And indeed, the Scripps Institute of Oceanography has highlighted that fossil fuel use would have to decline by about 10 percent around the world, and would need to be sustained for a year to show up clearly in carbon dioxide levels. A healthy planet means fewer diseases Any positive environmental impact in the wake of this abhorrent pandemic, must therefore be in our changing our production and consumption habits towards cleaner and greener. Because only long-term systemic shifts will change the trajectory of CO2 levels in the atmosphere. So, in the aftermath of the crisis, when economic stimulus packages composed of infrastructure are designed, there is a real opportunity to meet that demand with green packages of renewable energy investments, smart buildings, green and public transport, etc. With respect to the disease itself, part of the challenge ahead is understanding where such diseases come from, because the health of our planet plays an important role in the spread of , i.e. disease originating from pathogens that transfer from animals to humans. As we continue to encroach on fragile ecological ecosystems, we bring humans into ever-greater contact with wildlife. Further, illegal wildlife trade and illegal wet markets are not infrequent causes of such diseases. Around 75 per cent of new and infectious diseases are zoonotic and, in fact, about occur every year from these diseases. The wild must be kept wild Humanity’s expansion on the terrestrial earth surface means that, today, human activity has altered almost 75 per cent of the earth’s surface, squeezing wildlife and nature into an ever-smaller corner of the planet. And yet, nature is critical to our own survival: nature provides us with our oxygen, regulates our weather patterns, pollinates our crops, produces our food, feed and fibre, but it is under increasing stress. Changes in temperature, humidity & seasonality directly affect the survival of microbes in the environment; & evidence suggests that disease epidemics will become more frequent, as the climate continues to change. Learn about zoonosis emergence:   As we continue our relentless move into natural habitats, contact between humans and reservoir hosts increases, whether as a result of urbanization, habitat loss and fragmentation, or live animal markets – all of which increases the likelihood of interaction between these vectors and humans. According to IPBES, we have seen 100 million hectares of agricultural expansion in the tropics between 1980 and 2000, roughly equal to the size of France and Germany combined. The “wild” must be kept “wild.” It is time to restore our forests, stop deforestation, invest in the management of protected areas, and propel markets for deforestation-free products. Where the legal wildlife trade chain exists, we need to do a far better job of improving hygiene conditions. And of course, there is the urgent need to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, the fourth most common crime committed worldwide. Building a ‘different economy’ The better we manage nature, the better we manage human health. This is why the post-2020 biodiversity framework that countries around the world are expected to agree on this year matters greatly. An important pillar in our post-COVID recovery plan must be to arrive at an ambitious, measurable and inclusive framework, because keeping nature rich, diverse and flourishing is part and parcel of our life’s support system. Even more important when you consider that between of pharmaceutical products are derived from genetic resources. And as the engines of growth begin to rev up again, we need to see how prudent management of nature can be part of this “different economy” that must emerge, one where finance and actions fuel green jobs, green growth and a different way of life, because the health of people and the health of planet are one and the same, and both can thrive in equal measure."

The agency says that safeguarding the area, which is the size of Germany, will “encourage sustainable development” by promoting high-end tourism - once the industry can start to recover from - on land and sea, and by managing marine resources including fishing rights, and will contribute to what is known as the blue economy.

276-> Guterres vows support for island States in twin fight against COVID-19, climate crisis
In an era of new challenges wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, António Guterres is pledging the UN’s continued support to small island States – longtime leaders in the global fight against the devastating impacts of climate change. “Currently, all eyes are on the pandemic, the biggest test the world has faced since the Second World War”, said the UN Chief in a to the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) Ambition Forum in Placencia, Belize, on Monday.  “We must work together to save lives, ease suffering, lessen the shattering economic and social consequences and bring the disease under control.” While we tackle , we cannot postpone because the climate crisis is not on hold. By building back better from the pandemic, we will be able to secure a more sustainable and resilient future. However, he emphasized that the struggle to rein in climate change – in particular, to keep global temperature rise below the 2015 target of 1.5 degrees Celsius – has only become more acute amid the pandemic. Meanwhile, countries struggling with the most severe effects of the climate crisis now find themselves grappling with sharply contracting economies and unsustainable debt levels. Spotlighting the path of destruction left by in the Pacific in recent days, he urged Governments and their partners not to shift their focus away from climate change, warning that such events will only become more regular and deadly without decisive action. Climate crisis slower, deadlier, than coronavirus “The social and economic devastation caused by climate disruption will be many times greater than the current pandemic”, he stressed, adding: “Now is not the time for retreat.” Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  He said the COVID-19 pandemic – which is resulting in major economic and political shifts around the globe – gave the international community a unique window of opportunity in which recovery plans can be instrumental in creating a more sustainable and resilient future. Calling for ambitious climate mitigation, adaptation and financing aimed at “building back better”, he said the voices of small island States – traditional warriors at the forefront of climate advocacy – are needed now more than ever. “By coming forward this year with enhanced nationally determined contributions and strategies to reach net zero emissions, you will once again lead the way for others to follow,” he said, noting that the UN will remain a strong ally. “It is essential that you are supported in your efforts.”

277-> COVID-19 pandemic, an ‘unprecedented wake-up call’ for all inhabitants of Mother Earth
In for International this Wednesday, UN Secretary-General acknowledged that all eyes are on the COVID-19 pandemic, which he flagged as “an unprecedented wake-up call” Recognizing the “immediate and dreadful” impact of the , the UN chief urged everyone to “work together to save lives, ease suffering and lessen the shattering economic and social consequence”. At the same time, he observed that climate disruption is approaching “a point of no return”, and a “deep emergency” that long predates the pandemic. “Greenhouse gases, just like viruses, do not respect national boundaries”, stated the top UN official. “We must act decisively to protect our planet from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption”. 6 ways to act now, to help the climate Emphasizing the need to turn the recovery into “a real opportunity to do things right for the future”, he proposed climate-related actions to shape the recovery. While spending huge amounts of money to bring economies back, Mr. Guterres asserted, “we must deliver new jobs and businesses through a clean, green transition”. And where taxpayers’ money is used to rescue businesses, he maintained that it needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth. He also underscored that to make societies more resilient, “fiscal firepower must drive a shift from the grey to green economy”. The UN chief maintained that Fossil fuel subsidies must end, polluters must pay for their contamination and public funds should be invested in sustainable sectors along with pro-environment and climate projects. Moreover, climate risks and opportunities must be incorporated into financial systems, public policy making and infrastructure. Finally, he stressed the “we need to work together as an international community”. “On this Earth Day, please join me in demanding a healthy and resilient future for people and planet alike”, he concluded. Harmony with nature Meanwhile, General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande reaffirmed the UN’s commitment to promote harmony with nature for a “just, sustainable and prosperous society”. In his message, he conceded that the loss, suffering, and unprecedented challenges created by has affected “everyone’s daily lives” and awoken us to the fact that “solidarity is our best and first line of defence”. “Our experience with COVID-19 demonstrates that we, humanity, are not separate from the world around us”, said the Assembly President. “In this Decade of Action and Delivery to implement the (SDGs)…we must work together to protect our planet and ecosystems, which affect every aspect of human life”. He underscored the importance of prioritizing the sustainable use of planetary resources when pursuing industrial growth, notably in food production and agriculture; and to protect biodiversity in climate action efforts, industrial practices and urban expansion. “We will only preserve Mother Earth through a paradigm shift from a human-centric society to an Earth-centred global ecosystem”, he spelled out. Calling education “critical” to safeguarding our planet, Mr. Muhammad-Bande maintained that everyone has something to teach and something to learn, and by working together the world could implement the SDGs in harmony with nature. “I call on all Member States to reaffirm our commitments to protect Mother Earth, in particular the ”, he concluded. Earth Day ‘more important than ever’: UN environment chief This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Earth Day, and also five years since the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2015, providing a “stark reminder of the vulnerability of humans and the planet in the face of global scale threats”, according to the UN environment agency, . The more we are putting pressure on nature, the more it is impacting us  In a video released to commemorate the Day, UNEP chief, Inger Andersen, said that ‘the more we are putting pressure on nature, the more that is then impacting us”. We have altered and impacted about 75 per cent of the surface of planet Earth”, she added, a process which has “led us to where we are today. Healthy people and a healthy planet is part and parcel of the same continuum. Climate change could cause an even greater danger. A three to four degree warmer world is something we can’t even begin to imagine”. UNEP’s message is that, as the international community works through potential solutions to the current health crisis, the post-pandemic recovery plan should be seen as an opportunity to “build back better”, with a focus on “green jobs” in a more sustainable economy.

278-> A record number of people will need help worldwide during 2020: UN Humanitarian Overview
A record 168 million people worldwide will need help and protection in crises spanning more than 50 countries in 2020, the UN’s emergency relief chief has , in an appeal for nearly $29 billion in humanitarian aid from donors. Climatic shocks, large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying, protracted conflicts, have resulted in global needs increasing by some 22 million people in the past year, told journalists in Geneva, at the launch of the UN humanitarian affairs coordination office’s ( ) Global . “In 2020, nearly 168 million people worldwide will need humanitarian assistance and protection,” he said. “That represents about one person in 45 on the planet. It is the highest figure in decades.” On current trends, our projections show that more than 200 million people could be in need of assistance by 2022 –  Another disturbing trend is that armed conflicts “are killing and maiming a record number of children”, Mr. Lowcock explained. “More than 12,000 in fact were killed or maimed in conflict in 2018, and 2019 has been worse.” In addition, women and girls were at higher risk of sexual and gender-based violence than in the past, and one in five people living in conflict areas has a mental health condition, he said. In a call to donors, the UN relief chief said that the UN and partner organisations including the Red Cross and other non-governmental organisations “will be aiming to assist 109 million of the most vulnerable people”. More communities had been affected by conflict and yet more “were affected by climate change-related events than we had projected”, Mr. Lowcock insisted, in reference to more frequent drought, flooding and tropical cyclones that tend to disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable. In 2020, nearly 168 million people in 53 countries will need humanitarian aid and protection. The and our partners aim to assist nearly 109 million of the most vulnerable.  “Thirteen of the 20 countries most vulnerable to climate change are places in which we have an inter-agency appeal,” he noted. In terms of sheer scale, Yemen “is still going to be the world’s worst humanitarian crisis” in 2020 after nearly five years of war, the UN official maintained. “The number of people in need is expected to remain close to this year’s levels, that’s around 24 million people, 80 per cent of the population.” Detailed in the Global Humanitarian Overview 2020, the appeal for Yemen is $3.2 billion. Funding is also needed for a multitude of other protracted conflicts, including Afghanistan ($732 million for 9.4 million people), Burundi ($104 million for 1.7 million people), Iraq ($520 million for 4.1 million people), Syria ($3.3 billion for 11 million people) and the Central African Republic ($388 million for 2.6 million people), among others. To illustrate a growing disregard by combatants for international humanitarian law, Mr. Lowcock highlighted nearly 800 attacks against healthworkers and healthcare facilities in the first nine months of 2019, which claimed 171 lives. The unexpected scale of infectious disease outbreaks has also helped drive needs to unprecedented levels. “In Africa, in the first three months of this year, there were 700 per cent more measles cases than in the same period last year”, Mr. Lowcock said, a likely reference to the more than 5,000 measles fatalities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since January. Turning to Venezuela, where the funding requirement is $1.35 billion for 3.8 million people in 2020, needs are “substantially outstripping resources”, the UN official said. A “substantial increase in humanitarian assistance for Venezuelans” was needed for those inside their country” and an approximate doubling of assistance for those who’ve left the country, Mr. Lowcock insisted. “On current trends, our projections show that more than 200 million people could be in need of assistance by 2022,” he added. UNICEF appealing for more than $4 billion to reach 59 million children The UN Children's Fund released its US$ 4.2 billion 2020 to reach 59 million children with life-saving support in 64 countries across the globe. This represents the biggest ask of donors yet - more than triple the funds requested in 2010. The number of countries experiencing conflict is at its highest point since the adoption of the in 1989, noted the ageny. Children have become frontline targets, UNICEF said, resulting in death, serious injury and lasting trauma. Humanitarian emergencies also deprive children of health, nutrition, water and sanitation, education and other basic needs. “Around the world today, we’re seeing the largest number of children in need of emergency assistance since we began record-keeping. One in four children lives in a country affected by conflict or disaster”, said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Historic numbers of children forcibly uprooted from their homes urgently require protection and support. Conflict remains the major driver, while hunger, infectious disease, and extreme weather events related to climate change force millions of others to seek lifesaving aid.”

279-> Fall in COVID-linked carbon emissions won’t halt climate change - UN weather agency chief
An expected drop in greenhouse gas emissions linked to the global economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is only “short-term good news”, the head of the UN said on Wednesday. “This drop of emissions of six per cent, that’s unfortunately (only) short-term good news”, said Professor Petteri Taalas, World Meteorological Organization ( ) Secretary-General, in reference to a 5.5 to 5.7 per cent fall in levels of carbon dioxide due to the pandemic, that have been flagged by leading climate experts, including the Center for International Climate Research. In the 50 years since the first , has accelerated, reaching a new peak in the past 5 years, which were the hottest on record. That trend is expected to continue. We need to show the same solidarity and science for as against  Once the global economy begins to recover from the new , WMO expects emissions to return to normal. “There might even be a boost in emissions because some of the industries have been stopped”, the WMO head cautioned. CO2 at record levels once again Latest data from WMO published to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, on 22 April, indicates that carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rose to new records last year. Levels of carbon dioxide were 18 per cent higher from 2015 to 2019 than the previous five years, according to WMO’s report. The gas “remains in the atmosphere and oceans for centuries. This means that the world is committed to continued climate change regardless of any temporary fall in emissions due to the epidemic”, the report states, with data indicating that CO2 concentrations are on track “to reach or even exceed 410 ppm by the end of 2019”. The forecasted fall in carbon emissions is mirrored by decreases in levels of common air pollutants from car exhausts and fossil fuel energy, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) particles. “Their lifetime is typically from days to weeks, so the impact is seen more rapidly”, Professor Taalas said. “But these changes in the carbon emissions, they haven’t had any impact on climate so far.” Cleaner air even in most polluted cities Highlighting the dramatic improvement in air quality in major cities and industrialised regions “in several parts of the world”, the WMO chief noted that this has been the case “in China, in India and also here close to us in the Po Valley in northern Italy, which is one of the most polluted areas in Europe. And we have seen that also in individual cities like Paris.” Climate change was “of a different magnitude” to the problems posed by the new coronavirus, Professor Taalas insisted, underscoring its serious health risk, along with a devastating economic impact. Mitigating climate change is a question of survival Given the fact that the last 50 years have seen the physical signs of climate change - and their impacts – gathering speed at a dangerous rate, the WMO Secretary-General insisted that unless the world can mitigate climate change, it will lead to “persistent health problems, especially hunger and inability to feed the growing population of the world and there would be also more massive impact on economics”. Since the first Earth Day in 1970, carbon dioxide levels have gone up 26 per cent, and the world’s average temperature has increased by 0.86 degrees Celsius (33.5 Fahrenheit). The planet is also 1.1C (nearly 34F) warmer than the pre-industrial era and this trend is expected to continue. In its latest report warning of the impacts of climate change, the UN agency confirmed that the last five years were the hottest on record. This warming has been uneven, with Europe seeing the highest change in the last decade (of around +0.5C, or 32.9F) and South America experiencing the least change. Others key indicators showed an acceleration of climate change in the past five years. These include ocean heat and acidification, rising sea level (up 112 millimetres since 1970), glacier melt and Arctic and Antarctic sea ice shedding (with ice loss five times higher in last five years, compared to the 1970s).

280-> Parallel threats of COVID-19, climate change, require ‘brave, visionary and collaborative leadership’: UN chief
To combat the COVID-19 pandemic and the “looming existential threat of climate disruption”, the only credible response is “brave, visionary and collaborative leadership” anchored in mutilateralism, the UN Secretary General António Guterres, on Tuesday, during an international discussion focused on climate change. has exposed the fragility of our societies to global shocks, such as disease or the climate crisis. As we recover, we must build a better future for all. Together, we can protect our planet, improve health, reduce inequality & re-energize struggling economies.  And against the backdrop of threatened lives, crippled businesses and damaged economies, the UN chief warned the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in Berlin that the (SDGs) are also under threat. “The highest cost is the cost of doing nothing”, he spelled out, underscoring the need to urgently “strengthen resilience and cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees” above pre-industrial levels, to mitigate climate change. Political will required Heartened by technology and public opinion, especially among the younger generations, he observed that many cities and businesses are taking action. “But we still lack the necessary political will”, he said, advocating for “significantly more ambition” on mitigation, adaptation and financing. On mitigation, all countries must commit to carbon neutrality by 2050. And developing countries – least responsible for climate change but most vulnerable to its impacts – need resilience-building support. This requires adequate financing, beginning with a promised $100 billion dollars a year for mitigation and adaptation efforts, added Mr. Guterres. ‘Profound opportunity’ In planning the pandemic recovery, there is “a profound opportunity” to steer the world on “a path that tackles climate change, protects the environment, reverses biodiversity loss and ensures the long-term health and security of humankind”, the Secretary-General said. “By making the transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient growth, we can create a world that is clean, green, safe, just and more prosperous for all”, he emphasized. As such, he proposed six different climate-related actions that countries can take, to shape the recovery. Recognizing that like the , greenhouse gases respect no boundaries, Mr. Guterres maintained that isolation is a trap in which “no country can succeed alone”. “We already have a common framework for action – the and the on climate change”, he reminded. Carbon neutrality by 2050 Pointing out that 121 States have already committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, the Secretary-General asked all countries to “prepare enhanced national climate action plans”, or Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), “to reach net zero emissions by 2050”. Actions for a climate-positive recovery “I encourage the European Union to continue showing global leadership by presenting, by the end of the year, a Nationally Determined Contribution in line with its commitment to become the first climate neutral continent by 2050”, he said. Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  “The key to tackling the climate crisis is the big emitters”, upheld Mr. Guterres. Noting that the world’s 20 leading economies collectively account for more than 80 per cent of global emissions and over 85 per cent of the global economy, he flagged that “all of them must also commit to carbon neutrality by 2050”. “Without the contribution of the big emitters, all our efforts risk to be doomed”, he conceded. “Let us use the pandemic recovery to provide a foundation for a safe, healthy, inclusive and more resilient world for all people”.

281-> FROM THE FIELD: Women act as ‘agents of change’ in climate emergency
Women around the world can act as “agents of change” and find solutions to the challenges provoked by the global climate crisis, according to the UN’s specialized gender agency, UN Women.  Although a changing climate affects everyone, it is the world’s most vulnerable people, and especially women and girls, who bear the brunt. They are more likely than men to suffer from the social, environmental and economic impacts of a warming planet and can face major barriers in accessing shelter, healthcare, energy and education for their children. But now UN Women is partnering with other United Nations agencies to demonstrate how women can bring around change. Read more about how women are key to finding solutions towards creating a more equitable world and sustainable planet.

282-> Moving towards 100% renewable power in Hawaii (with a little help from sheep)
The US island state of Hawaii has committed to generating 100 per cent of its power using renewable energy by 2045, demonstrating to other US states and island communities across the world, that sustainable energy can be a reality. UN News travelled to Hawaii with the International Labour Organization (ILO) to talk to a power company executive and a sheep farmer to find out how they are contributing to that goal. Neatly arranged rows of deep marine blue-coloured photovoltaic panels are lined up on the undulating hills of one of Hawaii’s volcanic islands, creating a sea of solar-energy generation. It’s midday, and the strong tropical sun is beating down on this power plant, which will provide electricity to over 70,000 people. This is Kauai, one of seven inhabited islands in the northwest of the Hawaiian archipelago, where energy generation is not just an aspiration but also a necessity. The Kauai Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC), a non-profit organization runs this plant, and its 77,000 solar panels generate at least 10 per cent of the islands power, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year. Energy costs in Hawaii, one of the world’s remotest island communities, have typically always been high, as fossil fuels have to be imported to fire the power plants. Speaking to UN News before the oil price declined to historical lows in April 2020, David Bissell, the Chief Executive Officer of KIUC said that the cost of solar power is “significantly lower than a cost of oil-generated power” adding that “it’s getting cheaper as the technology improves.” And, importantly for businesses and domestic consumers, solar power has stabilized prices which “before could have fluctuated by 50 per cent depending on the volatility of the price of oil.” One of the key challenges for every solar power facility is how to store electricity which is plentiful during sunny days but which, for obvious reasons, cannot be generated at night. “Right now, during the sunniest time of the day, we are probably meeting 100 per cent of Kauai’s daytime energy needs,” said Mr. Bissell, “and now we are able to store any excess in batteries.” KIUC unveiled the “world’s first utility-scale solar plus battery storage generation facility” in March 2017. The battery allows the cooperative to store power during the day and dispatch it over a four-hour period during the evening peak demand. Ambitious 100 per cent target for renewable energy Solar power generation on Kauai is one part of an ambitious programme to move Hawaii to 100 per cent sustainable energy by 2045.  The Sustainable Hawaii initiative was launched in 2016 in support of the globally-agreed (SDGs) a set of 17 targets to reduce poverty, protect the  planet and ensure peace and prosperity for all, by 2030. SDG 7 which focuses on affordable and clean energy commits to increasing “substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.” The Governor of Hawaii, David Ige, told UN News that other US state governors “were generally very surprised. They thought that our commitment to 100 per cent clean renewable energy for electricity was so beyond possible that it was a foolish undertaking.” Although it is getting cheaper to build solar electricity generating facilities, it is still an expensive undertaking for developing countries. Nevertheless, Governor Ige says he’s “proud that Hawaii has really inspired other states and communities.” One significant pressure facing Hawaii is a lack of space as the population of 1.4 million residents compete for land with farmers, tourism and industry. Putting sheep to work However, a unique partnership between a local sheep farmer and the Kauai Island Utility Cooperative is demonstrating how businesses competing for land resources can have a mutually beneficial relationship. Daryl Kaneshiro’s 350 sheep are deployed to the facility to graze on the luscious, quickly growing, tropical grass, which otherwise might envelope the solar panels and impede their productivity and power output. “I won a competitive bid against landscaping companies which wanted to clear the grass with machines,” he said. This is just more efficient and it’s good for the environment and sustainable.”  Green investment strategy Small islands, such as Kauai, face unique environmental challenges and external supply shocks due to their remoteness and limited natural resource base, so “developing solar power as part of a green investment strategy that links different sectors of their economy creates a multiplier effect in sustainably managing natural resources, creating jobs and advancing a just transition to a low carbon economy” said the ’s green economy expert, Moustapha Kamal Gueye. As the sheep settle down satiated with grass in the shade of the solar facility, the panels automatically tilt another few inches to catch the afternoon sun, generating electricity which will be stored in the batteries for evening use, bringing Hawaii one step closer to 100 per cent power sustainability.

283-> UN sustainable energy project in Ukraine finds a new role: fighting COVID-19
A United Nations project to promote energy efficiency among Ukrainian homeowners has found a second life – informing 1.8 million of the nation’s citizens on how to combat the COVID-19 virus. Home Owners of Ukraine for Sustainable Energy Efficiency Solutions, also known as HOUSES, was initially designed to help Ukrainians lower their energy costs, better their livelihoods and reduce the country’s carbon footprint. Since its launch in October 2018, it has helped hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians in 24 oblasts (administrative regions) to manage their homeowners’ associations, develop energy efficiency projects and apply for subsidies under the Ukrainian Energy Efficiency Fund. “Little did we know at the time we set it up that we could use this same network to communicate urgent information about the pending pandemic”, said Dafina Gercheva, the United Nations Development Programme ( ) resident representative in Ukraine since 2019. Piggybacking on HOUSES’s network of 24 coordinators, 344 local authorities and nearly 4,000 homeowners’ associations, and working with World Health Organization ( ), UNDP produced more than 100,000 posters detailed information about the new , how to avoid contracting it and how to protect families. Going a step further, many of the homeowners’ associations came up with creative ways to sanitize buildings and footwear, support the elderly and sew protection masks and suits for doctors, medical professionals and vulnerable neighbours, UNDP said. One community made 1,300 masks and 76 suits in the space of a month. The HOUSES programme, which continues through September 2020, is supported by €4 million in European Union funding. COVID and conflict lines In its latest country-by-country situation report on Monday, the WHO reported 15,648 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ukraine and 408 deaths. UNDP said that the number of fatalities is relatively low for a larger European country. The UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ) said that in eastern Ukraine - gripped by conflict between Government forces and mostly pro-Russia separatists since 2014 - there were 142 confirmed cases in Government-controlled areas and 416 in non-Government-controlled areas. The contact line between the two areas has been closed since 21 March as part of a national COVID-19 lockdown, with almost no one – including humanitarian personnel – able to cross over. Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  “This is having an impact on, for example, vulnerable elderly people living in non-Government-controlled areas who are unable to access services, pensions and other social benefits in the Government-controlled part,” OCHA said in a briefing note. Some 325 humanitarian exemptions have been made, however, between 21 March and the end of April, the Office said, adding that humanitarian agencies are still operating on both sides of the contact line, targeting 2 million people with existing stockpiles.

284-> Deadly gas leak in India, grim wake-up call for global chemical industry: UN rights expert
Last week’s deadly toxic gas leak at a Korean-owned polymer plant in south-eastern India, is a grim wake up call for the chemical industry to acknowledge and fulfil its responsibility to respect human rights, the UN independent expert who monitors the issue, said on Thursday. Twelve people reportedly died and more than 1,000 fell sick after styrene leaked from the LG Chem plant near Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh state, on 7 May. Styrene is used to make plastics, but it can also cause cancer and neurological damage. It can also harm reproduction and its impacts may go unnoticed for years after exposure. “The latest disaster has rightly drawn parallels to the toxic gas leak that killed thousands in Bhopal, India, in 1984”, , on hazardous substances and wastes. ‘Rampant consumption’ “It also illustrates the range of human rights infringements brought by our rampant consumption and production of plastics”, he said, welcoming the start of an investigation and possible homicide charges. In a statement, he recalled that the Visakhapatnam and Bhopal incidents both involved trans-national corporations – LG Chem, based in the Republic of Korea, more often known as South Korea, and Union Carbide of the United States, in the case of Bhopal. “It is yet another reminder that around the world, mini-Bhopal chemical disasters continue to unfold with shocking regularity”, Mr. Tuncak said. Reiterating his call last year on the 35th anniversary of the Bhopal disaster for the industry to implement human rights due diligence, he urged authorities to be fully transparent and ensure those responsible are held to account. “I am concerned about ensuring that the victims of exposure who develop diseases or disabilities later in life are provided an effective remedy”, Mr. Tuncak continued. “I urge Indian and South Korean authorities, and the businesses implicated, to avoid the same mistakes and abuse of judicial procedures that have denied justice to the victims of the Bhopal disaster, who are still suffering to this day.” Responsible care initiative In the wake of the Bhopal disaster, the global chemical industry adopted a Responsible Care initiative in an effort to prevent further human rights abuses by chemical manufacturers. “Yet this industry initiative’s principles contain no mention of human rights and fail to require that industry respects human rights in practice as required under the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights”, the Special Rapporteur said. Endorsing his appeal was the ’s five-member , as well as , UN independent rights expert on human rights and the environment. News reports say that LG Chem has sent an eight-member team to India to investigate the gas leak. The plant used styrene monomer to make polystyrene products which would go on to become consumer items such as cups, cutlery and electric fan blades. UN Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the of the Human Rights Council. Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system. The experts work on a voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and nor do they receive a salary for their work.

285-> Tuesday's Daily Brief: Situation critical for Libya migrants, ‘dangerous paralysis’ in Israel-Palestine conflict, ‘shocking escalation’ in Syria, record heatwaves
Our main stories today: UN officials warn of desperate situation for migrants and refugees in Libya; the UN peacebuilding chief calls for ‘tangible steps’ to alleviate the crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and keep two-State solution alive; Idlib in Syria suffers more deadly attacks on civilians; Europe and Bangladesh deal with extreme weather events; and Angry Birds take on the climate crisis. UN officials warn of desperate situation for migrants and refugees in Libya The heads of the two key UN agencies championing refugees and migrants, have called for an end to their “arbitrary detention” across Libya, following an agreement on Tuesday by European Union countries to offer those fleeing across the Mediterranean a safe berth through a new distribution mechanism. “The violence in Tripoli in recent weeks has made the situation more desperate than ever, and the need for action critical”, stressed António Vitorino, Director General of the International Organization of Migration ( ), and Filippo Grandi, UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( ). Disagreements on how to distribute people rescued at sea, led the European Union (EU) to end official Mediterranean Sea patrols earlier this year. Read our full story . ‘Tangible steps’ needed to alleviate crisis in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, keep two-State solution alive, says UN peacebuilding chief The “dangerous paralysis” that prevails in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is fuelling extremism and exacerbating tensions, leading to a “loss of hope” that peace can ever be achieved through negotiation, the UN’s Political and Peacebuilding chief told the on Tuesday. Rosemary DiCarlo said it was “not inevitable” that the international desire for a two-State solution, with both countries living securely side-by-side, was a lost cause, but to resolve all the final status issues dividing Israelis and Palestinians would take “leadership, political will, and a determination to make tangible progress, despite the difficulties.” Full story . ‘The nightmare in Idlib is getting worse’, UN humanitarian official warns 59 civilians killed, and over 100 injured, some critically: that’s the human toll from the latest attack in the last rebel-held province in Syria, Idlib. The succession of airstrikes on Monday was described as “the deadliest so far” by a senior official at , the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Mark Cutts, Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator, that the worst strike was on a popular public market in the town of Maarat al-Numan, which left at least 39 dead, with the figure likely to rise. Mr. Cutts said that the attacks amounted to a “shocking escalation” in the ever-worsening conflict in north-west Syria, and that rescue teams had been working all day to pull people out of the rubble. Strikes continued into the evening, including one that hit a market in the town of Saraqeb, reportedly killing eight, including one woman and four children, and another in Aleppo, where seven civilians reportedly lost their lives. Record heatwaves in store for Europe Heatwaves will continue to hit many parts of Europe this week, with some countries on course to see record temperatures, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said on Tuesday. Briefing journalists in Geneva, a WMO spokesperson said that Germany and the Benelux countries are likely to experience their hottest day ever on Thursday, when they will have to deal with a peak of over 40 degrees Celsius – that’s 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Several parts of France have set records for the lowest amount of rainfall since records began, and in Bordeaux-Merignac, overnight temperatures did not fall below 24.9 degrees Celsius. France and Switzerland are both on “level 3” amber alerts for a period of four days, which means an increased likelihood of travel disruption due to road and rail closures, and risks to health. In Spain, the national weather service is warning of an extreme fire risk for large parts of the country, whilst Portugal is experiencing severe wildfires, with a burned area increasing by 2,000 hectares (almost 5,000 acres) per day. A spokesperson for the WMO said on Tuesday that extreme weather events are “not a problem that’s going to go away”, and that heatwaves are starting earlier, becoming increasingly common, and more intense. The warnings follow a sweltering weekend for the USA, where records were set for several locations, including Atlanta, New Jersey and New York’s JFK airport . Widespread flooding brings destruction to Bangladesh Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, parts of the country - including the huge Cox’s Bazar refugee camp – are struggling to cope with continual heavy rains that have brought widespread flooding and destruction. In a statement on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the World Food Programme ( ), said that the agency has supported more than 11,000 refugees affected by the rains and flooding in the first two weeks of July, a significant rise compared to the same time last year. Refugee camps have been affected by hundreds of landslides caused by storms and rain, and WFP engineering teams have been working against the clock to stabilize slopes and create drainage systems. Thanks to their efforts, the camps are now “significantly safer” than before. The flood response is already greater than that of 2018, and the second half of the monsoon season in Bangladesh is still to come. Angry Birds attack climate crisis The Angry Birds from the game and movies of the same name, are taking a break from hurling themselves into the path of green pigs, to encouraging all of us to do what we can, to help solve the climate crisis. The English-speaking voice stars behind “The Angry Birds Movie 2”, have joined forces with the UN to promote the #ActNow campaign to raise awareness about the importance of changing our habits and routines, and making choices that are less harmful to the environment. The Angry Birds and pigs themselves will be on hand for the first ever takeover of the ActNow website from July 23-30, providing users with individualized suggestions – like traveling more sustainably, saving energy or eating less meat – in a campaign to highlight the impact that collective action can have at this critical moment in the planet’s history.

286-> Cultivating a taste for traditional crops in Hawaii
Hundreds of millions of people go hungry around the world, and there are fears the COVID-19 pandemic could make matters worse. In Hawaii, researchers think that bringing back overlooked, traditional crops, could help feed many vulnerable people. As part of an ongoing series focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals and ahead of International Day of Biodiversity marked annually on 22 May, UN News travelled to Hawaii with the International Labour Organization (ILO) to see how researchers are trying to cultivate a taste for indigenous crops.  As part of an ongoing series focusing on the and ahead of International Day of Biodiversity marked annually on 22 May, UN News travelled to Hawaii with to see how researchers are trying to cultivate a taste for indigenous crops. Full story:  It’s a warm tropical February afternoon at the National Tropical Botanical Garden on the island of Kauai, in the Hawaiian archipelago, and two researchers are busying themselves in a grove of breadfruit trees. The generous rainfall on this Pacific island and the long sunny days create a verdant environment in which fruits and vegetables grow rapidly and plentifully. The starch-rich breadfruit tastes similar to potato and is seldom eaten raw, but, like the potato, it can be roasted, baked, boiled, fried, or dried and ground into flour. It grows to the size of a small soccer ball on a medium-sized bushy tree, which begins to bear fruit within three to five years, and which remains productive for many decades. These trees require little attention or care, producing an abundance of food with a minimal amount of labour or materials, and they thrive under a wide range of ecological conditions. Return of the ‘canoe plants’ Noel Dickinson is a research technician and farmer who has been cultivating the fruit at the Breadfruit Institute which is part of the garden. “Breadfruit was one of about 27 so-called ‘canoe plants’, that were brought by voyaging Polynesian people when they settled these islands centuries ago,” she told UN News, as she cradled an almost ripe fruit in her hand. “These 27 plants were very important to the voyagers because they could be used in many different ways including as food, building material and medicine; and they were also extremely resilient.” In recent times, the breadfruit, of which there are 150 varieties, has fallen out of culinary favour as a staple dish despite the ease with which it can be grown, and its highly nutritious and versatile nature. But now the Breadfruit Institute is trying to change that, recognizing that cultivating the tree, especially in less developed tropical countries, can not only provide a significant source of food to hungry people, to help solve what the Institute calls “critical global food security issues,” but can also bring important environmental benefits. “Breadfruit trees help to diversify agriculture and agroforestry and improve soil conditions and watersheds,” said Noel Dickinson, adding that “they also help to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, so have a role to play in fighting climate change.” Protecting Hawaii from ‘forest system collapse’ As Noel Dickinson continues to tend the breadfruit trees and promote the importance of biological diversity, on the other side of the botanical garden, important work is underway in the shade house to save indigenous plants and support the conservation of the Hawaiian Islands’ mountain ecosystems. Of the nearly 1,300 endemic species that have been identified on the islands, more than 100 are considered to be extinct and a further 273 classified as threatened and endangered. Mike Demotta is the National Tropical Botanical Garden’s Curator of Living Collections and is passionate about saving these indigenous plants. “I really feel responsible for doing whatever I can to conserve and perpetuate native plants because they are an important part of the ecosystem,” he said. “Without these plants, we would probably not be able to live here for very long. If there are too many invasive species, and if our forest systems collapse entirely, the islands could not hold any rainwater: our water supplies would literally evaporate and these islands would become uninhabitable.” Protecting Hawaii’s biodiversity is a key element of Sustainable Hawaii, an initiative launched in 2016 by the State Governor David Ige, which supports the UN’s or SDGs. The initiative includes managing and protecting watersheds, protecting native species by reducing the impact of alien species and, crucially, doubling by the end of 2020 local food production, including promoting traditional crops like breadfruit. “Hawaii, like many other island communities, has had to import food,” Governor Ige told UN News. “More than 90 per cent of the food consumed here is imported from somewhere else, and we recognize that if we can invest in our communities, we would be able to grow more of our food. Our commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals is really a commitment to sustainable communities, to investing in ourselves.” Investing in people makes sense not just in developed communities like Hawaii, but also in developing world countries, especially small island states according to Kevin Cassidy, the Director of the Office for the United States. “If developing countries invest in basic education and skills training for workers in their agro-food value chains they will experience exponential productivity growth, better environmental stewardship and an increase in entrepreneurship for resilient livelihoods, particularly in rural areas.” Back in the breadfruit grove at the National Tropical Botanical Garden, varieties of breadfruit that no longer exist on their native islands are being preserved. And, crucially, the team is now working on how best to mass-produce plants, so that thousands of trees can ultimately be distributed to tropical countries around the world, where hunger is a critical issue.

288-> Shrinking forests need bold action to safeguard their biodiversity
Amidst alarming rates of deforestation and land degradation, urgent action is needed to safeguard the biodiversity of the world's forests, according to a new United Nations report, released on Friday. 🌲Forests are the most diverse habitat on land, but deforestation, mainly due to agricultural expansion, threatens . We must transform how we produce & consume food. Read our interactive story 👉     Published on the , The , highlights that since 1990, some 420 million hectares of trees have been lost to agriculture and other land uses. And the crisis has thrown into sharp focus the link between peole's health and that of the ecosystem, underscoring the importance of conserving and sustainably using nature. "Deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates, which contributes significantly to the ongoing loss of biodiversity", Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) Director-General, QU Dongyu, and Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme ( ), Inger Andersen, said in the foreword. Working with nature Protecting the world's biodiversity is entirely dependent on the way in which we interact with the world's forests. And as they harbour most of our terrestrial biodiversity, safeguarding woodland holds the key. The report shows that forests contain 60,000 different tree species, 80 per cent of amphibian species, 75 per cent of bird species, and 68 per cent of the earth's mammal species. Conservation and sustainable use can work together to protect plants, animals and livelihoods. Within the report, a special study from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission and the US Forest Service, found 34.8 million patches of forests in the world, ranging in size from one to 680 million hectares – illustrating that greater restoration efforts are urgently needed to reconnect forests that have fragmented over time. Turning the tide As FAO and UNEP prepare to lead the in 2021, both UN agency heads expressed their commitment to increased global cooperation in the race to restore degraded and damaged ecosystems, combat climate change and safeguard biodiversity. "To turn the tide on deforestation and the loss of biodiversity, we need transformational change in the way in which we produce and consume food", Mr. QU and Ms. Andersen. "We also need to conserve and manage forests and trees within an integrated landscape approach, and we need to repair the damage done through forest restoration efforts." The report notes that the target to conserve at least 17 per cent of the earth's terrestrial areas by 2020 has been achieved for forests, but acknowledges that progress is still required to ensure that protection. One study conducted for this report shows that the largest increase in protected forest areas were in broadleaved evergreen forests, typically found in the tropics. Furthermore, over 30 per cent of all tropical rainforests, subtropical dry forests and temperate oceanic forests, are now located within protected areas. Jobs and livelihoods Forests provide more than 86 million green jobs to the millions of people around the world who count on them for food security and their livelihoods. Of those living in extreme poverty, over 90 per cent are dependent on forests for wild food, firewood or part of their livelihoods, including eight million extremely poor, forest-dependent people in Latin America alone. The report was produced by FAO in partnership, for the first time, with UNEP, and technical input from the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

289-> ‘Dogged pragmatism’ needed to save Ocean: UN Special Envoy
‘Dogged pragmatism’ is needed to save the Ocean as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, according to the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy for the Ocean. Where are we right now in terms of the physical health of the Ocean? The Ocean is in trouble. Some 60 per cent of the world’s major marine ecosystems have been degraded or are being used unsustainably. We know that the Ocean is getting warmer, that it is losing oxygen and becoming more acidic. These changes, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, are incrementally making life underwater more difficult, with big implications for life on land. Deep cuts in our greenhouse gas emissions are required if we want to reverse the declining health of the Ocean. As we approach the massive task of socio-economic recovery from the pandemic, the self-interest of our species lies in investing public funds into a future of sustainable projects that help the environment and the climate. Why should we care so much about the Ocean? Billions of people depend on the Ocean for their main source of protein and millions of others draw their livelihood from the seas. It’s estimated that marine fisheries provide 57 million jobs globally. Covering 70 per cent of the earth’s surface, absorbing 25 per cent of all carbon dioxide CO2 emissions and 90 per cent of the heat generated by our greenhouse gas emissions, the Ocean is the planet's largest biosphere and climate regulator. It generates 50 per cent of the oxygen we breathe and is often described as the lungs of this planet. It is also the planet’s largest carbon sink, making it one of our greatest allies as we face the challenges of global warming. But the Ocean’s resistance and resilience are not infinite, and we cannot expect it to endlessly absorb the effects of unsustainable human activities. It is said that trouble for the Ocean means trouble for the people, for we cannot have a healthy planetary ecosystem without having a healthy Ocean. To what extent do you see the current COVID-19 crisis as a way to provoke a rethink of the way humankind treats the Ocean? In this respect I urge you to think about the six principles that UN Secretary-General Guterres laid down in his Earth Day address this year, principles that included ending fossil fuel subsidies, polluters being made to pay for their pollution, and investing public funds into a future of sustainable projects that help the environment and the climate. The future of human health, of sustainable food and socio-economic systems, of renewable energy and of a stable climate relies on a healthy Ocean. Therefore, I trust that the tragedies suffered through the crisis will not be repeated by returning to the planet-polluting policies that preceded the pandemic. The best interests of our countries and communities lie in investing in the clean, green transition. At this time, decisions on massive financial commitments are in train, and before the seal is set upon them, we should ensure the consequences of taking the low road back to the polluting fossil-fuel dependant world we knew, are understood and avoided. Governments, development banks, agencies, corporations, none should allow themselves to avoid long-term responsibilities in the name of short-term expedience. Humankind will continue to rely on the Ocean for a wide variety of resources, but can this reliance be more sustainable? It absolutely can, as long as we take the approach of blue-green recovery and give the Ocean the respect it deserves. This approach is all about getting the balance right between protection and production. The Ocean will provide us with the future we want, be it through better medicines, nutrition, or sources of renewable energy. Sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, marine biotechnologies, ecotourism, the greening of the global shipping fleet and more, these will give us the resilience and sustainability we seek. A sustainable ‘blue economy’ which takes into account the well-being of our Ocean will give us a healthy future, but only if we first correct our bad habits on land. How does that look on a small island developing state? Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are particularly vulnerable to global economic shocks and they are in need of special assistance at this time. Many of these countries are highly dependent on tourism for foreign exchange earnings and employment. As lockdown measures ease, urgent attention is required to restore travel connections between compatible countries in order to allow some resumption of tourism. The same relaxation is required for trade and services between compatible countries. How optimistic are you about the Ocean in the light of the coronavirus pandemic? I try to be neither optimistic nor pessimistic, but instead concentrate on the dogged pragmatism required for us to implement our internationally agreed goals. A 2018 report on global warming by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change told us that limiting global warming to sustainable levels would require rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society. While life-altering pandemics are not the prescription for mitigation of climate change, the COVID-19 crisis has demonstrated possibilities for unprecedented change. Perhaps the greatest risk of the pandemic would be that we lose sight of the most fundamental challenge facing humanity, which is the effect that climate change is having on our planet, now and in the future. We must stay focused on the rapid reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions to levels that will keep global warming to no more than 1.5˚C above pre-industrial levels. Without such action, we will be placing the wellbeing of future generations of humans in great jeopardy. The good news is that we have a universally agreed plan to save life in the Ocean which will also fight climate change and reduce rates of global warming. I refer to SDG 14, one the 17 of the United Nations . SDG 14 sets out to conserve and sustainably use the resources of the Ocean. Taken together with the Paris Climate Agreement, the faithful implementation of SDG 14 and the Sustainable Development Agenda will lead us to the future we want for people and for the Ocean.

290-> Wednesday’s Daily Brief: 2020 humanitarian plan, malaria latest, greener tourism, people key to SDGs, Fall Armyworm
A recap of Wednesday’s stories: A record number of people will need humanitarian aid in 2020; WHO calls for more funding to protect women and children from malaria; the transport and tourism sectors are urged to tackle carbon emissions; a group of rights experts want to see more people helping make the SDGs a reality; Fall Armyworm pest sparks new global action plan; and how the UN is helping impoverished landlocked nations develop. Humanitarian plan aims to assist 109 million vulnerable people in 2020 A record 168 million people worldwide will need help and protection in 2020, or roughly 1 in every 45 people on the planet, the UN’s top humanitarian official said on Wednesday. Mark Lowcock was speaking in Geneva, where the UN and its humanitarian partners launched the $29 billion to assist 109 million of the most vulnerable. Mr. Lowcock said climate change, protracted conflicts and economic instability are devastating millions of lives, and the international community “must stand up, face facts, and fight back.” Read our full report, . Step up funding to protect women and children from malaria: WHO While more pregnant women and children are being protected against malaria than before, more fast-tracking and greater funding are needed to reinvigorate the global response, according to a report by the World Health Organization ( ). The , launched on Wednesday, notes a significant increase in the number of pregnant women and children in sub-Saharan Africa sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets and using preventive medicines. However, progress has stalled in the hardest-hit countries. said pregnancy reduces a woman’s immunity to malaria, rendering her more susceptible to infection and at greater risk of illness, severe anaemia and death. Our full coverage . Transport-related emissions from tourism on the rise The World Tourism Organization ( ) is calling for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to transform tourism for climate action. The UN agency has released a report which analyzes the environmental impact of different modes of transport within the tourism sector. It estimates that transport-related emissions from tourism will comprise 5.3 per cent of all man-man carbon dioxide emissions by 2030; up from five per cent in 2016. The report was released on the sidelines of the UN climate summit taking place in Madrid. March of Fall Armyworm must be halted says UN, unveiling new Global Action plan The UN a new three-year plan to curb the growing spread of the invasive pest which is causing serious damage to food production and affecting millions of farmers across the world. (FAW), a crop pest native to the Americas, has spread rapidly through Africa, and to the Near East and Asia in the past four years, said the Food and Agriculture Organization on Wednesday. “It threatens food security of hundreds of millions of people and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers”, said Director-General Qu Dongyu, speaking at the launch on the sidelines of the , the Organization's executive body. “This is a global threat that requires a global perspective,” he stressed, urging the FAO member states “to greatly scale up the existing efforts” to prevent the further spread of this harmful pest to new regions. Mr. Qu said that FAO is seeking to mobilize $500 million over the next three years to control Fall Armyworm. To this end, he proposed the establishment of a Global Action Fund - the first ever multi-partner trust fund aimed at addressing the threat - and encouraged countries to contribute to this funding mechanism. The initiative also calls for increased partnerships to complement current FAO mechanisms such as Farmer Field Schools and South-South and Triangular Cooperation, Mr. Qu noted. In particular, he added, it will feed into FAO’s new data-driven to better target interventions. Leaders urged to increase people’s participation in meeting the SDGs A group of UN human rights experts is calling on countries to boost people’s participation in achieving the ( , aimed at delivering a more equitable future for all people and the planet by 2030. It is critically important for States to ensure the broadest public participation in decision-making about development action, the experts on Wednesday in a statement to mark the 33rd anniversary of the UN Declaration on Right to Development. They stated that immediate action is “imperative”, not only because the SDGs are not on schedule, but also because popular dissatisfaction continues to grow, as evidenced by rising protests across more than 30 countries this year. From landlocked to land-linked: how the UN is helping some of the world’s poorest countries How can the international community turn some of the world’s poorest, landlocked countries, into thriving, land-linked nations? On Thursday, at UN Headquarters, Member States will renew commitments they have made, to lift the 32 countries designated as Landlocked Developing Countries, or LLDCs, out of poverty. The two-day event in New York is officially known as the Midterm Review of the a 10-year initiative to improve the economies of the LLDCs, which suffer from, amongst other things, their challenging geography. our news feature story.

291-> Monday’s Daily Brief: Ozone layer heals, 'regional conflagration' risk rises over oilfield attacks, South Sudan update, Myanmar genocide threat remains
A recap of Monday’s top stories: The ozone layer is on track to repair; Instability rises over oilfield attacks in Saudi Arabia; General Assembly chief Espinosa bows out; Disaster and conflict displace thousands in Asia Pacific; Sexual violence unpunished in South Sudan; Genocide threat remains for Rohingya. At the current momentum, scientists predict the planet’s protective shield of gas - or ozone layer as we know it - will be completely healed as far as some regions of the planet are concerned, by the 2030’s, the UN’s environmental agency has revealed. The recognition of this success comes on marked 16 September. This year celebrates “32 Years and Healing”; a commemoration of the international commitment to protect the ozone later and the climate under the historic , which has led to the phase-out of 99 per cent of ozone-depleting chemicals. Read more . Attacks on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, claimed by rebel fighters in Yemen, are a sign that the war-torn country could be drawn into even greater conflict, the top United Nations official there told the . Special Envoy Martin Griffiths said there is “no time to waste” in ending four years of fighting between Houthi rebels and the internationally-recognized Government, supported by a Saudi-led coalition, which has pushed the country to the brink of famine. Get our full coverage ‘Champion for multilateralism’ readies to hand over UN General Assembly gavel Through consultation, collaboration and consensus, the UN chief on Monday described outgoing President of the General Assembly, María Fernanda Espinosa, as “a champion for multilateralism” who had succeeded in making the United Nations “relevant to all”. As “our universal platform to build consensus for the common good”, he said it had been his “privilege” to work with the Assembly under the leadership of Ms. Espinosa, the fourth woman to serve as the body’s President. The UN chief commended her “ambitious priorities for this session, which addressed crucial matters of international impact and concern, including gender equality, migration and refugees, decent work for all, environmental protection, the rights of people with disabilities, promoting the voices of young people to advance peace and security, and revitalizing the work of the United Nations”. Read the full story A new humanitarian from the UN’s Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs for Asia and the Pacific shows that between intensified conflict and serious disasters, thousands remain displaced in the region. At least 40,000 Lao people and 24,000 in Northern Thailand were counted displaced in the last week, with 32 people reportedly killed, all due to severe flooding caused by two major tropical storms, Podul and Kajiki. Heavy rains in Bangladesh have flooded refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar, affecting some 28,000 people, while in the Philippines, moderate to heavy rains wrought by Tropical Depression Marilyn prompted evacuations, as high tides damaged homes and caused river overflows. Meanwhile in Myanmar, a flareup in conflict between the country’s military and Tan’ang National Liberation Army on 13 September have displaced more than 1,200 people (mostly elderly and children) in just three days. Armed conflict in South Sudan has declined in intensity nationwide but sexual violence continues to plague communities, UN-appointed independent investigators said on Monday. In an update to the , the in South Sudan said that women in the northern town of Bentiu, as well as Yei and Wau states, say they are still victims of high levels of sexually-motivated attacks. Although the panel’s report does not indicate the number of incidents, chairperson of the panel Yasmin Sooka insisted that rape “has not stopped” in the east African country.   Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Rohingya who remain in Myanmar may face a greater threat of genocide than ever, amid Government attempts to “erase their identity and remove them from the country”, UN-appointed independent investigators say. In a report detailing alleged violations in Myanmar over the last year, the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission, insists that many of the conditions that led to “killings, rapes and gang rapes, torture, forced displacement and other grave rights violations” by the country’s military, that prompted some 700,000 Rohingya to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in 2017, are still present.

292-> Greener tourism: Greater collaboration needed to tackle rising emissions
The World Tourism Organization ( ) is calling for enhanced cooperation between the transport and tourism sectors to combat climate change. At in Madrid, we launched our 🆕 landmark report on transport emissions in the tourism sector. 📰 Read it online here:  On the sidelines of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference ( ) in Madrid, the agency on Wednesday released on Wednesday the Transport Related CO2 Emissions of the Tourism Sector report, which estimates that by 2030, transport-related emissions from tourism will comprise 5.3 per cent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions. “This comprehensive study analyses the environmental impact of the different modes of transport within the tourism sector”, Executive Director Manuel Butler at the launch. UNWTO said transport-related emissions remain a major challenge: “While tourism is mentioned in many Nationally Determined Contributions as a big concern, not enough has yet been done”, said Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ). Against the backdrop of a growing number of sightseers both at home and abroad, the data factors in the predicted growth in global emissions to 2030 and is set against the “current ambition” for the decarbonization of transport. “Industry must do more, but Governments must align their policies, so that at the international level we can collectively work to increase ambition”, Mr. Sarmad added. “The One Planet Sustainable Tourism Programme is a vital ongoing mechanism to promote sustainable tourism around the world.” Research revealed High ambition scenario Transport-related CO2 emissions remain a major challenge and require tourism sectors to work closely with transport sectors worldwide in order to support its commitment to accelerate decarbonization. In addition, the tourism industry must determine its own high ambition scenario, complementing the efforts of the transport sector, such as by significantly decoupling growth from emissions, allowing expansion within the international climate targets. “It is now for the tourism sector, especially tourism policy makers, to use data effectively and ensure the sector plays a leading role in addressing the climate emergency”, concluded the chief.

293-> Climate change: educating students to fight the crisis
With the latest containing worrying evidence that climate change is having a major effect on all aspects of the environment, how can teachers help children and adults to sort through the growing mass of information, avoid being overwhelmed, and come to an understanding of the challenges, and potential solutions, to what the UN Secretary-General has called “an existential crisis”? A UN programme for schools is looking to make education a central part of the international response to climate change, and empower students with the knowledge they need to fight the crisis, and adapt to its impacts. For Natukunda Edetruda, a student at Immaculate Heart School, Uganda, it is important for young people to play a key role in fighting climate change. “The future lies in the hands of the youth, and the youth have a role to play to either destroy it or to keep it. I believe that change begins with an individual and, as an individual, I believe that I should be empowered to protect the environment”. Natakunda’s school is one of 258 educational establishments, in 25 countries, that took part in a pilot project organized by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Associated Schools Network ( ), aimed at integrating sustainability, including climate action, into every aspect of school life. Students and teachers at Immaculate Heart school have taken part in a diverse range of sustainability-related activities, including using recycled glass to make glaze for use in ceramics classes, and constructing a water filter to prevent diseases associated with dirty water. Other schools in the programme focused on improving the built environment. Waldorf School in Namibia has offset the environmental impact of the school building by planting trees and vegetation, and St. Jude School in Costa Rica has replaced its air conditioners with more environmentally-friendly alternatives, and the students of Cours Saint Marie de Hann in Senegal made a hanging garden from recycled bottles and tyres. The feedback from schools has been extremely positive, demonstrating a number of positive outcomes. Participating schools greened their premises, improving water, waste and energy management, and the overall health and well-being of school communities; students and teachers developed a stronger environmental conscience, and a vision of how their schools and communities can become more sustainable, and resilient to climate change. Schools can empower students to change their behaviour and take action for the planet  “There is an enormous wave of optimism that comes out of a project like this’ says Sabine Detzel, outgoing International Coordinator of ASPnet. “You see that people are interested to engage and are ready to do things, and that schools, in a very short time, can be transformed so that they motivate and empower students to change their behaviour and take action for the planet”. The success of the pilot project, which ran from 2016 to 2018, has prompted ASPnet to invite all its member institutions – some 11,500 schools in 180 countries – to adopt a similar approach and develop action plans to counter climate change at the local level. Getting climate-ready The UNESCO programme demonstrates the importance of making climate action a part of every aspect of school life, from teaching to the way schools are run, and the impact they have on the local community. The agency has produced a guide for schools, called , which advocates for this “whole-school” approach. Several benefits have been identified by teachers, such as more meaningful and hands-on learning opportunities, significant reductions in the schools’ ecological footprints, and savings through more efficient use of resources. For example, at Colégio Israelita Brasileiro, a school in Rio de Janeiro, everyone at the school, from janitors to teachers, students and support staff, participates in climate-related learning activities. These include building solar and bamboo bicycle racks, and converting used cooking oil into biodiesel. The activities have created bonds between different members of the school community, and brought about a sense of belonging and pride. At the First Experimental Lyceum, a school in Gennadeio, Greece, an innovative approach has been taken to climate action teaching: biology and chemistry students worked in groups to investigate climate change, virus transmission and the dynamics of ecosystems, using computer simulations. The findings were then applied to their school building, to find its environmental weaknesses and develop a plan to improve it. This approach was found to engage students, and enrich their knowledge about real-world problems. Whilst some subjects have an obvious link to climate action (for example, geography and the sciences), the guide suggest ways that many other subjects can include the topic. History, for example, can examine how societies have, in the past, reacted to environmental challenges. Language and literature classes can help students to develop the communication skills needed to respond to local and global issues, mathematics students can produce graphs showing the change in school energy use, and civics students can interview local officials on the actions they are taking to address the problem. ‘Almost all countries’ educating children about climate change Encouragingly, nearly all countries have committed to climate change education,  a released in December 2019 has revealed. The study found that the most common commitment is to the raising of public awareness, and that cognitive learning is more commonly discussed (i.e. integrating climate knowledge into classroom teaching), rather than social and emotional or behavioural learning. However, it also showed that actual progress is currently hard to monitor, because of a lack of data. The UN is calling for nothing less than a transformation of the global economy in which technology, science, finance and ingenuity are all focused on ensuring a sustainable future for all. However, this will only happen if school-leavers have the skills needed to answer the demands of this new, greener economy, and that will require strong leadership from all sectors of society, including governments, international organizations, the private sector and civil society.

294-> Many Mozambicans still struggling to get back on their feet, one year after cyclone
Many of the people who lost everything when Cyclone Idai swept through central Mozambique a year ago, continue to face devastating hardship, the UN food relief agency said on Friday. While emergency assistance kickstarted the recovery of 1.8 million affected people, the strongest storm to ever hit the country has left many more facing an uncertain future, lackingthe funding they urgently need to rebuild, the World Food Programme’s Regional Director for Southern Africa said in Geneva. “For people who had their lives turned upside down, our projects – community farms, road and bridge repair, the rebuilding of schools – are a source of hope,” according to Lola Castro, and “this essential work must continue if we want to see real and lasting recovery.” Idai made landfall in the vicinity of Beira in central Sofala province on 14 March at Category 4 strength, provoking one of the worst weather-related disasters to hit the southern hemisphere. Months’ worth of rain, which fell in a matter of hours, swept through the central region with storm surges of 2.5m in height causing massive flooding that left entire communities submerged under 10 meters of water. More than 600 lives were lost, some 1,600 were injured, and close to 2.2 million people were in need of urgent assistance, according to the UN humanitarian wing, . Zimbabwe and Malawi also experienced massive devastation, with over 1.1 million people affected in both countries. Double blow To make matters worse, just six weeks later Tropical Cyclone Kenneth hit northern Mozambique with wind gusts of up to 220km/h, making it the most intense cyclone ever to hit the African continent. Nearly 35,000 houses were either partially or totally destroyed, the Government said, and more than 18,000 people were initially displaced.  In Sofala, the most damaged province, vital support for 525,000 people working on post-Idai recovery projects is at risk of a complete halt. maintained that as funding shortfalls last month forced food rations in half for those workers, $91 million are needed this year to fully implement rehabilitation projects for victims. Emergency levels of food insecurity Mozambique’s poorest were the most affected by the destruction. Many of the 250,000 families whose homes were damaged are subsistence farmers, whose crops were completely destroyed and few have been able to return to their villages, let alone replant in time for the 2020 harvest. Most people are now enduring “crisis” or “emergency” levels of food insecurity, said WFP. This means they do not have enough to eat, are foraging “for less-than-nourishing wild foods” and continue to need outside support to survive. In a country with one of the highest rates of chronic malnutrition in the world, acute malnutrition is on the rise among Idai-affected communities – affecting 43 per cent of children under five. Furthermore, a rare outbreak of Pellagra, a disease triggered by Vitamin B3 deficiency, has sickened almost 4,000 people in Sofala, with the numbers rising rapidly. Climate change warnings Heavily dependent on rainfed and smallholder farming, Mozambique is highly vulnerable to climate change. UN weather agency chief  Petteri Taalas called the devastation across Mozambique a “wake-up call” for vulnerable countries “to build resistance” against further high-impact tropical storms, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to climate change. And WFP stressed that significantly more investment is needed in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. “Boosting Mozambicans’ ability to withstand the impacts of increasingly severe drought and flooding was the core of our work before the cyclones struck”, concluded Ms. Castro. “It’s what we must resume now, and, with partners, step up in the coming years”.

295-> New report from UN Economic Commission for Europe measures progress on Global Goals
As all eyes, hearts and minds focus on the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) garnered attention on Tuesday when a new UN revealed that only ten countries in the European region have levels of air pollution below the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limit. The UN Economic Commission for Europe’s (UNECE) first regional report on SDG progress has singled out Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Estonia, United States, Norway, Portugal, Ireland and Spain as meeting the standards, noting that others need to step up. 🆕: First regional report on uses on 49 indicators across all 17 to highlight progress, lags & data gaps Read the report, issued ahead of to support sharpened efforts for the ⏩   These and other findings aim to sharpen efforts to achieve the SDGs by describing levels and trends of selected indicators and highlighting challenges, which will be used to inform the Regional Forum on Sustainable Development, which will be held Thursday . Measuring change for most of the 49 indicators across the 17 SDGs, the report found that UNECE countries are mostly fulfilling targets or making good progress, including on eradicating extreme poverty, enhancing social protections and achieving low levels of maternal, infant and child mortality. And the report highlights actions toward preserving the planet, such as expanding forest cover, providing safely managed sanitation, lowering the energy intensity of the economy and complying with environmental agreements. But the findings are not all favourable, including in the areas of air pollution, marine protection, development assistance and disaster-risk reduction strategies. Key trends Health indicators show that in most countries, the proportion of underweight children below age five is low while overweight rates are much higher – a pattern especially pronounced in some Western Balkan countries. “There are ten times more overweight children than underweight children in Albania, eight times more in Montenegro and around seven times more in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in North Macedonia”, to UNECE. Turning to gender equality, women in most countries spend considerably more time in domestic and care work than men, with the largest differences observed in Albania, where women spend 5.2 hours and men 0.8 hours per day. Nordic countries had the smallest gap. Sweden, Finland, Spain and Norway each have more than 40 per cent women among members of parliament, and in 36 countries across the region the share of women parliamentarians increased between 2015 and 2019. However, only Belarus, France, Iceland and Sweden have near gender parity among local government representatives. Regarding climate, almost all countries observed an improvement in CO2 emissions between 2011 and 2016, with the largest drop in Uzbekistan, followed by Turkmenistan and Ukraine. And over the past two decades, forest cover has been expanding in the region – a marked contrast with the situation worldwide, in which forest areas have decreased between 2000 and 2015. At the same time, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Israel have a level of water stress above 100 per cent as each extracts more water than is renewed in the same period. Development and economy Of the 25 countries with available data, only Sweden, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark and the United Kingdom meet the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income allocated to official development assistance. And while Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland have unemployment benefits reaching or exceeding 95 per cent of the population, that same coverage is below two per cent in Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kyrgyzstan. Although UNECE countries all have retirement pension provisions, the report showed that in 2016 about half covered 100 per cent of their populations, with the lowest coverage found in Montenegro (53 per cent) followed by Croatia (57 per cent). The UNECE region covers more than 47 million square kilometres. And has a membership of 56 States. For more details, click .

296-> Blueprint launched to manage Earth’s fragile peatland carbon sinks
A blueprint for how countries can keep carbon in fragile land-based carbon sinks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been unveiled by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Launched on Wednesday, the guidelines for peatland mapping and conservation come as around 15 per cent of the world's peatlands have already been drained mainly for cropping, grazing, forestry and extraction. Hotspots of peatland degradation are located especially in Europe, Russia and Northern America, southeast Asia, East Africa and the Amazon basin. A new publication & an innovative geospatial online tool will help countries better map & monitor the world's . Peatlands cover only 3% of the world's surface yet contain as much as all of its vegetation!  “Mapping peatlands to know their location, extent and greenhouse gas emissions potential, can help countries to plan and better manage their land, water and biodiversity, mitigating climate change and adapting to it more effectively,” said Maria Nuutinen, 's lead peatlands expert and guidelines co-author. Launched on Wednesday, the FAO’s Peatland Mapping and Monitoring guidelines complement an existing online surveying tool. This lets Member States map and monitor where their main carbon-retaining areas are, using high-definition satellite imaging. It also indicates when action is required to stop these carbon sinks from drying out. Water-level data is key For countries to successfully reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the fire risk caused by peatland degradation, monitoring them – and especially their water level – is key, FAO maintains. The task requires a mix of satellite and ground-based data, as well as access to high-quality imagery. Peatlands play a pivotal role in global climate regulation, FAO insists; even though they cover only three percent of the world’s surface, they contain as much carbon as all its vegetation. If they are destroyed by fire or by being drained, all the carbon that they have accumulated over thousands of years risks being released over a few decades. Indonesia leads way The FAO’s online mapping technology has already been successfully implemented for the first time in Indonesia – which has 40 per cent of all tropical peatlands. The country has been particularly active in taking action to change drainage and deforestation practices that, since the 1980s, have led to extensive fires. The FAO technology is also going to serve the needs of the Congo Basin by helping to avoid fires. In Peru, moreover, the UN agency’s advice is being employed to protect and manage the coastal, Andean and Amazonian peatlands. The FAO publication is the joint work of 35 expert authors from 14 countries, and highlights experiences from tropical peatland countries such as Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Peru, and the temperate regions. Urgent need to monitor peatlands To avoid their degradation and effectively plan their restoration, peatlands should be urgently mapped and monitored, the UN agency says. But recognizing peatlands is not easy, so “mapping and monitoring need to be approached as a complex and nuanced exercise,” said Hans Joosten, a peat expert and the FAO guidelines co-author. Surface vegetation types, for example, are predominantly mosses for arctic peatlands, mostly reeds in the temperate zones, and mangroves or peat swamp forests in the tropics. Peatlands are still being discovered, including one of the world's largest – larger than England – connected tropical peatland complex in the remote and hard-to-access Cuvette Centrale region of the Congo rainforest.

297-> FIRST PERSON: The ‘inseparable bond’ between Hawaiian culture and native plants
The 17 goals agreed by the global community to reduce poverty and create a sustainable planet are the responsibility of all people, wherever they are in the world, according to the United Nations. The Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs represent a boundary-pushing blueprint for the future of the Earth and it’s anticipated they will be realized by 2030. UN News joined the International Labour Organization on a visit to Hawaii where many people are already living aspects of the goals in their everyday work. Mike Demotta is the Curator of Living Collections at Hawaii’s National Tropical Botanical Garden on the island of Kauai. He is passionate about his speciality, native plants and the important role they play in Hawaiian culture. Ahead of the International Day of Forests, marked annually on 21 March he explained to UN News why saving biodiversity on the Pacific island archipelago is so crucial. “The majority of the plants that are grown here are native Hawaiian plants and many are federally listed as rare and endangered. One plant that the garden has been working with over decades is called alula in Hawaiian. It's generally found or was found mostly on the cliffs around the island of Kauai. ‘The Lone Ranger’ facing extinction It looks almost cactus-like, with a very thick stem which is quite bulbous at the base. It produces fibrous roots which are able to penetrate fine cracks and hold itself to steep rocks; it has large flat rounded green leaves and looks almost like a cabbage. I love this plant because it has adapted to live and thrive in the harshest of environments that the islands can throw at it. However, this plant is under threat due to habitat degradation, loss of pollinators and invasive species, like non-native grasses that choke out seedlings and goats which were brought here in the early 1800s and which eat them. The last time a survey was done, by helicopter, just one alula plant was found in the wild which was growing out of a cave overlooking the ocean. So, it's the last Lone Ranger. We think the alula was pollinated by what is probably now an extinct moth species that had a particularly long proboscis allowing it to feed off the nectar and carry pollen from plant to plant. Today, if we really want to produce seeds from these plants, we have to hand pollinate and that’s what we do here. Ideally, we work with other conservation organizations to replant native species in the wild as resources become available. ‘Inseparable bond’ between plant and culture 'Plants are manifestations of Hawaiian gods'. Mike Demotta, curator at in Kauai, explains why plants are so important to the culture of the Hawaiian islands. Read more in our First Person story:  I'm interested in native plants like alula because of the inseparable bond between these plants and early Hawaiian culture. Our poetry and music use plants as metaphors in storytelling. From a practical perspective, I really feel responsible for doing whatever I can to conserve and perpetuate native plants because they are an important part of the ecosystem. Plants never seem to be the first thing folks think about; they see an albatross soaring in the sky and or the rare Hawaiian monk seal. Those are charismatic animals which everybody wants to save. However, they probably would not be able to exist if the plants in the ground did not contribute to the ecosystem. For example, these plants will help to strain rainwater that goes into the ocean eventually as clean water instead of sediment. So, you have to educate people and show them why it's so important to love plants. The early Polynesians discovered and colonized these islands over many generations, and they understood the importance of conserving the islands’ ecosystems, as without those ecosystems, they would not be able to survive. Nature was part of their ancient religion and so plants were representations of certain gods or deities which they cared for; this was an innate part of the Hawaiian belief system. Climate change and the collapse of forest systems Today, without these plants, we would probably not be able to live here for very long.  If there are too many invasive species, and if our forest systems collapse entirely, the islands could not hold any rainwater: our water supplies would literally evaporate and these islands would become uninhabitable. Climate change is also a factor in our forest ecosystems. One of the things that we will sadly not see in our lifetimes at this elevation are our native forest songbirds, which are now very rare. We call them the honeycreepers and they're pretty much all evolved to feed on the nectar of our native plants. They're only found at the highest elevations now because their native ecosystem lower down has been destroyed.  The other problem is mosquitoes which are not native to Hawaii. They carry avian malaria which none of our native birds have resistance to. The climate has warmed up, so there are mosquitoes at the summits of mountains, the last sanctuary of these native birds. Unless something is done to control mosquitoes, we can foresee the loss of our native honeycreepers in the next couple of decades. It's make-or-break now, we're at a real crossroads. If birds and native insects start to disappear because of climate change, then we will lose pollinators. Plants will no longer produce viable seeds, and that will unleash a domino effect, which will impact biodiversity. I am still optimistic though; there is no reason why we shouldn't be growing and replanting these rare plants in the forest. I'm confident that there's enough resilience for most of the species to survive, and I will not give up my fight to save them. Life on Land and the UN

298-> Turn around deforestation in 2020, the ‘Nature Super Year’, says Guterres
On the , which falls on Saturday, UN chief António Guterres is calling for 2020, which has been referred to as a “nature super year”, to be the year that the world turns the tide on deforestation and forestry loss. This year’s International Day highlights the connections between forests and biodiversity, following a that sounded the alarm about accelerating species extinction rates, and the unprecedented speed at which ecosystems are declining. Forests and our unsustainable choices The UN chief pointed out that forests, and the global environment in general, are being severely degraded by the unsustainable way that we are consuming natural resources, which is accelerating biodiversity loss and exacerbating climate change. Given the huge role that forests play in preserving life on earth and regulating the climate (see the text box below), Mr. Guterres expressed his alarm at the damage being wrought by drought conditions in many parts of the world, citing devastating forest fires, from the Canadian Arctic and Siberia to California and Australia. On top of this, deforestation continues to occur, due to large-scale agriculture: even though the annual rate of deforestation has halved over the last 25 years, vast areas of forests continue to be lost. “We must act quickly to reverse this. Safeguarding forests is part of the solution” said Mr. Guterres, urging all governments and businesses and civil society to “take urgent action to halt deforestation and restore degraded forests, so future, generations can enjoy a greener, healthier future”.

299-> World Water Day: Often overlooked, water resources are essential part of solution to climate change
On , the United Nations launched a flagship report which says that reducing both the impacts and drivers of climate change will require major shifts in the way we use and reuse the Earth’s limited water resources. The new global report calls, among others, for concrete efforts to address rising water stress and improve the efficiency of water use in agriculture and industry, and it outlines actions in three areas: first, enabling people to adapt to the impacts of climate change; second, improving the resilience of livelihoods; and, third, reducing the drivers of climate change. The science around may seem complicated but the solutions can be simple. Water can help fight climate change. There are sustainable, affordable and scalable water and sanitation solutions. Find out how this   Tackling water (in)security and climate change, two of the most critical crises the world will continue facing over the next several decades, ­the 2020 UN , compiled by the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ), in collaboration with , provides decision-makers with knowledge and tools to craft sustainable water policies, and calls for scaling up investment to put them into practice. “The word ‘water’ rarely appears in international climate agreements, even though it plays a key role in issues such as food security, energy production, economic development and poverty reduction,” said Director-General, . She : “This potential of water must be explored, given that our actions to reduce global warming are currently lagging behind our ambitions, despite wide adherence to the ...the report shows that water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution. Water can support efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.” 'Everyone has a role to play’ UN Secretary-General in on World Water Day said, “everyone has a role to play,” and called on all stakeholders to increase climate action and invest in robust adaptation measures for water sustainability. By limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius, he said, “the world will be in a much better position to manage and solve the water crisis that we all face.” This year’s World Water Day focuses on water and climate change. With 2020 a make-or-break year for climate action, this focus is timely – UN chief António Guterres “Water is the primary medium through which we perceive the effects of climate disruption, from extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods, to glacial melting, saltwater intrusion and sea level rise,” he said. This will negatively affect health and productivity and act as a threat multiplier for instability and conflict. The solution is clear, said the UN chief. “We must urgently scale up investments in healthy watersheds and water infrastructure, with dramatic improvements in the efficiency of water use, said Mr. Guterres, adding that the world must anticipate and respond to climate risks at every level of water management. Above all, said the Secretary-General, “we must use this year and COP26 in Glasgow to bend the emissions curve and create a secure foundation for water sustainability,” he stressed, referring to the upcoming UN climate change conference, currently scheduled for next November 2020. ‘A water crisis is a global crisis’ In her on the Day, UNESCO chief Azoulay said that with four billion people worldwide forced to contend with water scarcity, “without sustainable access to water, we will be unable to achieve goals such as quality education or the development of more prosperous, fairer societies.” “Given the urgency of the situation, the coming decade needs to be one of action,” she declared. The 2020 Report, she said, sets out “concrete solutions for ensuring access to water for all: improved water resources management, the mitigation of water-related hazards, easier and more sustainable access to sanitation.”; Action to save the planet and its water will only be useful if future generations were fully involved, including through UNESCO member States incorporating issues related to environmental education in their school curricula. 'We simply cannot afford to wait’ The report, launched in Paris and Geneva, echoed the UN officials’ call on States to make more concrete commitments to address the challenge, and that climate change will affect the availability, quality and quantity of water needed for basic human needs, thus undermining enjoyment of the basic rights to safe drinking water and sanitation for billions of people. Such a deterioration of the situation would only hinder achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 6 ( ), which is part of the for Sustainable Development, according to which access to safe drinking water and sanitation must be guaranteed for all within 10 years. This will be a considerable challenge: ­2.2 billion people currently do not have access to safely managed drinking water, and 4.2 billion, or 55 per cent of the world’s population, are without safely managed sanitation. There are solutions for managing water and climate in a more coordinated manner and every sector of society has a role to play. We simply cannot afford to wait – UN-Water Chair Gilbert F. Houngbo UNESCO has also said that the critical need to substantially improve access to clean water for drinking and hygiene for billions of the world’s people has been further thrown into stark relief by the current deadly outbreak of . The 2020 World Water Development Reports reveals that water use has increased six-fold over the past century and is rising by about one per cent a year. However, it is estimated that climate change, along with the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme events – storms, floods and droughts, will aggravate the situation in countries already currently experiencing ‘water stress’ and generate similar problems in areas that have not been severely affected. Furthermore, the report highlights the fact that poor water management tends to exacerbate the impacts of climate change, not only on water resources but on society as a whole. The Chair of UN-Water, and President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( ), Gilbert F. Houngbo, said: “There are solutions for managing water and climate in a more coordinated manner and every sector of society has a role to play. We simply cannot afford to wait.” Adaptation, mitigation, finance To this end, the report outlines a range of adaptation and mitigation measures, including natural, technical and technological measures to curb damage, and steps humans can take to effectively to limit greenhouse gas emissions, as well as protect the environment.; The report also mentions innovative water management interventions such as fog capture, or more traditional ones such as wetland protection, as well as proven ‘conservation agriculture’ techniques. The ‘reuse’ of partially treated wastewater for agriculture and industry, without necessarily making it safe to drink, is another highlighted approach. On the “crucial” question of financing, the authors argue that there are increasing opportunities to systematically integrate adaptation and mitigation planning into water-related investments, in order to make them more attractive to donors. A good example of this is a project in Sri Lanka. This aims to improve irrigation systems in vulnerable village communities and promote climate-smart agricultural practices in three river basins, offering both climate adaptation and mitigation benefits, while conserving water and protecting drinking water sources. Various water and climate change initiatives can also bring co-benefits such as job creation, improved public health, poverty reduction, promotion of gender equality and improved livelihoods, further enhancing their attractiveness to donors.

300-> ‘Count every drop, every drop counts’: UN weather agency calls for better water data on World Meteorological Day
Floods, extreme rainfall, droughts and melting glaciers…many of the major signs of climate change involve water. On this year’s World Meteorological Day, the UN weather agency (WMO) is reinforcing the message of World Water Day, by focusing on the links between climate and water, and calling for better water-related data. In a message to mark the Day, UN said that climate and water are “inextricably linked. Both lie at the heart of global goals on sustainable development, climate change and disaster risk reduction”. “Water”, he continued, “is one of the most precious commodities of the 21st century. National Meteorological and Hydrological Services will be central to efforts to ‘count every drop, because every drop counts’”. We can’t manage what we can’t measure: the importance of data The increasingly unpredictable, changing weather patterns are likely to lead to more “water stress” which, in turn, will affect sustainable development and security. The effects of unpredictable weather were described, in detail, in the ’s flagship weather report, the Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019, released on 10 March. The study showed that climate change is having a major effect on all aspects of the environment, as well as on the health and wellbeing of the global population. In 2019, extreme weather events, some of which were unprecedented in scale, took place in many parts of the world. These included monsoon rains and deadly floods in India, the driest year on record in Australia, and the widespread devastation caused by cyclone Idai in Mozambique and the east coast of Africa. This is why the WMO is urging for a ramping up of water forecasting, monitoring and management of supplies. This will help to tackle the problem of too much, too little, or too polluted water. Better data can help in the planning of water projects, such as hydroelectric plants; improved understanding of the impact that water resource management has on the environment, the economy and society; and can help us to better protect people, property and ecosystems from water-related hazards, particularly floods, droughts and pollutants. Closer collaboration between weather and water services Because of the likelihood that future water demands will require tough decisions to be made, when it comes to allocating resources, WMO is calling for closer collaboration between meteorological (weather) and hydrological (water) services. The capacity to forecast, monitor and manage water is currently fragmented and inadequate, a concern for WMO and its chief, Petteri Taalas. “It is worrying to see that Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) which focuses on clean water and sanitation, is so far off track now. “The world needs to demonstrate the same unity and commitment to climate action and cutting greenhouse gas emissions as to containing the pandemic”, he said. WMO is committed to working closely with UN Water and other key United Nations partners, towards enhanced implementation and acceleration of SDG6.

301-> First Person: Humankind’s ‘modern mentality to tame’ the environment: A volcanologist’s view
The 17 goals agreed by the global community to reduce poverty and create a sustainable planet are the responsibility of all people, wherever they are in the world, according to the United Nations. The Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs represent a boundary-pushing blueprint for the future of the Earth and it’s anticipated they will be realized by 2030. UN News joined the International Labour Organization on a visit to Hawaii where many people are already living or studying aspects of the goals in their everyday work. “In my work, I look at specifically at how volcanic eruptions impact populations. It doesn't have to be human populations; it could be marine communities that live in and around the submarine volcanoes. When I'm studying volcanoes on land, I focus mostly on understanding how frequently events happen and what hazards people face. Up until maybe a thousand years ago, humans were much more tuned into their environment and tended to stay away from the most dangerous places like volcanic areas, but it's our modern mentality that we can tame anything. So, we encroach much more closely on very dangerous environments. This whole area that we're standing in was inundated in the 1940s by a tsunami created by a big earthquake in Alaska. It's part of the reason why this coastline is now protected and there are no buildings. A tsunami event like that only happens every several decades; the last one was in 1964 and we haven't had a big one since. Treating the water like a trash can Living and working on an island, you understand quickly that there's a lot of reliance on the nearshore environment as a resource for marine life and the protection of the coastlines. A healthy coral ecosystem, for example, helps to protect coastlines from events like tsunamis. There's a legacy of people treating everything below the waterline with less direct regard than what is above water; for instance, the dumping of all types of trash. I do a fair amount of work in the submarine environment in manned submersibles and there are places around Hawaii that we can't go because of thousands of unexploded bombs and strings of bullets. The damaging effects of human activity . is a volcanologist at Hawaii's . He spoke to News about the impact of on volcanic activity. Full story here: CC:  The way I like to think about climate change is to recognize that the planet has been changing ever since it formed and that the climate fluctuates over different time scales. So, there's a long-term time scale, which has to do with the what we call the rock cycle, the forming of materials on the land and their subsequent breakdown which affects the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. So, over the course of Earth history, CO2 levels have naturally been slowly going down. Then we have factors like how the Earth orbits the sun which affects the cycles of ice ages and warm periods such as the warm period that we're in now. And there's of course the shorter-term damaging human-produced or anthropogenic effects resulting from human activity which picked up pace following the industrial revolution. Volcanic eruptions and global cooling There's always been a certain amount of volcanism. It waxes and wanes and affects climate in both positive and negative ways in terms of temperatures. Volcanoes can inject aerosols into the upper atmosphere which reflect light and can cause planetary cooling, rather than warming. But, it's really only the very big eruptions, the sort which occur once or twice a century, that have any kind of measurable impact on climate. Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines erupted in 1991 and caused a couple years of cooling afterwards which gave a lot of fuel to the anthropogenic climate naysayer types because they said, “look it's getting cool.” In Hawaii, our eruptions aren't so violent and don’t cause the same effect. But when volcanoes erupt in a big way, they affect climate in one place or another for a brief period of time. What volcano eruptions mean collectively is the outgassing of the interior of the Earth which brings a lot of CO2 and water to the surface; those are the two things that modulate our atmosphere and temperature patterns. If we didn't have water vapour and CO2 in our atmosphere, if we didn't have the greenhouse effect, we wouldn't be able to live here. That atmosphere is provided by volcanism. Climate change and increased volcanic activity I'm looking specifically at the period after the last ice age, when we had a 140-metre sea level rise over about ten thousand years. It was the last period in our history where we had sea-level change of the magnitude we predict for the next several hundred years. Climate change can also have an impact on volcanic activity, although we have to look at this from a geologists’ timeframe. In Iceland after the ice age, when the glaciers started to retreat, the amount of volcanism increased dramatically, but it didn't happen right away. It took several thousand years. So, I wouldn't want to go out on a limb and say there's going to be more volcanism in a hundred or a thousand years as the full effects of anthropogenic climate change are felt, but that's what we would predict based on our observations from the past. I would say that in all the myriad ways that anthropogenic climate change is going to affect us, volcanism is pretty far down the list of things we need to worry about. But it is one of the reasons why we like to study volcanic cycles.”

302-> COVID-19 effect casts cloud over weather alert accuracy: UN sky watchers
UN weather experts warned on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic risks disrupting key forecasting services, including early warning alerts around the world. Both the quantity and quality of weather observations and forecasts, as well as atmospheric and climate monitoring are at stake, according to the World Meteorological Organization ( ) in Geneva. “We are concerned about the impact on the ability of our Members to deliver their basic weather and climate services”, said Lars Peter Riishojgaard, Director of WMO’s Earth System Branch. “And you may think, why would we care about this, we have bigger things to worry about right now…But even in this situation, there could be situations where all of a sudden you could be critically reliant on weather forecasting if a hurricane, tornado, or some other adverse weather situation breaks out.” In a statement, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas urged Governments to support their national early warning and weather observing capacities despite the “severe challenges” caused by the crisis. He explained that the devastating impacts of climate change haven’t stopped since the new emerged in December, and neither have the “growing” number of weather-related disasters. Without reliable weather data, the COVID-19 pandemic “poses an additional challenge and may exacerbate multi-hazard risks at a single-country level”, the WMO chief maintained. Automated monitoring systems vulnerable Many parts of the global weather monitoring system are automated, such as satellites and land-based observation points. But other parts of the network have experienced a “dramatic” impact over the last few weeks – such as high-altitude readings - thanks to a sharp decrease in air traffic levels. Before the COVID-19 era, commercial airlines took around 700,000 daily readings of air temperature, wind speed and wind direction. This data and much more is fed into , which supports weather and climate services and products provided by the 193 WMO Members. In Europe, where air traffic readings are down by 85 to 90 per cent according to WMO, countries affiliated with 31 national weather services are already discussing how to boost the short-term capabilities of other parts of their observing networks, to mitigate this loss of aircraft-sourced data. The impact has been less severe in the US, where commercial airline traffic data is down by 60 per cent, WMO said. “At the present time, the adverse impact of the loss of observations on the quality of weather forecast products is still expected to be relatively modest”, said Mr. Riishojgaard. “However, as the decrease in availability of aircraft weather observations continues and expands, we may expect a gradual decrease in reliability of the forecasts.” Data dip in developing countries The situation is also concerning in many developing countries, where data is retrieved manually by weather observers, before being shared with international forecasting databases “WMO has seen a significant decrease in the availability of this type of manual observations taken every few hours and reported to national centres over the last two weeks,” Mr. Riishojgaard said. “WMO will continue to monitor the situation, and the organization is working with its Members to mitigate the impact as much as possible.” WMO chief Mr. Taalas added: “National Meteorological and Hydrological Services continue to perform their essential 24/7 functions despite the severe challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.” “We salute their dedication to protecting lives and property but we are mindful of the increasing constraints on capacity and resources.”

303-> Climate change: Another year of record gas emissions, warns UN meteorological agency
Levels of the three main heat-trapping gases emitted into the atmosphere – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide – have reached yet another high, the UN meteorological agency, , said on Monday. In an appeal to Governments to do more to reverse countries’ reliance on producing energy from fossil fuels, in line with the 2015 on Climate Change, Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, “the future welfare of mankind” was at stake. gas concentrations hit a new record high. Future generations will face increasingly severe impacts of , incl rising temperatures, extreme weather, water stress, sea level rise, ocean acidification, disruption to ecosystems.  “We have again broken records in carbon dioxide concentrations and we have already exceeded 400ppm level which was regarded as a critical level,” he said, in reference to the 407.8 parts per million reading for 2018. “That happened already two years ago and this carbon dioxide concentration continues and continues, and last year’s increase was about the same as we have been observing in the past 10 years, as an average.” According to the World Meteorological Organization’s Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, since 1990, so-called “long-lived” greenhouse gases have caused a 43 per cent increase in total radiative forcing - the warming effect on the climate. Of these gases, CO2 accounts for about 80 per cent, according to the United States’ National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), whose data is quoted in the WMO Bulletin. Carbon dioxide especially damaging CO2 is particularly harmful in a global warming context because it remains in the atmosphere for centuries and in the oceans for even longer, the agency explained. Professor Taalas noted too that when the Earth last had similar concentrations of CO2, the temperature “was 2-3 degrees Celsius warmer (and) sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now”. Turning to methane, which is responsible for 17 per cent of radiative forcing, Professor Taalas noted that “we have also been breaking records”, since last year’s increase “was the second-highest in the last 10 years”. According to the WMO bulletin, global readings indicate that atmospheric methane (CH4) reached a new high of 1,869 parts per billion (ppb) in 2018, more than two and a half times the pre-industrial level. Approximately 40 per cent of methane comes from natural sources, such as wetlands and termites, but 60 per cent comes from human activities, including cattle breeding, paddyfields, mines, landfills and biomass burning. “For CH4, the increase from 2017 to 2018 was higher than both that observed from 2016 to 2017 and the average over the last decade,” the bulletin noted. Gas concentrations accelerating This upwards trend in emissions was repeated in the case of nitrous oxide (N2O), with concentrations in 2018 estimated at 331.1 ppb, or 123 per cent above pre-industrial levels. “Nitrous oxide has contributed about six per cent of the warming so far”, said Professor Taalas. “It’s very much coming from farmlands and again there we have been breaking records, the steady growth of N2O concentration still continues.” Based on current data, global emissions are not estimated to peak by 2030, let alone by 2020, if existing climate policies - as set out in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - remain unchanged, WMO believes. Addressing this will involve promoting non-fossil-based energy sources, since “we produce 85 per cent of the global energy based on fossil ones – coal, oil and gas”, Professor Taalas said, “and only 15 per cent based on nuclear, hydro and renewables. And to be successful in implementation of the Paris Agreement we should reverse those numbers in the coming decades.” China number one Highlighting the need for the global community to tackle emissions, the WMO head explained that the biggest polluters “used to be Europe and North America, USA, but China has become number the one emitter – along with “fairly strong growth in the emissions of non-OECD countries” too. This demonstrates that global perspective and strategy is needed to solve this problem, Professor Taalas said. The European Union or USA, or China, can’t solve it alone, “you have to have all of the countries involved.” While Governments understand that this is a challenge, so too does the private sector, he added, noting that it was “more and more interested in finding solutions”.

304-> FROM THE FIELD: Niger supporting the most vulnerable, as crises mount
The number of people requiring humanitarian assistance in Niger, a country which the UN humanitarian agency, OCHA, says is “being assaulted on all fronts”, is expected to increase in 2020. Currently, around 10 per cent of the population of the West African country, around 2.3 million people, requires humanitarian aid to survive. Conflict, climate change and the arrival of refugees from neighboring countries have all combined to drive up the number of people who are not getting enough to eat, in what is already one of the world’s poorest nations. But now, the Nigerien government, with the support of UN agencies, is helping the most vulnerable people. The UN humanitarian agency’s Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, Ursula Mueller, recently travelled to Niger to meet some of the those who are benefitting.

306-> COP25: Italy and Mexico pave the way on climate education
A commitment by Italy and Mexico to ramp up climate and environmental education has been welcomed by the UN office which supports global efforts to respond to climate change. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change ( ), expressed hope that more nations will follow their initiative, announced this week at the UN COP25 climate change conference in Madrid. Ms. Espinosa described the countries’ commitment to equipping a new generation with the knowledge, awareness and skills to tackle climate change as a key contribution to realizing the goals of the , which aims to keep global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. I welcome the initiative by Italy and Mexico to make part of their school curricula and I look forward to more countries factoring in climate education into their national plans ahead of >     “Climate change should be included in all school curricula and should play a central role in updated Nationally Determined Contributions”, she said, referring to countries’ efforts to reduce the emissions that cause global warming. “I look forward towards more countries factoring in climate education into their national climate action plans.” Compulsory climate education needed The hopes there will be a critical mass of countries by the time COP 26 rolls around next year in the Scottish city of Glasgow. Italy and Mexico are encouraging other nations to prioritize climate education. “Young people are demanding that governments take climate change far more seriously. There are many areas of society where we must act, and act with increased ambition: compulsory education on these topics needs to be a key part of this national and international response to the big issues of our time”, said Lorenzo Fioramonti, Italy’s Minister of Education, Innovation and Research. Martha Delgado, Vice Minister of Global Affairs in Mexico’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said her country has incorporated mandatory environmental education into the constitution as the first step in a new comprehensive plan. “Great transformations can only be achieved through knowledge, awareness and the sense of collaboration”, she said. “We are convinced that environmental education is the route to meeting , an essential tool to fight the climate crisis and can prompt a profound cultural change to contribute to our planet’s sustainability.” Earth Day milestone a catalyst The two countries propose that other nations can use the celebration of Earth Day in April as the occasion to announce their plans for climate and environmental education. The 2020 commemoration also marks the 50th anniversary of Earth Day and the birth of the environmental movement. Kathleen Rogers, President of the Earth Day Network, pointed out that environmental literacy had been at the core of Earth Day since its inception, but that governments had not gone far enough. “Young people, through movements such as Fridays for Future, have been asking governments to tell the truth about the climate and environmental emergencies that we are now facing - ‘telling the truth’ needs to happen in the schools and universities, and needs to happen now”, she said. The Congregation for Catholic Institutes of the Holy See also has chosen Earth Day 2020 as a preparatory meeting for the Global Compact on Education to be launched by Pope Francis next May. The Compact will promote a global commitment that also teaches new generations respect for humankind and nature.

307-> COVID-19: ‘Unparalleled economic shock’ threatens development hopes and gains
As the diverse and severe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be felt across the world, an “unparalleled economic shock” is putting development gains at risk, the UN chief told a meeting of high-powered business leaders on Wednesday. “Unemployment has skyrocketed. Temporary business closures are becoming permanent. Rebuilding to pre-crisis levels of employment and output may take years”, told at a virtual gathering of the Global Investors for Sustainable Development Alliance (GISD). "We need to ensure the economic damage that Maldives & other island nations are suffering as a result of is not repeated permanently by or environmental degradation." -      He that as the poorest and vulnerable continue to suffer most – “from job losses and illness, from overwhelmed and insufficient health systems and a lack of social safety nets” – the world is being thrown “even more off track in our efforts to achieve the (SDGs). Opportunity out of crisis The UN chief maintained that rebuilding, must mean a “fairer, greener and more resilient global economy, that leaves no one behind”. “There are positive signs that this moment could provide the opening for transformations that have been long in the making, but perhaps needed a push”, Mr. Guterres asserted. Highlighting the as “the world’s agreed framework”; the as a path to mobilize resources and the on climate change, as the pact to rein in greenhouse gas emissions, he underscored the importance of aligning economic and social values. “This means businesses acting in the interest of stakeholders, not just shareholders, and integrating sustainability into their operations”, he spelled out. Shifting priorities The Secretary-General stressed the importance of ensuring that environmental and social impacts are factored into all financial decisions. He outlined how by shifting public international finance towards sustainable sectors, and aligning private financial flows to achieve Net Zero emissions, capital can be channeled into developing and emerging economies, “countering the forces of fragmentation that this crisis threatens to unleash”. While acknowledging that has derailed many strategies and shifted the focus from long-term planning to immediate demands, Mr. Guterres asserted that it “underscores the need to think long term, build resilience and limit the impact of future crises.” In closing, he foresaw that crises in general will become increasingly more multi-layered and complex, “stretching already limited resources and causing more widespread human suffering". “I call on you to seize this moment of crisis to shape our future for the better” concluded the UN chief.

308-> Throughout COVID-19 recovery, 'plummeting’ clean energy costs can help climate action
As COVID-19 hits the fossil fuel industry, a new UN report published on Wednesday shows that renewable energy is more cost-effective than ever – providing an opportunity to prioritize clean energy in national economic recovery packages and bring the world closer to meeting the goals of the .  The new report, , is a collaboration between the UN Environment Programme ( ), Frankfurt School-UNEP Collaborating Centre, and energy financing company, BloombergNEF. New report shows that renewable energy⚡️ is more cost-effective than ever – providing an opportunity to prioritize clean energy in economic recovery packages & bring the world closer to meeting the goals.  Against the backdrop of governments injecting huge amounts of money into their economies to offset the impact of lockdowns, UNEP chief Inger Andersen; Nils Stieglitz, President of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management; and Jon Moore, Chief Executive BloombergNEF, maintain in the foreword that “putting these dollars into renewables will buy more generation capacity than ever before”, and help countries deliver on stronger climate action. Tell-all numbers The report illustrates that apart from large hydro-power generation, in 2019, renewable energy grew by a record 184 gigawatts (GW). \ Although this was a 12 per cent jump over the previous year, the 2019-dollar investment was only one per cent higher. Meanwhile, technology improvements, economies of scale and fierce competition, have prompted the cost of wind and solar electricity to continue to drop over the last decade, resulting in and 83 per cent price drop for electricity from new solar photovoltaic plants, in the second half of 2019. Although this represents good progress, the report notes that “there is room to do much more”. Looking ahead Nations and corporations have made clean energy commitments over the next decade, for 826GW of new non-hydro renewable power by 2030, at a likely cost of around $1 trillion. However, these commitments fall far short of what is needed to limit the rise in global temperatures, to well under 2 degrees Celsius under the , and also falls short of last decade’s achievements, which saw around 1,200GW of new capacity, at a cost of $2.7 trillion. “This lack of ambition can be rectified in economic recovery packages”, assured Ms. Andersen, Mr. Stieglitz and Mr. Moore, adding that by “simply repeating the investment of the last decade, over the next, would buy far more clean energy than it did before”. The COVID factor The slump that the coronavirus has created in the fossil fuels sector, combined with the resilience of clean energy, have made it clear that renewable energy is a smart investment, says the report. "The chorus of voices calling on Governments to use their COVID -19 recovery packages to create sustainable economies is growing”, Ms. Andersen. And the report’s findings highlight that renewable energy is one of the smartest, most cost-effective investments going. “If governments take advantage of the ever-falling price tag of renewables to put clean energy at the heart of COVID -19 economic recovery, instead of subsidizing the recovery of fossil-fuel industries, they can take a big step towards clean energy and a healthy natural world – which ultimately is the best insurance policy against global pandemics”, concluded the UNEP chief.

309-> Inaction over climate emergency ‘not an option’ says UN Assembly chief
Inaction when it comes to the fight back against damaging climate change is not an option, the told a major energy conference in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Tijani Muhammad-Bande was addressing the International Organization for Renewable Energy High-Level meeting on the particular threat faced by Small Island Developing States, or SIDS, and their partners in development. “Inaction will put at risk all life on earth as we know it”, warned the veteran Nigerian diplomat. “Inaction will only lead to more severe and extreme weather events, land degradation and deforestation, loss of biodiversity, pollution and acidification of oceans, global food insecurity as well as drought and floods.” More than 1,500 delegates including senior ministers, heads of international and regional organizations together with finance leaders and private sector executives are meeting for the 10th session of the International Renewable Energy Agency Assembly (IRENA), in the United Arab Emirates. “Despite our collective disappointment with the international community’s inability to reach consensus on vital issues during the last Climate Change Conference (COP 25), we are here to chart a way forward, with respect to a related matter: renewable energy,” said Mr. Muhammad-Bande. “Inaction will lead to continued sea level rise, risking the displacement of 280 million people from coastal areas and islands by 2050”, he reminded the session. “Climate change is the single greatest security and development threat facing SIDS, despite this being a crisis not of their making. SIDS are bearing the climate crisis’ most immediate and most severe consequences, including greater recurrence of devastating natural disasters that erase development gains and create additional debt burdens.” He noted that rising sea levels put the low-lying nations and their entire infrastructure at risk, literally eating away territory, “with some states at risk of being partially or fully submerged in the not too distant future.” Help SIDS thrive, not just survive The international community must “exert all efforts” to ensure that the civilizations that have settled on small island States for often thousands of years, “are not only safeguarded but thrive in the future”, he added. Climate change is indifferent to borders and is thus not amenable to ‘national’ solutions. We are all in this together.” The General Assembly’s top official told the room that “we are duty-bound to ensure that no one is left behind, and that we reach the farthest left behind first. Commitments to assist in funding the SDGs, including climate action, have been reiterated. Sadly, action has lagged far behind. We need to reverse this before it is too late for our SIDS brothers and sisters, and indeed for us all.” SIDS were a key focus during September’s opening week of the Assembly, when a high-level summit was convened to discuss their vulnerability, and the search for solutions, on the fronline of the climate crisis. “Small Island Developing States are a special case for sustainable development, said the UN chief, António Guterres, during the late September meeting. They require the concerted long-term attention and investment of the entire international community”, . Mr. Muhammad-Bande said that despite all the challenges, SIDS are still leading the way in implementing their ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 to limit climate change to well below 2 degrees Celsius. More need from the international community “It is the international community that is now required to do more to support and match their efforts, including by facilitating concessionary financing for SIDS’ adaptation and mitigation initiatives. IRENA’s work, as one of the custodians of ‘SDG 7: Sustainable Energy for All’, is vital for its implementation and a just transition to the new green economy globally”, he added. “Time is running out for the woman losing her livelihood to climate-induced desertification; for the child who will have to abandon her home to a rapidly-rising sea level; and for the communities that will have to build back only to be washed away again.”

310-> FROM THE FIELD: Adapting to Lesotho’s changing climate
Living in the African mountain kingdom of Lesotho comes with its fair share of challenges, including land degradation and climate change, which are upending traditional farming practices. Farmers in Lesotho have to cope with droughts, rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. And, as the changing climate forces more people to migrate, new conflicts are being triggered. Ecosystems have been pushed to their limits by over-cultivation, overgrazing, and over-harvesting, as communities are forced to adopt measures that push the land beyond its capacity, while Lesotho’s people, the Basotho, suffer the consequences. The UN Development Programme ( ), in collaboration with the Government to help farmers adapt, and become more resilient, with innovative programmes aimed at transforming the way they plant crops, raise livestock, and manage their natural resources. In from UNDP, learn more about these projects, and the inspirational example of community leader Maitumeleng Mabaleka, who has learned new farming techniques to improve her income, and her family’s wellbeing.

311-> An important opportunity lost as COP25 ends in compromise, but Guterres declares 'we must not give up'
Negotiations at the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid finally ended on Sunday, wrapping up an event which saw much progress made by the private sector, and by national, regional and local governments. However, there was widespread disappointment that no overall consensus was reached on increased climate ambition. I am disappointed with the results of . The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation & finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up. UN chief António Guterres expressed his feelings on Twitter, but refused to see the conference as a defeat, and wrote that he is “more determined than ever to work for 2020 to be the year in which all countries commit to do what science tells us is necessary to reach carbon neutrality in 2050 and a no more than 1.5 degree temperature rise”. However, by Friday, when the conference had been expected to end, agreement on some important issues had been reached by negotiators, for example on capacity building, a gender programme, and technology, but an overall deal was held up over disagreement on the larger, and more contentious issues dealing with loss and damage caused by man-made climate change, as well as financing for adaptation. Weary negotiators worked through Friday night, at the request of the Chilean president of the COP, but a draft version of the outcome text released on Saturday morning was reported to have underwhelmed all parties to the negotiations, with representatives of NGOs and civil society describing it as unacceptable, and a betrayal of the commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. At 3pm local time on Saturday afternoon, a press conference was held by the COP organisers, explaining that the negotiators were still hard at work, aiming to “show the outside world that we can deliver, that multilateralism works." By Saturday evening, there was still no sign of a deal, prompting acclaimed 16-year-old activist Greta Thunberg, one of the high-profile speakers at the Climate Action Summit held at UN Headquarters in September, to that “it seems like COP25 in Madrid is falling apart right now. The science is clear, but the science is being ignored”. Improved commitments announced at all levels Despite the disappointment voiced at the contents of the outcome document, several announcements made during the two-week conference to indicate progress. The European Union, for example, committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, and 73 nations announced that they will submit an enhanced climate action plan (or Nationally Determined Contribution). A groundswell of ambition for a cleaner economy was also evident at a regional and local level, with 14 regions, 398 cities, 786 businesses and 16 investors are working towards achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. Discussions held during COP25 broadened the understanding of the science behind the climate crisis, and the critical need for urgency: the UN Global Compact, which works with the private sector, announced that 177 companies have now agreed to set science-based climate targets that align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. That is double the number of companies that signed up to the pledge at the Climate Action Summit, representing private sector emissions equivalent to the annual total CO2 emissions of France. Scottish bagpipes were heard in Madrid on Friday, marking next year’s climate conference, to be held in Glasgow, Scotland. COP26, due to be held in December 2020, is being touted as an important milestone in the fight against climate change, because countries will be expected to present upgraded national climate plans, that go beyond commitments made under the 2015 .

312-> First Person: Innovation brewing at Hawaii coffee farm
Innovation and experimentation are helping a coffee farm in the US state of Hawaii to prosper in a competitive market, an approach which has helped the company to get through the global COVID-19 pandemic. What do AI and robotics have to do with a good cup of coffee? Fred Cowell, of the Kauai Coffee Company, has the answers!  CC  Fred Cowell is the General Manager of Kauai Coffee Company on the island of Kauai in the Pacific Ocean Hawaiian archipelago, which has the largest coffee farm in the United States accounting for 25 to 30 per cent of US production in any given year. He spoke to UN News about sustainability and innovation as part of an International Labour Organization photography project called “Dignity at Work: The American Experience” which is documenting the working life of people across the United States. “Technology is certainly helping us to do a better job. At Kauai Coffee Company, the technology we are looking at includes sensors, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. Sensors will potentially give us real-time feedback on conditions on the farm, which I like to call the “internet of farm.” AI has the potential to improve data analysis using those sensors. In fact, our team won an AgTech “Hackathon” (finding technological innovations in agriculture) in 2019 for demonstrating an AI-assisted camera that could learn to recognize ripe coffee. The concept would be used on our harvesters to give the human operators direct feedback on ground speed and shaker intensity to optimize volume and ripeness as they harvest the coffee. We have not yet put this into use, but it definitely has potential. More intelligent farming with better sensors and data processing is applicable to nearly all farming operations anywhere in the world, especially large farms. Robotics could minimize labour costs on repetitive tasks such as mowing and weed control. We deploy a drone to survey the land and to make aerial maps which can be shared digitally. A photograph or a 360-degree video provides a different perspective and allows me to communicate more effectively with colleagues about managing the farm. The impact of COVID-19 We have also used the drone to make an interactive virtual reality film of the estate, which shows all parts of our operation to our visitors. Before the pandemic, we  received more than 800 visitors a day and we, obviously, can’t let those people walk into the coffee growing areas, so the presentation with a virtual reality head-set is an excellent way to give them a literal overview of the farm and what goes on here. Farm and maintenance operations have continued during the COVID-19 outbreak, but with social distancing. The team has done a great job and we’ve even seen a decrease in safety incidents due to the increased awareness across the team. We’ve lost almost all our sales to tourists within the state following the closure of our visitor center but we’ve recently reopened with a much smaller footprint. Our mainly local sales are less than 10 per cent of pre-crisis volumes, but online sales have almost doubled and we’re now trying to understand the phenomenon clearly so that we can continue the momentum. Sustainability, biochar and micro-herds Technology goes hand in hand with sustainability which we are moving towards on the farm. We are very focused on soil nutrition. There are more microorganisms in a tablespoon of soil than there are people on Earth and there are a lot of tablespoons of soil here. Rather than injecting nutrients into the trees, which is like keeping an athlete alive on an IV, we're now recognizing that the health of the tree and the quality of that fruit depends on the health of the billions and trillions of microorganisms, what we sometimes call the micro-herd, that actually enable the plant to survive. Without the healthy vibrant microcosm of life in the soil, it's just dirt. Our main emphasis is on increasing the health of the soil and biochar (a charcoal-like substance that's made by burning organic material which can boost soil health and sequester carbon from the atmosphere) is one of the potential tools for that. Composting and using cover crops to improve the soil are our primary focus but inserting biochar into our composting material would be a great way to introduce it to our fields. I’ve been forcing myself and asking my team to do our best with the current situation but look beyond the shutdown and aftermath to those things that will make us more resilient three to five years from now. As an example, we just submitted a grant proposal to US Department of Agriculture to host an on-farm soil health demonstration centered on measurable economic impacts of composting and cover crops. Chocolate, coffee and culture Now that we have an established coffee plantation, we are looking at what can grown within the coffee. We’re considering pongamia trees to produce fuel oil or bio-diesel that could be used to power tractors.   We’re looking at maybe reintroducing macadamia nut trees as windbreaks. It’s not a great commodity crop, however, we could package it here and sell directly to our visitors which would be profitable. We could even grow cacao and produce chocolate-covered macadamia nuts and chocolate covered coffee for sale. We are focused on benefitting from technology but we also want to learn as much as we can from indigenous Hawaiian culture, which is very rich closely tied to the land. We don't harm the land in any way, contributing to erosion or degradation; we actually want to grow coffee that borrows from and honours the Hawaiian traditions and in this way create a product that is truly meaningful. I consider myself a steward for this land. It will be here forever, but I will not. In Hawaiian culture we have a word, kuleana, which means responsibility and stewardhsip. So, it is my duty to look after this land for those who will follow me whilst recognizing the contributions of those who came before me. Post-pandemic, we know that Hawaii and Kauai will likely have fewer visitors which will force us to seek creative ways to communicate our message of aloha (Hawaiian word for welcome), sustainability, and community to our customer base.

313-> Social, cultural diversity ‘an enormous richness, not a threat’ Guterres declares calling on investment for a harmonious future
Like a well-tuned orchestra, successful modern societies have a balance of diversity and culture, that is a source of “enormous richness, not a threat” said the UN chief on Monday, speaking alongside UN Messenger of Peace, acclaimed cellist Yo-Yo Ma in the Austrian capital, Vienna. He was speaking against the backdrop of European Parliamentary elections in recent days, which showed a surge in support away from political parties in the centre ground, towards those espousing more nationalist and anti-immigrant policy platforms. “This is the world we want: a world in which contributions from everybody, everywhere matter” - at music workshop and in Vienna.  Secretary-General told those gathered for the Day of Action that it was particularly important “in the present debate in Europe” to adopt “a universal perspective for peace, for human dignity, for human rights” and the values enshrined in the . “ . And that is a richness, not a threat”. Like an orchestra featuring musicians from around the world, they need to practice to play harmoniously: “It is the same with society” he added. “Diversity requires investment. Social, cultural, political, religious; sometimes investment in social cohesion – to make sure that in a diverse society, every community feels that their identity is being respected – like the identity of the violinist needs to be respected, together with each instrumentalist. Hailing music as a fundamental tool to promote UN values, he said the Day of Action was fundamental to the future of the Organization “especially when we are also discussing the dramatic situation of human mobility”. Migration too, needs investment, instead of letting people smugglers and traffickers profit from it, and letting fear of migrants fester, “we need to invest in international cooperation, we need to invest in adequate forms of migration”, he said. Guterres lauds 40 years of UN in Vienna, Austrian World Summit after meeting Austrian President Alexander Van Der Bellen, Mr. Guterres praised the nation for its support for the UN Office at Vienna over the past 40 years, home to many key agencies and bodies. As one of the main UN headquarters, he said he was convinced the work done in Vienna would help preserve peace and security for the world, during trying times. He looked ahead to Tuesday’s Austrian World Summit on climate, saying that taking part was essential to him, having convened the Climate Action Summit this coming September. Fresh from a major , Mr. Guterres said that to rescue an island State such as Tuvalu – parts of which are already sinking below the waves due to rising sea levels – was “to rescue the planet”. “The climate crisis is something that will have an impact on the lives of everybody everywhere”, said the UN chief. “And to reverse the present trend in which climate change is running faster than we are is an absolute must. And for that, we need in 2020, countries to assume engagements much stronger than the ones that were assumed in Paris.  He said nations had to commit “to a much more ambitious set of measures in mitigation in adaptation, mitigation and in finance. And I must tell you that I consider absurd that we are taxing salaries, we are taxing income, and not taxing carbon”.

314-> UN chief lauds Fijians as ‘natural global leaders’ on climate, environment, hails ‘symbiotic relationship’ with land and sea
Fiji’s strong traditions of community and social responsibility, and its “symbiotic relationship” with its surroundings, has made its people “natural global leaders on climate and the environment”, United Nations told the nation’s Parliament on Thursday. “Fiji has taken on the sceptics and the deniers” in a , he said, “and the world is listening”. The Secretary-General outlined that Fiji was the first small island State to preside over the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) and in 2017, became the first emerging market to issue a sovereign “green bond”, dedicated to environmental conservation. It introduced an Environment and Climate Adaptation Levy; launched a rural electrification programme to reduce diesel emissions; and has relocated villages and established guidelines on how to support people displaced due to climate change. . chief continues his journey in the Pacific islands to fight the "battle of his life" for . His second day in Fiji: “Other countries in the region can learn from your example”, he congratulated. Mr. Guterres pointed to the Fijian legislature as another of the country’s important achievements calling it “a place of inclusiveness, equality, diversity and tolerance”. “We need that spirit more than ever at this time”, he said, noting rising anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim rhetoric, the persecution of Christians and other forms of xenophobia and racism. The UN chief stressed the importance of showing solidarity in response to a “dangerous upsurge in hatred” and to combat the hate speech “coarsening our public dialogue in many countries and regions of the world”. Citing the and the ( ) as “our blueprint for a fair globalization built on prosperous, peaceful and resilient societies on a healthy planet”, he commended Fiji for being the first parliament in the world to undertake an SDG self-assessment. Climate change defines our time Noting that climate change is “the defining issue of our time”, Mr. Guterres acknowledged how Fijians have suffered cyclones, floods and droughts, or lost their homes, schools or crops to rising seas, saying “the United Nations stands with you, I stand with you”. He flagged the importance of financing, underscoring that given the amount of climate change that has already occurred, investment in adaptation “is especially crucial” in the Pacific region. “We need developed countries to fulfill the pledges they have made to support action in developing countries – including by mobilizing the public and private sector to reach $100 billion per year to support mitigation and adaptation”, the UN chief said, adding that the “successful replenishment of the Green Climate Fund” is also vital. To help generate ambition, Mr. Guterres announced that he is convening a Climate Action Summit in September. “My message to leaders is very clear: Don’t come with a speech; come with a plan”, he asserted. “I want leaders to showcase their plans to enhance Nationally Determined Contributions by 2020, and to cut emissions radically by 2025” by ending subsidies for fossil fuels and unsustainable agriculture and shifting towards renewable energy, electric vehicles and climate-smart practices. Keys to sustainable growth, peace and prosperity: Carbon pricing must reflect the true cost of emissions, the UN chief said, “from climate risk to the health hazards of air pollution”. That means not constructing any coal plants beyond 2020 and replacing jobs in fossil fuel industries with “cleaner, healthier alternatives, so the transformation is inclusive, profitable and just”. Noting “rampant” overfishing and plastic pollution that is “poisoning and depleting” the oceans, he emphasized that “the world must do more”. “The coming years will be a vital period to save the planet and to achieve sustainable, inclusive human development,” he said. “The alarm bells keep ringing”. “We must address this global emergency with ambition and urgency”, the Secretary-General concluded, adding “every country has a role to play”.

315-> Mozambique cyclones a ‘wake-up call’ to boost resistance: UN weather agency
The havoc caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth across Mozambique is “a wake-up call” for vulnerable countries “to build resistance" against further high-impact tropical storms, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to climate change, according to the United Nations weather agency chief. Devastation caused by and is a wake-up call about more high-impact tropical cyclones, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to , says WMO fact-finding report released for reconstruction donor conference  A World Meteorological Organization ( ) fact-finding mission to Mozambique recommended on Wednesday a package of disaster-risk-reduction priorities to strengthen the country’s early warning systems and reduce damage due to weather, climate and water-related hazards. “Mozambique needs to build resilience”, WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a message to an international pledging conference to secure support for reconstruction, on Saturday. “Although the number of tropical cyclones globally is expected to reduce in the future, the number of most intense tropical cyclones (category 4 and 5), associated with more rainfall, will increase in a warming climate,” he said. He asserted that future sea level rise “will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions” and raise flooding concerns, “particularly for low-lying cities such as Beira”, which was inundated by the cyclones in March and April. It also draws attention to Mozambique’s vulnerability to floods from both rivers and sea. The fact-finding team said that a $27 million investment is needed to strengthen meteorological and water supply sectors. This includes reconstruction, rehabilitation and modernization of infrastructure and equipment, land surveys for flood-risk mapping and satellite rainfall estimation and forecast training. The team of meteorologists and hydrologists, headed by WMO’s Filipe Lúcio, will present a report to an international pledging conference for Mozambique, taking place on Friday and Saturday in Beira. ‘A salutary warning’ On 14 March, months-worth of rain fell in a matter of hours around the coastal city as Idai provoked one of the worst disasters to ever hit the southern hemisphere. Disaster management practices require: The cyclone and subsequent flooding killed more than 600 people, injured an estimated 1,600, affected more than 1.8 million and caused an estimated $773 million in damages to buildings, infrastructure and agriculture. “In times of floods, Mozambicans seek safety on roofs of buildings. But the ferocity of Idai’s winds blew the roofs away”, said Mr. Lucio. “It is a salutary warning about the future scale of the combined challenges from urbanization and climate change-related sea level rise and extreme weather”. The fact-finding team’s visit coincided with Cyclone Kenneth, the most intense tropical cyclone ever known to have hit the Cabo Delgado province, on 25 April. According to the report, identified major weaknesses on preparedness, emergency coordination and response, including the lack of a back-up communication system for warning and emergency operations and an evacuation plan for cities, particularly in low-lying areas. Moreover, because Mozambique is downstream of nine major river basins, it is prone to devastating floods, but water use upstream can also exacerbated low flows during droughts. While climate change projections indicate a global decrease in numbers of tropical storms and cyclones, they signal possible increases in intensities and associated rainfall. And, assuming all other factors are equal, WMO predicts that sea-level rise will exacerbate the impact of storm surge on coastal regions.

316-> ‘Disaster resilient’ farming reduces agriculture risks, yields economic gains, says new UN agriculture agency report
A scale of economic gains through easy-to-implement "disaster resilient" farming practices was revealed on Monday at the launch of a new study by the United Nations agriculture agency. According to by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), poor farmers can obtain significant economic gains and other benefits by implementing modified farming practices aimed at boosting their ability to cope with disasters and natural shocks. "The study makes clear that in most cases, disaster risk reduction (DRR) efforts on the farm make good economic sense: that investing in DDR early can save many dollars that would otherwise be spent on post-disaster rehabilitation," said Dominique Burgeon, Director of FAO Emergency and Resilience Division, in the foreword to the report. Affordable solutions, tangible benefits. Poor farmers👩‍🌾👨‍🌾 can obtain significant economic gains through easy-to-implement "disaster resilient" practices - new study.     Through multi-year trials on over 900 farms in 10 different countries, FAO stated that many of the low-cost farming innovations are within easy reach of poor farmers. And, they are much more than buffers against disasters. Examples include planting mangrove to protect coastal areas from floods, and shifting to rooftop water collection and irrigation systems. "Farm-level DRR good practices are often ‘no-regret’ measures’, Ms. Burgeon continued, explaining that “they prove effective in providing added benefits even in the absence of hazards". FAO's study illustrates that good practices have considerable potential to reduce damages wrought on developing world agriculture by smaller-scale, lower-intensity disasters. While these garner less attention than large-scale hazards, like dry or cold spells, they represent a constant problem for the 2.5 billion people who rely on small-scale agriculture. Win-win for small-scale farmers On average, DRR practices have generated benefits 2.2 times higher than practices previously used by farmers, including in increased agricultural production and avoided hazard-associated risks. In hazard scenarios, for every dollar invested in DRR, the farmer achieved $3.7 in terms of avoided loss or return. And under non-hazard conditions, the return rose even further, to $4.5. These practices can benefit billions of people, preventing economic losses and delivering economic benefits at regional and national levels. Greater upfront investment in anticipatory measures is also more cost efficient than post-disaster spending on reconstruction and recovery, the report says. This can be done through farmer-to-farmer replication, or when local farmers begin to adopt new techniques after observing the benefits their neighbors gained when doing so. This method requires little investment or institutional support. Another avenue is through large-scale efforts that require government and private sector support to promote the practices at scale. Crucially, both pathways depend on good infrastructure, adequate investment and an enabling environment. Agricultural development policy, planning and extension work should treat disaster risk reduction as a priority, the report stressed.

317-> Tuesday’s Daily Brief: Children in armed conflict, Ebola in DR Congo, human rights in Bahrain, and two International Days
Our main stories today cover: A new report on children and armed conflict, a day to combat human trafficking; funds needed to fight Ebola in DR Congo; UN rights office condemns the execution of two Bahraini citizens; and International Day of Friendship New UN report shows record numbers of children killed, maimed in conflict A new UN report has found that 2018 was the worst year on record for children caught up in armed conflict; the year saw the highest number killed or hurt since the United Nations began monitoring the violation. In the 20 conflict situations monitored in the 2018 edition of the , released Tuesday, more than 12,000 children were killed or maimed over that year. A “disheartened” said that he was “particularly appalled” by the unprecedented numbers of grave violations committed against children. Children continued to be used in combat, particularly in Somalia, Nigeria and Syria: some 7,000 have been drawn into frontline fighting roles around the world during 2018. They also continued to be abducted, to be used in hostilities or for sexual violence: more than half of the 2,500 reported cases were in Somalia. Read about it . Conflict, climate change among factors that increase ‘desperation that enables human trafficking to flourish’, says UN chief To mark the , UN has stressed that “human trafficking is a heinous crime that affects every region of the world” – especially women and children. According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime ( ), some 72 per cent of detected victims are women and girls, and the percentage of child victims has more than doubled from 2004 to 2016. “Most detected victims are trafficked for sexual exploitation; victims are also trafficked for forced labour, recruitment as child soldiers and other forms of exploitation and abuse”, Mr. Guterres said in his on the Day, marked annually on 30 July. our story. UNICEF budget must triple to fight DRC Ebola outbreak Updating the press on the deadly Ebola outbreak in the north-east region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Jerome Pfaffmann, a Health Specialist for the UN Children’s Fund ( ) said that the agency would have to triple its budget to respond to the crisis. The spokesperson underlined the complexity of the outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which are facing a public health emergency and a humanitarian crisis at the same time – including conflict and a major measles outbreak. UNICEF has already vaccinated more than 40,000 children against measles and plans to put in place a programme to address acute humanitarian and social needs. Execution of Bahrainis condemned by UN human rights office, amid allegations of unfair trial The execution of two Bahraini citizens on Friday has been by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, in a statement released on Tuesday. The executions took place despite concerns of Michelle Bachelet, the UN rights chief, that the men’s confessions were obtained under torture, and that they were denied due process and guarantees of a fair trial. The two men were tried in a mass hearing with 58 other defendants and convicted on charges of terrorism. A UN spokesperson said the High Commissioner is “very concerned” about the fate of other detainees at risk of imminent execution on death row in Bahrain and has called on the Bahraini Government to halt all pending executions. Spread some kindness, on International Day of Friendship The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is encouraging us all to brighten someone’s day, and spread a bit of kindness, on the UN’s International Day of Friendship. The call is part of UNICEF’s campaign to end violence in and around schools where, worldwide, around half of all students aged between 13 and 15, have reported experiencing some form of violence. The campaign includes a short featuring K-pop superstars BTS singing their hit single “Answer: Love Myself”, showing young people confronting school violence.

318-> With a premature death every five seconds, air pollution is violation of human rights, says UN expert
An independent UN expert said on Monday that the failure of governments across the world to ensure clear air, constitutes a “violation of the rights to life, health and well-being, as well as the right to live in a healthy environment.” Ahead of the 2019 on Wednesday, which has air pollution as its theme, David Boyd, the UN’s Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, called on states to take urgent action to improve air quality in order to fulfill their human rights obligations. Air pollution is a deadly, man-made problem, responsible for the early deaths of some seven million people every year, around 600,000 of whom are children. It is estimated that 90 per cent of the world’s population breathe polluted air. Every five seconds, somebody around the world dies prematurely as a result. In a statement, Mr. Boyd said that uncontaminated air is a core component of the right to a healthy environment, together with clean water and adequate sanitation, healthy and sustainably produced food, a non-toxic environment, healthy biodiversity and a safe climate. “The right to a healthy environment is fundamental to human well-being and is legally recognized by over 150 States at the national and regional levels. It should be globally reaffirmed to ensure the enjoyment of this right by everyone, everywhere while upholding the human rights principles of universality and non-discrimination.” Mr. Boyd described the efforts of China, host of this year’s World Environment Day, to tackle air pollution, as a “success story.” Although the Chinese capital, Beijing, has become synonymous with dirty air over the past few decades, a concerted effort by local and regional authorities has seen an improved situation in recent years, with the concentration of fine particulates – the tiny, invisible airborne particles that are largely responsible for deaths and illnesses from air pollution – falling by a third. The UN expert reiterated his recommended measures for reducing air pollution, contained in a presented to the UN in March. These include monitoring air quality and impacts on human health; assessing sources of air pollution; establishing air quality legislation; and developing air quality action plans. “In celebration of World Environment Day, I urge States to take bold action to beat air pollution, improve health, address climate change, and fulfill their human rights obligations,” the expert said. World Environment Day, celebrated since 1974, is the United Nations day for encouraging worldwide awareness and action to protect the environment. It is organized around a theme that addresses a particularly pressing environmental concern. In a released ahead of the Day, UN said that, as well as claiming millions of lives every year, and damaging children’s development, many air pollutants are also causing global warming. Mr. Guterres called climate change an “existential threat,” and pressed the international community to “tax pollution, not people” and stop building coal plants.

319-> A dangerously hot climate, simmering political tensions: ‘This is not the summer of our youth,’ UN chief warns
Global warming and rising political tensions are dangerous and avoidable, told reporters on Thursday, previewing the UN’s upcoming , and spotlighting geopolitical hotspots. These extreme weather events are just the tip of the iceberg. And that iceberg is also rapidly melting  Briefing the press at UN Headquarters in New York, Mr. Guterres noted that, while there have always been hot summers, this is “ ”, but a climate emergency.

July is also on course to equal, or surpass the hottest month in recorded history, and 2015 to 2019 are likely to be the five hottest years on record. “If we do not take action on climate change now”, said Mr. Guterres, “these extreme weather events are just the tip of the iceberg. And that iceberg is also rapidly melting.” UN Climate Summit: ‘ticket to entry is bold action’ We have updated our roundup of July , with more information on temperatures, ice, wildfires and . Details at (link: )   Turning to the Climate Action Summit, slated for 23 September in New York, the UN chief said that the ticket to entry – for governments, business and civil society – is “bold action and much greater ambition”. This will be needed if the world is to limit temperature increases to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, by cutting 45 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. “Beautiful speeches”, he continued, are therefore not enough: leaders need to come to New York on September 23 with concrete plans to reach these goals. Mr Guterres said that many solutions are available and are already being implemented. These include the growing use of technology that is rendering renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels; the planting of millions of trees to reverse deforestation, and remove carbon dioxide from the environment, the finance world increasingly pricing carbon risks into their decision-making process and calling on leaders to phase out fossil fuel subsidies; and leading businesses are recognizing that, in order to avoid huge losses, now is the time to move from the “grey”, polluting economy, to the green economy. “We need rapid and deep change in how we do business, generate power, build cities and feed the world.” Political heat also rising Mr. Guterres also turned his attention to tensions in global politics, notably in the Persian Gulf, friction between China and the US, and between nuclear-armed states. A minor miscalculation in the Persian Gulf, he said, could lead to a major confrontation. Referring to recent incidents in the Strait of Hormuz – which include the diversion of a British-flagged oil tanker by Iran, the US destruction of an Iranian drone, and the UK decision to provide a naval escort for tankers – the UN chief stressed the need to respect the rights and duties related to navigation through the Strait, and its adjacent waters, in accordance with international law. Concerning China-US relations, Mr. Guterres said that the lessons of the Cold War must be learned, in order to avoid a new one, in which two competing blocs emerge, each with their own dominant currency, trade rules, and contradictory geopolitical and military rules. “With leadership committed to strategic cooperation and to managing competing interests”, he said, “we can steer the world onto a safer path”. The imminent end of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty – described by the Secretary-General as a “landmark agreement that helped stabilize Europe and end the Cold War”, means that the world will lose an “invaluable brake” on nuclear war. States with nuclear arms capacity should, he continued, avoid destabilizing developments, and urgently seek a new path towards new international arms control measures. These include an extension of the so-called “New Start” agreement between the US and Russia; the 2020 Review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

320-> From philanthropy to profit: how clean energy is kickstarting sustainable development in East Africa
Until recently, Namacurra district, in the Zambezia province of Mozambique, some 1,500 km from the capital Maputo, did not have any basic services – such as schools, health centres, or even energy – connecting the region to the electricity grid would be extremely time-consuming, and costly. But a new UN-backed clean energy initiative looks set to change the outlook for Namacurra, and, within a matter of months, kickstart sustainable development for the benefit of the thousands of people, relocated to the area following the devastating rains of 2015, and it could herald an improved outlook for other economically disadvantaged parts of Africa. The United Nations human settlements programme, , and Portuguese energy company EDP, are constructing a solar energy system to supply 12 classrooms – which have been built to withstand 180 km per hour winds – with clean, renewable energy. This will have a huge impact on the community because, as well as enabling some 1,300 students to study at night, people living in the area will, for a small fee, be able to charge their mobile phones, and access the internet. They will also stand a better chance of surviving, when the next cyclones and floods hit the country: Mozambique has developed an early-warning system, with SMS alerts sent out by the government, but this only works in communities with access to energy. “As long as you can provide this service at a school, people will at least have access to communication with the outside world, which is the main handicap when an emergency strikes, recounts Juan Hurtato Martinez, UN-Habitat architect and manager of the project.  “So, it ensures that, in an emergency, they can receive the alarms quickly." Scaling up across east Africa Although the impetus for the project comes from EDPs philanthropic arm, the company sees it as a sensible investment in Africa, in line with the UN’s call for companies to play their part in the move to a “green economy,” that is not reliant on fossil fuels such as coal and gas. "The African continent is surely the continent with more natural resources – such as the sun, wind, water, biomass and others – that allow the use of renewable energies,” says Guilherme Collares Pereira, Director of International Relations at EDP. “Therefore, it makes total sense to intervene in the market that has resources and that has the needs.” Renewable energies can enable universal energy access to be achieved  Some 600 million people in Africa are without access to electricity, Pereira points out, and it is “more than proven that renewable energies can enable, in a cheaper, faster and more efficient way, universal energy access to be achieved.” The project in the district of Namacurra is one of six, in Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawi, that will be receiving support from EDP. At the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya, which hosts more than 186,000 people, a mini-grid will supply pay-as-you-go electricity to refugees according to their consumption needs. “It is a very interesting approach that can be replicated throughout the camp,” says Pereira, “but it can also be replicated in other refugee camps, not only in the Horn of Africa but all over the world.” Sustainability as a business opportunity For EDP, the is an opportunity, says Pereira. “Ten years ago, when we began involvement with these projects, we were guided more by our corporate responsibility policy, but nowadays it is more about business.” In 2018 the company decided to invest €12 million in companies that are already working with renewable energy in East Africa. “At the moment, they are not as profitable as traditional EDP businesses,” he notes, “but this is a journey, and we are discovering how the process develops. So, in the next couple of years, when we are ready, we can invest in more companies and grow them in preparation for entry into other markets.” “The potential is enormous: renewable energy technology is getting better, more efficient and more resilient. There is also an abundance of mechanisms and even financing from countries and the international community to support these projects.  Everything is in place for its growth and it is imperative that the private sector enters this market." What is SDG 12?

321-> Accelerate climate action and raise ambition, urges UN chief
As the impact of climate change worsens around the world, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has called on the global community to redouble efforts to help countries respond to climate shocks, especially the most vulnerable. “I am encouraged to see climate action taking hold, at all scales, at all levels, involving an ever-wider coalition of actors and institutions,” said the Secretary-General, at a at the UN Headquarters, in New York. “But we need to do more,” he underlined. In his remarks, the UN chief said that he will be travelling to Bonn to participate in the UN Climate Change Conference ( ), where, he will urge efforts to accelerate climate action as well as to raise ambition to do more. “The window of opportunity to meet the 2-degree target may close in 20 years or less – and we may have only five years to bend the emissions curve towards 1.5 degrees,” he said, noting the need for a further 25 per cent cut in emissions by 2020. Speaking on the need for bolstering finance, Mr. Guterres called for mobilizing the agreed $100 billion annually for developing countries, which is crucial to spur action. He also said that in September 2019, he will convene a Climate Summit to mobilize political and economic energy at the highest levels. “I ask world leaders to show courage in combatting entrenched interests; wisdom in investing in the opportunities of the future; and compassion in caring what kind of world we build for our children,” he said. “As a former politician myself, I have no doubt that in today's world, this is the path to progress today and a meaningful legacy for tomorrow.” Also at the stakeout, the UN chief informed that before Bonn, he will visit the Philippines to attend the UN-ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Summit, and after participating at COP23, he will deliver an address at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London on counter-terrorism and human rights on Thursday, 16 November. “As the world responds to modern terrorism, our goal must be to win the fight while upholding our values,” he said.

322-> Photo Story: World pushing for faster climate action at Bonn conference
One year after the entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement, the annual Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is an opportunity for nations around the world to show their ambition for climate action and their determination to keep their promises under the theme of “Further, Faster – Together.” The international community has been meeting in Bonn, Germany, for the past two weeks to tackle climate change. One year after the entry into force of the Paris Climate Agreement, the annual Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) is an opportunity for nations around the world to show their ambition for climate action and their determination to keep their promises under the theme of “Further, Faster – Together.” The gathering, known as COP23, started last Monday, with technical discussions over the , and featured high-level events this week, including an address by UN .  While senior officials addressed the international community, one of the most reported stories was of 12-year-old Timoci Naulusala, whose village in Fiji’s Tailevu province was hit by a cyclone last year. “My once beautiful village is now a barren and empty wasteland,” he told the thousands of participants. “Climate change is here to stay unless you do something about it.”

323-> On International Day, UN agency urges greater investment for sustainable agriculture in mountains
On International Mountain Day, the United Nations food security agency has called for greater focus on sustainable agriculture in highland regions around the globe to better respond to climate change impacts and migration challenges. “Investing in sustainable agriculture in mountain regions is central to the response to climate and migration challenges as it promotes the adaptation to and mitigation of climate change and reduces other root causes of migration such as rural poverty and food insecurity,” said Maria Helena Semedo, the Deputy Director-General at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), in a marking the . Across the world, some one billion mountain people – about 13 percent of the global population – are increasingly being impacted by the effects of climate change and climate-induced disasters. Furthermore, living in often geographically isolates areas and on the political and economic margins of their countries, they are more prone to hunger and poverty. As mountain people become more vulnerable, migration to urban areas and abroad increases. Those who remain are often women, left to manage the farms but with little access to credit, training and land tenure rights, added FAO in the release. In the release, the UN agency further noted that in an effort to address these challenges, some 60 countries and over 200 civil society organizations today to strengthen mountain people's and their environments' resilience to climate change, hunger and migration as well as to bolster the implementation of the . The commitments include reviews and updates by Governments to their development policies, integrating strategies and international development cooperation policies for sustainable mountain development and mountain ecosystem conservation. The pledge, made by members of the Mountain Partnership – an alliance founded in 2002 by Italy, Switzerland, FAO, the UN Environment Programme ( ) and over 300 members from other Governments, and intergovernmental, civil society and private sector organizations – also includes a focus on raising awareness on the importance of sustainable mountain development and mountain ecosystem conservation in all relevant international forums. Also in the news release, FAO announced the launch of its publication, , which recognizes the role of well managed mountain watersheds in supplying freshwater to humankind and reducing the risk of natural disasters for downstream communities. The publication presents lessons learned and recommendations based on a comparative review of 12 FAO-supported projects testing new watershed management approaches over the past decade in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Ecuador, the Gambia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Tanzania and Zambia.

324-> Now is a ‘pivotal time for climate action’ says UN chief, looking to ozone layer gains
With record-breaking heat once again enveloping the earth this year, United Nations António Guterres said it was also “a pivotal time for climate action”, marking  the International Day for the , on Sunday. When scientist revealed that chlorofluorocarbons, found mainly in refrigerants and aerosol sprays, were tearing a hole in the ozone layer - a fragile shield of gas that protects the earth and helps preserves life – the world responded with the Montreal Protocol. The landmark 1987 global agreement, heralded the phasing out of the production of ozone-depleting substances. “We can draw inspiration from the , a shining example of how the world can come together for people and planet,” added the UN chief. Phasing out ozone-depleting substances has not only helped protect the ozone layer but also contributed significantly to global efforts to address climate change. Moreover, it has protected human health and ecosystems by preventing some harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the earth. “Thanks to this global commitment,” Mr. Guterres stated, “the ozone layer is expected to return to its 1980 levels by mid-century.” “However,” he continued, “this work is not yet done.” We can draw inspiration from the Montreal Protocol, a shining example of how the world can come together for people and planet –  He explained that the landmark , which enters into force on 1 January 2019, sets its sights on hydrofluorocarbons; powerful climate-warming gases, still being used in cooling systems throughout the world. “So far,” Mr. Guterres said, “46 countries have ratified this new instrument,” as he called on all others to show their commitment to a healthier planet and “follow suit.” “I expect countries to demonstrate significant progress in implementing the Kigali Amendment at the Climate Summit I am convening in September 2019,” the Secretary-General stressed. For over three decades, the Montreal Protocol has done much more than helped repair the ozone layer. “It has shown us how environmental governance can respond to science, and how countries can come together to address a shared vulnerability,” said Mr. Guterres. “I call for that same spirit of common cause and, especially, greater leadership as we strive to implement the on climate change and mobilize the ambitious climate action we so urgently need at this time,” he concluded. Keep Cool and Carry On The theme for this year’s Ozone Day, commemorated annually on 16 September, is a “motivational rallying call” urging everyone to protect the ozone layer and climate under the Montreal Protocol. “The theme has two connotations – that our work of protecting the ozone layer also protects climate, and that the Montreal Protocol is a “cool” treaty, as exemplified by its outstanding success”, says the UN’s official webpage marking the day.

325-> ‘Invest in the future, not the past;’ green business key to winning war on climate change – UN chief
Those who fail to bet on a green economy will be living in a grey future, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned Tuesday, calling for greater ambition by governments, civil society, the private sector and finance partners to help tackle the global climate challenge. “ ,” the UN chief said, speaking at the opening of the One Planet Summit, in Paris, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron and Jim Yong Kim, the President of World Bank. “Renewables are now cheaper than coal-powered energy in dozens of developed and developing countries […] we need to invest in the future, not the past,” he added. The Summit, taking place on 12 December, the anniversary of the adoption of the historic , is providing an opportunity to fast-forward action on climate change. In his remarks, Mr. Guterres pointed to the large under-utilized global financial resources and called for ensuing that financing – which by its nature if forward-looking – is used future of people and the planet in addition to being used for profit. “It is a fact that fossil fuels remain heavily subsidized – meaning we are investing in our own doom,” he emphasized, noting cities, regions, states and territories across the globe along with thousands of private enterprises – including major oil and gas companies – are already taking climate action, resulting in new industries and markets as well as in healthier environments and more jobs. Finance is the key to successful climate action. We need more ambition – climate change is moving faster than we are and this is a war we cannot afford to lose.  “I have heard it said that the stone age did not end because we ran out of stones. We don’t have to wait to run out of coal and oil to end the age of fossil fuels,” he stated, adding: “The message is simple: those who fail to bet on a green economy will be living in a grey future.” The UN chief stressed that it is not funds but trust that is lacking. “We need to fix it. This means, first and foremost, ensuring that rich countries honor their commitment and provide $100 billion a year through 2020 for developing countries.” It also means that the must become an effective and flexible instrument, especially for the most vulnerable countries such as small island States and least developed countries. “These two conditions are essential for trust between developed and developing countries,” he emphasized. “We need to build trust and reduce risk, make the best use of available resources, and find innovative ways of financing, such as green bonds whose viability and success are already realities,” the Secretary-General said. Also at the summit, Jim Yong Kim, the President of the World Bank Group, that the Group will no longer finance upstream oil and gas after 2019 and that it would be mobilizing finance for climate change impact mitigation and resilience. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) a subsidiary of the World Bank Group will invest up to $325 million in the Green Cornerstone Bond Fund, a partnership with the asset management company, Amundi, to create the largest ever green-bond fund dedicated to emerging markets. “This is a $2 billion initiative aiming to deepen local capital markets, and expand and unlock private funding for climate-related projects. The fund is already subscribed at over $1 billion,” read the announcement.

326-> FROM THE FIELD: Watering the parched farmland of São Tomé and Príncipe
Farmers on the island of São Tomé and Príncipe, off the western coast Africa, are being supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP) to become more resilient in the face of climate fluctuations which have left the land parched and farmers without an income. A decrease in rainfall has meant that crops can no longer be grown in the dry season, so UNDP, working with government agencies, has supported the development of an irrigation system which all farmers can benefit from. The project on the island archipelago is not only providing access to water and the chance to grow more crops for sale, it is also building awareness about how life and farming practices must adapt to the realities of climate change.

327-> Early action key to preventing crises related to El Niño and La Niña – UN relief official
La Niña is expected to impact weather around the world in 2018, a United Nations relief official said, urging governments and the international community to act early to mitigate the impacts from this potentially destructive weather pattern and its counterpart, El Niño. “We know that the earlier we’re able to put in place a response, the more efficient and effective that response can be,” Greg Puley, Chief of Policy Advice and Planning Section, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), told . El Niño is the term used to describe the warming of the central to eastern tropical Pacific that occurs, on average, every three to seven years. It raises sea surface temperatures and impacts weather systems around the globe so that some places receive more rain while others receive none at all, often in a reversal of their usual weather pattern. Its counterpart La Niña is associated with cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures, but it also results in extreme weather. In 2016, 23 countries – representing 60 million people – had to appeal for emergency aid because of El Niño-related weather events. While there is never 100 per cent certainty that a weather event will happen, Mr. Puley urged governments “to be willing to act on the clues.” He discussed insurance, or forecast-based funding, which released funding early, as innovations that have “no regrets” even if a predicted event does not happen. “If you’re aware that excess precipitation is forecast, for example, you can make some investment to reinforce river beds so that the excess precipitation doesn’t result in flooding,” he said. “It will cost you $10 million to reinforce the river bed. It might have cost you $50 or $60 million to provide food, water and shelter to people who are displaced by the flood. You can make those investments when you know.”  : Interview with UN OCHA’s Greg Puley

328-> Concerns of island nations top final session of UN Assembly's high-level debate
The United Nations General Assembly wrapped up its annual high-level debate today by hearing calls for continued assistance to small island nations struggling to deal with development and environmental issues. Foreign Minister Jérémie Bonnelame of Seychelles said his country wished to be an example of co-habitation between man and nature, and an example of unity and cohesion within a people, two objectives at the heart of the country's development plans. It had committed to a progressive programme of adjustments to give a new dynamic to its economy. As a small island country isolated from markets, the Seychelles remained a vulnerable economy, he noted.  The Foreign Minister of , Fathulla Jameel, said small nations felt more vulnerable to challenges and threats such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, as their security was entirely dependent on the prevalence of global security and the observance of the rule of law by all States. Clearly, the concerns of small States could not be confined only to issues of the environment, climate change, sea-level rise and sustainable development. The ominous threats on the political and security fronts had far-reaching implications on all.  In highlighting the devastating effects of the recent wave of hurricanes to hit the Caribbean, Frederick Mitchell, Foreign Minister of the , supported the call for an international donors conference to meet the needs of all the countries adversely affected by the storms. He also urged the countries of the region to better plan for eventualities such as hurricanes. They risked losing their dignity if they were not seen to help themselves. However, if the recent hurricanes, as scientific evidence suggested, were related to climate change, it was clear that the region could not hope to defend itself alone. A major shift by the most polluting countries was required, thus assuring the survival of people in the small island developing States.  Talbak Nazarov, Foreign Minister of , said the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the struggle against international terrorism were urgent problems that needed to be addressed. Another issue facing the international community was the problem of illicit drug trafficking. The volume of narcotics being transported via Tajikistan constituted a serious threat to his nation's stability, he said.  Foreign Minister Maria Levens said development issues such as the eradication of poverty and hunger, as well as protection of the environment, were among the most important issues that needed to be tackled if one wished to obtain lasting and comprehensive security. Globalization had not delivered vast development opportunities on a worldwide scale. The current world order was still characterized by economic disparities, unequal trade regimes, income inequalities between and within countries, social injustice and declining opportunities for hundreds of millions, she noted.  For Carlos Morales Troncoso, Secretary of State for Foreign Relations of the Dominican Republic, the fight against poverty, essential for economic development, could not be separated from a country's attainment of democracy, good governance and stability. He expressed deep concern at the rise in corruption and human and drug trafficking in many regions of the world, including his, which jeopardized the development efforts of the countries concerned, and urged international action against those crimes. In addition, he invited countries to rededicate themselves to the fight against HIV/AIDS, which also constituted a threat to the survival of nations.  Also participating in the general debate were the Chairmen of the Delegations of , Lamuel Stanislaus ; , Stuart Leslie ; and , John Dauth.  .video { font-family: Verdana; font-size: 9px; font-weight: bold; background-image: url(http://www.un.org/en/sites/news.un.org.en/files/legacy-news-images/latest/media/video.gif); padding-left: 14px; background-repeat: no-repeat; } -->

329-> Rearing cattle produces more greenhouse gases than driving cars, UN report warns
Cattle-rearing generates more global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in CO2 equivalent, than transportation, and smarter production methods, including improved animal diets to reduce enteric fermentation and consequent methane emissions, are urgently needed, according to a new United Nations report released today. Cattle-rearing generates more global warming greenhouse gases, as measured in CO2 equivalent, than transportation, and smarter production methods, including improved animal diets to reduce enteric fermentation and consequent methane emissions, are urgently needed, a new United Nations report released today. “Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today’s most serious environmental problems,” senior UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) official Henning Steinfeld said. “Urgent action is required to remedy the situation.” Cattle-rearing is also a major source of land and water degradation, according to the FAO report, , of which Mr. Steinfeld is the senior author. “The environmental costs per unit of livestock production must be cut by one half, just to avoid the level of damage worsening beyond its present level,” it warns. When emissions from land use and land use change are included, the livestock sector accounts for 9 per cent of CO2 deriving from human-related activities, but produces a much larger share of even more harmful greenhouse gases. It generates 65 per cent of human-related nitrous oxide, which has 296 times the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CO2. Most of this comes from manure. And it accounts for respectively 37 per cent of all human-induced methane (23 times as warming as CO2), which is largely produced by the digestive system of ruminants, and 64 per cent of ammonia, which contributes significantly to acid rain. With increased prosperity, people are consuming more meat and dairy products every year, the report notes. Global meat production is projected to more than double from 229 million tonnes in 1999/2001 to 465 million tonnes in 2050, while milk output is set to climb from 580 to 1043 million tonnes. The global livestock sector is growing faster than any other agricultural sub-sector. It provides livelihoods to about 1.3 billion people and contributes about 40 per cent to global agricultural output. For many poor farmers in developing countries livestock are also a source of renewable energy for draft and an essential source of organic fertilizer for their crops. Livestock now use 30 per cent of the earth’s entire land surface, mostly permanent pasture but also including 33 per cent of the global arable land used to producing feed for livestock, the report notes. As forests are cleared to create new pastures, it is a major driver of deforestation, especially in Latin America where, for example, some 70 per cent of former forests in the Amazon have been turned over to grazing. At the same time herds cause wide-scale land degradation, with about 20 per cent of pastures considered degraded through overgrazing, compaction and erosion. This figure is even higher in the drylands where inappropriate policies and inadequate livestock management contribute to advancing desertification. The livestock business is among the most damaging sectors to the earth’s increasingly scarce water resources, contributing among other things to water pollution from animal wastes, antibiotics and hormones, chemicals from tanneries, fertilizers and the pesticides used to spray feed crops. Beyond improving animal diets, proposed remedies to the multiple problems include soil conservation methods together with controlled livestock exclusion from sensitive areas; setting up biogas plant initiatives to recycle manure; improving efficiency of irrigation systems; and introducing full-cost pricing for water together with taxes to discourage large-scale livestock concentration close to cities.

330-> Accepting Nobel Prize, laureates issue strong call to fight climate change
Accepting the Nobel Peace Prize today, this year’s laureates – Al Gore and the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) – issued a call for bold and immediate actions to curb global warming. “We, the human species, are confronting a planetary emergency – a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here,” former United States Vice-President Gore said at the award ceremony in Oslo, Norway. “But there is hopeful news as well: we have the ability to solve the crisis and avoid the worst – though not all – of its consequences, if we act boldly, decisively and quickly.” Representing the , its Chair warned of the risks to peace that could result from climate change. “Peace can be defined as security and the secure access to resources that are essential for living,” Rajendra K. Pachauri . Global warming could adversely affect some communities’ access to clean water and sufficient food; could lead to unstable health conditions; and threaten ecosystem resources security of settlements. He voiced hope that discussions at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali, Indonesia – which entered its second and final week today – will produce positive results. “Will those responsible for decisions in the field of climate change at the global level listen to the voice of science and knowledge, which is now loud and clear?” Mr. Pachauri asked. Meanwhile in Bali, delegates are working to wrap up agreement on how to launch a process to address global warming ahead of the ministerial-level meeting that begins on Wednesday. Countries have differing ideas on what should be included in the roadmap to create a successor pact to the Kyoto Protocol which expires in 2012. They also have diverging views on whether or not the outcome should contain targets or goals. A text prepared for the negotiation suggested responding to the need for quantified national emission objectives for industrialized countries and to be guided by the need to reduce emissions in a range of 25-40 per cent by 2020, peaking in the next 10-15 years. Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), said the text on future actions should not prejudge the outcome and that discussions on the future were at a critical point. “We need to walk away with a clear sense of where we’re going,” he emphasized. There are 10,776 participants attending the Bali Conference from 187 countries, making it the largest-ever conference on the issue of climate change. In a related development, the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ) today said that the presentation of this year’s Nobel Peace Prize reinforces the need for leaders to take scientific findings regarding climate change into account. The work of the – which is hosted by the – “has shown how vital it is for the scientific evidence on climate change, and mankind’s role in this, to be used as the basis for moving the political process on curbing climate change forward,” said Michel Jarraud, the agency’s Secretary-General. Also, a new report by the UN Environment Programme ( ) – which, along with the WMO, founded the IPCC – spotlights how climate change is a security risk. It could “result in destabilization and violence jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree,” said Hans Schellnhuber, one of the lead authors of the new study. Entitled “Climate Change as a Security Risk,” it warns that global warming could potentially aggravate old tensions and trigger new ones that could result in violence and even war. The report also defines vulnerable States and societies as those that are in political transition with low levels of economic activities and large populations.

331-> FEATURE: One woman’s heroic efforts to restore more than just Rwanda’s forests
As her nation emerged from crisis, and in the face of great personal tragedy, Rose Mukankomeje took the initiative to bring Rwandans together to protect their natural resources and, in the process, restore communities devastated by conflict. She is one of five individuals from around the world honoured this week with the Forest Heroes Award by the United Nations Forum on Forests for their efforts to sustain, protect and manage this vital natural resource, and inspire positive change. Rose was unable to attend the award ceremony in Istanbul, Turkey, as she was taking part in numerous events taking place this week in Rwanda to mark the 1994 genocide, during which nearly one million people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were massacred by Hutu militia and government forces over a period of just 100 days. She was studying in Europe when the genocide occurred, and when she was able to return to her country, she discovered that her parents and all of her brothers and sisters had been slaughtered. She then set out to find her nieces and nephews, going from one orphanage to another, greeted along the way by child after child who longed for a family of his or her own. There were thousands of children who needed a home in the wake of the genocide, and Rose became a single mother to 24 foster children. “The country suffered a lot,” Rose said, speaking to the UN News Centre from her home in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. “After the genocide, the social structure of the country was completely destroyed.” Also completely destroyed, she said, was the country’s forests, which is where many people fled and hid during the genocide. According to a post-conflict assessment by the UN Environment Programme ( ) that was released in 2011, the genocide and the conflict that preceded it caused “significant” environmental impacts that will extend many years into the future. “The main damage has been caused by massive population displacement and resettlement of returnees leading to potentially irreversible losses, including considerable reductions in the surface area of national parks, forests and other vegetation cover as well as encroachment on wetlands,” stated the report, which proposed a package of almost 90 projects to help the country accelerate its sustainable development agenda. That same year, in 2011, Rwanda received a UN-backed award for its national forest policy. It is only one of three countries in Central and Western Africa to achieve a major reversal in the trend of declining forest cover and is on course to achieving its goal of forest cover of 30 per cent of total land area by the year 2020, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), which sponsored the award. Rose, a biologist by training, has devoted her life to the protection and restoration of Rwandan forests. She is currently Director General of the Rwandan Environment Management Authority (REMA). One of her most successful initiatives is public awareness for environmental management, through Umuganda – a community project in which everyone goes one day a month to clean up the environment and plant trees. It is a unique home-grown solution that ensures that the growth of forests in Rwanda supports livelihoods and benefits the rural poor. “After the genocide we tried to find ways to bring people together, to prepare nurseries, to plant trees… this is our way of healing,” said Rose, adding that this showed that, even after conflict and genocide, people can come back together and work with each other. Rose also drew attention to the need to protect critical ecosystems like wetlands by encouraging farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural techniques. Her work helped to improve the livelihoods of people without compromising Rwanda’s rare and vulnerable ecosystems. She also worked to ban plastic bags throughout the entire country. “This woman has so much energy… She never stops. She has project after project. And I would say that that’s one of the characteristics of a Forest Hero,” said Jan McAlpine, the Director of the UN Forum on Forests Secretariat, who herself spent part of her childhood in Rwanda. Despite the gains made by the country, Rose noted that there are a number of challenges. “Most importantly, Rwanda is developing very quickly… and the challenge is often a lack of alternative livelihoods for people who depend on forests. “When you ask people to protect the environment, including the forests, to take care of the trees, we need to find alternatives sources for things like firewood.” She credits Rwanda’s environmental successes to the passion of its people. “This passion is turned into vision. This vision is translated into policy. Then policy is translated into programmes. At the same time, people are committed to make a difference. We need to help our communities but the environment has also suffered a lot due to the conflict. “After the genocide, people want to contribute in a meaningful way to the reconstruction of the country… people who want to move from conflict to a better life.”

332-> FROM THE FIELD: Turning waste into a business in the slums of Yaoundé, Cameroon
The increasing volume and complexity of waste associated with modern economies is posing a serious risk to ecosystems and human health. Every year, an estimated 11.2 billion tons of solid waste are collected worldwide, according to the . For the past 20 years, a young man from the slums of Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, has been running a local waste collection service that has had a transformative impact on the community around him. The residential area of Melen, like most teeming city’s informal settlements, is not connected to the public garbage disposal system. Through the , nearly every morning at 6 a.m., a team of young men from Melen make their way through the community. At the end of their shift, they unload their full carts at a municipal waste collection point outside the slum. The initiative is supported by UN-Habitat, the United Nations programme working towards a better urban future. Read more about this unique initiative.

333-> INTERVIEW: "Climate change is in everybody's backyard" – Robert Redford
Actor and environmental activist Robert Redford paid his first visit to the United Nations Headquarters in New York this week to address the UN General Assembly’s High-Level Meeting on Climate Change, which aimed to energize multilateral cooperation on the issue ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris later this year. In the French capital, countries will discuss an agreement intended to succeed to the landmark Kyoto Protocol on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. I’m here because I was asked to come –  which was an honour – and also here because I think climate change has moved up  the register of issues to be considered, and it’s done that because it’s a  current issue and it’s a current danger unless it gets addressed. I thought any  voice that could be lent to the effort should be used and so I’m here for that. Now climate change is in everybody’s backyard. The question is to make people aware of it, to make people aware not only of the dangers but what the positive move would be, and bring it to their attention that it’s already in their own backyard.   I think you can get them to pay attention  if you place climate change where it belongs. It’s usually way down at the  bottom. The environment, I've experienced over the years, gets little attention  compared to other things. But I think because of what’s happened now – change  is in the air, you can feel it – we’re in a period of change that’s positive  with also some negative. Positive: you see what the Pope said. Positive: you  see what happened this week with same-sex marriage; you see what’s happened  with [US] Supreme Court decisions.  From my  point of view those are all pretty positive things. But what sits behind and on  top of all this is the bigger problem that concerns everybody’s health – every  country, every nation, every person. They’re all under the umbrella of climate.  And because climate change is such a harsh topic with very little time to  correct it – there’s been so much damage done over the years to the planet –  that if we don’t do something sooner rather than later, then I don’t know what  kind of planet we’re going to have to live on.  What can they expect? I don’t know. I  don’t know what the consensus is here, this is a first time for me so I don’t  have any experience knowing how they operate, how they think, how they vote – I  can only hope. But I think that because every nation is affected, this issue  gets their attention.    Years ago there used to be a saying, they called it  “NIMBY,” which is an abbreviation of “Not in My Back Yard.” People would not  get interested or focus on anything, particularly if it was a danger, unless it  was in their backyard. It was somebody else’s problem – they didn’t have to  think about it, or worry about it, or address it. But now climate change is in  everybody’s backyard. The question is to make people aware of it, to make  people aware not only of the dangers but what the positive move would be, and  bring it to their attention that it’s already in their own backyard. Look at  the drought in California, the flooding, what’s happened in New York – it’s  pretty clear that something is happening.  Please, that’s insulting. The fact is what  he’s saying is so much in need – I salute him, on many fronts, particularly  that one because he’s placing it where it belongs, as a moral issue, and  therefore there’s a spiritual component to that. And thank God that he’s  placing it that way.  It’s not  about politics. The moral issue of climate change should transcend politics. If  it’s reduced to politics, we’re going to have the same old yin-yang, the same  old problems, the same old fighting, the same old narrow-minded bickering  between ideologies. It’s going to be a mess. Let’s get above it and take advantage  of change and make it positive.  I would start with an apology to the new  generation. The new generation – focusing on the role of women and politics,  focusing on youth – to me I see that as an enormous plus, whereas maybe 15  years ago, no, because I think America’s youth was focused more on other  issues, like how to get ahead, how to make money, and the environment was not  on their minds. But now  it is. I’m very encouraged by this new generation. They’re better informed,  they’re more knowledgeable, and the more knowledgeable they are, the more they  get concerned, because it’s going to be their future. Our time is kind of done.  We should apologize for what’s being left for them to work with – they don’t  have a lot.  But I’m  looking forward to them taking the reins because not only do they deserve it,  but I think it’s time, and also I think it’s a good time because the new  generation is just different than before. It’s more active. I think it has the  quality and the qualifications to take the reins and move things forward with  what little we have left of our planet. I’m just sorry we didn’t leave them  much.   I think if you ran it all the way back, it  started when I was a kid growing up in Los Angeles. When I was a child, my  memories really began at the end of the Second World War. It was a beautiful  city, the air was fresh, it was clean, there were green spaces in between  communities. I had a paper route on a bicycle. I rode around different  neighbourhoods, it was fresh and clean. I loved it. Then  suddenly, when the war ended, everything changed. It’s like Los Angeles became  something at the end of a rainbow and everybody clamoured to get in there. And  suddenly everything changed. Suddenly there were skyscrapers, there were  freeways, there was pollution. So I saw a city that I really loved sort of  disappear under my feet and I moved away. I moved to the mountains. I spent  time in the Sierras and worked at Yosemite National Park, and when I did that,  that connection to nature hit me like a ton of bricks – I said this is where I  want to be. I want to be in and around nature. I want to preserve it, if I can,  because I could see that we were already a development-oriented society, I knew  that. But the question for me was: if we only have that, we won’t have anything  of nature left. So I guess I got committed at an early age to do whatever I  could.  And then  in 1970, I was at a conference in Vale, Colorado, and I remember there was a  picture of renewable resources and non-renewable resources, extractable resources  – oil, gas, coal – and all the politics, all the money, was going into  non-renewables. And over here, where you had wind, solar, geothermal – that was  new then, very new, so it wasn’t getting much attention – but there was nothing  there. I thought well, if this continues, there won’t be anything left. It  might make some short-term money for someone, but there won’t be anything left  for future generations. But over here, look at all the possibilities for  alternative energy and what’s happening. So I guess at that time I made a  commitment to myself to do whatever I could, raise whatever small voice I had  in that direction and so I have.   There was little to no change for much of  that 40 years. Things don’t change quickly. You have to work hard, you have to  wait, you have to be patient. I’m sorry that it didn’t happen soon because I  think we would have been better off had it happened sooner. But you have to  live with what you got. I think what is happening now is that it’s dawning on  people, the value of alternative energy, and the jobs and industry that could  be created from it. And as soon as you talk about industries and jobs then that  changes the whole picture, because before the argument was always “oil and gas,  that produces energy but also jobs and this doesn’t.” But now people are  realizing that not only does alternative energy do this, but in a much better  way that is sustainable for our planet.  The environment, I've experienced over the years, gets little attention  compared to other things. But I think because of what’s happened now – change  is in the air, you can feel it.  My artistic life used to be just painting  and then it became theatre and film, so that’s my artistic life. And then  there’s my civic life, and that is the environment and the role that nature can  play in the continuation of our society. So it’s divided into two sections: art  and nature. I guess you can boil it down to that.  First of all, pay attention. Put it out  there as a topic. Once it’s out there as a topic, request that others pay  attention to the topic and then see how, if they look around, how they can see  why it is such a topic. If you talk about climate change, all you have to do is  look around. Unfortunately, I declared some negative examples: flooding,  drought, wildfires. But all you have to do is open your eyes and pay attention  and you’ll look this way or that way, and you’ll see fire, flood, tornadoes,  hurricanes, and if that’s the case, you can’t tell me it’s not going to affect  people. So I would say pay attention and look at how climate change is being  evidenced around you.

334-> COP21:  a ‘green’ UN climate change conference, from electric cars to the power of human energy
With countries reaching a new agreement at the United Nations climate change conference (COP21), the global meeting has been qualified as a “monumental triumph” by top UN officials. While many continued to hail the outcome document as the walls of COP21 were torn down on Sunday, the UN News Centre looked back on other aspects that contributed “positive energy” to the two-week event. Highlighting what made COP21 “green” was Fanina Kodre-Alexander from  the UN Environment Programme ( ), who manages communications on climate  change, disasters and conflicts. She said UNEP worked with the organizers – the  UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) and the Government of France  – to ensure sustainability throughout the Paris-Le Bourget site located  north-east of the capital. “We work under our ‘Eat, Think, Save’ campaign in collaboration with  the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and we believe that food waste is the  third largest emitter after a couple of countries,” Ms. Koder-Alexander noted. To reduce waste, all the food provided at UNEP events, including  those during COP21, is sourced from rescued food, resources that would  otherwise have been destroyed. Ms. Kodre-Alexander highlighted that it’s always  provided in a “very appetizing and lovely way.” Another exciting feature at COP21 related to food, which attracted a  lot of attention, was the brought on premise to  avoid trucking kilos of fresh baguettes ever day. They welcomed the into their  lab, which is visible to all conference-goers through a thin see-through  plastic tarp.  To go with the bread, of course there’s café. “We’re very happy to see they’re using recyclable cups,” said Ms.  Kodre-Alexander. “The method which they’ve employed is that people are  returning them to get a credit. It’s quite successful and you don’t see them  left around and dropped in the garbage.”  In addition, welcome packs handed out to all participants included  water bottles to limit the number of plastic ones purchased. Water stations to  fill these were abundantly found around every corner, similarly to the many  recycling bins, clearly labeled to support the separation of paper, plastics  and compostable organic waste. “UNEP has also tried to be as paperless as possible,” added Ms.  Kodre-Alexander. “There are certain documents that need to be printed and  distributed but we believe in either providing links to our website or USB keys  when available.” On Saturday, the printed final draft of the agreement was handed out  to delegates to review before they reconvened hours later for its adoption.  This was a rare time paper was seen throughout the venue, as negotiators met in  all free spaces including the cafeteria.  Meanwhile, several eco-friendly options were available to get to and  from the site. In addition to free public buses, 300 electric cars were  provided by Renault-Nissan to anyone seeking a ride. Reservations could be made  online just hours in advance, or in person with a little extra wait time. Two  hundred of the drivers were professional chauffeurs, while the rest volunteered  to help limit COP21’s carbon footprint. According to Renault-Nissan, a total of  16.32 tons of carbon dioxide were diverted during the two weeks thanks to the  initiative.  While the cars recharged during the day, so did thousands of cell  phones at power stations provided by a group called “Solar Sound Systems.”  Unlike a typical plug, participants had to pedal to activate the charging.  Similarly, this applied to making one’s own juice and contributing to power a  DJ booth located in the hall, a space  open to the public and dedicated to the exchange of idea, mainly between  younger climate advocates.     Despite all these “green” options, the asked Ms. Kodre-Alexander whether there was anything more she had wished to see  at the conference. “Personally for me it’s always the heating/air conditioning issue,”  she answered. “I always find that if you’re overheating the venues and then air  conditioning others, you’re consuming a lot of resources that would normally be  saved.” Perhaps this is an additional aspect to consider next year, when a  new COP convenes next November in Marrakesh, Morocco.

335-> “If we take action now, we can address climate change and build a sustainable future” – Janos Pasztor
Just days away from the kick-off of the 21st United Nations climate change conference — widely known as COP21 — the UN is reminding its main actors that this conference must be a turning point for climate action. : There are at least two major points. First of all, if we have a good agreement it will allow us to move towards a low-carbon, low-emission future, where there are lots of opportunities for new technology developments and new ways of organizing ourselves. That is an opportunity we must take. Secondly, climate change is already happening. The impacts are already visible. If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay. Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change. If we allow warming to go beyond that, scientists tell us there are likely to be potential irreversible impacts on people, on natural ecosystems, and therefore, on the economies of the world. Now the 2 degrees is not a very hard level. Many are saying that it actually has to be much less than 2 degrees for the small island developing countries whose land might become completely inundating with a sea level rise. Already 2 degrees is way too much. So, it must be remembered that when we talk of 2 degrees, it is the maximum.  It must be kept as much as possible below that. We are expecting a package of outcomes and it will have four elements – they're interrelated but they're different. The first one will be the national plans for climate change of each country, for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Those are plans that are developed &#8220bottom up&#8221 by the countries – this is what they can do. The second element will be the actual agreement. It will contain the rules of the game on how countries will assess the impact of the totality of the national plans on the objective to keep warming below 2 degrees. And then they will review and assess what it takes to raise the ambition to make sure that we keep below those 2 degrees of global warming. That will be the core of that agreement.  The third part is climate finance. All of this will require financing, public and private finance, and there will be some parts of this package of finance that will go into the agreement. And the fourth is the action agenda – a collection of actions on the ground to do either mitigation or adaption, and it's to demonstrate that it's already possible, it's already happening and to showcase what are the good partnerships between private sector, public sector and civil society to actually do the work on the ground. If we take action now, we can address climate change as we move toward a low-emission economy and build a sustainable future. The more we delay, the more we will pay. The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. That's the bottom line. And we have very little time. In fact, the last negotiation week finished recently in Bonn [Germany]. What we now have left in terms of formal negotiation time is only that period during the actual Conference of the Parties [COP] in Paris, the first two weeks of December. There are quite a few of those and the most important one seems to be related to what is referred to as the differentiation – the differentiation between the developed and developing countries. Some countries would like no formal differentiation and they would like all rules to apply to everybody, every country, with maybe a certain flexibility to reflect the capacities of different countries.  Other countries would like to maintain the existing grouping of countries in the Convention to developed and developing countries, and then have rules that refer to these different groups. So that's quite important because it has implications, not just on the conceptual issue of having divisions like that, but in terms of financing. But there are other challenges – such as climate finance. Developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion dollars per year by 2020 to developing countries. The $100 billion doesn't have to be on the table in Paris, but what does need to be on the table is a politically credible mobilization trajectory towards this $100 billion. Some progress was made in October, but there is still work to do and there are still announcements that hopefully will be made by some countries. So these are just two examples of difficult issues that still need to be resolved but there are others as well. What we have is a document that has grown in size. While the actual size doesn't matter – what matters is the content – clearly the longer the text, the more time it takes to negotiate and that's our biggest challenge. The text is some 55 pages long and it will take some time to go through the different elements. What we ended up with at the Bonn negotiation is that countries added into the original draft which was much shorter – specific things that they wanted to see in the final text and there wasn't enough time to negotiate all that in Bonn. So we still have lots of options in there and those will still need to be negotiated both in informal discussions and during COP21. The new Sustainable Development Agenda—or – is extremely important for the implementation of the climate agreement. First, we have a goal – – which focuses on climate change. But what the other goals are even more important. There are 12 goals [ ] that have very specific climate related targets on energy, on forests, on food security, on education – these are all things that will feed into successfully implementing the climate agreement. The main challenge ahead is to negotiate the agreement. But what is really important is that if we don't achieve the 2 degree objective, then none of the can be achieved. And in order to achieve the less than 2 degree objective, we need to do all the things that are in the Sustainable Development Goals. That's the challenge but that is the beauty: these two different processes that are negotiated through separate processes are now coming together at the level of implementation. And this is where the UN system has a very important role also, because we are there to support Member States to help them to address these issues in a coherent and integrated way. World leaders have a very important role in guiding their ministers and negotiators on the broad economic implications of climate change and actions about climate change. So their role for the negotiations is very important. If they don't give clear guidance to the negotiators then they don't know what to agree upon. So that is why the UN Secretary-General has been much engaged with Heads of States and Governments so that they own this process and clearly guide their ministers and their negotiators. Climate change affects us all, but our actions affect climate change – all of us. We are all responsible for what we do in our daily lives – how we vote, how we engage, how we run our companies, how we run our civil society organizations. We all need to be conscious of this, and we all need to do our part.

336-> INTERVIEW: Managing disaster risk vital for sustainable development, UN official stresses
Nearly 350 reported disasters, over 22,000 deaths, 98.6 million people affected, and $66.5 billion in economic damage. That was the devastating toll of disasters worldwide in 2015, according to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR). At the helm of the Geneva-based office is Robert Glasser, an experienced development official who took up his post at the start of this year. As the new Special  Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mr.  Glasser is leading the Office at an important time, following a series of  critical agreements reached last year by Member States. These include the (2015-2030), which seeks substantial  reductions in disaster losses including mortality, the numbers of persons  affected by disasters, economic losses and damage to critical infrastructure  such as schools and hospitals. Addressing disaster risk is the single most tangible way we can make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people around the world. Disaster risk  reduction ( ) aims to reduce the damage caused by natural hazards such as  earthquakes, floods, droughts and cyclones, with a focus on prevention. It is fundamental,  says Mr. Glasser, to achieving the and  the on climate change. The Australian national recently sat  down with the to  discuss the need for integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change  adaptation efforts, particularly given that 90 per cent of disasters are now climate-related;  what the current priorities are in the area of disaster risk reduction; and  what motivated him to accept his current post. There is some good news. Well,  the first question is what is a trend? Because we certainly have seen over the  last year relative to the previous decade that some losses from disasters are  lower than they were compared to the average of the decade. It’s not really a  trend though to talk about one year’s results. You have to look at the  longer-term trends. And overall, as a result of climate change, as a result of  population growth… these are all trends… that are going to increase the  frequency and severity of natural disasters and exacerbate particularly the  livelihoods of poor and vulnerable people around the world.  Disaster risk reduction is  fundamental both to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and to  achieving the objectives in the Paris climate change agreement that was reached  last year. The Secretary-General, for example, has said that sustainability  begins with Sendai – the . And he  says that because he realizes it’s absolutely impossible to achieve sustainable  development without addressing the risks, and disaster risk in particular.  Disaster risk is costing countries over $300 billion a year and that’s an  initial estimate. The actual costs are far greater but we just can’t measure,  actually quantify, a lot of the costs. For developing countries, if disasters  strike, they can wipe out 20 per cent of GDP or more, so if we want to address  sustainable development, if we want that to work, then disaster risk has to be  incorporated in development planning and we have a long way to go to do that. Climate  change is probably the single biggest disaster risk moving forward. The most  significant treatment to reduce disaster risk is to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. Because if we don’t achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,  we’re going to see a massive increase – we’re already seeing it actually – in  extreme weather events. Those extreme weather events are not only going to  cause food security crises, droughts, famine, huge unprecedented storms, and  extreme weather, and 100-year events becoming 1-in-20-year events. But they’re  also going to trigger people movements and be contributing causes of conflict  as well around the world. So if we don’t get a handle on climate change, then  all of the other efforts to reduce disaster risk are going to be extremely  difficult to realize.  The Sendai Framework, which was  agreed last year, was the successor to the Hyogo Framework of Action on  Disaster Risk Reduction. Countries have made a lot of progress and we see  evidence of that in recent disasters. For example, there was a major storm that  hit Bangladesh some decades ago and it resulted in hundreds of thousands of  deaths. It was really devastating. A more recent storm that followed a very  similar track resulted in some deaths, and in fact the news story was about the  deaths, but it was in the hundreds rather than in the tens of thousands. The  real news story in that was the improvement, which is a result of the  Government of Bangladesh’s efforts working with donors, the UN and others to  address disaster risk, with early warning, storm shelters, evacuation planning,  a whole range of factors that have now decreased Bangladesh’s vulnerability to  extreme events. Of course, there’s still enormous vulnerability but it’s just  an example of progress that can be made with a concerted effort to address the  challenge. Disaster risk reduction is fundamental both to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and to achieving the objectives in the Paris climate change agreement... When people think of disasters  and disaster risk reduction, they probably think of the immediate warning  before a disaster, the response to the disaster to help people and the recovery  of people after disaster. And of course, there’s a lot of important work that  needs to be done on early warning, on planning evacuations, on humanitarian  relief, on reconstruction afterwards, and those are all very high priorities.  But the real challenge is actually well before that – to work with governments  to incorporate disaster risk in their planning of their economic development. Because if a  country is not very careful, if it doesn’t understand the costs of disasters,  if it doesn’t understand how the risks are changing as a result of climate  change, if they’re not considering that in the investments they’re making, then  it’s likely that they will be creating risk in future crises. For example,  without having building codes in earthquake zones or in allowing settlements to  take place in flood zones… There are a whole range of actual decisions that  governments are making as part of their central economic planning that if  they’re not incorporating disaster risk, we’re not going to get a handle on the  actual humanitarian disaster. By that point, there are things we can do but  it’s almost too late if we’ve embedded additional risk in the economic  development in countries around the world. So the challenge is to get out ahead  of the disasters… the challenge is moving from thinking of disasters in terms  of humanitarian relief in the phases immediately before and after, to thinking  about longer-term development and the choices we’re making.  The Global Platform is the  culmination of a series of regional events, regional platforms at which  countries and stakeholders – civil society, the private sector, others – take  stock of progress in reducing disaster risk, share best practice, share experience,  identify gaps and increasingly, they will also be part of the formal network  for monitoring implementation of the Sendai Framework. All of those regional  platform meetings come together at a global platform and that’s where all of  this is combined and we take stock globally of how we’re going. And ideally  that information then is channeled into monitoring as an element of explaining  how we’re tracking the Sustainable Development Goals… So that’s essentially  what the Global Platform is, it’s a fundamentally important meeting of the key  stakeholders around the world, including ministers and others, to talk about  disaster risk and the challenges and opportunities. Climate change is probably the single biggest disaster risk moving forward. Thank you for asking that  question. For me, addressing disaster risk is the single most tangible way we  can make a difference in the lives of vulnerable people around the world whose  vulnerability is generally increasing because of climate change, because of  population growth and because countries are not incorporating risk in the  investments and the choices for the investments they’re making. I feel deeply  concerned about climate change in particular because it will have such a  profound impact on disasters and on the lives of, particularly, poor and  marginalized people around the world. There are so many issues we talk about  that at a political level are abstract or that seem more international  political than practical. DRR is one of those issues that is extremely  tangible. People understand it – whether you’re someone in New Orleans who’s  just lived through Hurricane Katrina, whether you’re someone in Japan who’s  just experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake, Tsunami and then Fukushima  disaster, whether you’re an Australian like me who lived through the droughts  and fires that threatened Australia’s capital city, Canberra, or whether you’re  an Ethiopian farmer in East Africa who is experiencing the fourth deep,  profound drought in less than a decade. Disaster risk reduction is something  that is tangible, and is an opportunity to actually make a difference in those  lives.  I hope so because it’s a big  challenge and I think maybe one of the advantages I have in this job is that, because  of the diversity of the previous jobs I’ve had, I may be able to see things from  a variety of different perspectives, or maybe more easily than some others  might. I’ve worked in a donor country, in the Australian Government aid  programme, so I have a good view of the donors’ perspective and that’s key  because the funding is fundamental to making other things happen. I’ve also  worked closely in a developing country with the highest levels of government. So  I’ve seen things from a developing country perspective in terms of the budget  processes, the competing demands, how donors look from the outside… And I’ve  worked in CARE, the international NGO which does both humanitarian relief and  development, but focused at a community level to look at how whatever we’re  working on is actually impacting people on the ground in developing countries.  So for me, it’s already been quite useful in this job to examine issues we’re  working on from those three perspectives and that I think will hopefully enable  me to identify some initiatives and ways of dealing with existing initiatives  that increase our impact and effectiveness. At least that’s my hope. There are a few things that are  really important. One of them of course is implementing the Sendai Framework  and UNISDR is mandated by Member States to be the custodian of that process of  monitoring the implementation. Members are now agreeing to these indicators to  monitor our progress in implementation and those indicators give us the  opportunity to support Member States in achieving those objectives. So one of  the key priorities for me is to not only, through UNISDR, manage the monitoring  of these commitments that States have made but also to provide support to those  States… to have an effective implementation and to move forward on that.  A second  priority is one I know that the Secretary-General is very keen for me to  promote and that is the integration within the UN system, to integrate disaster  risk across UN programmes and to support the efforts of our colleagues at ,  at , and elsewhere that are incorporating risk and across the  programmes they’re supporting in their work in member countries around the  world. We have a UN plan of action around disaster risk reduction that  highlights how we’re going to do that, what the indicators of progress are,  what the minimum requirements are, those sorts of things… and of course active  engagement with my colleagues in the UN system will be key to implementing that  effectively.

337-> FEATURE: Ahead of Paris Agreement signing, cyclone-hit Fiji champions climate change action
As Fiji and Governments of more than 100 other United Nations Member States are preparing this week for the historic signing of the Paris Agreement, back in Fiji, residents of the South Pacific country are clearing debris and trying to recover from one of the region's fiercest storms. Fiji was hit by Cyclone Winston, a Category 5 storm, on 20 February, less than a week after the country became the first to ratify the , which establishes a long term, worldwide framework to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Small island developing nations, like Fiji, have led the charge on climate change, sounding the alarm because their communities are on the front lines of rising sea levels and increasing natural disasters linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions. “We don’t realize it would be big like this because this is the first time a big cyclone, the first time a tsunami came in our village,” Vilisa Naivalubasaga from Mudu Village, on one of Fiji’s more than 300 islands, told the Pacific branch of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), as she was preparing food with other women in a temporary shelter. If your house is built on sand, you must expect to lose it when a cyclone hits. There is no point of putting a house back up again on sand. The Cyclone thrust Fiji to the centre of a narrative around climate change, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction, and the vital role for humanitarian work when these three intersect. In the village of Nabukadra, residents are working with OCHA and partners to procure chainsaws, so they can cut fallen wood and construct new homes. This is the immediate priority, but Winston has shown the need to think longer-term about reducing the risks facing their community. “We will discuss how we will manage to rebuild because the sea level became high,” Raivolita Tabusoro, the village’s headman said ahead of a community meeting. The group had been discussing a range of measures, including moving seafront homes further back from the water’s edge and building a seawall from boulders displaced by the cyclone. Diplomacy and natural disasters When Winston hit Fiji, Peter Thomson, the Pacific island nation’s Ambassador to the United Nations, was in New York and instantly aware of the key role he would have in rallying political support for assistance to his home country.  “Suddenly, you have a responsibility for the welfare of hundreds of thousands of people,” he told the UN News Centre. In the storm’s wake, Mr. Thomson convened a briefing to the wider UN membership on his country’s need for international assistance. He asked Member States not to issue travel advisories against visiting Fiji. He also strongly urged Governments to follow in his country’s footsteps and promptly ratify the Paris Agreement, which will enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55 per cent of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification. On 22 April, the Paris Agreement will be signed at the UN Headquarters in New York, with participation from more than 120 Member States. Each Government that signs the Agreement will also have to ratify it, as Fiji did, when its Parliament unanimously agreed to approve the Agreement. Fiji’s Prime Minister Voreqe Bainimarama is expected to formally sign the document on behalf of the country on Friday. But for Mr. Thomson, the timing could not be soon enough. “This is the worst storm I have ever seen in my lifetime,” he noted, referring to Winston. The destruction brought back memories of Hurricane Bebe, which hit Fiji more than four decades ago when Mr. Thomson was working at a local district, and which cemented his interest in disaster preparedness and response. “We’ve got to think about what is causing these storms,” Mr. Thomson said, stressing that climate change “puts the whole development agenda at risk.” Disaster preparedness and resilience A Category 5 hurricane, as measured in intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, is the strongest hurricane that can form on planet Earth. Only 11 cyclones in the Category 5 have been registered south of the equator since 1970. Two of them hit in the past 13 months. Pam, which ripped through Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in March 2015; and Winston, which took more than 40 lives and affected 350,000 people, about 40 per cent of Fiji’s total population.  In addition, Winston’s fury wiped out generations of aspirations for rural schools and agricultural projects in a space of a few hours. “Generally speaking, humanitarian assistance lasts at least six months,” Mr. Thomson said. This timing comes from the fact that the provision of food is one of the most crucial, in addition to potable water, shelter and sanitation, for example, and that the fastest growing staple in the Pacific Islands – the sweet potato – takes at least six months to grow. The recovery phase takes much longer. One year on, Vanuatu is still recovering from the devastation by Cyclone Pam. The Philippines is still rehabilitating from the wreck brought by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013.  Five years on, Japan’s northeast coast is still healing from the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. For its recovery, Fiji will follow the 2015-2030, a voluntary non-binding agreement which recognizes that the State has the primary role to reduce disaster risk, but that responsibility should also be shared by the local government, the private sector and other stakeholders. For example, Fiji’s disaster management system at the national level is complemented by local offices. Ahead of Winston’s landfall, the Fijian authorities, under the leadership of the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO), activated evacuation centres and moved people to those facilities, saving many lives. Military, police and other personnel on leave had been ordered back to active duty and worked with local officials. Building back better and safer is very much on people’s minds, and the World Humanitarian Summit next month is an opportunity to discuss the lessons learned from this emergency about community resilience. But a key question, not only for Fiji but other countries, is how to make communities more resilient to such natural disaster. In Fiji, vital disaster preparedness measures include the introduction of stringent building codes to ensure that all structures, whether in urban or rural areas, are disaster-proof. “If your house is built on sand, you must expect to lose it when a cyclone hits,” Mr. Thomson said. “There is no point of putting a house back up again on sand.” There are also  considerations on how to build. Nails are no longer the main choice for roofing,  for example. But even development projects need to be rethought. Solar panels,  which are increasingly utilized in Fiji for clean energy are often  placed on rooftops. Unfortunately, they are often one of the first objects to  be blown away in heavy winds. “The inevitable question is who’s next in our region,” Mr. Thomson said, stressing that Pacific island nations share an understanding that climate-caused disasters are a common challenge. Relocating above the waves Some village leaders on the Island of Koro have started discussing complete relocation of villages to higher ground, far away from future storm surge and rising sea levels, and have already identified suitable land if this goes ahead. “That’s a good message coming from the villagers themselves,” said Amena Yauvoli, Fiji’s Ambassador for Climate Change and Oceans, following a visit to his home community of Nasou on the island of Koro, where Winston made landfall. “What we have to look at is the reality of the situation on the ground,” he noted, pointing to some of the key challenges in moving affected communities to another area or potentially another country. “Relocation comes with lots of costs and even the emotional traditions and attachment to the current village site is always there,” he said, stressing that ample time for discussions should be given before any definitive step forward by the village and the government.    More than 40 at risk communities in Fiji have been identified for relocation in the near term and two have already been moved to higher ground. There is also talk of Fiji hosting migrants from other Pacific countries where people have been displaced by climate change, if the need arises. ‘New normal’ requires higher level of planning, preparedness Karen Allen, Pacific Representative of the UN Children’s Fund ( ), said that an increasing number of more destructive storms throughout the Pacific is “the new normal,” requiring another level of planning, preparedness and emotional strength. The implications are immense for everything from the way that buildings are constructed – including schools and health facilities – to other critical infrastructure, such as water and power supply, to the way that families prepare themselves, their crops and their livelihoods. “Buildings traditionally designated as evacuation centres may now be insufficient,” she added. “Community centres built to serve large numbers as evacuation centres are needed.” One of the concerns is that many people do not understand what a “Category 5” storm means or how to protect themselves should one be forecast. UN agencies, such as UNICEF, and partners, are investing in school-based preparedness efforts so that children will be prepared for emergencies from their youngest years. The aim of such programs is to instil in young children what needs to be done in case of natural emergencies, making it habitual, such as brushing their teeth and washing their hands. The programs are new, but Ms. Allen says they could have wide reaching impacts: “Just as the Pacific looks to others for expertise and guidance, the rest of the world has much to learn from the Pacific region. We are, after all, experts by circumstance.” Taking the message on to the World Humanitarian Summit Today, about 43 per cent of the world’s population live in fragile situations, and that number is estimated to climb to 62 per cent by 2030. “Building back better and safer is very much on people’s minds, and the World Humanitarian Summit next month is an opportunity to discuss the lessons learned from this emergency about community resilience,” said Osnat Lubrani, Humanitarian Coordinator for Fiji, referring to the international event to be held 23-24 May in Istanbul, Turkey. The World Humanitarian Summit will be the first event of its kind in history, bringing together more than 5,000 people from governments, international organizations, civil society, Diaspora, business and academia to tackle a number of humanitarian challenges. These include how the vulnerability of people and communities can be reduced so that there is less need to deliver humanitarian aid. Read more about the World Humanitarian Summit and the Secretary-General’s Agenda for Humanity on our special . “It will be a chance for the Pacific to speak out on the need to adequately finance and invest in disaster preparedness and risk reduction to alleviate humanitarian crises. It also makes good social and economic sense for governments striving to achieve sustainable development,” said Ms. Lubrani. Mr. Thomson is also looking ahead to the Summit with a clear message from Fiji: “What we want to see at the Summit is a renewed call to make the implementation of the Paris Agreement as number one priority in the world.”

338-> World Environment Day: COVID-19 crisis demands fundamental rethink
The COVID-19 health crisis should be seen as a clarion call to “fundamentally rethink our relationship” with natural ecosystems and shrinking biodiversity, the UN cultural agency chief said on Friday, . Against the backdrop of bushfires in Brazil, the United States and Australia; locust infestations across East Africa; and a global pandemic, the theme for this year’s commemoration, biodiversity, points out the interdependence of humans and the webs of life in which they exist. We rely on nature for our health, jobs & so much more. For , & raise your voice with   & citizens around the planet. Reply & tell us why it’s time Why you 💚 nature & what you’re doing to care for it. “The pandemic has allowed us to observe what scientists the world over have been saying  for  years:  the  interdependence  between  humanity  and  biodiversity  is  so profound that the latter’s vulnerabilities are our own”, Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ) in her message for the day. Over the past year, the environmental crisis has revealed itself in a spectacular and disturbing manner. “While wildfires ravaged tropical rainforests as if they were arid savannah, dramatically highlighting the effects climate change, the pandemic has cast yet another harsh light on the crisis affecting biodiversity”, she stated, urging people around the globe to forge a broad consensus – both technical and ethical – to “construct a new pact with the living world”. Pillars of climate change Every year, in late May and early June, the world spotlights three major international days that that can be considered the systemic pillars of climate change: biodiversity, climate and the oceans. The UNESCO chief urged everyone to reflect upon how World Environment Day is “a whole, a complex system wherein, climate the oceans and the diversity of living organisms and their surroundings interact sometimes in ways that are beyond our ability to anticipate”. “This year”, she concluded, “as the world struggles with an unprecedented pandemic, these days resonate more urgently than ever”. Environmental migration Meanwhile, in his video message, the Director General of the International Organization for Migration ( ), António Vitorino, flagged that the environment has always prompted people to move. He spelled out that disasters displace millions every year and that climate change affects migration patterns the world over. “Even when societies are slowed down by COVID-19, nothing stops cyclones and floods, the climate continues to change, the environment keeps degrading, and many people are forced out of their homes”, the IOM chief, also noting that other people are “trapped in environmentally fragile regions or cannot resort to usual seasonal agriculture activities”. He encouraged everyone, “even while battling the global pandemic”, to stay focused on climate change and biodiversity throughout. “Let’s take action now for people and for nature”, underscored Mr. Vitorino. COVID-19 and biodiversity COVID-19 has revealed the vulnerability of global systems to protect the environment, health and economy, the UN Environment Programme ( ) said in a compelling video that illustrates how nature can protect us from pandemics. It explains that zoonotic diseases are transferred from animals to humans, including in all likelihood the COVID-19 . UNEP explains that keeping the diversity of nature and animal species intact, protects us against global health crises. And while a high host species diversity can also reduce disease risk, if in some cases those hosts are removed, a resulting monoculture of animals is created, that are likely to increase their role as disease transmitters. “We need to invest in a better scientific understanding of how human activity can affect potential future zoonoses”, upheld UN Environment . “Now is the time to appreciate the vital role of the health of our planet and to take immediate action to conserve nature”.

339-> First Person: Collecting the ‘Book of Life’ for coral reefs
With the climate crisis threatening coral reefs around the world, a researcher in Hawaii is part of a team pioneering new techniques to preserve living coral sperm and larvae, and ultimately save the biodiversity and genetic diversity of coral reefs not just in Hawaii but across the world. “Cryopreservation is a relatively new field of science founded in the late 1940s.  It was first used to preserve human embryos in the early 1980s and then human eggs at the end of the 90s. At Coconut Island we have been working for the last 16 years on adapting those techniques to successfully preserve coral sperm and larvae to help restore reefs now, or potentially use them to reseed the ocean in the future. Once frozen, the material is held in large thermos-like containers which can store them for hundreds of years in liquid nitrogen. We call them biorepositories. We're really collecting the Book of Life for coral reefs and that's significant, because it contains the genetic diversity and biodiversity of our coral reefs. Coral are actually animals which create a skeleton with a thin veneer of skin on it, which is the coral animal. If you step on it, you can destroy the fragile coral. That's why we don’t want people walking on reefs, because they basically destroy all of the tissue that is the coral. The coral animal is actually a single polyp, so there can be thousands of animals on one piece of skeleton, although there are many different species with different sized coral animals. Why coral reefs are critical for life on Earth Coral reefs are important for life on Earth, as almost 25 per cent of all marine life lives on a coral reef at some point and so, without reefs, many species of fish that we eat wouldn't exist. They also provide a natural protection for our coastlines, like here in Kaneohe Bay. We've had a number of tsunamis, but the barrier reef took the impact and protected our homes. They are also important for many types of livelihoods through tourism and fishing, to name a few. Finally, corals are intimately involved in the process which helps green algae produce oxygen. These algae produce up to 50% of the world’s oxygen. A lot of the conservation work that happens with coral now is around trying to restore and rebuild reefs that have been damaged.  People want hope, they want to see some kind of restoration, even if it's not going to ultimately end up in building new reefs. It’s part of the psychology of engaging people in valuing and preserving wild species and places. Creating new life in the lab The Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology is unique; it’s a very sophisticated laboratory sitting on a coral reef here in Kaneohe Bay. It’s a great location, as we can take a small boat or even snorkel to three kinds of reef on our doorstep; patch, barrier and fringing reefs. So, it’s a lot easier to work here than, for example, at some locations along the Great Barrier Reef in Australia which requires an oceanographic vessel to collect coral samples. Throughout much of the world, corals have a relatively restricted reproduction cycle, spawning or breeding just a couple days a year. So, we don't have a lot of time to work. However, here in Hawaii, reproduction is a much more extended — we have almost three months for various species that spawn. What can we freeze? You can successfully freeze the sperm of most animals, so the very first thing we worked out was how to freeze the coral sperm, and we have built the necessary equipment to freeze it in the field. Freezing eggs is more difficult and is almost unknown, except for humans and a few domestic animals. We have not yet frozen coral eggs. However, we have to work out how to freeze coral larvae, and use very sophisticated methods, such as lasers, to warm the larvae at millions of degrees per minute. Additionally, we have used these frozen assets to prove that they can be used for restoration. We have used frozen sperm to make new coral; and we've crossed sperm from one geographical region, with eggs from another area that wouldn't ordinarily meet, to show that it can be done. This proof of concept is called assisted gene flow, because it can allow us to move genes from corals that are thriving and partner them with coral that are not doing as well. Climate Change and coral ‘heart attacks’ One of the biggest threats to coral reefs is climate change. Our overuse of fossil fuels is warming the planet. It also causes the ocean to warm and to become more acidic, which is problematic for corals. When the oceans become too acidic, it will ultimately prevent the coral from absorbing the calcium carbonate that they need to grow. When the ocean temperature is too high, coral bleaches, and loses its life-giving algal symbionts, which is a bit like a person having a heart attack. If this happens on an annual basis, then corals may ultimately die off. It's not going to be easy to restore our oceans, unless we seriously make some changes now. There are both local and global causes which are leading to the death of reefs and one of the biggest things that we can do is to start really addressing those local causes. In Kaneohe Bay that means dealing with sediment and pollution in the Bay. As an individual, the global issue of climate change seems somewhat intractable: it’s difficult to feel like you can have any impact to help our future. I think that's what we're doing with our conservation efforts. I cannot reduce global CO2, but our conservation and reproductive efforts can potentially help to provide seeds for the future for the ocean. Our job is really not about today, it’s about 200 or 500 years from now when, hopefully, our oceans have been restored to pre-industrial conditions. I'll never see the fruition of that work in my life, nor my students or their students, but we’ve set this whole thing in motion. As a scientist, I know we're doing something that really is good for the planet. Coral reefs are the most beautiful ecosystem on our planet and it’s critical that we do this work now.” Life Below Water and the UN

340-> FROM THE FIELD: Pacific islanders confront twin threats of climate change and coronavirus
People living on an isolated island community in the Pacific Ocean are finding ways to reduce their dependence on expensive imported food while promoting climate resilient farming techniques, thanks to a programme supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Islanders in Kiribati have long recognized that they need to adopt more sustainable and climate-appropriate fishing and farming practices, in order to feed themselves; a situation which has become more pressing as the food imports are disrupted by the global pandemic. Like many Small Island Developing States (SIDS), Kiribati’s low-lying topography makes it particularly susceptible to warming and rising sea levels brought on by climate change. UNDP has been working with the authorities there to ensure islanders get enough to eat, promoting traditional farming techniques, as well introducing household kitchen gardens. Read more about how Kiribati is facing up to the twin threats of climate change and COVID-19.

341-> ‘New contract’ needed with nature to keep drought and deserts at bay
The UN Secretary-General has called for to address ongoing global challenges connected to land degradation, such as forced migration, hunger and climate change. António Guterres made the appeal on Wednesday in a message to mark the The Impact of desertification in Food Systems - Desertification and Drought Day 2020 “Through international action and solidarity, we can scale up land restoration and nature-based solutions for climate action and the benefit of future generations. By doing so, we can deliver on the and leave no one behind”, he said. Desertification, or the degradation of land in arid areas, is caused primarily by human activities and climatic variations, with more than three billion people routinely affected. Drylands cover more than a third of the planet’s land surface. They are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation and inappropriate land use, such as through overgrazing or bad irrigation practices. Choose to protect nature This year’s observation puts the spotlight on sustainable production and consumption. With ‘Food. Feed. Fibre’ as the slogan, the aim is to get people everywhere to reduce food waste, shop at local markets, and swap clothes instead of always buying new items. The head of the UN office which oversees a global treaty on preventing land degradation said that although the pandemic may have temporarily curtailed some freedoms, such as travelling at will, people still have freedom of choice. “In our globalized world, the food we eat, the feed for our livestock and the fibre for clothes, impact land thousands of miles away,” Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary at the . “Each of us holds the power to protect the land for each choice we make in our daily lives. And we can still choose to protect nature. By doing so, we in fact protect our future.” Great Green Wall The Secretary-General pointed to efforts to reverse land degradation, such as the Great Green Wall in Africa’s Sahel region, launched by the African Union in 2007. Through the initiative, trees are being planted from Senegal to Djibouti, to restore land and boost food security, transforming lives and livelihoods along the way. “Such efforts bring back biodiversity, reduce the effects of climate change and make communities more resilient,” the UN chief said. “All told, the benefits outweigh the costs ten-fold.” Globally, 75 per cent of land is degraded, according to the President of the UN General Assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande. “As land degrades, resources deplete. Thus, the most vulnerable people are further exposed to poverty and hunger; with women, smallholder farmers, indigenous communities and children being disproportionately affected”, he . ‘Urgent paradigm shift’ The resulting extreme poverty and hunger are among the root causes of both conflict and migration, he continued, outlining a cycle of “degrade-abandon-migrate”. Mr. Muhammad-Bande believes an “urgent paradigm shift” is needed, focusing on protection, sustainability and restoration, and he called for renewed commitment to safeguarding the planet. “As we build back better in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, let us work together with farmers to promote sustainable land management”, he said. “We must support smallholder farmers, the vast number of whom are women, to make evidence-based decisions in regard to crop selection, inputs usage, and land resilience, in the face of climate change and loss of biodiversity.”

342-> World Oceans Day: Don’t be colour blind, help blue oceans keep the planet green
The COVID-19 pandemic is a “sharp reminder” of how we are all intimately connected to each other and to nature, the UN chief said on Monday, . “As we work to end the pandemic and build back better, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity – and responsibility – to correct our relationship with the natural world, including the world’s seas and oceans”,  in his message for the day. We not only rely on the oceans for food, livelihoods, transport and trade but, as the lungs of our planet and its largest carbon sink, they also play a vital role in regulating the global climate. “Today, sea levels are rising due to climate change, threatening lives and livelihoods in low-lying nations and coastal cities and communities around the world”, Mr. Guterres reminded. Happy ! Today is not just about the ocean. the environment. something abstract.  It’s about our lives. Because we’re all interconnected.  When we , we help save our future:   Moreover, as the oceans are becoming increasingly acidic, marine biodiversity and essential food chains are increasingly being jeopardized. And plastic pollution has become ubiquitous. Against this backdrop, ‘Innovation for a Sustainable Ocean’, has been chosen as this year’s theme. Dedicated decade Better understanding of the oceans is essential for conserving fish stocks and discovering new products and medicines. “The upcoming United Nations will provide impetus and a common framework for action”, the UN chief said, urging governments and all concerned to commit innovation and science to conserve and sustain the world’s oceans. In that same vein, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, President of the UN General Assembly, underscored in his statement that the unsustainable misuse of this valuable resource threatens "the ability of our oceans to provide for us”. As we look towards the Decade, which will begin next year, he encouraged everyone to “take urgent action” by putting protection measures into motion to enable the oceans to create a better world on land and under water, “for generations to come”. Life under water A healthy marine environment holds untold potential for achieving the entirety of the Sustainable Development Agenda. In January, the opened to implement the (SDGs): “Protection of marine biodiversity is of essential importance as we progress with the implementation of ”, Mr. Mohammad-Bande said, referring to the 14th global goal, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. He also pointed out that four SDG targets pertaining to the goal, expire in 2020. “This World Oceans Day, we must take a moment to reflect on and appreciate all that the ocean does for us. It is also an opportunity for us to look forward”, he pointed out, exhorting everyone to “harness the potential of blue and green economies”. Strategic investments can generate 100 million jobs by 2050, facilitating critical global recovery efforts in the wake of the pandemic, according to the Assembly president. “This year we must take action to prevent a further eight million tons of plastic waste from entering the ocean and protect global ecosystems”, he stressed. In closing, Mr. Mohammad-Bande asked all Member States to “commit to protecting 30 per cent of our blue planet by 2030”, in order to safeguard at least 30 per cent of our ocean, through a network of highly protected areas. “We simply cannot stand by while oceans acidify, sea levels rise and pollution increases”, he concluded.

343-> Protect the environment, prevent pandemics, ‘nature is sending us a clear message’
On this year’s , celebrated on June 5, the UN is drawing links between the health of the planet, and human health, and highlighting the importance of protecting biodiversity, the system that supports life. “At least 70 per cent of emerging infectious diseases” such as , are crossing from the wild, to people, and “transformative actions are urgently required to protect environment and human rights”. This was the message from David Boyd, the independent UN Special Rapporteur on human rights and the environment, ahead of this year’s Day. Mr. Boyd added that countries should take urgent action to protect the environment and stop climate disruption, biodiversity loss, toxic pollution and diseases that jump from animals to humans. Get the message UN chief said in that “nature is sending us a clear message. We are harming the natural world, to our own detriment.” He noted that habitat degradation and biodiversity loss were accelerating, “climate disruption is getting worse…To care for humanity, we must care for nature.” Time for natureSince World Environment Day was launched in 1974, it has grown to become the UN’s biggest annual event, advocating for environmental action and raising worldwide awareness of the need to increase protection for the planet’s long-term survival. The 2020 edition, which has the tagline “Time for Nature”, is being hosted by Colombia, which is organizing several events, streamed live, which can be accessed here, or on social media. The theme is biodiversity protection, at a time when one million animal and plant species are believed to be on the brink of extinction. This year’s Day inevitably references the global COVID-19 health crisis, noting that, with the population doubling over the past 50 years, and the global economy growing fourfold over the same period, the delicate balance of nature has been disrupted, creating ideal conditions for pathogens, such as COVID-19, to spread. As countries open up, and governments approve stimulus packages to support job creation, poverty reduction, development and economic growth, the UN Environment Programme ( ), is urging them to “build back better”. This involves capturing opportunities for green investment — such as renewable energy, smart housing, green public procurement, and public transport — guided by the principles and standards of sustainable production and consumption. A failure to do so, warns UNEP, and an attempted return to business as usual, risks seeing inequalities rising even further, and a worsening of the degradation of the planet, at a time when one million animal and plant species are on the brink of extinction.

344-> Solidarity is the world’s ‘best line of defence’: UN General Assembly president
Back in September, the world committed to a landmark political declaration on universal health coverage. Now, in the throes of the COVID-19 crisis, the President of the UN General Assembly has reiterated the importance of investing in health as “an investment in human capital, social and economic development and the empowerment of all people”. In a virtual press conference on Monday, reflecting on the 193-member body’s work throughout the pandemic, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande reminded journalists that despite the extraordinary circumstances, the Assembly has worked hard to uphold its vital mandates, perform essential services and ensure continuity for the people it serves. Against the backdrop of restrictions to physical in-person meetings, the Assembly has had to apply innovative working methods, such as a so-called ‘ ’, which provides Member States with at least 72 hours to raise objections on a draft resolution or decision, and allowing countries to outline their positions. “Since March 27th, the General Assembly has adopted 26 resolutions and decisions under silence procedure”, said Mr. Muhammad-Bande. Secret ballots Following consultations with Member States, the UN has developed a procedure during the health crisis to conduct voting and election processes, via secret ballot without the usual full plenary meeting. Mr. Mohammad-Bande informed correspondents based at UN Headquarters in New York, that 17 June would be a bumper election day, for non-permanent members of the ; new members who will sit on the Economic and Social Council (ESOSOC); and for his successor, who will wield the gavel in the General Assembly. “I will oversee the proceedings in the General Assembly Hall”, he said, adding that the whole process, would be streamed live on UN WebTV. ‘Seminal year for humanity’ Calling 2020 “a seminal year for humanity”, the UN official pointed out that the Organization would be commemorating its 75th anniversary, including Charter Day on 26 June, which will assess the last decades’ successes and shortcomings with regard to implementing the UN’s founding treaty. Mr. Mohammad-Bande also pointed to 21 July as the day that a virtual high-level meeting would celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, when governments around the globe agreed on a comprehensive plan to achieve global legal equality, known as the and Platform for Action. “If we are to ensure a gender-responsive recovery from , we simply cannot fall short of our commitments in the Beijing +25 process”, he spelled out. At the same time, January began the on implementing the (SDGs). “These milestones call for action to create a better world for all”, upheld the Assembly president. Global goals In outlining other upcoming noteworthy events, he observed that “as we look towards the future we want [and] the UN we need, we will examine how to best collectively overcome current and upcoming challenges”. The first in the series of policy seminars to eradicate extreme poverty will be convened 30 June during a high-level meeting on Poverty Eradication Strategies, which will also advance the . “[In] what looks to be the decade of recovery in the wake of COVID-19”, he underscored that “we cannot deviate from the path towards achieving the and realizing the 2050 Vision for Biodiversity: ‘Living in harmony with nature’”. In closing, he observed that “Member States are continuing to tackle a wide range of complex intersectional issues”. “Solidarity remains our best line of defence, and we remain nations, united striving together to deliver for all”, concluded the General Assembly President.

345-> Extreme weather ‘record’ likely in Arctic Circle, says UN weather agency WMO
that temperatures in a Russian town in the Arctic Circle likely reached a record 38C (100.4F), last weekend, have been approved by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) pending final verification, it said on Tuesday. “The is seeking to verify reports of a new temperature record north of the Arctic circle”, WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis told journalists in Geneva. “It was reported in the Russian town of Verkhoyansk amid a prolonged Siberian heatwave and increase in wildfire activity.” Temperatures in the Arctic Circle appear to have reached a record high over the weekend. Our planet is sending us a clear warning. The need for immediate and ambitious is more urgent than ever. If the Russian authorities confirm the temperature observation taken last Saturday, WMO will then refer the finding for a further detailed review by an international panel of experts, Ms. Nullis explained. The region of Eastern Siberia now in the spotlight is known for its weather extremes in winter and in summer, with temperatures above 30C (86F) not unusual in July. This latest report of an Arctic temperature more typical of the Tropics comes a few months after the Argentine research base, Esperanza, on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula, set a new record temperature of 18.4C (65.3F) on 6 February. Arctic heating up twice as fast According to WMO, the Arctic is heating at roughly twice the global average. The heat spike follows a prolonged Siberian heatwave and wildfire period, Ms. Nullis explained, after an unusually warm spring that was also characterised by a lack of snow. Data from WMO shows that May was about 10C (18.5F) above average in many parts of Siberia, “and it was this extraordinary heat which actually drove, made the warmest May on record for…the northern hemisphere, and also we think at a global level as well”, said Ms. Nullis. According to WMO, air temperatures in the Arctic from 2016 to 2019 were the highest on record. Sea ice declines Equally worrying, the volume of Arctic sea ice in September 2019 – after the melting season - declined by more than 50 per cent, compared to the average from 1979 to 2019. WMO’s verification process involves requesting additional information from the Russian meteorological service Roshydromet, including the readings, the type of equipment used and how the observation corresponds to others taken by surrounding weather stations. “Those data will then be very carefully examined by an international panel of atmospheric scientists who, once they discussed it, will make a recommendation as to whether or not the observation is valid,” said Professor Randall Cerveny, WMO Rapporteur, in a statement. He added: “The end result will be incredibly valuable information that will help climate scientists better understand climate, engineers and medical doctors better prepare for climate extremes and even the general public in achieving a better appreciation of climate change across this planet.”

346-> World must unite against ‘preventable tragedy’ of ocean pollution: UN chief
From carrying your own water bottle, to volunteering for a local clean-up, everybody needs to do something to stop plastic pollution from getting into the world’s oceans, said UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his message for . Marking the day on Friday, the UN chief reminded everyone of the major role the oceans have in everyday life, as the lungs of the planet, providing most of the oxygen that we breathe. “The oceans make our blue planet unique in our solar system – and not just visually,” he adding that they help regulate “the global climate and are the ultimate source of the water that sustains all life on Earth, from coral reefs to snow-covered mountains, from tropical rain forests to mighty rivers, and even deserts.” “However,” he continued “the ability of the oceans to provide their essential services is being threatened by climate change, pollution and unsustainable use.” Plastic pollution alone is reeking tremendous havoc on the marine resources of the world, he said, highlighting the problem of plastic pollution in particular. Eighty per cent of all pollution in the sea comes from land, including some eight million tons of plastic waste each year, that have cost the lives of one million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals. Moreover, it causes $8 billion in damage annually to marine ecosystems. Pollution, said Mr. Guterres, “chokes waterways, harms communities that depend on fishing and tourism, kills turtles and birds, whales and dolphins, and finds its way to the most remote areas of the planet and throughout the food chain on which we ultimately rely.” “Unless we change course, plastic waste could soon outweigh all the fish in the oceans,” Mr. Guterres added. The UN chief urged everyone to work individually and collectively to “stop this preventable tragedy” and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds. “Action starts at home, and speaks louder than words,” he said. “The United Nations aims to lead by example, and more than 30 of our agencies have now begun working to end the use of single-use plastic.” But everyone needs to play a part by taking simple actions like carrying your own water bottle, coffee cup and shopping bags; recycling plastic, said Mr. Guterres; avoiding products that contain microplastics; and volunteering for a local clean-ups. “If we all do a little, our combined actions can be massive,” he added. “On this World Oceans Day, I urge governments, communities and individuals alike to celebrate our oceans by helping clear them of pollution and ensure they remain vibrant for generations to come,” concluded the Secretary-General.

347-> Save our planet by protecting migratory birds and their ‘epic journeys,’ urges UN chief
As they make their global journeys, migratory birds not only set birdwatchers’ binoculars agog, they also help the planet maintain its essential ecological balance. That’s one of the key messages from United Nations chief Antonio Guterres, for , celebrated on Saturday, with the soaring message: “Unifying Our Voices for Bird Conservation.” “Migratory birds connect people, ecosystems and nations. They and of an interconnected planet,” said in a statement to mark the Day. “Their epic journeys inspire people of all ages, across the globe,” he continued, adding: “World Migratory Bird Day is an opportunity to celebrate the great natural wonder of bird migration – but also a reminder that those patterns, and ecosystems worldwide, are threatened by climate change.” The Day highlights the need to and their habitats by raising awareness of the threats they face, their ecological importance and the need for international cooperation to conserve them. Migratory birds fly hundreds and thousands of kilometres, along historic routes, to find the best habitats available for feeding, breeding and raising their young. The perilous journeys involve a wide and diverse array of threats. Of the 11,000-bird species on the planet, one-in-five is considered migratory. Forty per cent of them are in decline, with one-in-eight under threat of global extinction. Major threats include habitat-loss and degradation, caused by agricultural and coastal development; collision with badly placed wind turbines and powerlines; unsustainable harvesting, and illegal killing and taking. Migratory birds are also greatly affected by poisoning, such as through ingesting lead released into the environment, through spent ammunition, or toxic weights used for fishing. “Migratory from every corner: they are losing their habitats, subjected to illegal killing and suffering from the impacts of climate change,” said Erik Solheim, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme, , adding that we all have a responsibility to “save such a precious component of the natural world.” By protecting them, we protect our planet. Key supporters and partners globally, are adamant that successful migratory bird conservation can only be achieved through a united effort. Beginning this year, World Migratory Bird Day will be observed annually each May and October, to coincide with the cycle of migration, making it possible to organize events in countries around the world at peak migration times. “I urge Governments and people everywhere to take concerted conservation action that will help to ensure the birds’ survival – and our own,” the Secretary-General concluded.

348-> UN forum to coordinate global efforts to address worsening water shortages
With extreme weather costing hundreds of billions a year and fears that by 2050, one in four people will be living in a country affected by severe water shortages, a global conference got underway on Monday convened by the United Nations meteorological agency to manage the precious resource more sustainably. The problem has been further complicated by a lack of comprehensive water supply data and monitoring systems which is making it harder to respond to the growing crisis. “ ,” said Harry Lins, the President of the World Meteorological Organization ( ) Commission for Hydrology. “And yet the systems and data collection which underpin these vital services to society are under real pressure,” he added, underscoring that informed decision-making must be based on comprehensive facts and figures. This sums up the key challenge underlying the agency’s , taking place in Geneva from 7-9 May, is seeking to address. It brings together the full gamut of so-called “water stakeholders” – decision makers, meteorological and hydrological services; the private and academic sector; non-governmental organizations, and UN entities – around the same table to coordinate efforts as well as leverage individual knowledge and collective expertise to maximum effect. WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said it was important for all actors to cope with the scale of the challenges that lie ahead, citing the two extremes of droughts and floods. “Effective flood and drought policies can be implemented only with data and models for assessing the frequency and magnitude of extreme events,” he said, adding that the same also holds for other goals related to water and its efficient use; including those in the . Sustainable Development Goal 6 ( ) explicitly calls for sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Water is also a key component for other Goals including those on eliminating extreme poverty ( ); as wells as , to eradicate hunger and malnutrition, as well as on mitigating climate change.

349-> The world is being ‘swamped’ by harmful plastic waste says UN chief, marking Environment Day
The world must unite to “ ” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said in his message for on Tuesday, noting that microplastic particles in the ocean, “now outnumber stars in our galaxy”. In his message marking the day on 5 June, he said a healthy planet was essential for a prosperous and peaceful future, spelling out that: “We all have a role to play in protecting our only home.” “Our world is swamped by harmful plastic waste,” he stated. “Every year, more than eight million tonnes end up in the oceans.” Pointing out the astonishing comparison between stars in the cosmos and ocean plastics, Mr. Guterres underscored that “from remote islands, to the Artic, nowhere is untouched.” If present trends continue, by 2050 our oceans will have more plastic than fish, he said. On World Environment Day, Mr. Guterres is encouraging everyone to also stop using plastic products which are designed just to be thrown away, such as plastic bottles. “Refuse what you can’t re-use,” he asserted. “Together, we can chart a path to a cleaner, greener world,” concluded the Secretary-General. Since it was first celebrated in 1974, the Day has helped raise awareness and generate political momentum around global environmental concerns such as ozone depletion, desertification and global warming.  In conjunction with the Day, UN Environment ( ), on Monday, launched or the , which paints a positive picture of a renewable power sector characterized by falling costs, increased investment, record-setting installation and innovative business models that are driving rapid change. The Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century, or REN21 – supported by - is a global renewable energy policy network that aims to facilitate knowledge exchange, policy development and joint action towards a rapid global transition to renewable energy. After years of active policy support - driven by technology advances, rapid growth and dramatic cost reductions in solar and wind - renewable electricity is now less expensive than newly installed fossil and nuclear energy generation in many parts of the world. But not all of the news is good. There is uneven progress between sectors and across different geographical regions, and a “fundamental disconnect” between commitments and real action on the ground. The power sector on its own will not deliver the emissions reductions demanded by the or the aspirations of to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, says the report. The heating, cooling and transport sectors, which together account for about 80 per cent of the world's total energy demand, are also lagging. Simply put, the global renewable energy transition is progressing far too slowly.

350-> As cities boom, forests key to meeting demands for water, food and energy – UN
With two-thirds of the world’s population expected to live in urban areas by 2050, forests are critical part of the solution to the unprecedented demand for water, food and energy that these cities will face, senior United Nations officials said Wednesday, on the International Day of Forests. “How we manage forests ,” said Manoel Sobral Filho, Director of the UN Forum on Forests Secretariat (UNFFS). He noted that growth and shifts in population, changes in climate, and innovation in knowledge and technology will undoubtedly impact future forests. “One thing I am certain of, investing in forests is essential for securing a sustainable future for communities the world over,” he added. In his video message for the Day, José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), said that “ in and around cities provide habitats, food and protection for many plants and animals, helping to maintain and increase biodiversity.” This year, the , observed annually on 21 March, will focus on the interlinkages between the sustainable management of forest and sustainable cities. The theme provides an opportunity to highlight the benefits forests and trees provide to urban communities. It is estimated that by 2050, more than half of the world’s population will face water stress. Given that forested catchments provide three-quarters of all freshwater used worldwide, safeguarding the water-providing capacity of forests is even more urgent. Trees in cities help regulate climate, store carbon, and reduce flooding and storm water runoff.  Sustainable forest management and sustainable forest products offers some of the most effective and cost-competitive natural carbon capture and storage options available. Forests are home to over 80 per cent of biodiversity on land, and urban forests and city parks can provide important habitat for migratory birds and other fauna and flora. of the , adopted in 2015 by world leaders, calls for action to “protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss” by 2030. envisions “a world in which all types of forests and trees outside forests are sustainably managed, contribute to sustainable development and provide economic, social, environmental and cultural benefits for present and future generations.” At UN Headquarters in New York, the Day is being celebrated with a featuring speeches by prominent officials, including Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Social and Economic Affairs.

351-> Climate change: An 'existential threat' to humanity, UN chief warns global summit
None of the world’s challenges loom as large as climate change, the United Nations chief told a major climate action summit on Tuesday, reiterating his belief that global warming poses an “existential threat” to humanity. Both leadership and innovation are , said in his keynote address to the global gathering, known as the R20 Austrian World Summit – a long-term initiative to help regions, States and cities implement the and meet the targets. Mr. Guterres spelled out: “We must use all our resources to build a sense of urgency”, to raise ambition, while keeping temperature rises in the years ahead, as close to 1.5 degrees Celsius as possible. He said there was reason to hope, declaring that “the world is seeing a groundswell of climate action”,  citing examples, including Morocco’s building of a solar farm “the size of Paris, that will power over a million homes by 2020” and China’s achievement in already passing it’s 2020 goal of producing 105 gigawatts of solar power capacity.  “We must build on this,” the UN chief emphasized, calling renewable energy – which already produces a fifth of the world’s electricity – power that also delivers significant health benefits. The reports that more than 80 per cent of people living in urban areas are exposed to poor-quality air that is damaging human health. Financing to accelerate climate action is necessary if we are to bend the emissions curve  “Investments in clean, green infrastructure need to be scaled up globally,” he explained. “For that, we need leadership from the finance and investment community and by local, regional and national governments who will decide on major infrastructure plans over the coming years.” Mr. Guterres encouraged private sector leaders attending the UN General Assembly-backed summit in the Austrian capital, to announce new financing for clean energy projects. While the 30-member independent estimates that 2017 investments in renewable electricity amounted to $242 billion, said the UN chief, that was still far less than the funds invested in new fossil fuel development. Billions of dollars more needs to be invested in renewables if we are to see a “full-scale transition to clean energy” by 2020, said Mr. Guterres. Moreover, some 75 per cent of the infrastructure needed by 2050 has still not been built. “Mobilizing and equipping local governments with the capacity and financing to accelerate climate action is necessary if we are to bend the emissions curve,” he maintained. Noting that climate change continues to move faster than climate action, Mr. Guterres quoted the UN saying: “The more we disrupt our climate, the more we risk severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts.” “But,” he added, “it does not have to be that way,” pointing to solar, wind and cutting-edge technologies, such as electric vehicles or energy from algae in the ocean, which promises a new era of clean air. “Let’s join a race to the top, a race where there are only winners,” concluded the Secretary-General.

352-> Promoting biodiversity across all agricultural sectors ‘fundamental’ — FAO chief
Changing how countries across the world produce food is “fundamental” to protecting the future of the Earth’s ecosystem, said the head of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) on Tuesday. With large swathes of the planet’s surface used to grow food, raise animals or produce products such as timber; the agricultural sector — if managed sustainably — can make significant contributions to protecting biodiversity, said Director-General José Graziano da Silva. Addressing a three-day on mainstreaming the key issue into agricultural policies and practices, he called for transformative changes in food production, aimed at producing healthy and nutritious food while simultaneously safeguarding the planet’s biodiversity. “Biodiversity is essential for safeguarding global food security and nutrition, improving rural livelihoods, and enhancing the resilience of people and communities,” he said in keynote remarks. However, planetary biodiversity — at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels — faces a number of threats, the FAO Director-General noted, adding that food production “is a big part of the problem”. “Biodiversity is essential for safeguarding global food security and nutrition, improving rural livelihoods, and enhancing the resilience of people and communities”  Pointing out that the world still produces food based mainly on 50-year-old principles, often using environmentally unfriendly chemicals, he also described how the loss of agricultural biodiversity poses a direct risk to food security. “Only three staple crops — rice, maize and wheat — and three animal species — cattle, pigs and chicken — provide the majority of food energy intake in the world,” he said. Diversifying food sources could play a critical role in ensuring food security; such as genetically diverse plants which are more tolerant to hotter and drier conditions, he said. Similarly, more diverse livestock would allow farmers and pastoralists to breed animals which could adapt to changing environmental conditions. “This is especially important nowadays in the face of emerging challenges such as the impacts of climate change, rapid urbanization and also a growing population with changing diets,” Mr. Graziano da Silva said. At the farm level, implementing production practices that prioritize safeguarding biodiversity can also ensure that food can be produced sustainably. To that end, this week’s FAO conference gathers together people from across the whole sector, to consider real-world examples of how agriculture, fisheries and forestry have been successfully managed to safeguard biodiversity. A series of working groups will also focus on avenues for mainstreaming biodiversity in agriculture, including global governance; national policies and legislation; financial incentives and investments; and supply chain measures.

353-> Rich variety of life on earth essential says UN chief Guterres, marking biological diversity day
The welfare and prosperity of people now and in the future, depends on a “rich variety of life on earth” said United Nations in his message for the , marked on Tuesday. Since December 1993, when the entered into force, its parties have acted to conserve the earth’s flora and fauna, in a sustainable and fair way, said the UN chief. “Achieving these objectives is integral to meet our goals for sustainable development,” Mr. Guterres stressed, underscoring the importance of protecting, restoring and ensuring access to ecosystems to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger: Goals 1 and 2 of what are known as the ( ). To mitigate climate change, he notes that deforestation and land degradation must be reduced while at the same time, enhancing carbon stocks in forests, drylands, rangelands and croplands. He said it was also critical to protect the biodiversity of forests and watersheds to support clean and plentiful water supplies. Yet, despite these and other benefits, biodiversity continues to decline globally. “The answer is to intensify efforts and build on successes,” stated Mr. Gutteres. He explained that in 2018, Parties to the Convention will begin work on a new action plan to ensure that, by 2050, biodiversity is preserved to the best of our abilities. “The entire world needs to join this effort,” he emphasized: “I urge governments, businesses and people everywhere to act to protect the nature that sustains us.  Our collective future depends on it,” concluded the Secretary-General. In her message, Cristiana Paşca Palmer, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity ( ), noted that biodiversity is at the heart of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Its decline compounds other challenges, including climate change, water and food security, and public health, which “can potentially for human existence on this planet,” she warned. “It is therefore, imperative to do everything in our power to halt the destruction of nature,” she emphasized. “We have two more years to go to redouble our efforts, […] to design a new deal for nature that will take us from 2020 to the middle of this century,” she said, adding: “We don’t have much time. But we have a lot of power if we work together, in a collaborative manner to change the way we use nature and biodiversity. Martha Rojas-Urrego, Secretary General of the , drew attention to wetlands as being among the most biodiverse ecosystems on earth – from which almost all freshwater supplies are drawn. “Given the increasing human population and its dependence on water and wetlands, we must work together in a collective, concerted and sustained effort to conserve wetlands for the planet’s biodiversity and human wellbeing,” she said. For his part, David Morgan, from the UN-administered Secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( ), reiterated that “ on our planet, for both the natural environment and human beings.” “Safeguarding biodiversity is among the key elements of the UN Sustainable Development Goals ( ),” he said. “While we are still facing tremendous challenges, with the political will of the world’s governments, we can protect the world’s biological diversity,” he asserted, affirming ’ continued collaboration with CBD “to save our common heritage for this and future generations.”

354-> Hunger surges amid deadly conflicts, poor weather conditions in many countries – UN agriculture agency
Despite ample food supplies, persistent conflicts and adverse climate shocks are taking a toll on global food security, according to a new report launched on Thursday by the United Nation’s agriculture agency. The Food and Agriculture Organization’s ( ) new reveals that since its last report in March, the number of countries requiring external food assistance has jumped by two, namely Cabo Verde and Senegal, to 39. According to the report, civil war and insecurity in Africa and the Middle East have displaced millions – resulting in . “Poor rains have hit cereal production prospects in South America and Southern Africa,” explained. “Unfavourable weather conditions are also placing a heavy burden on pastoralists in West Africa.” The food insecure countries on FAO’s list are: Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cabo Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guinea, Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Democratic People's Republic of Korea , Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Swaziland, Syria, Uganda, Yemen and Zimbabwe.  Turning to cereal production, FAO foresees a 1.5 per cent annual drop from last year’s record high, with a larger decline in some areas, such as South and North America and Southern Africa. “Conflicts have choked agricultural activity in swathes of Central Africa, notably in the Central African Republic and parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where access to food is further hindered by surging inflation,” FAO elaborated. On a brighter note, after consecutive seasons of drought-reduced harvests, fresh rains point to cereal production gains in East Africa. Meanwhile, abundant rains recently triggered flooding in Somalia, Ethiopia and Kenya, displacing some 800,000 people. In contrast to the trend in the subregion, high staple food prices are rising in Sudan and South Sudan, intensifying food insecurity risks. In the absence of humanitarian assistance, the number of severely food insecure people in South Sudan is expected to rise to 7.1 million people during the June-July lean season. Turning to Asia, the cereal harvest is projected to remain similar to last year's, with recoveries in countries affected by unfavourable weather conditions, including Bangladesh, Viet Nam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and, to a lesser extent, Sri Lanka. While favourable crop conditions in India and Pakistan mean wheat outputs are expected to rise further, fair weather will not be enough to boost crop production in war-afflicted areas, as chronic conflicts impedes access to fields such as in Iraq and Syria, where this year's harvests are expected to decline further.

355-> Heatwaves, hurricanes, floods: 2017 costliest year ever for extreme weather and climate events, says UN
Hurricanes, monsoon floods and continuing severe drought made 2017 the costliest year ever for severe weather and climate events, according to a new report by the United Nations weather agency launched on the eve of . “The start of 2018 has continued where 2017 left off – with extreme weather claiming lives and destroying livelihoods,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said Thursday. Now in its 25th year, the drew attention to the high impact that extreme weather had on economic development, food security, health and migration, pointing to estimates showing disaster losses from weather and climate-related events at $320 billion – the largest annual total on record. The statement confirmed that last year was one of the three warmest on record, and the warmest not influenced by an El Niño event. It also examined other long-term indicators of climate change, such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, sea level rise, shrinking sea ice and ocean heat. “The Arctic experienced unusually high temperatures, whilst densely populated areas in the northern hemisphere were gripped by bitter cold and damaging winter storms. Australia and Argentina suffered extreme heatwaves, whilst drought continued in Kenya and Somalia, and the South African city of Cape Town struggled with acute water shortages,” Mr. Taalas reflected on 2017. According to the report, the North Atlantic hurricane season was not only the costliest ever for the United States, but it also eradicated decades of small Caribbean islands’ development gains. “Since the inaugural Statement on the State of the Global Climate, in 1993, scientific understanding of our complex climate system has progressed rapidly,” Mr. Taalas stated. “This includes our ability to document the occurrence of extreme weather and climate events, the degree to which they can be attributed to human influences, and the correlation of climate change with epidemics and vector-borne diseases,” he continued. Compiled by with input from national meteorological services and UN partners, the statement details that 2017 global mean temperatures were about 1.1 °C above pre-industrial temperatures. The report also provided detailed information to support the international agenda on disaster risk reduction, sustainable development and climate change. “In the past quarter of a century, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide have risen from 360 parts per million to more than 400 ppm. They will remain above that level for generations to come, committing our planet to a warmer future, with more weather, climate and water extremes,” Mr. Taalas asserted. The report revealed that the overall risk of heat-related illness or death has climbed steadily since 1980, with around 30 per cent of the world’s population now living in climatic conditions that deliver potentially deadly temperatures at least 20 days a year. Additionally, from November 2016 to December 2017, 892,000 drought-related displacements were recorded. “Now more than ever, we need to be weather-ready, climate-smart and water-wise,” concluded Mr. Taalas.

356-> The world banks on sunshine, UN says in renewable energy report
In 2017, solar energy dominated global investment in new power generation like never before, according to a new United Nations-backed report, which shows a steady move away from fossil fuel-based power production to ‘green’ power sources. Last year, the world installed a record 98 gigawatts of new solar capacity, far more than the net additions of the rest – other renewables, fossil fuel and nuclear, according to the report, released Thursday by the UN Environment Programme ( ) and its partners. Solar power also attracted far more investment than any other technology, at $160.8 billion, up 18 per cent. A driving power behind last year’s surge in solar was China, where an unprecedented boom saw some 53 gigawatts added – more than half the global total – and $86.5 billion invested, up 58 per cent. The extraordinary surge in solar investment shows how the global energy map is changing and, more importantly, what the economic benefits are of such a shift –  “The extraordinary surge in solar investment shows how the global energy map is changing and, more importantly, what the economic benefits are of such a shift,” said UNEP chief Erik Solheim. “Investments in renewables bring more people into the economy, they deliver more jobs, better quality jobs and better paid jobs. Clean energy also means less pollution, which means healthier, happier development,” he said. Last year was the eighth in a row in which global investment in renewables exceeded $200 billion – and since 2004, the world has invested $2.9 trillion in these green energy sources. Overall, China was by far the world’s largest investing country in renewables, at a record $126.6 billion, up 31 per cent on 2016. There were also sharp increases in investment in Australia, up 147 per cent to $8.5 billion; Mexico, up 810 per cent to $6 billion; and Sweden, up 127 per cent to $3.7 billion. Meanwhile, countries in the Asia-Pacific region, which is projected to account for two-thirds of global energy use between now and 2040, committed to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy by scaling up their share of renewables, as a United Nations forum in Bangkok wrapped up on Thursday. “There is a palpable sense of the enormous opportunities ahead that can transform the energy scene,” Shamshad Akhtar, the Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ), told the two-day forum, acknowledging the growing recognition by governments, the private sector and investors, that a sustainable, low carbon energy system is the only option to safeguard the future. The highlight of the Second was the adoption of a ministerial declaration, which lays out a series of actions to encourage the sustainable use of energy, including through greater regional cooperation to facilitate cross-border infrastructure and energy trade to advance .  Organized by , the Forum provided a platform for governments, the UN system, private companies, international organizations, and civil society organizations to review the region’s implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 7 ( ) on affordable and clean energy. Delegates concluded that Asia and the Pacific has made remarkable progress on universal access to electricity, with renewable energy surpassing price benchmarks that were only expected in 2020. However, greater efforts are needed throughout the region to achieve targets on reliance on clean fuel and renewable energy, and energy efficiency.

357-> Climate Action Special Envoy Bloomberg pledges $4.5 million to help UN fight climate change in line with the Paris Agreement
The UN Special Envoy for Climate Action, Michael Bloomberg, announced on Sunday a contribution of $4.5 million to the Organization’s Climate Change Secretariat, the . The billionaire philanthropist and former Mayor of New York City, pledged last June  to make up the Secretariat’s funding shortfall, caused by US President Donald Trump’s announced withdrawal from the historic 2015 on climate change. The contribution will go towards general operations, including assisting countries to meet targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in line with the accord, agreed by 193 States in the French capital. In late March, the United States Congress announced that it was cutting funding for this year to the by $4.5 million; from $7.5 million, down to $3 million, according to a media release from Bloomberg Philanthropies. Mr. Bloomberg made the announcement of his contribution on the CBS television programme, ‘Face the Nation’, saying that “America made a commitment and as an American, if the government’s not going to do it, we all have a responsibility.” UN  that he was “very grateful to Michael Bloomberg, not only for his generous support to the United Nations, but also for his global leadership on climate action.” with many contributions from signatories to the agreement still outstanding and “a decline in voluntary contributions” the funding was arriving at “a critical time”. It “strengthens UN Climate Change’s capacity to support developing countries” and allowed more “strategic outreach to promote climate action among stakeholders including cities, regions, business and civil society,” said the Secretariat statement. The UNFCCC’s Executive Secretary, Patricia Espinosa, said that “when countries adopted the historic to limit global temperature rise, they also recognized that achieving that goal would take broad-based global climate action in all sectors, public and private.” “I welcome this generous contribution from Bloomberg Philanthropies as an important, practical recognition of our need to work together and to step up our response to climate change,” she added. Mr. Bloomberg added that despite the US withdrawl from the Paris Agreement and funding cuts, he was confident that the US would “meet its commitment by 2025 to reduce greenhouse gases by an agreed amount, and if we do it, hopefully other countries will do it as well.”

358-> Hottest April day ever recorded - maybe: UN weather watchdog
Deadly storms in India and record temperatures in Pakistan are an indication that more extreme weather events are happening globally owing to climate change, United Nations weather experts said on Friday. Amid flash-floods in the East and Horn of Africa - and sand and dust storms in the Arabian Gulf - Clare Nullis from the ( ) told journalists at UN headquarters in Geneva that this week’s storms in northern India had reportedly left more than 100 dead. " We’ve never seen a temperature above 50 degrees C in April.” -  What may well be the hottest temperature ever recorded for April, was registered this week in Pakistan, she added. A weather station in the city of Nawabshah registered 50.2 degrees Celsius on Monday; or 122.4 degrees Fahrenheit. “This is April - not June and July - this is April,” she exclaimed. “We don’t normally see temperatures above 50 degrees: in fact, as we’re aware, we’ve never seen a temperature above 50 degrees C in April.” Moving considerably further south, to another climatic region of the world, A WMO committee of experts also announced on Thursday that a record high temperature recorded for the Antarctic which was set back in in March 2015, still stands. The record high reading, was under threat of being surpassed by a temperature recorded at a nearby weather station, in the same period of warm weather, and in more or less the same location. The existing record of 17.5 degrees Celsius was recorded at the Argentine Research Base Esperanza, near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on 23 March. The rival reading which, if verified, would have set a new record, was registered a day earlier in the same area, at an automatic weather station established by the Czech Republic on Davies Dome. But polar meteorology experts examined the data closely and made their long-awaited announcement on Friday that the existing record still stands.

359-> Nations begin drafting ‘operating manual’ for climate action at UN conference in Bonn
The latest round of United Nations climate change began on Monday in Bonn, Germany, to further develop the “operating manual” for implementing the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to keep temperature rises this century, well below 2 degrees Celsius. “We are witnessing the severe impacts of climate change throughout the world”, said the Executive Secretary of UN Climate Change, Patricia Espinosa, at a press conference. “Every credible scientific source is telling us that these impacts will only get worse if we do not address climate change and it also tells us that our window of time for addressing it is closing very soon,” she added. “We need to dramatically increase our ambitions,” stressed the chief, outlining three priorities. First, all stakeholders - including governments, non-governmental organizations, businesses, investors and citizens – must accelerate climate action by 2020. Second, she said, the international community must complete the guidelines, or operating manual, to unleash the potential of the accord. Third, conditions must be improved to enable countries to be more ambitious in determining their own national policies to slow down global warming. At the UN Climate Change Conference (COP23) held last November under the leadership of Fiji, nations agreed to accelerate and complete their work to put in place the guidelines – officially known as the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP) –  at in Katowice, Poland next December. At , which will run through 10 May, Governments will start drafting texts to be finalized at COP24. Finishing off the operating manual is also necessary to assess whether the world is on track to achieve the goals of the historic Paris Agreement limiting greenhouse gas emissions, while pursuing efforts to keep the temperature rise to less than 1.5°C. Throughout this year, countries will also focus on how they can scale up their climate ambition and implementation in the pre-2020 period. All countries share the view that climate action prior to 2020 is essential.

360-> May confirmed as warmest on record, CO2 levels hit new high despite COVID economic slowdown
Last month was the warmest May on record and carbon dioxide levels also hit a new high despite the economic slowdown from COVID-19, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said on Friday, in an for Member States to renew their efforts to tackle climate threats. “Governments are going to invest in recovery, and there’s an opportunity to tackle the climate as part of the recovery programme”, said Secretary-General . shows need for more after We just had warmest May on record, per  CO2 at Mauna Loa observing station reached a new record seasonal peak of 417.1 parts per million for 2020 in May Details  He added that if this course of action was taken, “there was an opportunity to start bending the curve (on emissions) in the coming five years”. The appeal coincides with , celebrated annually on 5 June, and a warning that warmer temperatures and higher greenhouse gas concentrations will have a major impact on biodiversity, socio-economic development and human well-being. Echoing the call that it is time to grow back greener and build back better for people and the planet, UN said that Nature was “sending us a clear message: we are harming the natural world – to our own detriment. Habitat degradation and biodiversity loss are accelerating.” “Climate disruption is getting worse. Fires, floods, droughts and superstorms are more frequent and damaging,” said the UN chief. “Oceans are heating and acidifying, destroying coral ecosystems. And now, a new coronavirus is raging, undermining health and livelihoods. To care for humanity, we must care for nature.” Any industrial and economic slowdown from is no substitute for sustained, coordinated action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Mr Taalas explained. This is because gases such as carbon dioxide and methane last in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so any short-term effects seen during lockdown is not expected to have a long-term benefit.

361-> INTERVIEW: Hurricane-hit Caribbean nations can build back better, says UN development official
“People want to live here for very good reason – they’re beautiful islands, it’s where people have lived for centuries, their families have lived here for centuries,” Mr. O’Malley said in an interview with on the side lines of the Secretary-General’s visit. “So how do you make sure that you use the right techniques to keep yourself as safe, and your country as safe, as possible?” Mere mention of the Caribbean conjures up images of pristine waters, beautiful beaches and fun in the sun. However, the images emanating from the region over the past couple of months have painted a very different picture. "A paradise turned into hell," was how United Nations described Barbuda earlier this month after visiting the island that was ravaged by Hurricane Irma. During a two-day visit to the Caribbean, he also witnessed the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria on the small island nation of Dominica. Mr. Guterres was accompanied by Stephen O'Malley, the for . "People want to live here for very good reason - they're beautiful islands, it's where people have lived for centuries, their families have lived here for centuries," Mr. O'Malley said in an interview with on the side lines of the Secretary-General's visit. "So how do you make sure that you use the right techniques to keep yourself as safe, and your country as safe, as possible?" Mr. O'Malley, whose remit includes Barbados and nine other countries in the region, describes what it was like for him to see the aftermath for the first time, what the priority needs are, and what countries can do to mitigate the risks as well as build back better following such disasters. Dominica, maybe I'll start there because I've been to Dominica probably 10 times over the last four years. It's a country that I feel I know quite well. When we were flying in and you were looking down at this 'nature isle', as it's called, and it was totally brown... you could see the trees blown over and hardly any green at all. We came in to land at this small airport and there are all these logs which had come down from the hillsides. They were all along the waterfront. We started driving into the city and, literally, it was like going... I'm from Canada... it was like going into a city after there'd been a snowstorm but the storm was mud and not snow. It had all been pushed up to the banks, on the sides of the street. You had galvanized sheeting, you had plastic, you had mattresses, all kinds of stuff. I had seen the pictures and I have to say it was still very emotional for me to see the effect. : Stephen O'Malley talks about the UN helping storm-ravaged Caribbean countries as well as reducing disaster vulnerability in the region. They're very different places. Barbuda is part of a twin-island State - Antigua and Barbuda - and is a relatively small island. There's about 1,600 people there. So they were very badly affected... I mean the infrastructure was very badly hit and then we had another storm coming, another hurricane right behind that. So the Government took the decision, I think wisely, to evacuate the population. Their houses were destroyed. They had nowhere to properly shelter. So they were evacuated to Antigua by plane and by boat in one day, which was really pretty amazing. And since then they've been sheltering here, and the Government has been working on cleaning up the island. What does that mean? It's pumping out all the standing water. When I went there two weeks ago, you were just covered in clouds of mosquitoes because of the breeding. So clean up the standing water... and then clean up dead farm animals and other animals... and establish a health post... and try and make it a place where, as people are able to, they can come back and they can start working on their homes bit by bit to restore them. They've lifted the mandatory evacuation order but for now, people go back and forth during the day. Understandably, the people who are here [Antigua], who were evacuated, the Barbudans, like people everywhere else, they want to go home. They have one thought in mind - how can I go home? When can I go home? And so in the meantime they've been in shelters, and the United Nations - , , , - we've been supporting them in those shelters. So has the Government, of course. And then some people are with family or friends. But, people want to go home. So, how can that be done in a safe way? What are the minimum conditions that people need? And of course, there wouldn't be any operational schools there. So what do you do if you have school-age children? The biggest challenge is that the storms are getting stronger. Dominica, I was there two weeks ago, and I was just there the beginning of this week as well. You could see the change. You could see that there was actually some green on the hillsides and the roads were clear. There's a bit more order to things. Civil servants were coming back to work because they were able to get into the city. But you know they still have some very big challenges. I mean we've managed to help the Government distribute 60 metric tonnes of food in the last week. We have to keep that up so that people feel safe and secure, that they do feel like 'okay I'm being properly taken care of, I have enough food, I have enough water, I have enough shelter, things are getting better.' People have to believe that and if they believe that, that's a very important psychological boost. They can get the medical care they need, etc. So, it's getting better but we have a long, long way to go, and there's still parts of the country we've only maybe been to once or twice because the access has been so difficult. We were very fortunate that we had support from a number of different foreign militaries and they airdropped via helicopter or took boats in and dropped stuff off to a range of coastal communities. More than 50 different coastal communities received some kind of food and/or water drop from, primarily, the Dutch and French military but also the Americans, the Canadians, the Brits and the Venezuelans. I think the most immediate thing is to keep that good flow of relief aid to people so that they feel comfortable and they feel they're being properly taken care of. I mean, the water system is coming back up slowly, electricity is coming back up slowly but that's still mostly in the capital city of Roseau. It's people in the rural areas who we have to reach in one way or the other. So we need to make sure they have the food and the water, then they can start to shelter themselves. But we still have two more months in this hurricane season left.  I think it will be expensive to rebuild. Two years ago, there was a tropical storm over Dominica - Tropical Storm Erica. It was mostly heavy rainfall... In six hours, it did about $480 million worth of damage. Even two years later, in some places the country's still recovering from that. So now we have damages which are clearly going to be higher than that. And so where do you get the money, as a small island developing State, to redevelop? So we have the money part. I think the other big piece... and this is where I think the Government in Dominica is working hard... is what's the strategy? You need to have a way to get money back into people's hands. You want to get the economy going again, and then you want to start building real climate-resilient infrastructure. On Barbuda, I think it's how do people get back and start rebuilding their lives there. Here you have people who are displaced and they want to go home. How can they do that in a way that's safe and in a way that contributes in a positive way to the redevelopment of the country? Again, you need a good strategy and certainly there'll be some funding requirements as well. I think the biggest thing was the sense of shock at how fierce the storm was. I know people across the region. I know people who were in Dominica, people who told me 'you know I was sitting in a house' - a concrete house, we're not talking about a flimsy, wooden building or a tin-walled shack, we're talking about concrete-block wall houses - and people telling me 'I thought I was okay. I was in this house, and then the wind just ripped the roof off.' It was a terrifying experience for a lot of people.  I think that's a very important question. The countries know their location. The biggest challenge is that the storms are getting stronger. And that seems to be the consensus of scientists, that these storms are going to get stronger for a variety of interrelated reasons - the warming Caribbean Sea and other things. We may get more frequent storms but the storms we get will be stronger.  So, what do you require to have a house or an office building that can withstand that? It's interesting, you know you can go to communities and you can see three or four houses that are really badly affected and another one that isn't. You can look at that house and you can say, 'well I can see that this house was constructed to building code.' How do you make sure everybody has the resources they need, because not everybody has the money to build to code. And then, those houses that already exist that need to be retrofitted, again you have to help people with that. So for me, the technologies are not difficult. They're not complex. People know them. It's how do we enforce the building codes. And then, it's the reality of some of these islands... I mean Dominica is a mountainous island. You have these very steep hillsides and a coast road running along there. In the best of times, you're getting rock fall and other debris coming down the mountains. So what can you do about that so that every time you have a serious storm, you don't have your entire road network go down for a week to two weeks? What are some of the other things you can do with the power systems? Now they have one interconnected power system, one interconnected transmission grid, and the electrical company is looking at the question of 'well, maybe we should split this grid into different pieces so that it might be less vulnerable.' You can bury the lines. You can see that in the Caribbean, you still have a lot of lines that are strung on poles. And that's another question - could we bury more of the lines and that would stop the electricity from going down. So there are things we can do. People want to live here for very good reason - they're beautiful islands, it's where people have lived for centuries, their families have lived here for centuries. So how do you make sure that you use the right techniques to keep yourself as safe, and your country as safe, as possible.

362-> Somalia: worst harvest since 2011, with more than 2 million expected to go hungry
Somalia’s 2019 cereal harvest is the poorest the country has seen since 2011, when famine strained already scarce resources, the Food and Agriculture Organization announced on Tuesday, blaming unreliable weather patterns and “climatic shocks”. Delayed rains during what is known as the “Gu” peak season for crop growing (April-June), and parched river beds, have produced harvest levels up to 70 percent below average in some parts, according ’s Food Security and Nutrition Analysis United (FSNAU) latest with severe hunger looming for more than 2 million people in desperate need. “In the absence of humanitarian assistance, up to 2.1 million people across Somalia face severe hunger through December,” the UN warned, citing the report’s conclusion that this would bring the total number of Somalis expected to be food insecure, to 6.3 million by year’s end. The problem goes back to 2018, when poor October-December rains preceded a harsh dry season early this year. Unpredictable rainfall, followed by drought conditions during April and early May resulted in significant crop and livestock production shortfalls for July, which account for about 60 percent of Somalia’s total cereal output, according to FAO’s most recent These “climatic shocks” the UN said, “coupled with widespread poverty and vulnerability, are key drivers that have trapped millions of Somalis in severe hunger and malnutrition.” Around 2.2 million people are estimated to be severely food insecure, falling under phases 3 and 4 of the five-scale Integrated Phase Classification . Phase 3 denotes “crisis” situations with high or above-usual acute malnutrition, and phase 4 indicates “emergency” levels of acute malnutrition, and high death rates. The figure is more than 40 percent higher than food insecure population estimates by FAO from just the beginning of this year, with an estimated 2.6 million people internally displaced, and living in makeshift settlements outside urban areas, facing hunger. “If interventions are not scaled up,” the UN stated, “one million children are projected to be acutely malnourished over the next year, including 180,000 who are likely to be severely malnourished.” Though climatic shocks exacerbate needs, they “do not have to lead to large-scale catastrophe”, said Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management for the Government of Somalia, Hamza Said Hamza. “We must continue to work collectively to strengthen the capacity of Somalia to withstand these climatic shocks and identify durable solutions.” Rainfall predictions indicate 45 to 55 percent probability of above average precipitation for the next “Deyr” cropping season, from October to December, the UN reported; meaning a wetter season which “will be crucial to avoid a deterioration of the food security situation in Somalia.” The Humanitarian community and Somali Government jointly launched a Drought Response Plan (DIRP) to cover June through December 2019, however the $487 million in funding received so far meets less than half of the requirement. The nation’s acting Humanitarian Coordinator, George Conway, urging additional resources and a more collective response from donors, saying that“humanitarian partners stand ready to respond, by they cannot do so without sufficient resources.

363-> INTERVIEW: Few global issues as urgent as tackling climate and disaster risks – UN official
Recent devastating natural events – from hurricanes in the Caribbean to floods in South Asia and earthquakes in Mexico – have again shone a spotlight on the importance of efforts to reduce disaster risk, and how impossible it is to achieve global development goals without addressing such hazards. “If you look into countries that are exposed to hurricanes and cyclones – for example, those hit by recent dreadful cyclones in the Caribbean – you see the entire GDP, or huge percentage of it, being wiped out,” said Robert Glasser, the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, in an interview with . The UN and its Member States have many priority issues, but “there are very few that are as urgent as addressing climate risk and disaster risk,” he added. Ahead of the , annually observed on 13 October, Mr. Glasser spoke about this year’s campaign objectives, and more broadly about how reducing disaster risk can contribute to the achievement of the (SDGs), and how climate change adaptation and disaster risk management must go hand in hand. We have a major campaign to raise awareness of the increasing costs, including loss of life and economic costs, of disasters. We model our campaign on seven global targets in the Sendai Framework – an international agreement that UN Member States have signed, in which they have committed to reduce disaster risk. Sendai ‘Seven’ Campaign incorporated these seven targets. The first target is about the loss of life. And the second, which we are featuring this year, is about reducing the number of people whose homes and livelihoods are affected. Well, this is a remarkable agreement because in it countries have committed to achieving really remarkable goals – reducing significantly loss of life, reducing number of people affected, and reducing the economic impact of disasters. They are committed to do this because they are seeing huge costs – economic, social and environmental costs – of these disasters that are growing rapidly. Each country is exposed to a different range of hazards. They understand the impacts these hazards have on sustainable development. So, this agreement puts in place these seven global targets, and an accountability framework at the global level, for which we can monitor the progress Member States are making as they reduce disaster risk. Well, it is hugely important. Let me give you a couple of examples. There are some estimates that the annual cost of disasters is something like $500 billion, and that 26 million people fall into poverty each year as a result of disasters – a lion’s share of the people displaced from natural disasters. If you look into countries that are exposed to hurricanes and cyclones – for example, those hit by recent dreadful cyclones in the Caribbean – you see the entire GDP, or huge percentage of it, being wiped out. The average annual loss from these disasters in some countries equates to something like 60 per cent of their annual social expenditure. So, we put all these costs together and see that they are escalating rapidly, particularly the economic costs. You see that in many, many places, it would be impossible to achieve the SDGs unless we address these disaster risks. And, of course, with climate change, the speed in which these hazards are increasing in severity and frequency is really daunting. With climate change, the speed in which these hazards are increasing in severity and frequency is really daunting This is such an important issue. Let’s say, the doctor says you have cancer. You go to seek a second opinion, and you were told you have cancer. You go to five, six doctors and they all say you have cancer. At some point, you have to listen to the experts, and this is what has happened with climate change. Those people who doubt that climate change is happening are not doubting it on the basis of any solid scientific consensus. Using multiple ways of demonstrating these lines of evidence, scientists are absolutely convinced that human activity is increasing the average global temperature of the planet. And the connection between rising temperature and natural disasters is very clear and is highlighted also by these scientists. We would expect changes in the distribution, frequency, and severity of disasters. We have seen sea-level rise and bleaching of coral reefs. That’s a disaster – an economic disaster, a tourism disaster – for many countries. If that continues and reefs still do not recover, it affects fisheries. In the hurricanes we have just seen this year in the Caribbean, we saw how sea-level rise can contribute to storm surges that resulted in much more severe damage in cities in Texas and elsewhere. We’ve seen floods in South Asia. In the Horn of Africa, people say drought only happened every 20 years or so, but now it’s every couple of years, or even consecutive years. Of course, you can’t scientifically attach any one event directly to climate change, but these are exactly the things the science suggests are going to happen, and happening now. You can also increasingly do statistical analyses that say ‘well, you can’t say that we are 100 per cent certain that this is climate change, but it is 3,000 times more likely to have happened as a result of climate change.’ So, you start seeing one-in-500-years events happening every 200 years, or seeing multiple events like this. The evidence is really becoming overwhelming. A major disaster also serves as a huge opportunity for countries to begin building back better Well, two things. I hope that particularly the climate-related disasters raise people’s awareness about the urgency of action to reduce greenhouse gases. Because, if we do not reduce greenhouse gases, so much of everything else we are trying to do to reduce disaster risk will be overwhelmed by rising seas, stronger storms, droughts and alike. So, that is number one. Second thing is that, it’s a sad thing to say, but we find that if you look back historically, a major disaster also serves as a huge opportunity for countries to begin building back better from the previous disaster, and to begin thinking, ‘okay, we do not want this to happen again.’ There is a lot of political energy for legislation to be enacted, for changes to be put in place in government, for disaster management agencies to be given more authority, or even to be moved into the Prime Minister’s Office – these are the reflection of the central importance of addressing this. You have seen this actually in Mexico. It was an earlier earthquake decades ago that actually triggered the formulation of the current National Disaster Management Office that is now putting in place a lot of measures – first of all, responding to this disaster, the recent earthquake, but also to prevent future disasters. I am so grateful to so many of my colleagues and agencies in the UN that are working on various aspects of reducing disaster risk – starting with climate change and the huge efforts that Patricia Espinosa and the [UN Framework Convention on Climate Change] is working on; Petteri Taalas at [World Meteorological Organization] and the amazing scientists there that are working on early warning systems, multi-hazard warning systems. UNISDR has great collaboration with WMO and the World Bank to do that. Virtually, every organization in the whole UN system – including the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which is increasingly playing an important role in these areas, and the economic commissions – is really increasingly focused on addressing these risks, embedding risk in the Sustainable Development Goals, which is our overall framework for development and for all the work we are trying to do now. Of course, there is a lot of work to do. There are huge gaps, and we have the UN reform that hopefully will help us become even more strategic in targeting how we address these challenges. So, I am very grateful to my UN colleagues for the impact they are having on this important problem. Getting back to your original question about the link between the Sendai Framework and SDGs, one priority is to build the integration the SDGs call for – the coherence of our approach. To give you one example, we have, in many countries I visited, the environment ministry creating a climate adaptation plan, the disaster management agency producing a disaster management plan, but they do not come together even through probably 70 per cent of the disasters in the disaster management plan are climate-related. So, helping countries integrate two critical frameworks – Paris [Agreement] and Sendai Framework – in the context of their economic planning by embedding risk, by ensuring that they are not investing or building hospitals in flood zones, for example, is hugely important. Something like $100 trillion is invested in infrastructure, including the Belt and Road Initiative in China. If all of these initiatives are resulting in infrastructure that produces more greenhouse gas, and is vulnerable to climate risk and disaster risk more broadly, then we will never achieve the Sendai Framework, let alone the SDGs. That would be a huge waste of money that could be spent on fighting poverty, on a whole range of other social benefits.  : The 2017 International Day for Disaster Reduction focuses on reducing the number of people affected by disasters by 2030. There are many priorities in the UN system and Member States have many priority issues, [but] there are very few that are as urgent as addressing climate risk and disaster risk more broadly. They have a huge impact on people’s lives, taking people’s lives, and on wasting money that should be spent on more productive things.

364-> UN’s Guterres on climate change: ‘We need to do more and we need to do it quicker’
As governments prepare to meet later this year for the next round of climate talks, Secretary-General António Guterres today underscored the need to speed up action on an issue that is “the absolute priority” for the United Nations. “Climate change is the defining issue of our time – and we are at a defining moment,” the Secretary-General at the Informal Leaders Dialogue on Climate Change, held on the margins of the annual high-level debate of the General Assembly. “[…] we have many priorities in the UN – peace and security, human rights, and development – but I would say that this is the absolute priority.” Mr. Guterres recalled that when world leaders signed the three years ago, they pledged to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to work to keep the increase as close as possible to 1.5 degrees. These objectives were agreed, he noted, as the “bare minimum” to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. “The commitment was universal – but we are nowhere close to where we need to be to meet these minimum targets,” he stated, adding that a UN study found that the commitments made so far by Parties to the represent just one-third of what is needed. “We need to do more and we need to do it quicker: we need more ambition and accelerated action by 2020.” Today’s meeting takes place amid what is known as “New York Climate Week” and comes on the heels of the Global Climate Action Summit, held in San Francisco earlier this month. It also follows a landmark speech delivered by the Secretary-General this month in which he warned that the world risks “crossing the point of no return” on climate change and highlighted the need to speed up action to tackle this global threat. To mobilize greater action and finance, the Secretary-General will convene a Climate Summit in September 2019 to “focus on the heart of the problem.” “Only a significantly higher level of ambition will do – and the Summit will be an opportunity for leaders and partners to showcase their ambition.” A key moment on the road to next year’s Summit will be the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) – known informally as – that will be held in December in Katowice, Poland.

365-> More than 65 million ‘low-carbon jobs’ can be created by 2030: UN-backed Climate Summit urges action ‘to the next level’
New UN-backed commitments to take action against the damaging effects of climate change, could result in $26 trillion in economic benefits worldwide, and help create 65 million new “low-carbon jobs” by 2030 – the deadline for the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals ( ). Those are some of the opportunities of moving to a low-carbon economy, outlined on Friday, at the close of the Global Climate Action Summit, which took place in San Francisco. It brought together national, regional and urban leaders from across the world, together with businesses, investors and civil society organizations, in an effort to keep global warming to well-under 2 degrees Celsius, in line with the 2015 on climate change. Committing to take “their collective ambition to the next level”, participants focused on five specific areas. The summit issued a formal “Call to Global Climate Action” saying that “now I the time for all leaders to step up”. “Only together will we transform our communities and energy systems, create employment opportunities and economic prosperity, protect our oceans and natural environment and complete the transition to a zero-carbon world”. This Summit and its Call to Action make an important contribution towards achieving our collective goal: to boost ambition that we need to address climate change -  UN , said the summit had demonstrated “ The Call to Action was presented to the UN’s , Jayathma Wickramanayake, in a symbolic gesture to illustrate that it is future generations who will be most affected by the decisions of the current generation to build a more resilient world. Accepting the Call to Action on behalf of the United Nations, : This Summit and its Call to Action make an important contribution towards achieving our collective goal: to boost ambition that we need to address climate change.” “We must increase climate action and create unstoppable momentum towards in Poland and the Secretary General’s 2019 Climate Summit,” she added adding that the summit “will encourage governments worldwide to step up their actions, demonstrating the vital role that states and regions, cities, companies, investors, and civil society are playing to tackle climate change.” The event took place against a background of accelerating impacts of climate change, evidenced this week through the destructive power of Super Typhoon Mangkhut in South East Asia, and Hurricane Florence, on the east coast of the United States, which killed dozens and caused billions of dollars-worth of destruction. highlighted the vital role of non-Party stakeholders in propelling the global fight against climate change forward, in an excerpt of their , launched at the Summit. “Climate change is undoubtedly the defining issue of our time, and working together across nations, organizations and communities is the only way that we can tackle this enormous task and seize the huge opportunities,” said head of UN Environment, Erik Solheim. “We have seen here over the past few days the inspiring amount of work that is already being undertaken by communities around the world to address these issues. If we manage to put our environment first, we can come out on the other end of this formidable challenge and achieve our common goal: a sustainable world for all.”

366-> Sustainable farming, ‘key’ to world free of hunger, malnutrition, says UN agriculture chief
There will be “no sustainable future without eradicating poverty and hunger,” the United Nations agriculture agency chief spelled out on Monday, launching the Food and Agriculture Organization’s ( ) latest flagship publication, on the world’s . Focusing this year on the links between agricultural trade, climate change and food security, Director-General José Graziano da Silva said in the foreword that “ensuring food security for all is both a key function of, and a challenge for agriculture, which faces ever-increasing difficulties.” “As populations rise, urbanization increases and incomes grow, the agricultural sector will be under mounting pressure to meet the demand for safe and nutritious food,” Mr. da Silva explained. Climate change will have an increasingly adverse impact on many regions of the world, with those in low latitudes being hit the hardest –  He sized up that agriculture must generate decent jobs to support billions of rural people globally, especially in developing countries where hunger and poverty are concentrated. Turning to the warming planet, he underscored that agriculture is pivotal in helping to sustain the world’s natural resources and biodiversity. “Climate change will have an increasingly adverse impact on many regions of the world, with those in low latitudes being hit the hardest,” he said. The report points out that by the middle of this century, higher temperatures, precipitation changes, rising sea levels, extreme weather events and a likely increase in damage due to pests and disease, will all significantly impact agriculture and food security. Climate change impacts will be affect different places in different ways, with variations across crops and regions. Arid and semi-arid regions will be exposed to even lower rainfall levels and higher temperatures, lowering crop yields. Countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America will be disproportionately affected, many of which already suffer from poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition. Conversely, countries in temperate, largely more-developed areas, may benefit from warmer weather during their growing season, further exacerbating existing inequalities and widening the development gap. “Unless we take urgent action to combat climate change, we can expect to see a very different global picture of agriculture in the future,” the FAO chief stressed. Agricultural trade impact  The relationship between agricultural trade and food security is increasingly important in both trade and development agendas, with developing countries requiring international support to cope with climate change. While international trade can potentially stabilize markets and reallocate food from surplus to deficit regions, Mr. Graziano da Silva emphasized: “We must ensure that the evolution and expansion of agricultural trade is equitable and works for the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition globally.” Against the backdrop that the world’s food system overall in 2050 will need to produce almost 50 per cent more, compared to 2012, according to the report, the sector needs to adjust to climate change effects and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while meeting a growing demand. Producing more with less, while preserving natural resources and enhancing the livelihoods of small-scale family farmers, will be a key challenge for the future. “Developing and implementing policies that shift global agricultural production onto a more sustainable path, protect the most vulnerable countries and regions…will be key if we are to see a world free of hunger and malnutrition by 2030,” concluded the Director-General.

367-> UN sees 'worrying' gap between Paris climate pledges and emissions cuts needed
Pledges made under the Paris Agreement are only a third of what is required by 2030 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, pointing to the urgent need to boost efforts by both government and non-government actors, the United Nations environment wing said on Tuesday. “One year after the entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future,” said UN Environment Programme ( ) Executive Director Erik Solheim. The Paris accord, adopted in 2015 by 195 countries, seeks to limit global warming in this century to under 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. “If we invest in the right technologies, ensuring that the private sector is involved, we can still meet the promise we made to our children to protect their future. But we have to get on the case now,” the UNEP chief added. The eighth edition of UNEP's , released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference in next month, warns that as things stand, even full implementation of current national pledges makes a temperature rise of at least 3 degrees Celsius by 2100 very likely. Should the United States follow through with its stated intention to leave the Paris accord in 2020, the picture could become even bleaker. The pace of growth in carbon dioxide emissions have slowed, driven in part by renewable energy, notably in China and India, raising hopes that emissions have peaked, as they must by 2020, to remain on a successful climate trajectory. To avoid overshooting the Paris goals, governments – including by updating their Paris pledges – the private sector, cities and others need to urgently pursue actions that will bring deeper and more-rapid cuts. Source: The Emissions Gap Report 2017 | UNEP The report also says that adopting new technologies in key sectors, such as agriculture, buildings, energy, forestry, industry and transport, at investment of under $100 per tonne, could reduce emissions by up to 36 gigatonnes per year by 2030, more than sufficient to bridge the gap. However, it warns that other greenhouse gases, such as methane, are still rising, and a global economic growth spurt could easily put carbon dioxide emissions back on an upward trajectory. Strong action on hydrofluorocarbons, through the to the Montreal Protocol, and other short-lived climate pollutants such as black carbon – could also make a real contribution.

368-> UN chief appoints former New York Mayor as Special Envoy for Climate Action
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday appointed Michael R. Bloomberg, the former Mayor of New York City, as his Special Envoy for Climate Action. “ , and makes us believe that we will soon be running faster than climate change, that we will soon be starting to defeat climate change, that the [on climate change] can be fully implemented but with an enhanced ambition,” Secretary-General Guterres told reporters at UN Headquarters in New York. “We need that enhanced ambition in order to make sure that we reach the end of the century with an increase in temperature of about 1.5 and below 2 [degrees Celsius],” he added, referring to the central aim of the three-year-old Paris Accord, which set the stage for all countries to take ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. According the UN chief’s spokesperson, Mr. Bloomberg – who earlier served as the UN Special Envoy on Cities and Climate Change – will the Secretary-General’s climate strategy and efforts toward the planned 2019 Climate Summit at UN Headquarters, which seeks to mobilize stronger and more ambitious action towards 2020 climate targets. The Special Envoy will leverage efforts in key areas of the Climate Summit to encourage rapid and enhanced implementation of the in the context of sustainable development. The note further stated that Secretary-General will be engaging and inviting leaders from Governments, businesses, finance and civil society organizations with a view to bending the emissions curve by 2020 and accelerating the implementation of the Paris Agreement. “The Secretary-General and Mr. Bloomberg share the perspective that the emissions gap needs to be closed soon to limit global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius. Climate Action, including those by cities and sub-national actors, play an essential role in driving ambition on climate change,” it added. In addition to having served as the former UN Special Envoy on Cities and Climate Change, Mr. Bloomberg was appointed by the Chair of the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The Task Force – which has finished its work – has developed voluntary, climate-related financial disclosures for use by companies in providing information to lenders, insurers, investors and other stakeholders. From 2002-2013, Mr. Bloomberg served as the 108th Mayor of the City of New York. He began his career in 1966 at Salomon Brothers, and launched the financial news and information company Bloomberg LP in 1981.

369-> Bringing the coral reefs back to life
Coral reefs are being killed by the climate crisis, which is leading to rising sea temperatures. “Cryopreservation”, a pioneering scientific technique, could be one way to help save them. A tiny piece of coral is stuck to a thin sheet of plastic, and submerged in a tank at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology on Coconut Island in Kaneohe Bay, on the island archipelago. This is part of a unique process which includes the cryopreservation [the use of very low temperatures to preserve living cells and tissues] of sperm, larvae and tissue, to create what has been called the “Book of Life” for coral. Marine biologists, working on land and in the water, collect sperm and eggs from reefs during their annual spawning events, in the warm tropical water surrounding palm-fringed Coconut Island, and then in labs, where they prepare the coral for cryopreservation. Ground-breaking techniques Mary Hagedorn, a senior research scientist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, leads the team at the Institute which is pioneering these techniques. “Cryopreservation is a relatively new field of science originating in the late 1940s, but was only first used to preserve human embryos in the early 1980s and then eggs at the end of the 90s,” she told UN News on a visit to Coconut Island. “We have been working for the last 16 years on adapting those techniques to successfully preserve coral sperm, and also coral larvae, to store in living frozen bio-repositories, and help restore reefs now and potentially reseed the ocean in the future. We're really collecting the Book of Life for coral reefs, and that's significant.” Coral reefs across the world are being threatened by climate change. The UN Environment Programme ( ) estimates that about 25 to 50 per cent of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed and another 60 per cent are under threat. Warm, acidic oceans, and coral ‘heart attacks’ As oceans become warmer and more acidic, the corals are bleached, an event which Mary Hagedorn compares to a person suffering a heart attack. “If bleaching happens on an annual basis then corals may ultimately die off,” she said. Corals are animals that create their own skeleton to help support them. These animals live in shallow warm waters around the world using sunlight to synthesize their sugar-based food. Reefs are not just “beautiful ecosystems” renowned for their biological diversity, according to Dr. Hagedorn, they are also crucial to life on Earth. “Almost 25 per cent of all marine life lives on a reef at some point and so without them many species of fish that we eat wouldn't exist. Corals provide a natural protection for our coastlines, for example against tsunamis. They also support people’s livelihoods in the form of fishing and tourism and contribute 350 billion annually to the global economy.  So, there are many reasons we should save them.” Researching for the benefit of future generations A small international team of marine biologists is based in the lab on Coconut island, which sits on top of a coral reef and is surrounded by many more, making it possible for the scientists to collect samples in a small dinghy, or by snorkeling. They also travel to many tropical countries around the world to help preserve their reefs including in Australia, Singapore and French Polynesia, among others. In the institute’s laboratory, Australian postdoctoral researcher Dr. Jonathan Daly examines polyps, individual coral animals, under a microscope. 'We're really collecting the Book of Life for coral reefs, and that's significant'. Meet Mary Hagedorn, a pioneering Hawaii-based biologist, using cutting-edge techniques to save coral threatened by the  “Corals have a very restricted annual cycle for reproduction (just a few days) and so there is a very brief window to collect their sperm and eggs in the field, and bring them into the lab for cryopreservation,” he says, adding that “today, coral reproduction is impacted very heavily by warming oceans.” The material gathered by the team is stored in frozen biorepositories and it’s hoped ultimately that other marine biologists in laboratories worldwide will eventually be able to preserve corals where they work. This would save the biodiversity and genetic diversity of their local coral reefs and help to create the Book of Life for corals that Mary Hagedorn talks of. This means that, if one of the many thousands of coral species found around the world becomes extinct, then potentially it could be regrown from the frozen biorepository. The role of the ocean in economic and social development “Our job is really not about today, it’s about 200 or 500 years from now when, hopefully, our oceans have returned to pre-industrial conditions,” says Mary Hagedorn in her laboratory. I'll never see the fruition of our work in my life, nor will my students or their students. Nevertheless, we have set this whole thing in motion, and as a scientist, I know we're doing something that really is good for the planet.  However, it is very critical that we do this work now, while corals still have robust genetic diversity.” Mary Hagedorn and her colleagues were interviewed as part of a photographic project called “Dignity at Work” which is being undertaken across the United States by the UN’s International Labour Organization (ILO). Oceans’ role in economic and social development Kevin Cassidy is the Director of the ILO Office for the United States: “We have seen the far-sighted and truly inspiring work on coral reefs by Mary and her team,” he said, explaining the key role the ocean plays in economic and social activity. “When one is fishing for seafood it creates income for the fisherman, his workers, more jobs in wholesale markets and shops, purveyors and transport workers, chefs and waiters serving food, patrons at restaurants and taxis. It is an economic string that threads its way through society.” And he warns of the danger of not looking after marine resources. “The impact of dying oceans would not only be an ecological disaster but would also take a large human and economic toll.” Back outside on Coconut Island, the work continues in between tropical rain showers. The plastic sheets which were planted in water tanks with individual corals on different occasions show how, over time, the animals grow bigger and stronger.  Ultimately, when the conditions are right, they could be returned to the ocean to restore reefs. And in the longer term, the corals now stored in frozen biorepositories could bring back to life species killed by the effects of climate change. Life Below Water and the UN

370-> UN launches Environmental Rights Initiative
Taking a stand against ongoing threats, harassment and murder of environmental defenders, the United Nations on Tuesday launched an initiative enlisting business communities to champion a clean and healthy environment. “Those who and people should be celebrated as heroes , but the sad fact is that many are paying a heavy price with their safety and sometimes their lives,” Erik Solheim, Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme ( ) said Tuesday, launching the UN Environmental Rights in Geneva. “It’s our duty to stand on the side of those who are on the right side of history. It means standing for the most fundamental and universal of human rights,” he added. By helping people to understand how to defend their rights, and by assisting governments to safeguard environmental rights, maintains that the initiative will bring environmental protection nearer to the people. Although, since the 1970s, environmental rights have grown more rapidly than any other human right and are enshrined in over 100 constitutions, in January the international non-governmental organization (NGO) Global Witness documented that almost four environmental defenders are being killed weekly – with the true total likely far higher. Many more are harassed, intimidated and forced from their lands. Moreover, around 40-50 per cent of the 197 environmental defenders killed in 2017 came from indigenous and local communities. “Violations of environmental rights have a profound impact on a wide variety of human rights, including the rights to life, self-determination, food, water, health, sanitation, housing, cultural, civil and political rights,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein said, recounting recent visits to Papua New Guinea and Fiji where he was made keenly aware of the impact of extractive industries and climate change on individual rights. “It is crucial that those most affected are able to meaningfully participate in decisions relating to land and the environment,” he stressed. Two disturbing counter-trends are underway. The first is the escalating intimidation and murder of environmental defenders, and the second is some countries’ attempts to limit NGO activities. “States have a responsibility to prevent and punish rights abuses committed by private corporations within their territory, and businesses have an obligation to avoid infringing on the human rights of others,” Mr. Zeid continued. “I hope this new Initiative will be able to encourage States and businesses to comply with these obligations.” Leo Heileman, UNEP director for the office in Latin America and the Caribbean called it “an opportunity to give environmental rights the same legal standing as human rights at the global level.” Among other things, the initiative will help governments strengthen institutional capacities to develop and implement policy and legal frameworks protecting environmental rights, and assist businesses to better understand their environmental rights obligations and provide guidance on how to advance beyond a compliance culture. “I am proposing to the UN that the UN should join countries in recognizing a global right to a healthy environment,” said John Knox Special Rapporteur on . “The time has come to recognize this formal interdependence of human rights and the environment, not only at national level but at the UN level too.”

371-> UN-World Bank panel calls for ‘fundamental shift’ in water management
With 700 million people worldwide at risk of being displaced by intense water scarcity by 2030, water infrastructure investment must be at least doubled over the next five years, a panel set up by the United Nations and the World Bank recommended on Wednesday. , released by a of 11 Heads of State and a Special Advisor, calls for a fundamental shift in the way the world manages water so that the ( ), particularly on ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, can be achieved. According to the , 40 per cent of the world’s people are being affected by water scarcity. If not addressed, as many as 700 million could be displaced by 2030 in search for water. More than two billion people are compelled to drink unsafe water and more than 4.5 billion do not have safely managed sanitation services. Water must be an absolute priority in everything we do – UN chief The report says women and girls suffer disproportionately when water and sanitation are lacking, affecting health and often restricting work and education opportunities. Some 80 per cent of wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment and water-related disasters account for 90 per cent of the 1,000 most devastating natural disasters since 1990. “It is my deep belief that water is a matter of life and death,” UN commented upon receiving the report on Wednesday, noting that 60 per cent of human body is water. He said that water-related natural disasters are occurring more frequently and becoming more and more dangerous everywhere, which means “water is indeed a matter of life and death” and “must be an absolute priority in everything we do.” In a press release, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim stressed that Heads of State and Government make up the panel “because the world can no longer afford to take water for granted.” “The ecosystems on which life itself is based – our food security, energy sustainability, public health, jobs, cities – are all at risk because of how water is managed today,” he warned. The world can no longer afford to take water for granted – World Bank President The panel, created in 2016 for an initial period of two years, is advocating for evidence-based policies and innovative approaches at the global, national and local level to make water management as well as water and sanitation services attractive for investment and more disaster-resilient. The panel calls for policies that will allow for at least a doubling of investment in water infrastructure in the next five years. The report also highlights the essential need for partnerships between Governments, communities, the private sector and researchers. The members of the panel are Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, Mauritius’ President (Co-Chair); Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico’s President (Co-Chair); Malcolm Turnbull, Australia’s Prime Minister; Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s Prime Minister; János Áder, Hungary’s President; Hani Mulki, Jordan’s Prime Minister; Mark Rutte, Netherlands’ Prime Minister; Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard, Peru’s President; Jacob Zuma, South Africa’s President; Macky Sall, Senegal’s President; Emomali Rahmon, Tajikistan’s President; and Han Seung-soo, Special Advisor and former Prime Minister of the Republic of Korea. In an open letter, they conclude: “Whoever you are, whatever you do, wherever you live, we urge you get involved, and contribute to meeting this great challenge: safe water and sanitation for all, and our water resources managed sustainably. Make every drop count. It’s time for action.”

372-> Time running out for construction sector to cut energy use, meet climate goals – UN
The clock is ticking on efforts to reform the buildings and construction sector's energy performance and keep the Paris Agreement on track, new United Nations-backed research revealed on Tuesday. The Global Status Report 2017, from the Global Alliance for Buildings and Construction – first launched by the UN Environment Programme ( ) and France at the 21st Climate Change Conference – finds that the sector continues to grow, with the energy intensity per square meter of buildings needing to improve 30 per cent by 2030. “Over the next 40 years, the world is expected to build 230 billion square metres in new construction – adding the equivalent of Paris to the planet every single week,” said Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, at a side event of the One Planet Summit in Paris. “This rapid growth is not without consequences,” he warned. In 2016, an estimated 235 billion square metres (m2) of total floor area was reached. Over the next 40 years, an additional 230 billion m2 buildings will be constructed – the equivalent of adding the floor area of Japan to the planet every year to 2060. When upstream power generation is included, buildings and construction account for 39 per cent of energy-related CO2 emissions. According to the -prepared, UNEP-coordinated report, the clock is ticking in part because more than half of building constructions expected by 2060 will be done in the next 20 years – two-thirds in countries that lack mandatory building energy codes. However, the report highlights many opportunities to deploy energy-efficient and low-carbon solutions, and points to a number of global examples showing how the goals can be met with clear and concerted efforts. To date, pledges have fallen short – with CO2 emissions from buildings and construction having risen by nearly one per cent annually between 2010 and 2016, releasing 76 gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide in cumulative emissions. “Ambitious action is needed without delay to avoid locking in long-lived, inefficient buildings assets for decades to come,” he stressed. Buildings with near-zero energy, zero-emissions need to become the global construction standard within the next decade for two per cent energy performance improvements to 2030, according to the report. The rate of building energy renovations also needs to improve three per cent in the coming decade, particularly important in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, where roughly 65 per cent of the total expected 2060 buildings stock is already built today. “Similar to many areas linked to the Paris Agreement, the building sector is seeing some progress in cutting its emissions, but it is too little, too slowly,” underscored Erik Solheim, UNEP Executive Director. An energy savings potential from improved building envelope performance can be huge. Globally, high-performance construction and deep energy renovations of existing building envelopes represent a savings potential of more than all the final energy consumed by the G20 countries in 2015. “Realizing the potential of the buildings and construction sector needs all hands-on deck – in particular to address rapid growth in inefficient and carbon-intensive building investments,” said Mr. Solheim.

373-> FROM THE FIELD: Restoring life to Ghana’s land
Subsistence farmers in Ghana are learning how to hold back the decline in the fertility of the smallholdings they cultivate while revitalizing their soils as desertification increasingly threatens their land and livelihoods. An increase in the population in the West African country has put more pressure on agricultural lands resulting in the clearing of forests and woodlands, a development which is hastening desertification. The Dorbor community which lives in central Ghana is finding the cultivation of the cereal crops and cashew nuts it traditionally farms increasingly challenging. The Dorbor people are now being supported by the UN Development Programme ( ), with funding provided by the Global Environment Facility, to hold back land degradation by introducing sustainable land management practices, including soil fertility improvement techniques. As the international community gathers in New Delhi in India to discuss how to combat desertification, read more here about how the Dorbor people are restoring life to Ghana’s lands.

374-> Disasters cost billions in agricultural losses, poor farmers bear brunt – UN report
A crowded field of threats that includes drought, floods, animal disease outbreaks and chemical spills are among the disasters costing farmers in the developing world billions of dollars each year, according to a new report from the United Nations agriculture agency. “The agriculture sectors – which includes crop and livestock production as well as forestry, fisheries and aquaculture – face many risks, such as climate and market volatility, pests and diseases, extreme weather events, and an ever-increasing number of protracted crises and conflicts,” said José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ). In collaboration with , Viet Nam launched the report, , Thursday at a regional conference in Hanoi. The report points out that between 2005 and 2015 natural disasters cost the agricultural sectors of developing country economies a staggering $96 billion in damaged or lost crop and livestock production, $48 billion of which occurred in Asia. Drought, which has battered farmers globally, was one of the leading culprits. FAO documented that 83 per cent of all drought-caused economic losses were absorbed by agriculture – to the tune of $29 billion. “This has become the ‘new normal,’ and the impact of climate change will further exacerbate these threats and challenges,” Mr. da Silva warned. The report also details how multiple other threats are taking a heavy toll on food production, food security, and people’s livelihoods. “Disaster risk reduction and management must, therefore, become an integral part of modern agriculture,” stressed the FAO chief. While floods and storms had the largest impacts in Asia, their agricultural systems were also heavily affected by earthquakes, tsunamis and extreme temperatures. For both Africa as well as for Latin America and the Caribbean, drought was the costliest disaster, resulting in crop and livestock losses of $10.7 and $13 billion, respectively, between 2005 and 2015. African farmers notched up more than $6 billion in losses in that period from crop pests and animal diseases. small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to tsunamis, earthquakes, storms  and floods. Their economic losses from disasters jumped from $8.8 billion for the period 2000-2007 to over $14 billion between 2008-2015, the report shows. The report also includes ‘food chain crises’ sparked by animal diseases, like Rift Valley Fever and also addressed conflict. A first case study done on the impacts of conflict in Syria found that the overall financial cost of damage and loss in that country's agriculture sector over the 2011-2016 period was at least $16 billion. All told, nearly a quarter of all financial losses caused by natural disasters between 2005 and 2015 were borne by the agricultural sector, according to FAO’s study. Given the increasing scale and intensity of threats to agriculture, it is critical to develop adequate disaster and crisis governance structures, which must be grounded on data and evidence detailing the ways that disasters affect farmers and food producers, the report says. “Building a more holistic and ambitious disaster-resilience framework for agriculture is crucial to ensuring sustainable development, which is a cornerstone for peace and the basis for adaptation to climate change,” concluded Mr. da Silva.

375-> Major reports on biodiversity, ecosystem services to be launched at UN-backed meeting in Medellin
With our planet’s flora and fauna facing unprecedented threats, science and policy experts are set to gather next week in Medellin, Colombia, for a United Nations-backed meeting to consider five landmark reports aiming to inform better decisions by Governments, businesses and even individuals on biodiversity, and issues of land degradation and restoration. “Literally, all Governments around the world should be looking at [the reports] to see what are we saying,” Sir Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( ) told ahead of the body’s sixth plenary session which will run in Colombia’s second largest city from 18-24 March. “That will be the basis for informed decisions,” said the IPBES Chair. Established in 2012, IPBES is the global science-policy platform tasked with providing the best-available evidence to inform better decisions affecting nature — by everyone from Governments and industry to non-governmental organization (NGOs) and the general public — towards strengthening services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development. The IPBES assessment reports are intended to provide decision makers with comprehensive, credible, evidence-based policy options to help reverse the unsustainable use of irreplaceable natural resources. Prepared by more than 550 leading international experts and peer-reviewed by experts from both government and academia, the reports took three years to develop at a cost of more than $6 million. IPBES will present the reports to representatives of its 128 member States for approval at the upcoming plenary. The reports to be presented comprise four regional assessments of biodiversity in Africa; the Americas; Asia and the Pacific; and Europe and Central Asia; as well as an assessment of land degradation and restoration, both regionally and globally. Each regional assessment will evaluate the status of biodiversity in its respective region and subregions, identifying progress, drivers of change and threats, as well as the policy-relevant issues affecting them. In addition, the regional assessments will present lessons learned and progress (or lack thereof) on the and its , agreed by States parties to the at their meeting in Aichi, Japan. The assessments will also describe the implications regarding biodiversity in achieving the ( ) and fulfilling the on climate change. The assessment on land degradation and restoration will identify threats to land-based ecosystems, offering evidence from around the world and a range of best-available solutions to reduce the environmental, social and economic risks and impacts of land degradation. The findings of the five IPBES reports will also be key inputs to a new comprehensive IPBES global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services, due for release in 2019. IPBES has previously issued a large-scale thematic assessment on global and regional pollination. IPBES meets annually at a date and venue decided at the prior session. The Platform is placed under the auspices of four United Nations entities — the UN Environment Programme ( ), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ), the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) and the UN Development Programme ( ) — and administered by .

Two days after disembarking from her carbon-free yacht in New York, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg paid a visit to UN Headquarters on Friday, after joining participants of her global climate strike movement, Fridays for Future, at the Organization’s gates. I’m far from New York, but I’m happy to know that young people came to the UN once again to express their commitment in the fight against climate change. I encourage them to keep pushing for stronger . The 16-year-old and two other teens got a preview of the Hall, where all 193 of the entity’s Member States every year to discuss a wide array of international issues, and where Ms. Thunberg is scheduled to speak during the Secretary-General’s next month. The Swedish youth activist was greeted by General Assembly President, , who : Welcome, Greta Thunberg and climate activists to the UN in New York. Your determination for climate action  has shaken the world and we join you in holding leaders accountable. "Science, not Silence" . She also received praise from UN in a Twitter : “I’m far from New York, but I’m happy to know that young people came to the UN once again to express their commitment in the fight against climate change. I encourage them to keep pushing for stronger .” Ms. Thunberg, who sailed from Europe to curb carbon emissions from air travel, will attend UN climate summits in New York in September, and in Santiago, Chile, in December. Her 60-foot Malizia II racing yacht, equiped with solar panels and underwater turbines for electric power, docked in New York City on Wednesday, where she was welcomed by a flotilla of  17 sailboats, each representing one of the UN's (SDGs). The young environmental advocate has gained media attention since waging a "school strike" for climate action last August. At just 15, she stood alone outside of Swedish Parliament in demostration, calling for drastic change. Since, other impassioned youth have followed her lead and skipped school for the cause. "I would love not to have to do this and just go to school," Ms. Thunberg told journalists upon arriving onto dry land, "but...I want to make a difference."

378-> UN chief appeals to G7 leaders for ‘strong commitment’ and political will to tackle climate emergency
People all over the world are calling for a shift towards a greener, cleaner future, UN said on Monday, stressing that “we have the tools to address the climate emergency, but we need more political will.” This was the message delivered on Twitter from Biarritz, France, where the UN chief has been meeting for the past two days with G7 leaders to mobilize action ahead of his next month in New York. Speaking to reporters, Mr. Guterres said the UN Summit – and the need for concrete action – come against the backdrop of a “ ,” with the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ) reporting the 2015 to 2019 are on track to be the five hottest years ever recorded, and historically high concentrations of C02 in the atmosphere. And with Greenland’s ice melting, and record-setting fires blazing from the Arctic to Alaska and the Amazon, the Secretary-General said, “we are much worse than what we were during Paris,” referring to the 2015 conference in the French capital that give birth to the aimed at easing global warming and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. He said that recent scientific evidence provided by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) has made clear that “we absolutely need to keep the rise of temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius to the end of the century and to be carbon neutral in 2050 and to have a 45 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030.” “And so, it’s absolutely essential that countries commit themselves to increase what was promised in Paris because what was promised [there] is not enough,” said Mr. Guterres, calling for more ambition and more commitment to that end. The UN chief said society is mobilizing, as well as the world’s youth, “and we want to have countries coming to New York and being able to commit to be carbon neutral in 2050, being able to increase substantially their ambition in the to climate action that have to be reviewed in 2020.” Mr. Guterres also stressed the need to make sure that counties are “shifting of taxes from people to carbon,” ending subsidies to fossil fuels, and that more coal power plants are not built after 2020. “All this requires a lot of political will, and the G7 was an excellent opportunity to appeal for the very strong engagement of the international community,” said the Secretary-General, adding that: “The youth have been leading the way, and we’ll start the Summit with a in the UN, but we need, especially those countries that belong to the G7, to give a positive example.”

379-> Human rights are everyone’s business, amid relentless crises around world: UN’s Bachelet
The relentless outbreak of crises around the world – from the fires in the Amazon to “carnage” in Syria and demonstrations in Hong Kong, Russia, Indonesian Papua and elsewhere - risk pushing the world “further and further away from global solutions to global problems”, the UN’s top rights official said on Wednesday. Briefing journalists one year since she took office, High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, appealed for greater international cooperation. The impact of violations in one part of the world can have serious regional and international repercussions on another – UN Human Rights Chief talks to the press at 👉  In our increasingly interconnected world, human rights violations in one part of the planet can have serious repercussions on another, she maintained. “We have seen this with large numbers of people fleeing their countries due to armed conflicts, insecurity, political oppression, climate crises and failure to protect economic, social and cultural rights”, she said. “We see also this with the fires that are raging in the Amazon, and with the ice caps melting in Greenland and elsewhere.” Syria conflict began after ‘failure of dialogue’ Highlighting the ongoing war in Syria, the High Commissioner noted that it had begun in 2011 after the Government’s “abject failure” to allow Syrians freedom of expression. In the last four months alone, Ms. Bachelet added that her Office, , had verified 1,089 men, women and children killed in the war-torn country’s north-west – an “appalling, shameful and deeply tragic” situation. “A total of 1,031 of these civilian deaths are reportedly attributable to the airstrikes and ground-based strikes carried out by Government forces and their allies on Idlib and Hama governorates,” the High Commissioner insisted, adding that non-State armed groups had also targeted Government-held areas, reportedly killing 58 people. “In a bid to take control of territories, there appears to be little concern about taking civilian lives,” Ms. Bachelet said. “I appeal to all parties to the conflict and to those – many, powerful – States with influence to put aside political differences and halt the carnage.” Support for Hong Kong Chief Executive dialogue call Asked about the ongoing protests against the authorities in Hong Kong, Ms. Bachelet said that while the majority of demonstrations had been peaceful, she was “disturbed” by others that had turned violent, adding that the situation had the potential to “spiral”. “Of course, we’re looking forward to the transparent dialogue that could find a solution to this situation,” she said, reiterating her support for Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s bid to pursue dialogue with the protesters to address their grievances. On the issue of the fires burning in the Amazon, the High Commissioner pointed out that one in three were in areas inhabited by indigenous people. “I’m not saying that they are intentional, but I’m just saying that they are in indigenous protected places, or conservation land,” she said, urging the Brazilian authorities to implement her Office’s recommendations on the protection of minorities. “Human rights violations are everybody’s business because they can affect us all at a very fundamental level: our peace and security, our economies, our very lungs depend on the promotion and protection of human rights in places far from our homes, no matter where we live.” Rejecting Ms. Bachelet’s comments, Brazil’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, said in a tweet that the High Commissioner was unnecessarily commenting on his country’s internal affairs. Earlier in the day, the High Commissioner expressed concern about violent demonstrations in the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. The escalation had led to the deaths of protesters and security personnel, she said in a statement, before urging the authorities to “engage in dialogue” with the demonstrators. The Government should also “refrain from any excessive use of force”, Ms. Bachelet continued, noting also that “blanket internet shutdowns” could exacerbate tensions among communities facing “longstanding racism and discrimination”. Climate action and sustainable development: we still have time Turning finally to the UN Climate Action Summit in New York on 23 September, the need for the world to act together to protect the planet while also leaving no-one behind – a key tenet of the 2030 Agenda – has never been so important, she stressed. “We still have time, experts say we still have time to get to 1.5 degrees (Celsius)…But if we don’t do what we need to do we could end with three or four degrees, and that would be very bad for the planet,” Ms. Bachelet said. “We still have time to get to 2030 with the Agenda 2030, but if we don’t accelerate the path…what it could become is more conflict, because conflicts are grounded in insecurity, poverty.”

380-> Climate change and multilateralism figure high on first day of UN General Assembly debate
If there was one issue that was a recurrent theme on Tuesday on the first day of the 's annual general debate, it was the potentially catastrophic impact of climate change , from ’s opening address warning global Heads of State and Government  that “its speed has provoked a sonic boom SOS across the world”, to individual leaders highlighting their individual vulnerabilities. “Peru is one of the most vulnerable countries,” Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra Cornejo said. “Our great biodiversity is the principal natural capital on which we rely and thus climate change and extreme climatic events like droughts and deluges put us in a particularly vulnerable position.” Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto highlighted the importance of implementing the UN’s , which seeks to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change by keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above industrial levels by the end of the century. President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands, a low-lying Pacific atoll nation little more than one metre above sea level, which is threatened with annihilation by rising oceans, urgent implementation of the Paris accord. “The future of the Marshall Islands hangs in the balance,” she warned. “But it is not just us, even if, as an atoll nation, we are the most vulnerable. We are joined not only by other , but many other countries who face serious challenges posed by climate impacts.” Seychelles President Danny Faure that peace and prosperity cannot be disassociated from the effects of climate change and its existential threat to the world as a whole. “Neglecting the effects of climate change will pass on to the next generation a world beyond repair,” he said. Speaking from the opposite spectrum of low-lying island States, President Sooronbay Jeenbekov of the high mountain Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan, that climate change is having an increasing impact on the glaciers and water resources in his country, contributing to the growth of natural disasters. Neglecting the effects of climate change will pass on to the next generation a world beyond repair  Many leaders recounted the problems and achievements of their own countries. But they also highlighted the UN ( ), which seek to eliminate a host of social ills in an environmentally friendly way by 2030,  and underscored the UN’s prime role in attaining the global partnership needed to combat climate change and resolve a slew of other problems, including the current worldwide migration crisis. A discordant note came from United States President Donald Trump, who rejected the ideology of globalism, opposed the new , scheduled to be adopted in Morocco in December, and complained that the US’s trading partners had taken advantage of it, explaining his policy of unilaterally imposing billions of dollars in import tariffs. Delivering a sound was Swiss President Alain Berset, who bemoaned the “tendency at the moment” to seek answers to such problems as globalization, inequality, conflict, extremism, migration and climate change “in nationalist isolation and in a growing mistrust with regard to cooperation between States.” “We are witnessing a real crisis in multilateralism – paradoxically at the very moment when we are trying to forge the main pillars of the global governance of the future,” he said. “The United Nations is indispensable and ideally placed to tackle contemporary challenges, especially the fight against inequality.” He also decried “policies relying on trade protectionism and selfish interests” that undermine trade and prosperity, and reiterated his countries support for the [International Criminal Court] as “this unique international cooperative effort in favour of the victims of the most serious crimes.” The defense of multilateralism must begin here ... The UN and its members need to show their will to act together, not past each other  Brazil’s President Michel Temer also made the case against protectionism. “Protectionism may even sound seductive, but it is through openness and integration that harmony, growth and progress can be achieved,” he said. He also underlined the importance of adopting the he Global Compact for Migration. Finnish President Sauli Niinistö also . “Unfortunately, there is now reason to be worried for all of us who believe in the benefits of multilateralism,” he said. “The international system we have built together is visibly under pressure. Its capability and credibility are questioned. We can no longer take the rules-based order for granted. It is our common responsibility to actively defend and develop it.” He called the UN “the core" of the multilateral system. “Therefore, the defense of multilateralism must begin here,” he said. “The UN and its members need to show their will to act together, not past each other.” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also multilateralism. “We must resist any and all efforts to undermine the multilateral approach to international trade, which is essential to the promotion of stability and predictability in the global economy,” he declared. Many speakers declared their support for the Global Compact on Migration. “We look forward to its adoption in Marrakech later this year,” Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari , noting that irregular migration is not a consequence of conflicts alone, but of the effects of climate change and lack of opportunities at home, calling climate change “one of the greatest challenges of our time.” While stressing the importance of multilateralism, Rwandan President Paul Kagame the need for “real multilateralism, where it has too often been lacking. “The current two-track system of global governance is unsustainable,” he said. “A few get to be the ones to define the norms by which others shall be judged. But standards that do not apply to everyone equally are not universal. Addressing this imbalance in the very foundation of our system is what will give shape to a revival of multilateral cooperation, and renew the legitimacy of the international institutions, that are so crucial to our planet's future.” Every nation is important and we all have something to offer  Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno Garces gave a personal dimension to the value of UN compacts, treaties and conventions, sharing his personal story of suffering an assault 20 years ago that cost him the mobility of his legs. “I see the world from the height of the heart,” he said, referring to his stature in a wheelchair. “This is not just my story, but that of one billion people in the world,” he added, calling the UN , and its optional protocol, “the best guarantee that, together, we will develop a commitment.” But it was Malawi’s President Arthur Peter Mutharika who perhaps best captured the true essence of the UN. “Every nation is important and we all have something to offer,” he . “There are no minorities here. There are no small nations here. There are only nations in the United Nations.”

381-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Cutting emissions, one bog at a time
Farmers and entrepreneurs in rural eastern Europe are helping to tackle climate change while boosting their livelihoods as a result of regenerating ancient wetland peat bogs. Peat is made up of decaying organic matter and, crucially, is able to absorb harmful carbon deposits which would otherwise add to carbon dioxide emissions, if released into the atmosphere. Many of the bogs in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, have been drained so the land can be used for commercial development, but when dry, the peat becomes highly combustible. If it catches fire, then dangerous levels of greenhouse gasses are released. Now, local people with the support of the UN Development Programme ( ) and European Union, are restoring the peatlands and setting up small businesses which can operate sustainably alongside. It’s estimated that the 30 million tons of carbon has been kept in ground thanks to their efforts, the equivalent, says, of closing 140 coal-fired energy plants. about how the conservation of peatlands is contributing to fighting climate change, and go here to our , for the latest information across the UN, including the crucial climate conference, in Katowice, Poland.

382-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: DR Congo Prospers from Environmental Protection
Families in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are being supported by their government and the United Nations to protect the environment and build what the UN Development Programme calls “climate-resilient lives.” People in the coastal region of the vast African country are being encouraged to combat the effects of climate change by changing the way they live and work. A young man who used to cut down mangrove trees to turn into charcoal is now making a living by manufacturing and selling energy efficient stoves. The eradication of protective mangrove forests can lead to flooding and increased coastal erosion. And small market gardens have been established to provide employment to women, improve the supply and quality of food locally and increase environmental sustainability. , about how small changes in routine, lifestyle and behavior can have a major impact on the environment.

383-> Greener energy for a third of the world bodes well for all, says UN on International Forest Day
Cautioning the impact of human activity such as practices use of woodfuel on world’s forests, the United Nations Department for Economic and Social Affairs and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) today called for better wood-energy conversions technologies and more sustainable management of forests so that everyone benefits. “This is an area where we can make a real difference,” Wu Hongbo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. “Sustainably managed forests are productive and resilient ecosystems, providing people with livelihoods and renewable energy, along with timber, food, shelter, clean air, water and climate benefits,” he added. At the same time, fuel wood – the primary source of energy for nearly a third of the world’s population and a product derived from forests – is also an important part of the energy equation. However, current fuel production practices (such as production of charcoal) are not only contributing to degradation of forests and soils, they are estimated to cause up to seven per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. Most of the emissions is largely due to unsustainable forest management and inefficient charcoal manufacture and fuelwood combustion, said in the report, , which was launched coinciding with the . “This is especially important for poor people in rural areas of developing countries, where wood is often the only energy source available [and its] conversion to charcoal is often done using rudimentary and polluting methods,” FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva announcing the report at a ceremony marking the International Day in Rome. Forests, energy, climate change and sustainable development Forests and energy are also linked to sustainable development and can help combatting climate change. According to estimates, about a third of the world’s population (about 2.4 billion people) still rely on the traditional use of woodfuel for cooking, and many small enterprises use fuelwood and charcoal as the main energy carriers for various purposes such as baking, tea processing and brickmaking. Of all the wood used as fuel worldwide, about 17 per cent is converted to charcoal, however the production often relies on inefficient technologies and unsustainable resources and in some cases the emission of greenhouse gas can be as high as nine kilograms of carbon dioxide-equivalent per kilogram of charcoal produced. Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is [...] fundamental for addressing the impacts of climate change and eliminating extreme poverty and hunger  “Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy is one of the 17 (SDGs) [and it is] fundamental for addressing the impacts of climate change and eliminating extreme poverty and hunger,” explained the head of FAO. “We need, for instance, to adopt improved technologies for energy conversion,” he noted, referring to the UN agency’s programmes to deliver fuel-efficient stoves, especially for poor people in Latin America and Africa. Greening the charcoal value chain and applying sustainable forest management practices can, therefore, mitigate climate change and further efficiencies can be gained by reducing charcoal waste, for example, by transforming charcoal dust into briquettes, adding a new iteration to the energy cycle. Economic benefits and environmental improvements The FAO report also argues that although the transition from unsustainable to sustainable sourcing could impose costs on the charcoal value chain, a greener charcoal sector would have an overall positive economic impact. For instance, a cost-benefit analysis in Kenya estimated that a transition to efficient charcoal production would require an investment of $15.6 million per year excluding upfront costs. However, it would generate $20.7 million in benefits. At the same time, demand for sustainable charcoal production can provide opportunities for afforestation and reforestation. And providing local people with greater tenure security can increase their willingness and ability to invest in sustainable approaches. Furthermore, fostering an enabling political environment and an attractive investment climate for transition to a greener charcoal sector can also help increase government revenue collection and investments in sustainable forest management and efficient wood conversion technologies. A win-win for all concerned, including for the forests.

384-> INTERVIEW: What extreme weather and global temperature rise mean for humanity – WMO chief
In a new report analyzing the global climate between 2011-2015, the World Meteorological Organization ( ) – the United Nations system’s weather agency – an increasingly visible human footprint on extreme weather and climate events with dangerous and costly impacts. This “hot  and wild” weather meant that global ocean temperatures rose at unprecedented  levels, Arctic sea ice coverage and mountain glaciers declined and surface  melting of the Greenland ice sheet continued at above-average levels. The  extreme weather also meant that people around the world suffered from high-impact  climate events such as severe droughts in Africa, devastating floods in  South-East Asia, terrible heatwaves in India and Pakistan, and catastrophic  hurricanes and typhoons in the United States and the Philippines. Against  this backdrop, and within the context of the ongoing 22nd Conference of the Parties ( ) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ),  in Marrakech, Morocco (07-18 November 2016), the spoke with  Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of World Meteorological Organization ( ), on  the state of the Earth’s weather and what it means to the people who inhabit the  planet.  One degree does not sound like a big number if you compare the temperate over a couple of days but globally [over a long  period of time] it means that we have seen an increase in the amount of  disasters related to the weather. It means that we have observed more heat  waves, for example, in Kuwait, the temperature hit 54 degrees Celsius limit  last summer and there have been devastating heat waves in many continents. We have also seen changes in the pattern of  rainfall, which means that some areas are now seeing flooding – when it rains,  it rains much more -- and that led to problems for human beings and also for  economies. And then in some parts of the world we have seen more droughts,  caused by the heat waves, and leading to forest fires and difficulties in  agriculture. For example, at the moment, the southern part of Africa is suffering  because of a drought that was partly caused by El Nino last year but also by a drying  trend behind it. In tropical zones we have observed more intense tropical  storms and they have been devastating for countries like Vanuatu. We also  observed the first hurricane hitting Cabo Verde on the African coast. So this one degree change means that the  amount of disasters related to weather and hydrology have been increasing and  if it goes beyond that one degree limit – which seems to be the case according  to this year’s observations – we can expect to see more of these kind of  disasters. And it will have a negative impact on the economies of the  countries, and it will also impact the lives and wellbeing of all humans.   The main reason behind it is that we are  using much more fossil fuel: coal, gas, and oil. We have changed the  composition of the atmosphere. Therefore, we have seen  a very dramatic increase of the carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere.  And we have also seen an increase in the amount of methane (CH4) in the  atmosphere and an increase of the nitrous oxide (N2O). And all these are  contributing to this warming that we have seen.   In our field we have known about this  problem for 30 years. So about 30 years ago, we established the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), and then years later we  established the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change ( )  to start mitigating climate change. So this problem  has been around for a long time, but the good news is that governments now  understand the need to mitigate climate change, and that’s why they adopted the on climate change last  year, and it has very recently entered into force. This gives us a good basis  for moving forward, and to mitigate the effects of  climate change. And the key issue is whether we are acting quickly  enough to avoid a 1.5 or 2 degree warming or are we going to go beyond that. So far the pledges behind the Paris Agreement indicate about  a 3 degree warming level, which would mean that we might have a larger  amount of disasters related to the weather. So  it would be a smart thing for the governments to start reducing the emissions,  and that would also be good for the coming generations.   I would like to thank them for ratifying  the Paris Agreement, which gives us hope. And we  also now have better technological means for mitigation. And those means are  also cheaper than they used to be. For example, solar and wind energy sources  are cheaper than they used to be ten years ago. And we also have possibilities to  convert our transport systems to use more electric cars. In the case of diet,  we can go to more vegetarian diet; which could also reduce emissions. So we have all the means available, and now  it’s time to act and prevent these negative impacts of climate change, and it’s  important that we start acting very soon, because if we wait, the problem will  become more severe. I am very optimistic that we have all the means to be  successful, but we should start changing our behavior very soon.   All normal consumers now have big powers – they  can decide what kind of sources of energy they use in their houses, what kind  of means of transport they use, and what kind of diet they are eating. For  example, a vegetarian diet is better for climate than a meat-based diet. Consumers  have big power here and if they decide to go to these low emission solutions,  they are the ones who have power to do that. And also the policy-makers are  watching very closely what the opinion of the ordinary people is, and I believe  that they are able to change the consumption behaviour in  the coming years.

385-> FEATURE:  Feudal-era Japanese village leader stands as beacon for tsunami education
Japan’s initiative to raise the awareness of the risks posed by tsunamis will this weekend mark a milestone when World Tsunami Awareness Day makes its debut on 5 November – an occasion that goes beyond paying tribute to the victims of tsunamis. Tsunamis are rare, but extremely deadly. Records show that, between 1996 and 2015, 250,900 people died in 21 countries affected by 30 tsunamis. The most devastating among them was the Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26 December 2004 in which more than 220,000 people perished, including 9,000 foreign tourists.  Japan’s tsunami on 11 March 2011 left more than 18,000 dead or missing. “Rather than selecting a memorial day or a tragic day, such as 11 March or 26 December, 5 November was selected as a ‘forward-looking’ day when many lives were saved due to proactive actions,” Yuki Matsuoka, Head of the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) in Japan, told the UN News Centre. There is a century and decades-long history to it. On 5 November in 1854, a massive tsunami triggered by a magnitude-8.4 earthquake struck the Kii Peninsula in Japan.  It is recorded that many lives were saved in that event when Goryo Hamaguchi, a leader in a small village, set fire to piled sheaves of newly harvested rice in his own paddy, to evacuate and guide fellow villagers to high ground in the darkness. In Japan, this story is known as “The Fire of Inamura (rice sheaves).” Last December, the UN General Assembly designated 5 November as , with 142 countries co-sponsoring a resolution drafted by Japan, which worked with other disaster-prone countries as well as partners such as UNISDR. “Tsunami, originally a Japanese word, is now commonly used in English. This represents the fact that the Japanese people have the long history of grappling with tsunami hazards,” Ms. Matsuoka said.  “Japan built the people’s resilience not only by hard measures, but also by soft measures,” she added.   In Japan, evacuation drills are being conducted every year in various forms and at different levels under initiatives of the national government, local authorities, schools and communities, according to Ms. Matsuoka. “These accumulated experiences have contributed to generating knowledge and expertise in disaster risk reduction to share with the international community,” she added. Serving as a repository of this expertise is , or the Hall of the Fire of Rice Sheaves, which was established in 2007 in the small municipality of Hirogawa in Wakayama Prefecture, where Goryo Hamaguchi was born. Japan built the people’s resilience not only by hard measures, but also by soft measures “The fundamental purpose of using ‘ ’ as educational material is to make everyone understand the importance of prompt evacuation,” Kouichi Sakiyama, the Hall’s Director, told the UN News Centre. Mr. Sakiyama explained that in tsunami-prone places, measures have been taken to prevent causalities and damage, such as building sea walls, embankments and other structures.  “It’s natural that people feel a sense of security when they see these big, stark structures, but in reality, people may just rely on those facilities,” he said, warning that a lack of knowledge about the mechanism of tsunami could lead to wrong actions. “Now that the date for the Fire of Inamura has been designated as , I take it that our Hall has assumed the responsibility to spread to the world the message that evacuation is critical in the event of tsunamis,” he said. “We are determined to carry out that responsibility.” The theme of the first World Tsunami Awareness Day is “Education and Evacuation Drills.” Jerry Velasquez, Chief of Advocacy and Outreach Section of UNISDR, headquartered in Geneva, told the UN News Centre that education and evacuation drills are key components of stopping tsunamis from turning into full-blown disasters with massive fatalities. “Even the technologically most advanced early warning systems in the world are only as good as their ability to reach the public and to provoke the appropriate reaction to the warning,” said Mr. Velasquez. Various tsunami awareness raising initiatives are under way around the world. According to UNISDR, crucial to success is to keep awareness-raising as jargon-free as possible.  Scientific accuracy is important, but messages have to be as clear as possible to the general public to achieve their aims.

Photo/Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India  In a unique effort, the Cabinet Office of Japan has “appointed” as “envoys” for raising tsunami risk awareness.  They participate in various events and lead tsunami evacuation drills across the country.  Their message is clear: when a tsunami occurs, each person should evacuate immediately and as fast as possible.  It is important to decide with family members where you will escape to and make the utmost effort to protect your own life. “Trust that your family is also evacuating, and get yourself to high ground as fast as your legs can carry you. Reunite with your family after you have evacuated,” they say. On 7-8 September, 24 countries – Australia, Bangladesh, Comoros, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Mozambique, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Seychelles, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Thailand, Timor Leste and Yemen –participated in an Indian Ocean-wide tsunami mock drill. In India, the exercise involved evacuation of around 35,000 people from the coastal regions, including Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala, Gujarat and Goa. Named “ ,” the two-day mock drill was organised by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ), which coordinated the setting up of Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (IOTWMS) in the aftermath of the December 26, 2004 tsunami triggered by an undersea earthquake off Sumatra, Indonesia. The simulation exercise was comprehensive, including not only evacuation and rescue operation, but also a mock interview with the media. About 300 pupils and 20 staff members of Vicente Guerrero Primary School in Zihuatanejo de Azueta, State of Guerrero, Mexico, run towards a hill during a tsunami evacuation drill on 14 October 2016. Photo/SATREPS, Mexico  Drills have been conducted in various continents that have a potential tsunami risk including countries such as Mexico and Chile. On 28 September, gathering in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, scientists and disaster risk experts from the Mediterranean and beyond have vowed to step up efforts to raise awareness among the general public of how to react to the threat of tsunamis. “Public awareness is one of the most important activities,” said Professor Ahmet Cevdet Yalciner of Turkey’s Middle East Technical University, who chairs the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation System in the Northeastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Connected Seas (ICG/NEAMTWS). Around 130 million people live on these regions’ shores, which also include the Adriatic, Aegean, Marmara and Black Seas. The population rises sharply during the summer tourist season, meaning that risk reduction also needs to target visitors. “There has to be an effort to make sure that messages are readable for the public,” Marzia Santini, of Italy’s Civil Protection Department, told the gathering. “In Italy, we have volunteers – ordinary citizens, not professionals – talking to other citizens about risks and how to behave in the event that hazard strikes, how to know more about the basics of risk management and so on,” she said. Meanwhile, Greece deploys a “tsunami tank.” By cranking a handle, passers-by generate model tsunamis and see their impact. “This really motivates people to ask about tsunamis, so we have a great opportunity to tell them about risk,” said Areti Plessa of the Institute of Geodynamics at the National Observatory of Athens. In April, Israel organized its “Blue Wave” exercise, in cooperation with Greece, Italy and Turkey.  Two weeks beforehand, the authorities put up tsunami signs – which are there to stay – thereby generating public attention for the exercise. The Miracle of Kamaishi is actually not a ‘miracle,’ but the result of awareness and education “It’s a game-changer,” said Amir Yahav, of Israel’s National Emergency Management Authority. These measures are critical as there are episodes that show lives were saved due to preparedness. In Japan’s 2011 disaster, almost all of the nearly 3,000 elementary and junior high school students in Kamaishi City in Iwate Prefecture survived the tsunami, Ms. Matsuoka of UNISDR Japan said. Immediately after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake struck that afternoon, the students of Kamaishi East Junior High School ran out of the school towards higher ground. Their quick evacuation prompted the children and teachers of the neighboring Unosumai Elementary School to follow, and consequently led many other local residents to follow. As they continued to run, older students supported the younger ones, and together they reached a safe location while the mega-tsunami swallowed their schools and the town. This episode came to be known as “the Miracle of Kamaishi,” Ms. Matsuoka said. According to UNISDR, there are similar tales in other parts of the world, like the story of Tilly Smith, a British girl who, at the age of 10, is credited with saving 100 holiday makers in a Thai resort during the Indian Ocean Tsunami of 2004 thanks to a geography lesson at her school that taught her the tell-tale signs of a looming tsunami. But in many disaster situations, making sound judgement is not as easy as in those textbook examples. According to Japanese media reports, 74 students and 10 teachers at Okawa Elementary School in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, either died or are still missing, after the 2011 tsunami. Bereaved family members of 23 students sued the Miyagi prefectural and Ishinomaki municipal governments – which run public schools – for compensation.  The plaintiffs argued that school officials were negligent in not evacuating the students to a hill in the back of the school where there would have been a greater chance of escaping the deadly waves.  The defendants argued that the hill was not adequate for an evacuation location as it had a risk of fallen trees. “These stories from Tohoku [Northeast] Region in Japan are indeed sending a critical message to the world,” Ms. Matsuoka said. “The Miracle of Kamaishi is actually not a ‘miracle,’ but the result of awareness and education,” she said.  “They could evacuate effectively on that day based on their knowledge and correct judgement through what they had learnt.” “By raising tsunami awareness through World Tsunami Awareness Day, we can save lives and mitigate the devastating damages caused by tsunamis,” she concluded.

386-> INTERVIEW: 'Climate change is really about the wellbeing of people'
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Patricia Espinosa as the new Executive Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in May this year. Ms. Espinosa recently spoke with about her work and the challenges ahead. The Mexican national comes to the job with more than 30 years of experience in international relations. This includes serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Mexico from 2006 to 2012 and serving as her country’s representative to Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia and Germany, as well as to multilateral bodies and international organizations in Vienna, Geneva and New York. Her areas of specialty include global governance, sustainable development, gender equality, the protection of human rights and climate change. In relation to the last area, she was the Chair of the 16th Conference of the Parties to the leading to the adoption in 2010 of the – a set of key steps forward in global plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to help developing nations protect themselves from climate impacts. She was also in the French capital of Paris last year for the 21st session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC, at which the Paris Climate Change Agreement was adopted. The historic pact to combat climate change and to intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable, low-carbon future builds upon the UNFCCC and – for the first time – brings all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. The Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As of 3 August 2016, the has 180 signatories. Of the 180 signatories, 22 have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval. The agreement will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, deposit their instruments of ratification or acceptance with the Secretary-General. Ms. Espinosa recently spoke with the about her work and the challenges ahead.   :  I am coming to the head of UNFCCC at a very exciting time. We have the approval of the Paris Agreement, which was an historic agreement, after many, many years of negotiations. Now we have on board a huge amount of political will of governments but also the willingness from private sectors, from civil society, from individuals everywhere in the world, to work toward a low-carbon economy, a low-carbon society-global society. So I wish to make a contribution in that respect. I wish to support all those actors, governments, private sectors and civil societies – everybody who is willing to participate in this big challenge that has to do with the future of our planet. : The Paris Agreement actually provides a very comprehensive framework for action, and it provides a comprehensive framework for action by all the actors that I mentioned earlier. Of course, the governments are in the centre of this agenda but it’s not only about the governments. In fact, in the case of the Paris Agreement, if we want to have full compliance with the Paris Agreement we need, not only action by governments, we need the action by all of society. I believe it depends really on all those actors whether the Paris Agreement can deliver as to how we would want it to deliver.  : Actually, climate change is really about the wellbeing of people. It is not a very vague concept or a vague problem that is out of our everyday lives. It is actually affecting our everyday lives and this is the fundamental fact that everybody should keep in mind while working toward a low-carbon society. If we think about the people that are affected in their health by the effects of climate change – for instance, the quality of air that we are breathing and how much children and older people are suffering from that; if we look at people who are living in poverty, who are suddenly victims to flooding and they lose not only the little property that they have but they also lose members of their families; if we look at disasters that are destroying infrastructure, leaving completely isolated communities in different parts of the world – we are talking about the lives of people. So having that consideration in mind, it’s a big driver towards more ambitious and urgent action by everybody.      : We have, as of today, 22 ratifications. That is, in my opinion, very good news and very encouraging.  And we have also the invitation to the Secretary General’s special event on 21 September in order to promote early ratification. So I’m very hopeful. I think it would send a very strong message about the willingness to comply with the commitment each country assumed in Paris.  : Of course we need to work on different areas. First of all, we need to continue to supporting the governments in their intergovernmental process, in their negotiations because the Paris Agreements provides this very comprehensive framework and it requires a lot of tools that need to be developed still. For instance in terms of rules for transparency, rules for measurement – these are issues that are not easy to solve and easy to really to get everyone’s minds together. So that will be one part, an important part, of our work. Of course, the Convention is mandating us to support the conference of the parties that takes place every year, but besides that, because what we really need is to have full compliance with the Convention, we would need to focus a lot on implementation of the Paris Agreement and which translates to the national programmes on climate change for each and every country. We will need to reach out to all those actors – to governments, to civil societies, to businesses – and help in mobilizing them to help in this fight against climate change.  : This is a very important area of work for the future, not only work for the UNFCCC but for the whole United Nations system. I would actually say for all of our societies in general too, because of what I was mentioning earlier – the fact that climate change has to do with development. There is only one development process in each country. We need to generate the frameworks, the legal frameworks, the institutional frameworks, the policies that are required in order to allow for countries to have those types of structural transformation processes that are required. So in that sense, this is an area of work that will take a lot of the resources of the UNFCCC and one on which I will be also dedicating myself too.   : Absolutely. We are in a completely different environment. When we had the conference in Cancun it followed the conference in Copenhagen where, unfortunately, we were not able to achieve a consensus document and that situation, of course, discouraged many of the participants in the process of negotiations. So it was a very critical moment then we needed to restore trust in the Parties and we needed to restore trust in the process and we managed to do it. Today, there is not only trust – there is an enormous enthusiasm about participating in this agenda and about being apart about this transformation process. So I am very happy to be heading the UNFCCC right now at this very fortunate juncture. : Now is the time for ratification and for implementation it is the time to act together, it is the time to avoid any disastrous consequences of climate change.  : I could see as a civil servant, particularly in my role as foreign minister of my country, that I had the opportunity to travel a lot and to be close to the reality and to the challenges that many countries are facing, especially, in this case, the region of Latin America and the Caribbean. I was responsible, for instance, for coordinating the help that we offered to countries in the region when there was flooding, when there was drought and people were starving. So I could see very clearly how much suffering this causes, really, a lot of suffering that should not happen. And, of course, I have been working all my life, more than 35 years, as a civil servant and trying to make a contribution to better conditions of living for our people in Mexico but not only for the people of Mexico, as part of my career has been in multilateral affairs. So in many senses the responsibility, the possibility of becoming the UNFCCC Executive Secretary brings together a lot of these issues for which I’ve worked for all my life.

387-> FEATURE: Humanity at the core as UN readies for first-ever Ocean Conference
Over a year ago, on 20 February 2016, Tropical Cyclone Winston made a category 5 landfall along the north coast of Fiji's largest, most populous island, Viti Levu, killing at least 44 people, and grounding flights to and from the Pacific Island nation. "It was one of the strongest cyclones to have hit  any country in the Southern Hemisphere," recalls Mr. Semi Koroilavesau, Fijian Minister  for Fisheries. "That was quite catastrophic for Fiji and we are still  recovering from it," he adds, sombrely. Mr. Koroilavesau was speaking recently at a panel  discussion on the margins of the first preparatory meeting – convened by the at the UN Headquarters in New  York – for the first-ever , to be co-hosted by the  Governments of Fiji and Sweden, from 5 June to 9 June 2017. "Our ocean is warming up and changing the pattern of  our main product, which is tuna," said Mr. Koroilavesau underlining the  significance of the ocean to the Fijian people. "The migratory pattern has changed because of the  conditions of the water. The degradation of the water is also depleting our  resources and creating a lot of havoc in our ocean," he told the high-level  panel, which included Peter Thomson, President of the UN General Assembly,  Isabella Lövin, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, and , UN  Under-Secretary-General and head of the Department of Economic and Social  Affairs ( ). "Fiji has about 320 islands. Ocean is quite an  important item to us both in our daily lives and… also as transportation between  the islands," said Mr. Koroilavesau.  In the run-up to the June Conference, four themes  will shape the focus of the preparations that, according to the President of the UN General Assembly,  "will lay the foundations upon which the Oceans Conference will stand." "Our efforts at this time and in the years ahead,  will determine whether our children, and those who come after them, will know  the joy and the sustenance of the oceans bounty that was provided to us in our  youth. Let's not deny them that bounty," Mr. Thomson had said earlier, in a  message that resonated strongly with the theme for the month of February, which  is , with a focus on  livelihoods, tourism, food security, maritime transport and trade. "Whether you  look at the declining fish stocks that are reaching a tipping point, or the  ocean acidification level or whether you look at the level of plastics in our  oceans, I think any sensible person can conclude that time is running out fast  and we need to take action fast," said Mr. Thomson, during the preparatory  meeting. SDG14  and the whole development agenda Under-Secretary-General Wu Hongbo underlined  the nexus between oceans and people, especially in the context of , which has to do  with conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources for  sustainable development. "When we talk about SDG 14, we are thinking about  navigation in the sea, we think about catching fish in the sea for food, we are  thinking about doing tourism, but that is not all. Health of the sea and  sustainable use of marine resources have a direct impact in the implementation  of the many SDGs," noted Mr. Wu, calling for voluntary commitments to implement  Goal 14.  Noting that SDG 14 is one of the vanguards for the  whole Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, Mr. Wu also makes the connection  between oceans and the goal to eliminate hunger. "We are actually receiving a  lot of nutrition and the food from the sea so we have to protect the sea," said  Mr. Wu. Besides food and nutrition, Mr. Wu pointed out the  significant contribution of the ocean to people's overall wellbeing and in  mitigating the effects of climate change. "The  ocean and the sea are the natural regulator of our climate and they are good  for sanitation," noted the UN Under-Secretary-General. "People are saying that  the oceans sink one third of greenhouse gas emission. If we lose the sea and  oceans, just imagine what kind of situation we are going to have," warned Mr.  Wu, who also made a connection between oceans, employment and economic growth. "I  think the best or sustainable use of marine resources would really have a big  boost to the economic growth and create a lot of jobs," said Mr. Wu. Transformative  commitments to drive Conference outcomes The outcomes of the Oceans Conference will,  according to the President of the UN General Assembly, include a call to action  and a conference report that will constitute the global body's work plan for  implementing the SDG 14. "We must keep our vision clear. We must universalise  our efforts. We must maintain the momentum towards the transformative  commitments that will emerge from the Oceans Conference in June," underscored  Mr. Thomson during the first preparatory meeting. Mr. Thomson places particular significance to the  outcomes of the Ocean Conference which, he noted, would constitute "a turning  point in history." "This is the opportunity for any human being to be a  part of the recovery of the ocean. For any human being who cares about the  health of the ocean," said Mr. Thomson, during the meeting. Sweden's Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lövin sees  the Ocean Conference as an opportunity to "share experiences, share best  practices," she told the high-level panel. "This Ocean Conference will be the  hub where we can actually share this knowledge, also transfer technology, and  support developing countries so they will have access and the capacity to share  the way that is needed for the oceans because the oceans connect us all," she  said.  Ms. Lövin also expressed concerns about  unsustainable exploitation of ocean resources and pollution, warning, "If these  trends continue, with the overfishing, with more and more plastic pollution in  our oceans, we will have more plastics than fish in our oceans by 2050." Like her fellow panellists, she made an urgent call  to action. "It's really, really serious so this is what we have to do now in  order to leave our planet with good conscious to our children and  grandchildren," she said, adding, "We need to take action now and we can do it.  We don't have any excuses for not doing it." The UN has called for  voluntary commitments to implement Goal 14 and established an online commitment registry. The voluntary commitments,  according to Under-Secretary-General Wu, "underscore the urgency for action and  for solutions." Other themes in focus every month ahead of the Ocean  conference include: Ocean Pollution (marine litter, land-based water  pollutants, shipping waste, oil spills); Marine Biodiversity (overfishing,  marine habitat loss, species loss); and Oceans and Climate Change (sea-level  rise, ocean warming, ocean acidification, coral bleaching).

388-> Make food systems climate resilient now or future production will be compromised – UN warns
Failure to act now to make food systems more resilient to climate change will seriously compromise food production in many regions, which in turn could fail international efforts to end hunger and extreme poverty by 2030, the United Nations agricultural agency warned today. “Agriculture holds the key to solving two of the greatest problems now facing humanity: eradicating poverty and hunger, and contributing to maintaining the stable climatic conditions in which civilization can thrive,” Food and Agriculture Organization Director-General José Graziano da Silva a roundtable on climate change during the in Dubai. The Director-General stressed in particular the need to support small farmers in the developing world adapt to climate change. Innovative approaches exist that can help them improve yields and build their resilience, he said, noting ‘green manuring,’ greater use of nitrogen-fixing cover crops, improving sustainable soil management, agroforestry techniques, and integrating animal production into cropping systems. “But farmers face major barriers, such as the lack of access to credit and markets, lack of knowledge and information, insecurity about land tenure, and high transaction costs of moving away from existing practices,” the Director-General said. For example, he said, 70 countries do not have established meteorological services. FAO is working with the World Meteorological Organization ( ) to develop low-cost, farmer friendly services to address this need. Ultimately, ‘an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,’ he argued. One critical front for action is water management, said Mr. Graziano da Silva. Millions of the world’s small-scale farmers are already wrestling with water scarcity, which will likely intensify as a result of climate change, he said. This is why at the last UN climate change conference FAO and partners launched a global framework on water scarcity in agriculture that aims to support developing countries in bringing stronger policies and programmes for the sustainable use of water in agriculture online, he explained.

389-> Wastewater should be recognized as a valuable resource, UN says on World Water Day
In a world where the demand for water continues to grow and the resource is finite, a new United Nations report argues that wastewater, discarded into the environment every day, once treated, can help meet the needs for freshwater as well as for raw materials for energy and agriculture. Needless to mention, treating wastewater and removing pollutants can also remarkably reduce the impact on the environment as well as on health. “Improved wastewater management is as much about reducing pollution at the source, as removing contaminants from wastewater flows, reusing reclaimed water and recovering useful by-products [as it is about increasing] social acceptance of the use of wastewater,” Irina Bokova, the Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ) Director-General in her foreword to the . The report, launched today in Durban, South Africa, on the occasion of , also highlights that improved management of wastewater is essential in achieving the . “It's all about carefully managing and recycling the water that runs through our homes, factories, farms and cities,” Guy Ryder, the Director-General of the UN International Labour Organization ( ) and the Chair of UN-Water, urging for reducing and safely reusing more wastewater. “Everyone can do their bit to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target to halve the proportion of untreated wastewater and increase safe water reuse by 2030.” Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG6) has specific targets on halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally (target 6.3) as well as supporting countries in wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies (target 6.a). Health and environmental dimension – particularly stark for low-income countries The report also revealed that low-income countries are particularly impacted by the release of waste water into the environment without being either treated or collected, where, on average, only 8 per cent of domestic and industrial wastewater is treated, compared to 70 per cent in high-income countries. As a result, in many regions of the world, water contaminated by bacteria, nitrates, phosphates and solvents is discharged into rivers and lakes ending up in the oceans, with negative consequences for the environment and public health. For instance, in Latin America, Asia and Africa, pollution from pathogens from human and animal excreta affects almost one third of rivers, endangering the lives of millions of people. Furthermore, growing awareness on the presence of hormones, antibiotics, steroids and endocrine disruptors in wastewater poses a new set of complexities as their impact on the environment and health have yet to be fully understood. These set of challenges underscore the need for urgent action on collection, treatment and safe use of wastewater. Wastewater as a source of raw materials In addition to providing a safe alternative source for freshwater, wastewater is also a potential source of raw materials, noted the report. Owing to developments in treatment techniques, certain nutrients, like phosphorus and nitrates, can now be recovered from sewage and sludge and turned into fertilizer. It is estimated that nearly 22 per cent of the global demand for phosphorus (a depleting mineral resource) can be met by treating human urine and excrement. Use of treated wastewater has long been practised by astronauts, such as those on the International Space Station who have been reusing the same recycled water for over 16 years Similarly, organic substances contained in wastewater can be used to produce biogas, which could power wastewater treatment facilities as well as contribute to energy needs of local communities. In addition, use of treated wastewater is growing for agricultural irrigation. At least 50 countries around the globe are now using treated wastewater for this purpose, accounting for an estimated 10 per cent of all irrigated land. Lastly, the report also mentioned that treated wastewater can augment drinking water supplies, although this is still a marginal practice. Cities such as Singapore, San Diego (United States), and Windhoek (Namibia) have been treating wastewater to supplement drinking water reserves. A great example is use of treated wastewater, long practised by astronauts, such as those on the International Space Station who have been reusing the same recycled water for over 16 years.

390-> Decades of progress ‘can be wiped out overnight,’ UN chief laments at climate session in Yokohama
“Little undermines development like disaster,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told attendees at a on Africa and climate change, on day two of the Tokyo international Conference on African Development (TICAD), now in its seventh year. “Decades of sustainable development gains can be wiped out overnight,” he lamented in Yokohama, citing the deadly in Mozambique earlier this year, floods that plagued Japan just days ago, and the wildfires presently ripping through the Amazon. With July recorded as the hottest month ever, “We are on track for 2015-2019 to be the five hottest years since there are records. At the same time, the World Meteorological Organization has also shown that we have now the largest concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere of human history,” the UN chief . As far as bearing the brunt, “The poor and vulnerable are the first to suffer,” he said, noting Africa is on the frontline of suffering consequences, yet contributes minimally to global warming. “Our overarching goal is to raise ambition and get the world on track to limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius”-- UN Secretary-General “Africa has the moral authority on this,” he urged, and holds the right to ask top CO2 emitters like China, the United States and India, according the UN Environment Programme’s ,  to scale back on their emissions and comply with the scientific community’s recommendations for achieving carbon neutrality in 2050. “Our overarching goal is to raise ambition and get the world on track to limit global temperature rise to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius,” he said, citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), which found this target is only manageable by way of “rapid and far-reaching transitions.” “We have been in contact with the countries to see whether, during the high-level session of the General Assembly, that would be a meeting devoted to the mobilization of support to the Amazon.” On 23 September the UN chief will host a t in New York, with proposals already put forward to protect the poor and vulnerable including boosts to disaster recovery and preparatory measures. Limiting crises wrought by climate change requires we “not only respond more efficiently to disaster after it happens, but through advanced warning and preparation, we must work to prevent disaster from happening in the first place,” the Secretary-General said.

391-> Hurricane Dorian: Bahamas death toll expected to rise as thousands remain missing
As the UN and other aid partners respond to huge humanitarian needs in the hurricane-struck northern Bahamas, latest reports indicate that the death toll is likely to increase substantially, the head of an emergency medical relief team said on Friday. “We certainly expect the death toll to rise, I can’t tell you what that would be, but we’re really worried about it,” Dr. Ian Norton, Manager of the World Health ( ) Emergency Medical Teams Initiative, told journalists in Geneva. In the eye of the storm, you either drown, or survive “What we’ve seen unfortunately in this devastating storm surge - especially in a stationary storm – (it) produces what you would see maybe after a tsunami”, Dr. Norton added. “And what we don’t see in those cases is injuries as such, we see unfortunately a lot of people drowned and losing their lives - drowning or surviving.” “We certainly expect the death toll to rise; I can’t tell you what that would be, but we’re really worried about it.” Dr Ian Norton, Manager of Emergency Medical Teams, Geneva, provided the latest updates on to the media today ⬇️ As of Friday morning local time, 30 people are confirmed to have died after Hurricane Dorian hit the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama last weekend with maximum wind speeds of 297 kilometres per hour (185 mph). But the Government says that thousands are still missing after the Category 5 storm brought with it a storm surge of 18 to 23 feet (5.5 to seven metres) and 76,000 people are believed to be homeless, in need of assistance. The extreme level of destruction has been attributed by UN weather experts at the World Meteorological Organization ( ) to the fact that Dorian “remained stationary, thus exacerbating the impacts of the hazards: wind, rain, waves and storm surge”. In a statement on Friday, UN Migration Agency, , said that “only minimal information” was available from the affected islands and that more detailed assessments of people’s requirements are urgently needed. Flooding and blocked roads blocking people from reaching shelters Among its priorities, the agency is providing 1,000 tarpaulins to replace roofs “stripped” from homes by the hurricane. Citing official sources, IOM said that some 449 people are in nine emergency shelters in Abaco, with 346 survivors being temporarily housed in 17 shelters in Grand Bahama. “Many are sheltering in clinics and therefore need to be relocated; thousands more are prevented from reaching the shelters due to flooding and blocked roads,” IOM said. Highlighting the immense challenge ahead for affected Bahamians, the agency noted the need to rebuild destroyed infrastructure, “with increased resistance in the face of extreme weather”, as being key to boosting the resilience of the communities. Treating chronically ill is only one of many priorities Other immediate needs include treating people with chronic illnesses, such as those with diabetes and kidney failure, Dr Norton explained. “We now know that the hospital in Freeport which is on Grand Bahama is severely flooded with sewage-contaminated water, and so therefore it needs to be temporarily replaced with a field hospital”, he said. Amid reports that many other medical centres are flooded, international health teams are arriving in the Bahamas to provide clinical care and help survivor to secure food supplies, safe drinking water and sanitation. “I can’t tell you that we’ve got to every single atoll and sand key, but certainly the major sections of each island have been reached”, said Dr. Norton. “We’ve certainly seen reports more and more on the health side, that they’re looking at shelter, food and trying to assess what populations are left where.” Echoing that message, Dr. Esther de Gourville, representative of the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in the Bahamas, insisted that staff would use their extensive experience in emergency preparedness to improve disaster relief operations. “Clearly it is a desperate situation for some persons on Abaco,” she said.

392-> Thursday’s Daily Brief: Climate emergency, call to support breastfeeding, rising political heat and new investigation board for Syria
Today, our main stories include: UN chief’s warning on climate and global politics; UNICEF’s call to bolster breastfeeding and new Board of Inquiry in Syria UN chief warns of dangerously hot climate, and political tensions Global warming and rising political tensions are dangerous and avoidable, UN told the press on Thursday, in a statement that raises awareness of the that will take place in September. Mr. Guterres noted that while there have always been hot summers, this is “not the summer of our youth”, but a climate emergency, in which the World Meteorological Organization ( ) shows that, this year, we have experienced . July is also on course to equal, or surpass the hottest month in recorded history, and 2015 to 2019 are likely to be the five hottest years on record. “If we do not take action on climate change now”, said Mr. Guterres, “these extreme weather events are just the tip of the iceberg. And that iceberg is also rapidly melting.” ’s the full story. Investment in family-friendly policies critical to support breastfeeding – UNICEF While the benefits of breastfeeding for both children and mothers are extensive, policies that support nursing, particularly in workplaces, are not yet available to most mothers worldwide, according to the Head of the United Nations Children’s Fund ( ). “The health, social and economic benefits of breastfeeding – for mother and child – are well-established and accepted throughout the world”, said Executive Director Henrietta Fore. “Yet, nearly 60 per cent of the world’s infants are missing out on the recommended six months of exclusive breastfeeding”. From supporting healthy brain development in babies and young children, protecting infants against infection, decreasing the risk of obesity and disease, reducing healthcare costs and protecting nursing mothers against ovarian cancer and breast cancer, the benefits are widespread. Click for more. UN Climate Summit: ‘ticket to entry is bold action’ The UN chief on Thursday said that the ticket for governments, business and civil society to participate in the Climate Summit is “bold action and much greater ambition”. This will be needed if the world is to limit temperature increases to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, by cutting 45 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. “Beautiful speeches”, he continued, will not be enough. Leaders need to come to New York on 23 September with concrete plans that include the growing use of technology that is rendering renewable energy cheaper than fossil fuels; the planting of millions of trees to reverse deforestation, and remove carbon dioxide from the environment, the finance world increasingly pricing carbon risks into their decision-making process and calling on leaders to phase out fossil fuel subsidies; and leading businesses are recognizing that, in order to avoid huge losses, now is the time to move from the “grey”, polluting economy, to the green economy. “We need rapid and deep change in how we do business, generate power, build cities and feed the world”, concluded Mr. Guterres. Rising political heat The Secretary-General also turned his attention to tensions in global politics – notably in the Persian Gulf – and friction between China and the United States as well as between nuclear-armed States. Referring to recent incidents in the Strait of Hormuz that include the diversion of a British-flagged oil tanker by Iran, the US destruction of an Iranian drone, and the UK’s decision to provide a naval escort for tankers, he spelled out that a minor miscalculation in the Persian Gulf could lead to a major confrontation. On China-US relations, Mr. Guterres said that the lessons of the Cold War must be learned to avoid a new one as two competing blocs emerge, each with their own dominant currency, trade rules and contradictory geopolitical and military rules. “With leadership committed to strategic cooperation and to managing competing interests”, he said, “we can steer the world onto a safer path”. The imminent end of the landmark Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty means that the world will lose an “invaluable brake” on nuclear war, continued Mr. Guterres. States with nuclear arms capacity should avoid destabilizing developments and urgently seek a new path towards new international arms control measures, which include extending the so-called “New Start” agreement between the US and Russia; and the 2020 Review of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Board of Inquiry in northwest Syria The Secretary-General announced on Thursday that he would establish an internal UN Headquarters Board of Inquiry to investigate a series of incidents that have occurred in northwest Syria since last September, when Russia and Turkey signed the Memorandum on Stabilization of the Situation in the Idlib De-escalation Area. According to his spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, “the investigation will cover destruction of, or damage to facilities on the deconfliction list and UN-supported facilities in the area”. Upon its establishment, Mr. Guterres urged all parties to cooperate with the Board, which will ascertain the facts and report back to the UN chief when its work is completed. Mr. Dujarric said that “once the Board has been set up and is ready to commence its work” a further statement will be issued.

393-> Teen activist Greta Thunberg arrives in New York by boat, putting ‘climate crisis’ in spotlight
After a two-week sail across the Atlantic, youth climate activist Greta Thunberg arrived in the Big Apple on Wednesday to take part in two major climate summits to be held at UN Headquarters next month. Refusing to take a gas-guzzling plane, the Swedish teen decided on a zero-carbon mode of transportation to further bring awareness to the dangers of rising global emissions and pollution caused by human activity. The has sent out one boat for each of the 17 sustainable development goal to greet us! Thank you! Despite the tight quarters and lack of creature comforts, she sailed with her father, a two-man crew and a cameraperson on the 60-foot racing yacht with solar panels and underwater turbines that generated electric power. To show appreciation and solidarity for her mission toward a better world by 2030, the UN greeted the sixteen-year-old at the Verrazano Narrows Bridge with a flotilla of 17 sailboats. “The UN has sent out one boat for each of the 17 (SDGs) to greet us!” she tweeted “Thank you!” “We welcome Ms. Thunberg and wish her a pleasant stay after a long journey across the seas”, Stephane Dujarric, Spokesperson for the Secretary-General, told reporters in New York. The flotilla met Ms. Thunberg at the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, which links the New York City boroughs of Staten Island and Brooklyn. The boats accompanied her to North Cove Harbor in Manhattan to show appreciation and solidarity for her mission to mobilize support for action to achieve ,as well as the other 16 goals for a better world by 2030, unanimously adopted by world leaders at the UN in 2015. Transformative youth “Young people around the world are by all leaders”, said , UN Deputy Secretary-General. “They are leading the kind of transformative change needed to drastically reduce carbon emissions to protect our planet and ensure the wellbeing of people,” Warning that “time is running out”, Ms. Mohammed affirmed that the UN is “proud to host hundreds of young activists and leaders, including Greta, who are answering the Secretary-General’s call to bring solutions to the and the Summits”. “Our individual and collective actions will transform our world, save lives and ensure a life of dignity for all”, maintained the UN deputy chief. The Climate Summit aims to mobilize political and economic ambition at the highest levels to advance climate action and enable many of the for Sustainable Development. A teen’s climate action mission Stepping onto dry land for the first time in two weeks, Ms. Thunburg said at a press conference: “I would love not to have to do this and just go to school, but… I want to make a difference”. Pointing to “the older generation” as causing the climate crisis, she stated that they “should not be saying to us ‘be a normal kid’ [because] we are just trying to clean up after them.” The young environmental campaigner has been captivating people around the world since she waged a one-girl ‘school strike’ for climate action last August. At that time, the then 15-year old stood by herself in front of the Swedish Parliament with a demonstration sign, calling for bold climate action. As she began drawing media attention, other students followed her lead and began staging similar protests in their own communities.

394-> G20 told crucial COP24 climate change conference 'must succeed': Guterres
During press briefings at the beginning of the G20 meeting of industrialized nations in Buenos Aires, UN Secretary António Guterres described the event as an essential forum, citing a lack of confidence and high level of confrontation within the international community. As well as mistrust between nations, and the risk of confrontation and escalation, Mr, Guterres said that there was a lack of trust between peoples in general and institutions everywhere, both at a national level – in the form of governments and parliaments – and internationally; because globalization has divided the world into winners and losers. Those left out, he said, “feel angry, that feel frustrated, that many times…there was not enough effort from their government, or from international organizations like the UN, in order to attend their problems, to attend their difficulties in the rustbelts of this world. I think it is very important to come together, the different countries around the world, and to have a common strategy for a fair globalization, which means a globalization that leaves no one behind.” For this reason, the world’s largest economies, such as the G20 group, must support the UN’s for sustainable development, said the UN chief, which was developed precisely to ensure a fair globalization and aims to eradicate poverty and address a wide range of governance problems worldwide. 'Katowice must succeed' Mr. Guterres also pointed out that this year’s G20 meeting is important because it precedes the climate change conference taking place in Katowice, Poland from 3 December, at which the “Work Programme” or rule book of the 2015 – when practically all countries signed up to a pledge to ensure global temperatures do not rise by more than 2 degrees before the end of this century– is expected to be agreed. Addressing the media on Friday, the Secretary-General said that “Katowice must succeed. We need to build in Katowice the momentum that is necessary for an increased ambition to be shown by the international community…when in 2020 the commitments made in Paris will be renewed in order to make sure that we are able to bring the increase of temperature in the world until the end of the century to clearly below 2 degrees and as close as possible to 1.5 degrees.” “Political will is lacking,” said the UN chief. “That is why it’s so important to come here and to express to political leaders how important it is for everybody to understand that this is a make it or break it moment in relation to guaranteeing that the Paris Agreement is implemented."

395-> ‘At risk’ Mediterranean forests make ‘vital contributions’ to development
Between 2010 and 2015, forests around the Mediterranean have expanded by two per cent, but that has come at the price of significant degradation and increasing vulnerability to climate change, population pressures, wildfires and water scarcity, warned a new UN report launched on Tuesday. The , from the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) and environment agency , analyzes a wide range of political, economic, social and environmental issues in the region, which consists of 31 countries. “Mediterranean forests and other wooded lands in the region make vital contributions to rural development, poverty alleviation and food security, as well as to the agriculture, water, tourism, and energy sectors,” Hiroto Mitsugi of FAO’s Forestry Department and Elen Lemaître-Curri, of ’s Mediterranean Action Plan, said in the foreword. But forest degradation in the northern Mediterranean is being driven mostly by a lack of land management and wildfires, while forests in the south-east suffer from overexploitation for firewood, overgrazing and population pressure – potentially triggering a range of economic, social and environmental problems. For example, as trees try to withstand droughts, they deplete their carbon stores and produce less carbohydrates and resins, which are essential to their health. This has already led to a decline of oak, fir, spruce, beech and pine trees in Spain, France, Italy and Greece, and Atlas cedar trees in Algeria. "Mediterranean forests have long been adapting to pressures caused by human development,” said Mr. Mitsugi. “But never have these pressures been so extreme as they are now." The region includes more than 25 million hectares of forests and about 50 million hectares of other wooded lands, encompassing urban, rural and agricultural terrain. Forests also play a significant role in the ( ). Did you know? The report observes that forest-based livelihoods not only benefit local villagers but also contribute to national tax bases, and overall well-being. And while the Mediterranean diet and agricultural products are world-renowned, their survival depend on rural landscapes, resources and decent working conditions.  Moreover, Mediterranean coastlines host 30 per cent of all international tourists, with budding cities and megacities that continue to push population growth and economic activity, putting a strain on the area. As such, it is crucial that national and regional strategies better emphasize the role of forests and agroforestry. "In a context of rapid climatic, societal and lifestyle changes in the Mediterranean, forest and tree-based solutions are critical to the region overall sustainability, with an expected impact well beyond forested areas,” asserted Ms. Lemaitre-Curri of .

396-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Climate-proofing Timor-Leste
A new generation of green infrastructure which boosts the local economy, ensures water supplies and protects the environment is being built in Timor-Leste thanks to the support of the UN Development Programme (UNDP). A range of small-scale projects including new roads, bridges, drainage canals, irrigation and water supply systems, as well as flood protection structures, have been undertaken across the South East Asian island nation. Crucially, the infrastructure is able to withstand increasingly frequent extreme weather events like flooding and landslides which may be due to climate change. about what the UN is calling “climate-proof” infrastructure in Timor-Leste.

397-> Thai cave boys spared thundershowers, highlighting extreme climate disruption: UN weather agency
Thundershowers that have been forecast in northern Thailand luckily did not materialize, easing the extraordinary rescue of a boys’ football team and their coach, who spent well over two weeks trapped in a cave complex there, UN weather experts said on Tuesday. Clare Nullis, spokesperson for the World Meteorological Organization ( ), was speaking in Geneva amid reports indicating that all 12 boys and their coach had been freed in a daring rescue operation by a team of specialist divers. “It is the start of the monsoon season in Thailand,” she said. “I’ve been looking at the weather forecast there for Chiang-Rai, for the region, every day for the past week. Every day it has consistently shown the risk of thundershowers; now they haven’t, fortunately, materialized.” Commenting on several other extreme weather events around the world, Ms. Nullis noted that in Japan, flash floods across the country had claimed at least 150 lives, according to authorities, and that the toll “is likely to rise” in coming days. The situation is significant given Japan’s high level of preparedness against natural catastrophes, the spokesperson said, noting that around 10,000 houses have been inundated or destroyed by the worst flooding in decades. “Japan is one of the best prepared countries in the world when it comes to disaster risk reduction, disaster response — they are supremely well prepared,” said Ms. Nullis. “So, the magnitude of the casualties, of the destruction we are seeing now, really is an indication of just how big and how extreme this was and how heavy the rainfall was in such a short period of time.” Among the areas affected between 28 June and 8 July, West Japan and Hokkaido experienced record rainfall, the WMO spokesperson said, citing the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). This was caused by huge amount of water vapour from a stationary rainy front, in addition to damp air left over from Typhoon Prapiroon, JMA said. Elsewhere in Japan, a different weather system, Typhoon Maria, has hit the south-west Ryukyu islands. The storm has put nearby Taiwan, Province of China, on “lockdown”, the WMO spokesperson said, noting that at its peak in recent days, Maria had developed into a category 5 storm. Although it has weakened to a category 3 event, Ms. Nullis said that it is still capable of sustained winds of 175 kilometres per hour and gusts of up to 250 kilometres per hour. “Taiwan is basically in lockdown today and Taiwan is expecting really to take the brunt of this. The China Meteorological Administration has issued a red alert and is … mobilizing all its emergency response teams.” The west coast of the United States is also in the grip of “high-impact weather” systems, Ms. Nullis continued, noting record temperatures in downtown Los Angeles: “Los Angeles area just set a whole new string of temperature records last week,” she said. “Just for an example, 48.9° (Celsius), which is 120° Fahrenheit, in Chino, which is a suburb of Los Angeles; 47.8° in San Bernardino.” Turning to Europe, the WMO spokesperson told journalists that the agency’s Regional Climate Centre on Climate Monitoring, located in Germany, had predicted “a continuation of the drought situation and above-normal temperatures” of between 3° and 6° Celsius, above average. “Almost daily warnings about forest fires” had been issued, Ms. Nullis said, noting that it was “very unusual” for this to happen so early in the year. No specific event can be associated with climate change but current weather patterns are “consistent” with it, the WMO official said, citing “extreme heat, consistent heat, persistent heat and heavy precipitation”.

398-> UN ‘prioritizing needs’, ramping up aid, as Hurricane Dorian continues to batter the Bahamas
Renewed warnings of deadly destruction in the Bahamas caused by Hurricane Dorian have been issued by UN agencies and partners, who said on Tuesday that they’re worried “for every single” person on two of the worst-hit Caribbean islands. Briefing journalists in Geneva, Jens Laerke from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ) said that initial assessments from Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands - where the storm made landfall and is effectively stationary as of Tuesday morning, local time - were “rather catastrophic”. He added: “As we heard, it made landfall in the Abaco Islands; the population there is a little more than 17,000 people, we are concerned for all of them. It is now over the Grand Bahama, the population there is about 51,000 people and we are concerned for every one of them. The Prime Minister of the Bahamas has said already that five individuals have been confirmed killed as a result of this hurricane.” is at a standstill as it pummels Grand Bahama island. Now a category 3 hurricane, devastating sustained winds of 195 km/h, life-threatening storm surge will raise water levels 3 - 4.5 meters above normal tide levels, torrential rainfall.  Initially classified as a Category 5 hurricane at the weekend when it hit the Bahamas’ north-west with wind gusts of over 320 kilometres per hour, Dorian has now been downgraded two notches. But it still has the potential to be deadly, regardless of its rating, according to the World Meteorological Organization ( ). “It was the strongest on record to make landfall in the Bahamas,” said WMO spokesperson Clare Nullis. “At its peak it had maximum sustained winds of 270 kilometres an hour, which is absolutely huge, with gusts of up to 321 kilometres an hour. It’s life-threatening it’s devastating, it’s now weakened to the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. The winds are still devastating, the storm surge is still life-threatening and the rainfall is still torrential.” Confirming the widespread damage from the high winds and amid reports of storm surges between five and seven metres high, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that more than 13,000 houses had been severely damaged or destroyed - about 45 per cent of all homes on the two islands. “In terms of needs, we believe that Abaco Island has the most vulnerable population,” said IFRC spokesperson Matthew Cochrane. “There’s a large Haitian community on the island, who will need, we believe, a significant amount of assistance to recover from and rebuild after this storm. We also understand that about 62,000 people across the two islands will need access to clean drinking water.” Thousands will need food support Initial assessments carried out by the World Food Programme ( ) with the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA) and other humanitarian partners, indicate that Abaco will likely require food for more than 14,000 people and Grand Bahama for over 47,000 people. With a handful of specialized staff on the ground to provide support in food security, emergency telecommunications and logistics, WFP spokesperson Hervé Verhoosel said that they would support the Government of the Bahamas in “rapidly assessing the damage from the hurricane and in prioritizing needs” over the next three days. Meanwhile, in response to the “unprecedented storm”, the UN Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori, expressed her condolences to the people of the Bahamas. “This is the fourth consecutive year that we have witnessed an extremely devastating Atlantic hurricane season including Category 5 hurricanes like Dorian”, said spokesperson Denis McClean from the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), reading from a statement. “The sequence cannot be divorced from fact that these last five years have been the hottest ever recorded because of the continuing rise in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.” Storm shows ‘existential threat’ facing small island States Ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York beginning on 23 September, Mr. McClean insisted that Hurricane Dorian “crystallises the existential threat posed to Small Island Developing States (SIDS) by the ongoing climate emergency. This is an enormous humanitarian and development challenge for the Bahamas. Within the past few years, the Bahamas has been seriously affected by at least three major hurricanes, all Category 4 storms or above. The impact of hurricanes Joaquin, Matthew and Irma on the Bahamas has been reported to have cost approximately $820 million”, he said.

399-> Building climate resilience and peace, go hand in hand for Africa’s Sahel – UN forum
To build a sustainable peace in Africa’s Sahel region, “urgent attention” is needed to mitigate the effects of climate change, and ensure that communities have access to sufficient opportunities, a joint meeting between the United Nations Economic and Social Council ( ) and the highlighted on Tuesday. The Sahel region is characterized by a series of challenges, including rampant insecurity which remains prevalent and causes rising levels of human suffering and humanitarian needs. Some 4.9 million people have been displaced in 2018, a three-fold increase in less than three years, while 24 million people require humanitarian assistance throughout the region. “In order to achieve peace and sustainable development… we must tackle the root causes of conflict and crises,” Deputy Secretary-General in her opening remarks for the annual session of the Peacebuilding Commission, on Monday. “These are found in discrimination, human rights violations, weak governance, conflict, and the impact of climate change”. The Sahel is also one of the most environmentally degraded regions in the world with temperature increases projected to be 1.5 times higher than the global average. It is regularly hit by droughts and floods which have enormous consequences on people’s ability to earn a living and feed their families. The region consists of 10 different countries, totaling 300 million people. Currently, 33 million women, children and men are food insecure, while 4.7 million children under the age of 5 suffer from acute malnutrition. The Sahel is arguably one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change - Ibrahim Thiaw, UN Special Adviser on the Sahel “The Sahel is arguably one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change,” said , UN Special Adviser on the Sahel. “It is most likely the region with the largest number of people disproportionately affected by global warming”. “With rapid population growth estimated at 2.8 per cent per year in an environment of shrinking natural resources, including land and water resources, climate change in the Sahel can compound existing vulnerabilities,” stressed the President of , , as she opened the joint meeting on Tueday. “This risks generating new conflicts and forced migration, issues which already characterize the region.” “This situation requires our urgent attention,” she stressed. The watershed of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) issued in October notes that, in the Sahel, the risks associated with global warming – including food shortages – would be lower if the rise in temperatures compared with pre-industrial levels was contained to 1.5°C, as opposed to 2°C. “Climate change impacts around the globe – including, desertification, droughts, floods and food insecurity — all pose grave threats to generations of human and development gains,” said the Chair of the Peacebuilding Commission, . He noted that, together, ECOSOC and the Peacebuilding Commission can support local initiatives through coordination of policies, building partnerships, resource mobilization, and promotion of national ownership for projects implemented. The joint meeting included local leaders invited to present their climate action initiatives to address their insecurity challenges. “We are convinced that there are solutions, that with effort we can get out of this situation, and improve the current trends, because the youth that commit terrorist acts are often enrolled to do so, not so much by religious conviction, but due to a lack of opportunities, said Ahmed Aziz Diallo, mayor of the city of Dori, in Burkina Faso. “If a pastoralist can’t feed his animals because he doesn’t have food and he doesn’t have water, then he is going to look for other ways”. Mr. Diallo gave examples of actions taken in his town to mitigate the effects of climate change citing, among others, reforestation efforts, financial support to farmers, trainings for bee keepers, cross-border cooperation with other countries’ municipalities to implement common projects. He ended his statement with a plea: “I ask you to support our efforts, to support the work done in the field, to support the initiatives of the municipalities… because their impact is immediate given that they are implemented locally for the well-being of the communities”.

400-> Future of our planet hinges on action by today’s youth – UN deputy chief
Protecting the planet rests on this generation’s youth and their inclination “to hold leaders and decision-makers accountable,” especially in the combat against climate change, United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed told university students in China today.  “Do not take this planet for granted – it is the only one we have,” she said, addressing Tsinghua University students. She highlighted that the last three years have been the warmest on record, spotlighting signs of climate change such as more frequent and exceedingly intense natural disasters, and declines in food security and prosperity. The from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) makes clear that the pressure is on to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Neglecting to address these warnings signs means leaving the future vulnerable to competition over scarce resources, injuring economies, and creating “a fertile ground” for chaos. She turned to the younger generation for hope to protect the planet. “I am counting on young people like yourselves to hold leaders and decision-makers accountable to ensure a secure future for yourselves and future generations,” she told students. Praising collective action, she said the , a pact within the UN framework convention, known by the acronym , aimed to strengthen the global response to climate change, indicated a strong start for countries committing to lowering their emissions, and added that the Agreement’s potential has yet to be fully unleashed. Countries must raise their ambitions, she counseled, and implement their own national contributions, highlighting that China has done its part in deploying more solar and wind capacity than any other country in the world in the last five years. “We have all the tools we need to create a new reality and you are in a position to lead us with new innovations,” she said. “Let us join hands and use this as an opportunity to strive for a healthy, prosperous and sustainable future for all.”

401-> Small island nations in Pacific urge global action to fight climate change
Leaders from Pacific island nations addressing the United Nations General Assembly today urged Governments to implement the Paris Agreement, and contribute to fighting climate change and supporting sustainable development efforts. “Micronesia expresses grave concern that some countries have chosen to break with the international community and neglect the , contrary to all of the best scientific advice,” the country’s Vice President, Yosiwo George, said in the UN General Assembly Hall in New York. Agreed by 195 nations, the 2015 Paris Agreement seeks to combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future. Its main aim is to keep global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and to drive efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In addition to implementing the Agreement, Mr. George urged world leaders to support the which aims to finance “green” investments in developing countries. He voiced concerns about lack of ambition in face of mounting threats to the health of the oceans, urging a special provision to be created for small island developing states within the UN Law of the Sea Convention on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological areas. Fishing rights in exclusive economic zones are of particularly concern, Mr. George said, urging the international community “to remain steadfast in our efforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in all its forms.” Prime Minister Peter Paire O’Neill of the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, addresses the general debate of the General Assembly’s seventy-second session. UN Photo/Ariana Lindquist The head of Government in Papua New Guinea expressed similar concerns, noting that the global fish stocks are being “decimated” and “people are being forced to abandon their traditional homes because they have to jobs or food.” Peter O’Neill told the UN General Assembly that the problem of unsustainable use of natural resources is part of the bigger issue of climate change and its adverse impacts, which include seawater flooding in coastal communities, extreme tropical storms and severe droughts. “In Papua New Guinea, and around the world, our people are dying as a consequence,” Mr. O’Neill said. “Living standards are being eroded and opportunity denied.” “The world needs increased action now, to make further commitments to reduce emissions, and to help communities respond effectively to the climate change challenges,” he added. Noting the challenges facing refugees and migrants around the world, Mr. O’Neill also called for a “more sensible and humane” approach to mobility, noting that more people will be dislocated in the future by natural disasters and the loss of livelihoods. John Silk, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands, addresses the general debate of the General Assembly’s seventy-second session. UN Photo/Cia Pak In the same vein, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Marshall Islands underscored that the science behind climate is very real and urged that global confidence in the Paris Agreement must not waver in the face of any short-term challenges. “The Paris Agreement is only as strong as the political confidence which stands behind it – and it is beyond imperative that, even in these early moments, committed nations are starting the challenging task of pushing ourselves to do even more,” said Minister John Silk. In his address, the Minister also underscored the importance of the Sustainable Development Goal, and in particular, Goal 14, on the conservation and sustainable use the oceans, seas and marine resources. Also in his remarks, Mr. Silk expressed condemned the recent nuclear and missile tests conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), adding that he is appalled by the threat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific Ocean.

402-> Studying water scarcity trends, helping communities adapt can ease migration pressures, says UN agency
Water scarcity and poor access to safe water sources pose major challenges for two-thirds of the world’s population, the United Nations food security agency said Tuesday, warning that worsening shortages could soon force people to leave their communities. The worst impacted are those dependent on agriculture, explained José Graziano da Silva, the Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), noting that some among them, especially the poorest, may see no alternative to migrate and in search of better livelihoods. “ ,” he stressed. Exploring this intricate linkages in its new report, , the UN agency also found that full information on these dynamics is lacking for India, Central Asia, the Middle East and central Sahel – areas expected to be hit with above-average surface temperature increases and worsening water scarcity in the next 30 years. Furthermore, inadequate infrastructure coupled with rising temperatures, human demand (such as for agriculture, energy and industrial sectors) and greater rainfall extremes are expected to add to the water stress. “While some studies demonstrate a correlation between water stress and higher outmigration, the causal interaction is still not clearly understood,” states the report, underscoring the importance to ensure that the water scarcity and migration does not become a case of “mutual aggravation.” Adapting to water woes can help ease burden Better adaption strategies, including ones that account for climate change impacts, to mitigate the compulsion to migrate is therefore vital. “Analyzing water scarcity trends and engaging in preparedness are particularly valuable, allowing time to intervene to mitigate pressure for forced migration,” said Eduardo Mansur, a senior FAO official on water and land issues. “Enabling proactive adaptation is a more effective and sustainable strategy than offering a reactive humanitarian response in the face of large-scale distress,” he added. At the same time, the report also highlights that migrants can positively contribute to water management and development in both origin and host communities through good practices, skills and knowledge transfer, and the use of remittances. In addition, it also calls for increased attention to the concept of environmental migration as well as more data to understand and pre-empt trends in a timely way. The launch of the report comes ahead of the with observed annually on 22 March as well as the , currently underway in the Brazilian capital, Brasilia. The theme for this year’s World Water Day is ‘Nature for Water’ which exploring nature-based solutions to present-day water challenges.

403-> FROM THE FIELD: Plastic pollution choking world’s oceans
An underwater photographer’s chance encounter with a starving turtle led to a personal “awakening” about the dangers discarded plastic poses to sea life in the world’s oceans. In November 2017, Saeed Rashid from the United Kingdom was taking photos during a dive on a reef in the Egyptian Red Sea when he came across a female hawksbill turtle that had swallowed a plastic bag and was, as a result, unable to eat. The turtle probably mistook the floating plastic bag for a jellyfish which hawksbills typically eat. It is just one example of how discarded plastic items are choking the marine ecosystem. On , marked annually on 8 June, the UN and its partners are raising awareness about the destructive force of plastic pollution across the globe.

404-> World simply ‘not on track’ to slow climate change this year: UN weather agency
The world is heading in the wrong direction to slow climate change after another year of near-record temperatures, the head of the UN’s weather agency said on Thursday. “We are not on track to meet climate change targets and rein in temperature increases,” said Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ). We are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it –  “Greenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5 degrees centigrade by the end of the century. If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise will be considerably higher,” he said. Data from five independent global temperature monitors which formed the basis of the latest annual WMO report, indicated that this year is on course to be the fourth highest on record. Worryingly, the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years, with the top four in the past four years. “It is worth repeating once again that we are the first generation to fully understand climate change and the last generation to be able to do something about it,” Professor Taalas said. The WMO Secretary-General’s comments support the findings of another authoritative global body, The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ). In its report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, it concluded that the average global temperature in the decade prior to 2015 was 0.86 degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. 'Every fraction' of warming 'makes a difference to human health' Between 2014-2018, however, this average has risen to 1.04 degrees centigrade above the pre-industrial baseline, IPCC’s experts said. “These are more than just numbers,” said WMO Deputy Secretary-General, Elena Manaenkova, noting that “every fraction of a degree of warming makes a difference to human health and access to food and fresh water”. The extinction of many animals and plants also hinged on global warming, the WMO official insisted, along with the survival of coral reefs and marine life. “It makes a difference to economic productivity, food security, and to the resilience of our infrastructure and cities,” Ms Manaenkova said. “It makes a difference to the speed of glacier melt and water supplies, and the future of low-lying islands and coastal communities. Every extra bit matters.” WMO’s report adds to the scientific evidence that will inform climate change negotiations from 2-14 December in Katowice, Poland. The key objective is to adopt the implementation guidelines of the on Climate Change, which aims to hold the global average temperature increase to as close as possible to 1.5 degrees centigrade. This target is possible, according to the IPCC, but it would require “unprecedented changes” in our lifestyle, energy and transport systems. Highlighting the economic impact of higher global temperatures, WMO noted that many countries were increasingly aware of the potential problems. This included in the United States, where a recent federal report detailed how climate change is already affecting the environment, agriculture, energy, land and water resources, in addition to transport, people’s health and welfare. A just-published United Kingdom assessment also warned that summer temperatures could be up to 5.4 degrees centigrade hotter, and summer rainfall could decrease by up to 47 per cent by 2070. In Switzerland, famed for its mountains and skiing, national weather experts warned earlier this month that the country is becoming hotter and drier. In addition, it is expected to struggle with heavier rainfall in the future – and less snow. Check out ahead of the key COP24 UN climate change conference which starts this weekend.

405-> UN chief welcomes G20 commitment to fight climate change
UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, has welcomed the declaration released on Saturday at the conclusion of the 2018 G20 meeting of the world’s leading economies, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which reaffirms a commitment to raise ambition in the fight against climate change. The declaration notes a focus on four pillars at the meeting : the future of work, infrastructure for development, a sustainable food future and a “gender mainstreaming strategy” (assessing the implications for people of different genders of planned policies) across the G20 agenda. Mr. Guterres, in a statement released on Sunday, picked out three key messages from the statement: Agenda 2030 Support for the , the UN’s global blueprint for a fair globalization that leaves no one behind, is reaffirmed in the document, along with a pledge to use all policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Climate change As well as stressing the need to raise ambition in the fight against climate change, the G20 leaders express their very strong support of countries that are signatories to the , to implement their commitments set out in their nationally determined contributions. The G20 declaration states that the leaders look forward to “successful outcomes” of the climate change conference, which begins in Katowice, Poland from 3 December: the “Work Programme” or rule book of the – which, for the first time, brought almost all nations into a common cause to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects  –  is expected to be agreed at the event. Mr. Guterres pointed out that agreement on the Work Programme will significantly advance implementation of the Paris accord. Multilateralism In the declaration, said the UN chief, G20 leaders recognize the importance of a multilateral approach to trade and of the reform of the World Trade Organization, and renew their commitment to a rules-based international order. The Secretary-General concluded with a reminder that the G20 comprises the world’s leading emitters of environmentally harmful gases, and that the declaration provides hope for a solution to a global challenge that he has described as a : “these agreements by the leaders of the world’s 20 largest economies, which also contribute the largest share of global green-house gas emissions, can help rally the international community to make sure that climate change is a race we can win. Indeed, it is a race we must win.”

407-> INTERVIEW: 'We are in a very fortunate situation since the Paris Agreement was adopted' - UNFCCC Executive Secretary
The Paris Agreement on climate change remains a momentous diplomatic success, universally supported by all countries when it was adopted in 2015 at a United Nations conference, and as of today, it has been ratified by 141 nations, surpassing the threshold for its entry into force. The countries ambitious and inspiring commitments set out a global  action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change and  shape how our planet will look tomorrow, and what we are going to leave behind  for future generations. The United Nations continues to receive examples of innovative climate  action by governments, and over the past few weeks, for example India has  announced bans on highly polluting vehicles while new research showed that  solar power capacity globally grew 50 per cent in 2016, led by the United  States and China. This governmental momentum continues to be underpinned by companies,  investors, cities, regions and territories including now many major oil  companies who's CEOs have in recent weeks publicly spoken out in support of the . The UN framework support of the world's climate agenda continues to  encourage Parties to implement and achieve their aims and ambitions under the  Paris Agreement. Patricia Espinosa Cantellano of Mexico is the Executive Secretary of  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ). She has more than 30  years of experience at the highest levels in international relations, with a  specialization in climate change, global governance, sustainable development,  gender equality and protection of human rights. We have 141 ratifications, which is really unprecedented for any multilateral treaty like the Paris Agreement Definitely. We are in a very fortunate situation since the  Paris Agreement was adopted. We have now seen a really long list of countries  ratifying the Agreement. As of today, we have 141 ratifications, which is  really unprecedented for any multilateral treaty like the Paris Agreement. Only 16 months after its adoption, to have this really long,  long list of ratifying countries from all regions of the world is a very  encouraging sign. That means political support at the highest level is there;  and not only that but also businesses, groups of civil society, scientists – everybody  continues to be very active and engaged with the agenda that arrives from the  Paris Agreement.  Well, there are different conditions. I think  this is such a complex treaty that we need to be very mindful that it depends  on the situation in which each country is, and which steps need to be taken.  The first step needs to be the ratification. Secondly, we have different kinds  of degrees of activity. I would say some countries have immediately gone into  transforming their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions into Nationally  Determined Contributions. As of today also we have more than 130 Nationally Determined  Contributions, which are the national plans for implementing the commitments  under the Paris Agreement. Now actual implementation demands or requires the  participation of the private sector; requires the transformation of those  commitments into national development planning; into investment programs. So  these are the steps that need to be followed and there are different degrees  and different ways in which countries are doing it.  Well  the Paris Agreement sets a framework towards achieving that goal. This is the  goal. Why? Because this is the temperature that science has said that would  allow us to manage the needs of humanity with a healthy environmental  situation; environmental balance. So, what the Paris Agreement does is to put  it in a framework where we all need to strive to get there, and it also makes a  framework for countries to progressively increase their ambitions; their  commitments under the Paris Agreement, so that we can achieve climate neutrality by the middle of  the century, and then really have the possibility of, in the second part of  this century, get to this goal that has been established.  As  of today, with the science that we have, with the technological solutions that  we have and with the commitments that we have on the table, we're still not  there. But at the same time, what is very encouraging is that we have seen  transformations in terms of technologies, in terms of behaviours, in terms of  commitments by different actors; not only governments – national governments –  but also governments at the local level, so national authorities. We have seen  all these transformations occurring much faster than we were able to foresee  just a few years ago, so I think there are very clear signals that the trend is  correct and that we are making progress into that direction.     Climate neutrality means a situation where the world can  naturally absorb the emissions that will continue to be produced in our  societies. For instance, in terms of agriculture, we know that combating hunger  – ending hunger is one of the important (SDGs),  but it turns out that agriculture is a source of emissions – so that's one area  where we will not be able to dispose completely of emissions, so we need to  have a situation where our environment can absorb naturally those emissions. What are our natural resources to absorb emissions? For  instance, soils can absorb emissions; forests absorb emissions. The oceans also  have that possibility. Today, emissions are too high, so our environment is not  able to absorb all of them, so we need to get to that neutrality; that balance. We need to start with – or to accelerate as much as possible – the implementation on the ground  Well, at the international level, we need to do many things  simultaneously, and we cannot have the luxury of waiting until we have finished  one task to continue to the next. In terms of the negotiating process, we need to  finalize as soon as possible – at the latest in 2018 – what is known as the  Paris Agreement rule book, which are basically the rules which are needed in  order to make the Agreement operational. What are going to be the rules for  governments to report on the compliance of their commitments? What are going to  be the rules for giving developing countries support in terms of technology, in  terms of financing? These kind of rules need to be developed. At the same time, the Paris Agreement presents a very clear  roadmap towards higher ambitions. For instance, in 2018 we will have what is  called the facilitative dialogue, which will be the first assessment of how  much countries have made progress on implementation of their commitments under  the Paris Agreement. In order to be able to raise ambition, hopefully out of  that assessment we can identify where there are other areas of opportunity so  that they can raise ambition. On the other hand, we need to start with – or to  accelerate as much as possible – the implementation on the ground. So we need  to do actions in the area of transport, housing, and the energy sector. We need  to start getting to very specific plans and programmes, and very specific  investment plans as well.  Well,  at Marrakesh we had a first report on the road map to the $100 billion – which  is what has been included in the Paris Agreement – and from that report that  was done by the donor community together with the OECD [Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development], things look positively. Now, it is not  all of it that will come from public sources; we need to bear in mind that  private financing will really play an important role, and in this sense,  private investment will play a major role. So I think that of course while the $100  billion is a very important goal that was included in the Paris Agreement, we  need to know and we need to bear in mind that the transformation that is  required in our economies will demand much bigger resources.

408-> FEATURE: Relationship with ocean vital part of Trinidad and Tobago culture
Oceans comprise roughly three-quarters of the Earth’s surface and play an essential role in human well-being, producing half the oxygen necessary for life on the planet. They also serve as the backdrop for another important component of a well-rounded life: recreation. The multiple benefits provided by the world’s oceans, seas and marine resources are the focus of the first-ever taking place this week at UN Headquarters in New York. The Conference seeks to achieve the targets laid out under , including galvanizing action on ocean-related issues such as protecting coral reefs, reducing plastic pollution, and addressing the impact of climate change. Spending time beside, in, or on the ocean is a major reason why millions of people escape to destinations such as Trinidad and Tobago, an island nation in the southern Caribbean. The diversity of its people – mainly descendants of enslaved Africans and indentured workers from India, though indigenous Caribs, Syrians, Lebanese, Chinese and a smattering of other nationalities have added to the gene pool – is reflected in the marine and coastal environments, home to fish, sharks, turtles, manatees, mangrove, sea grasses, coral reefs and numerous invertebrates and other marine organisms.  Neila Bobb Prescott with the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) is the Chief Technical Advisor for a project that supports improved management of the nation’s forests and other protected areas, some of which are linked to the sea. She summarized the significance of the ocean to “Trinis,” as citizens proudly call themselves. “Oceans are part of what it means to be Trinidadian,” she told UN News. “We have rituals when your baby is born. There’s a specific time when you take them to the beach to dip their feet in the saltwater to kind of bring them to the age. When you’re ailing and there’s something wrong with you, you go to the sea for a specific purpose, and then you drink some of the salt water, too, if you have troubles with your stomach. So the sea is part of us in terms of our culture…it’s just part of us.” Naturally, going to the beach to unwind is also part of the culture, and citizens and visitors swarm spots such as Maracas Bay in Trinidad, famous for stands selling “bake and shark,” a fried fish sandwich that can be seasoned with an endless array of toppings. But for serious relaxation, people head for the sister island of Tobago, a 20-minute flight from the high-octane capital, Port of Spain. Tourism is the island’s mainstay, employing more than half the roughly 60,000 residents. John Arnold, Senior Tourism Coordinator in the Tobago House of Assembly, the local government, said ocean conservation is a given for a destination billed as being “clean, green, safe, serene.” While the UN reports that some 20 per cent of the world’s coral reef has been lost and another 20 per cent degraded, those in Tobago are still “fairly intact,” according to coral reef ecologist Neil Cook with the Environmental Research Institute Charlotteville (ERIC), recipient of a small grant administered through the UN Development Programme ( ).  World-class diving draws people to the sleepy village of Speyside, where Sean Robinson opened the first dive shop some 30 years ago. On a recent Saturday afternoon he was fresh from taking SCUBA enthusiasts into the emerald waters of a location known as the Cathedral, where they were greeted by “a beautiful eagle ray” along with barracudas and stingrays. “We here have been fairly lucky that the quality of the reefs has just about remained the same, but the challenges that we are getting now here in the environment is with this whole concept of global warming,” he said. “We are now getting a problem with something that is very strange, which is sargassum.” No doubt islanders will not soon forget the carpet of reddish-brown sargassum seaweed which fouled the Atlantic shoreline in 2015 and cost millions to clean up. Sargussum originates in a swirling section of the North Atlantic near Bermuda known as the Sargasso Sea, first identified by 15th century Portuguese mariners. It has affected other parts of the Caribbean, which is the most tourism-dependent region in the world, according to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ). Helping governments in 33 of the region’s countries to address seaweed infestations, and other challenges, is Julio Orozco, Director of Sustainable Tourism with the Association of Caribbean States (ACS), a UN partner. “Right now, we are trying to support projects that are taking care of all these problems that we experience in the whole Caribbean Basin like sargassum, like coastal erosion, which has been a very difficult problem with climate change,” Mr. Orozco said. “Since 2001, the Association has been promoting the Declaration of the Sustainable Tourism Zone in order that the countries, through specific destinations, can implement indicators of sustainability in order to protect their different resources: not only the sea, of course, but also fauna, flora and cultural resources.”  Back on Trinidad’s north-eastern coast, Stephen McClatchie has been calling for action to counter a problem affecting his village, Toco, situated at the part of the island that is physically closest to Tobago. As head of the group Stakeholders Against Destruction, or S.A.D., for Toco, he lamented the long weekend and holiday hordes who come to Salybia Bay to hang out, or “lime,” to use the local expression. “Imagine hundreds of people in a beautiful bathing area with no established facility for human needs,” he said. “When collectively that kind of behavior is taking place in an area like that, you understand the dangers to health, the damage to the environment, and for years, for decades, we have been pleading with the powers that be to do something about it, but very little or nothing is being done.” Weekend “limes” also sour the serenity of Las Cuevas Beach on the other side of Trinidad, which has received certification for its water quality from Denmark-based environmental group Blue Flag. It is among 17 beaches in Trinidad and Tobago where leatherback turtles, an environmentally sensitive species, come to nest.  Despite the accolades, veteran surf instructor Jonathan Torry, who is at the beach practically every day, still has to fish the odd beer bottle or other garbage from the sand. He believes surfers are just naturally environmentally conscious and protective of the ocean. “As surfers, we look forward to being on the ocean all the time. To us, it’s like heaven,” he said, the wind and waves drowning his words. “We cannot exist without the ocean. If we didn’t have the ocean and we didn’t keep it clean, to us, life would be very simple, very blah.” In February of this year, the UN Environment Programme ( ) launched the campaign to combat marine litter by reducing plastic production and use. It warned that unless people stop dumping bottles, bags, cups, straws and other plastic items, by 2050 there could be more plastic in the oceans than fish. Ocean stewardship is also a byproduct of sailing lessons at the Trinidad and Tobago Sailing Association, which uses Hart’s Cut Bay in Chaguaramas as a classroom. Students like Luke Frankland, 11, have already grasped the main message of SDG 14: life on land affects life below water. “I think we need to start recycling more and being more mindful of where we put our garbage when we’re done with it,” he said. “Some people just throw it on the floor when they’re done with it. They should put it in a bin, or, even better, recycle it. Almost always it ends up in the ocean. It harms us in some ways, but it harms the sea creatures more.”  Life lessons of a different kind are also being learned in the waters at Buccoo Point, Tobago, home to the Healing with Horses Foundation. There, children with disabilities, or who come from troubled homes, develop confidence and leadership skills by interacting with 11 rescued ponies, some of whom have challenges of their own. The therapy also involves riding bareback in nearby Buccoo Bay. “When we are with the horse in the ocean, the child feels not only carried by the horse but also carried by the water,” said German native Veronika Danzer-La Fortune, who runs the foundation alongside her Trinidadian husband, Lennox. “The water has a very soothing, calming effect. The water also helps the children to relax their muscles.” Healing with Horses Foundation has found a friend in the UN Information Centre (UNIC) for the Caribbean Area, based in Trinidad and Tobago’s capital, Port of Spain. In addition to participating in a summer camp in 2016, the UN office has supplied the organization with information about UN priority areas such as human rights, the rights of people with disabilities, autism awareness and, of course, the .

409-> UN agency develops new guidelines to help countries better monitor forest resources
The United Nations agriculture agency has created new guidelines to help countries develop a strong mechanism to monitor national forest resources. “The demand for reliable, up-to-date and more diverse forestry data and stronger analytical capacities at a national level has grown considerably in recent years,” said Eva Muller, Director of Forestry Policies and Resources Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ). “Understanding forest resources and how they change is key to address climate change and make progress towards the (SDGs),” she added. In 2010, only 45 countries worldwide were able to assess changes in forest area and characteristics through consecutive systematic national forest inventories, suggesting a serious gap in information. Moreover, it is likely that the data collected is incomplete. It is common for forest inventories to collect data on more than 100 variables. The aim to fill this gap, drawing on experiences and lessons learned from FAO member countries and FAO national forest monitoring projects, and provide good practices, and a framework and tools for planning and implementing multi-purpose national forest monitoring, she added.

410-> UN agencies join forces against environmental risks that cause 12.6 million deaths a year
Two United Nations agencies are combining their expertise to counter the growing threat of extreme weather, climate change and air pollution, which cause more than 12.6 million deaths a year, it was announced on Thursday. The legal agreement, signed by the World Meteorological Organization ( ) and the World Health Organization ( ) in Geneva, commits the agencies to protect communities using “relevant and authoritative” data on the weather, climate and atmosphere. spokesperson Clare Nullis said that there was a “lot of political will” between the heads of the two organizations – WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, and Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus – who shook on the deal on Wednesday after “decades of collaboration” between the agencies. In practical terms the arrangement will ensure a better flow of information between the agencies, Ms Nullis explained, adding that air pollution and UV forecasts from national weather centres, reach the health professionals on the ground “who are dealing on a daily basis, with the impact of environmental risks to health”. In a statement released on Thursday, said that the deal’s “overarching aim” was to promote policies and practices which are beneficial “both to public health and which cut greenhouse gases”. One of the initiative’s main targets is to prevent people dying prematurely from illnesses related to air pollution including strokes, heart disease respiratory conditions and cancer. Annually, an estimated seven million people die from air-pollution related diseases, WMO noted. The agency also highlighted the threat from climate change, noting that Hurricane Maria claimed 64 lives in Puerto Rico last September, only for new research to reveal that it actually led to more than 4,600 deaths, “because of a breakdown in healthcare, electricity and infrastructure”. ’s role in coordinating Member States’ seasonal rainfall and temperature forecasts will also help in the fight against many diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, which depend on these variables. Similarly, scientific drought predictions could help protect farming communities during the dry season, while extreme heat warnings are increasingly used to reduce the health impact of heatwaves. In its statement WMO noted that the plan is line with internationally agreed , and their focus on helping populations to implement disaster risk reduction measures and adjust to climate change. This involves placing “special emphasis” on reaching the most vulnerable populations in developing countries, Small Island Developing States and urban areas.

411-> Renewable energy sources could be cheaper than fossil fuels within 10 years – UN-backed report
A new United Nations-backed report has revealed overwhelming consensus that renewable power will dominate in the future, with many experts saying that even large international corporations are increasingly choosing renewable energy products either from utilities or through direct investment in their own generating capacity. “[The report] is meant to spur discussion and debate about both the opportunities and challenges of achieving a 100 per cent renewable energy future by mid-century,” Christine Lins, the Executive Secretary of Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21) – a global renewable energy policy multi-stakeholder network hosted by the UN Environment Programme ( ). “Wishful thinking won’t get us there; only by fully understanding the challenges and engaging in informed debate about how to overcome them, can governments adopt the right policies and financial incentives to accelerate the pace of deployment,” she added. At a press conference at UN Headquarters today, Ms. Lins said  that 2016 was the third year in a row where the global economy continued to grow, by three per cent, but emissions related to the energy sector decreased. And that was mainly due to renewable energy and efficiency investment in China and in the United States. “And so, we actually really see that renewables are, on the one hand making their way into the energy systems of many countries, but also we see that we have come a long way. We have a 20 per cent of the world’s final energy consumption nowadays coming from renewables,” she added. Christine Lins, Executive Secretary of Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century (REN21). UN Photo/Evan Schneider The also noted that more than 70 per cent of the experts expressed that a global transition to 100 per cent renewable energy is both feasible and realistic, with European and Australian experts most strongly supporting this view. The report also found that similar number expected the cost of renewables to continue to fall, beating all fossil fuels within the next ten years. Noting some challenges in achieving the 100 per cent transition, the report mentioned that in some regions, most notably Africa, the US and Japan, experts were sceptical about reaching that figure in their own countries or regions by 2050, largely due to the vested interests of the conventional energy industry. Also, the lack of long-term policy certainty and the absence of a stable climate for investment in energy efficiency and renewables hinder development in most countries, read the report. “When REN21 was founded in 2004, the future of renewable energy looked very different than it does today,” noted Arthouros Zervos, the Chair of REN21, adding: “at that time, calls for 100 per cent renewable energy were not taken seriously, today the world’s leading energy experts are engaged in rational discussions about its feasibility, and in what time frame.” The REN21 report is based on interviews with 114 renowned energy experts from all regions of the world. In addition to governments, REN21 also includes international organizations, industry associations, science and academia and the civil society, as well as UN agencies including the UN Development Programme ( ) and United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( ).

412-> UN experts urges Poland to ensure unrestricted ‘civic space’ during climate talks
Poland’s new law designed to address safety concerns during the United Nations climate change conference to be held there later this year could infringe on the privacy of environmentalists and curtail their rights to protest peacefully, UN human rights experts said Monday. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ) will take place in the southern Polish city of Katowice from 26 November to 16 December. “For the COP24 to be a true success, the Polish Government must do its utmost to prepare and hold the meeting in a manner that facilitates the climate change negotiations and also ensures that is free from undue surveillance and restriction,” said a group of independent UN experts in a news release issued by the organization's human rights office ( ). These experts – including Clement Nyaletsossi Voule, Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and Joe Cannataci, Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy – raised the issue, as the Polish Government briefed officials about COP24 at a preparatory meeting being held in Bonn, Germany. “All eyes are on the Polish Government to see how, as the host and the president of COP24, it will honour its human rights obligations and uphold its responsibility to ensure free and unfettered access for broader participation,” the experts said. Specifically, Article 17 of a new safety and security law appears to give sweeping surveillance powers to the police and secret services to collect and process personal data about all COP24 participants, and Article 22 appears to prevent spontaneous peaceful assemblies from taking place during the conference. The UN experts encouraged the Government to how the law might would be put into effect.

413-> Near-record warm temperatures fuel deadly, costly weather events in 2017 – UN
The upward trend in global temperatures marked by record-shattering warmth in 2015 and 2016 kept pace last year, with the United Nations weather agency warning Thursday that continued pressure on the Arctic in 2017 will have “profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.” “The long-term temperature trend is than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,” Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ) said. A WMO analysis showed that while measuring 1.2°C above the preindustrial era that 2016 holds the warmest year record, 2017, which measured approximately 1.1° C above the pre-industrial era, was the warmest year without an , which can boost global annual temperatures. Describing the accelerating pace of climate change as “an existential threat to the planet,” the Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, Robert Glasser, said, “A three-year streak of record hot years, each above 1° Celsius, combined with record-breaking economic losses from disasters in 2017 should tell us all that we are facing an existential threat to the planet which requires a drastic response. “We are getting dangerously close to the limit of the 2°C temperature rise set out in the and the desired goal of 1.5° will be even more difficult to maintain under present levels of greenhouse gas emissions,” he underscored. Recording the same global average temperatures, 2017 and 2015 were virtually indistinguishable because the difference is less than one hundredth of a degree, which is less than the statistical margin of error. “Seventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional,” Mr. Taalas pointed out, stressing: “Arctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.” The globally averaged temperature in 2017 was about 0.46°C above the 1981-2010 long-term average of 14.3°C – a 30-year baseline used by national meteorological and hydrological services to assess averages and variability of key climate parameters, which are important for climate-sensitive sectors, such as water management, energy, agriculture and health. Climate also has a naturally occurring variability due to phenomena such as El Niño, which has a warming influence, and La Niña, which has a cooling influence. “Temperatures tell only a small part of the story. The warmth in 2017 was accompanied by extreme weather in many countries around the world,” Mr. Taalas continued, saying that the United States had its most expensive year ever in terms of weather and climate disasters, “whilst other countries saw their development slowed or reversed by tropical cyclones, floods and drought. In March, WMO will issue its 2017 full Statement on the State of the Climate, which will provide a comprehensive overview of temperature variability and trends, high-impact events, and long-term indicators of climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, sea level rise and ocean acidification. The final statement will include information submitted by a wide range of UN agencies on human, socio-economic and environmental impacts as part of a drive to provide a more comprehensive, UN-wide policy brief for decision makers and the Sustainabel Development Goals (SDGs). Mr. Glasser expressed concern that climate change, combined with poverty, eco-systems destruction and inappropriate land use are pushing more people to leave home. “We need increased levels of ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions combined with concrete actions to reduce disaster risk especially in least developed countries which contribute little to climate change,” he underscored.

414-> FEATURE: Climate change and the world’s oceans
The vital link between oceans and climate change is among the issues at the forefront of discussions at the United Nations Ocean Conference taking place in New York from 5 to 9 June. The oceans, which cover three quarters of the Earth’s surface, play a vital role in the global climate system, generating oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Changes to the climate, brought about by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, will thus lead to changes in the oceans, including sea-level rise and ocean acidification, which will put marine ecosystems and coastal communities at risk. SDG 14 is the only universally agreed road map for conserving and sustainably managing marine resources World leaders acknowledged the importance of the oceans when they adopted the 17 (SDGs), the universal blueprint for ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. SDG 14 sets out specific targets to be met in order to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. “SDG 14 is the only universally agreed road map for conserving and sustainably managing marine resources. Its faithful implementation is therefore our best hope for remedying the ocean's woes,” Peter Thomson, President of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly.  Although the ocean is the single largest habitat on the planet and is inextricably linked to human survival, climate change and the impact of increasing carbon dioxide emissions on the oceans have been largely overshadowed in the climate change debate, according to Isabella Lövin, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, one of the co-chairs of the Ocean Conference. The oceans – which produce half of the world’s oxygen, regulate the earth's climate and temperature, provide food and water, and are home to hundreds of thousands of species – have been a staunch ally in curbing climate change. More than 93 per cent of all the heat people have added to the planet since the 1950s has been absorbed by the oceans – but at a price, Ms. Lövin . Rising ocean temperatures and increased acidification are now becoming apparent in melting Arctic sea ice and coral bleaching. Immediate mitigation, protection, restoration and adaptation actions are needed. “Whether on the coast or in the high seas far away from all, safeguarding biodiverse marine sites is vital for ensuring the sustainable long-term use of precious natural resources,” says Irina Bokova, Director-General of the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ).  The importance of the ocean to global climate cannot be underestimated, according to . It absorbs a significant portion of carbon and an overwhelming amount of excess heat. Still, warmer atmospheric temperatures and increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases exert an enormous pressure on the ocean's ability to regulate the climate. UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) helps in developing ocean sciences, observations and capacity-building to monitor the ocean’s major role in the climate system and predict ocean changes. Laying the ground for efficient climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, IOC focuses on the most damaging impacts, such as temperature increase, sea-level rise, storm variations and changes in marine biodiversity. Its scientifically-founded services help countries, particularly coastal and small island developing States, become more resilient to present and future climate impacts. The oceans are experiencing “major stress” from climate change, according to Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed. “Globally, the sea level has risen by 20 centimetres since the start of the 20th century, due mostly to thermal expansion of the oceans and melting of glaciers and ice caps. Some regions are experiencing even greater sea level rise. “General warming trends, massive episodes of coral bleaching, acidification and the sea level rise are affecting eco­systems in all regions, threatening fisheries, food chains and the oceans' ability to act as efficient carbon sinks.  “Warmer temperatures are causing more extreme weather events, and a projected two-metre rise in sea levels by the end of the century would be catastrophic for coastal habitats and economies. Hundreds of millions of people are at risk,” she . Particularly at risk are the inhabitants of small island States, with hurricanes, cyclones and tsunamis becoming increasingly more common threats. “Trouble for the oceans means trouble for people. Human well-being and health, economic prosperity, and a stable climate depend on healthy oceans,” Wu Hongbo, Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs and Secretary-General of the Ocean Conference. According to the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), losses due to disasters from natural and man-made hazards including floods, storms and the impacts of climate change are mounting, costing governments over $300 billion globally each year. UNISDR recently aligned its Disaster Resilience Scorecard, which provides a set of overarching assessments on disaster resilience, with the Sendai Framework – boosting the number of cities and towns capable of reducing their disaster losses by 2020 The effects of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, one of the leading causes of global warming, are felt most intensely in the Polar Region.  According to the World Meteorological Organization ( ), both the Artic and Antarctica are warming twice as fast as the rest of the world. Glaciers and ice shelves are melting and sea ice and snow coverage are shrinking. Polar wildlife ecosystems and indigenous population are already feeling the impact of climate change as polar conditions impact weather across the globe. “Because of teleconnections, the poles influence weather and climate conditions in lower latitudes where hundreds of millions of people live,” Petteri Taalas, WMO’s Secretary-General. “Warming Arctic air masses and declining sea ice are believed to affect ocean circulation and the jet stream, and are potentially linked to extreme phenomena such as cold spells, heat waves and droughts in the northern hemisphere.” With relatively little data available on the Earth’s Polar Regions, the UN weather agency kicked off of a two-year international effort to close gaps in polar forecasting capacity and improve future environmental safety. The was launched in May to close the gaps in polar forecasting capacity and improve predictions of weather, climate and ice conditions in the farthest reaches of the planet. The global campaign aims to minimize environmental risks and maximize opportunities associated with climate change in polar regions. Social scientists will examine how polar forecasts can be factored into socio-economic decision making while stakeholders in transport, shipping and tourism will provide input on community needs.   Tropical coral reefs cover a mere 1 per cent of the ocean but are among the most bio-diverse systems on the planet, supporting one quarter of all marine species. According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), coral reefs exist in over 100 nations, including more than 80 developing countries. They sustain human society through a range of ecosystem services, such as livelihoods and food security from fisheries; revenue from tourism; erosion prevention; and protection from extreme weather events through dissipation of wave energy. They also help to lessen inundation and damage during storms. Among the planet’s natural ecosystems, mangroves, sea-grass beds and coral reefs return the highest value in terms of ecosystem services. A square kilometre of healthy, well-managed coral reef can yield a catch of over 15 tons of fish and other seafood every year. Some 850 million people live within 100 km of coral reefs, deriving some benefits –with at least 275 million depending directly on reefs for livelihoods and sustenance. According to the UN Development Programme ( ), the planet’s freshwater and oceans are inextricably linked through the earth’s water cycle. The agency notes that 97 per cent of the world’s water is in the ocean and the ocean supplies almost all the water that falls on land as rain and snow. Of the small portion that is fresh water; about a third is in in the ground and a mere .3 per cent in accessible surface waters. Climate change scenarios project that discrepancies between water supply and demand will heighten. The frequency and severity of floods and droughts will likely change many river basins worldwide – with droughts causing significant socio-economic and environmental consequences. The UNEP estimates the cumulative economic impact of poor ocean management practices at minimally $200 billion per year. In the absence of mitigation measures, climate change will increase the cost of damage to the ocean by an additional $322 billion annually by 2050.  “In a world where demands for freshwater are ever growing, and where limited water resources are increasingly stressed by over-abstraction, pollution and climate change, neglecting the opportunities arising from improved wastewater management is nothing less than unthinkable in the context of a circular economy,” according to the UN World Water Development Report 2017, Wastewater: The Untapped Resource Weighing the linkages and significant socio-economic benefits of the earth’s freshwater and marine systems, UNDP underscores the need to take adaptive, integrated, ecosystem-based approaches to manage freshwater and ocean resources. As such, UNDP is assisting countries in equitably allocating water resources and implementing integrated management through adaptive water governance, which helps to reduce poverty and vulnerability, sustain and enhance livelihoods and protect environmental resources. Humanity owes much to the oceans in many aspects of life: providing invaluable ecosystems, climate regulation and cultural support to the millions of people who live near the sea, according to José Graziano da Silva, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ).  As 3 billion people ultimately depend on marine and coastal biodiversity, all nations agree on the need to step up efforts to protect oceans and seas, especially in the era of climate change, when transformational interventions are becoming even more urgent and encompassing. The oceans cover almost three quarters of the Earth's surface, storing one third of all the carbon emissions stemming from human activity. They are part of the solution, and they must be a key focus of global efforts to cope with and mitigate climate change, he . “Oceans play a crucial role in the achievement of global food security, as well as human health and well-being,” Miguel de Serpa Soares, UN Legal Counsel and Special Adviser to the Presidents of the Ocean Conference on oceans and legal matters. “They are the primary regulator of the global climate, function as an important sink for greenhouse gases, serve as the host for huge reservoirs of biodiversity and play a major role in producing the oxygen we breathe.” He adds that oceans, seas and marine resources are increasingly threatened by human activities, including increased CO2 emissions, climate change, marine pollution, unsustainable extraction of marine resources, and physical alterations and destruction of marine and coastal habitats.

415-> Disaster risk outpaces resilience in Asia-Pacific, warns UN regional commission
Disaster risk is outpacing resilience in Asia-Pacific and putting people in this most disaster-prone region at risk of being pushed back into poverty, the latest report from a United Nations regional commission has revealed. “Disasters can very quickly strip poor people of their livelihoods bringing deeply that push them back into absolute poverty or trap them in an intergenerational transmission of poverty,” said Shamshad Akhtar, Executive Secretary of the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ), as she launched the report in Bangkok today. Asia-Pacific Disaster Report 2017 shows that the greatest impacts of disasters are in countries which have the least capacity to prepare or respond to these events. Between 2000 and 2015, the low- and lower middle-income countries in the region experienced almost 15 times more disaster deaths than the region's high-income countries. Beyond the human costs, ESCAP research indicates that between 2015 and 2030, 40 per cent of global economic losses from disasters will be in Asia and the Pacific, while the region accounts for around 36 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP). The greatest burden of the losses as a proportion of GDP will be borne by small island developing States with average annual losses close to 4 per cent of their GDP while the least developed countries will have annual losses of around 2.5 per cent of GDP. Ms. Akhtar said that action on early warning systems is critical, and called for cost-effective financing that is needed to decrease the existing resilience gaps. “The absence of an institutionalized insurance culture and adequate post disaster financing threaten our extraordinary economic and developmental achievements. Promoting more, and deeper, collaboration among countries in the region on disaster risk financing will be an ESCAP priority,” she added. In recent months, the region has seen Typhoon Hato unleash large scale damage in Hong Kong, and Macau, that stretched all the way to Vietnam, along with torrential monsoon rains in Bangladesh, India and Nepal that claimed more than 900 lives and affected another 41 million people. ESCAP argues that measures for disaster risk reduction should take account of the shifting risks associated with climate change, especially in risk hotspots where a greater likelihood of change coincides with a higher concentration of poor, vulnerable or marginalized people. The report – presented at the opening of the ESCAP Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction during the first ESCAP Disaster Resilience Week – aims to assist policymakers, in both public and private sectors, to better understand disaster risk and take action in the context of the on Sustainable Development and the .

416-> UN chief Guterres highlights importance of sustainable energy in message to EXPO 2017
Underlining the importance of energy, in particular for realizing the Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called for urgent action to ensure that everyone has access to clean, affordable and efficient energy so that they can rise to their full potential. Underlining the importance of energy, in particular for realizing the (SDGs), United Nations called for urgent action to ensure that everyone has access to clean, affordable and efficient energy so that they can rise to their full potential. “Energy is vital to our lives [...] Access to energy helps children to study at night, farmers to grow more crops and hospitals to provide better care,” said the Secretary-General in his message to EXPO 2017, which opened today in the capital of Kazakhstan, Astana. In his remarks, the UN chief also noted that the theme of this year's Astana EXPO, 'Future Energy', is all the more important given that energy in today's world comes from many sources that contribute to climate change. “It reminds us that the world must take urgent action to ensure that everyone has access to clean, efficient and affordable sources of energy [...] I hope this EXPO will help us resolve to contribute to more sustainable world,” added Mr. Guterres. Being held from 10 June to 10 September, the World's Fair EXPO 2017 explores the possibility of scaling up the world's sustainable energy production, promoting energy security and efficiency, as well as encouraging the use of renewable energy around the globe. : UN Secretary-General's message to EXPO 2017 The UN exhibit, a particular highlight at the EXPO, showcases technology and ideas that help the implementation of the through sustainable energy. “Given the urgency of the situation, the focus is going to be squarely on practical solutions,” said Cihan Sultanoðlu, the UN , reminding participants of the simultaneous need to make sure every woman, every man, every girl, and every boy has access to affordable and clean energy by 2030, while keeping temperatures within 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Several UN entities, including the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ), the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), the UN Development Programme ( ), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ( ) and UN Children's Fund ( ) will host events, release findings and showcase their work on how to mobilize investments to achieve breakthroughs on universal access to energy, renewable energy, and energy efficiency.

417-> INTERVIEW: Achieving global development goals ‘inconceivable’ without reducing disaster risk, stresses UN official
According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR), disaster risk reduction is an integral part of social and economic development, and is essential if development is to be sustainable for the future. In 2015, for example, there were nearly 350 reported disasters, over 22,000 deaths, 98.6 million people affected, and $66.5 billion in economic damage. Over the years, disasters – including earthquakes, floods, droughts and cyclones – have not only taken a heavy toll on human lives, but have had an immense impact on development efforts owing to the enormous economic losses resulting from them. “It’s inconceivable that we’ll achieve the SDGs [ ] if we don’t get a handle on reducing disaster risk, including climate risk,” Robert Glasser, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said in an interview with . It is for this very reason that more than 5,000 participants, including policymakers and disaster risk managers, are meeting at the 2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction in Cancun, Mexico, this week to discuss how to curb economic losses from disasters. Established in 2006, the Global Platform is now the world’s foremost gathering of stakeholders committed to reducing disaster risk and building the resilience of communities and nations. Well we’ve seen over the past decades a huge impact of disasters on economic and social development. Not only have millions and millions of people lost their lives in disasters, but the economic cost of disasters in terms of foregone development opportunities has been absolutely enormous. Just to give you an example, for less developed countries, the average annual loss of disasters equates to something like over 20 per cent of their annual investment in social expenditure, in things like education and healthcare. So it’s a huge cost, conservatively estimated at something like $300-400 billion a year. So this conference on reducing disaster risk is a huge priority if we’re going to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Not only have millions and millions of people lost their lives in disasters, but the economic cost of disasters in terms of foregone development opportunities has been absolutely enormous. I think there are two main factors that increase the economic costs. The first is economic development that is poorly risk-informed… as an example, building hospitals in flood zones. As the economies around the world develop, as more and more infrastructure is built in areas that are susceptible to hazards, when these hazards strike, the damage goes up and increases. So economic development that is poorly risk-informed is clearly a cause of the escalating costs. The second factor is climate change, because we’ve seen over time the frequency and severity of hydro-meteorological disasters or hazards has been increasing dramatically over the past decades – exactly what you’d expect from climate change. And of course, these disasters, whether they’re extreme weather events, sea-level rise, drought, all of these factors are elements of disaster risk and of course are contributing to the escalating costs.  Well one thing the international community could do is probably the most critical… reduce greenhouse gases as quickly as possible because if climate change continues unabated, then our efforts to reduce disaster risk in other ways will be overwhelmed. So number one, reduce greenhouse gases. The second thing that countries need to do is to incorporate risk in core economic planning so that we don’t end up building this estimated $50 trillion of new investment in infrastructure over the decades ahead… we don’t end up building this infrastructure in ways that are contributing to risk, the hospital-in-flood zone example. And that means looking at both particular investments to reduce risk but more generally risk-proofing as much as possible all of the investments to deal with multi-hazard risk, including climate risk. So those are steps that need to happen as a matter of priority if we’re going to reduce the economic costs of disasters. ... if climate change continues unabated, then our efforts to reduce disaster risk in other ways will be overwhelmed. We will see parliamentarians. We will see mayors. We will see civil society; people with disabilities; the private sector has a fundamentally important role to play in disaster risk reduction and they’re extremely motivated to participate. I mentioned $50 trillion of new investment in infrastructure. Well over 75 per cent of that will be private sector investment, not government investment. So if we’re going to reduce economic costs, the private sector has an absolutely fundamental role to play. So we’re expecting 5,000 people, maybe more, in Cancun, Mexico, for the Global Platform and each of these groups will have a really fundamental role to play, including leaders and heads of State. I think if this is just a platform for exchanging ideas, it’s not worth it to have a meeting like this. One of the wonderful things about disaster risk reduction is that it is an extremely practical agenda and actually it has achieved a lot, even over the last ten years in terms of reducing loss of life from disasters, from the Hyogo Framework and now to the Sendai Framework. But this meeting is not about just exchanging ideas, although that’s important. This meeting will identify, will launch the monitoring framework for this global agreement and the seven targets member States have agreed to. There’s a whole process to monitor implementation, the global accountability for continuing to improve or reduce disaster risk. It will also include major commitments through the leaders’ forum, heads of State, heads of industry, private sector and others. It will include some major initiatives, including a major initiative on multi-hazard early warning that UNISDR is working on with the [World Meteorological Organization] and our colleagues at the World Bank to launch. And it will involve the science and technology community initiatives, and I mentioned the private sector a moment ago, and there’s a very fundamental role for the private sector where they are quite enthusiastically and dramatically looking at some major initiatives, including in the insurance sector, but in the other areas as well to reduce disaster risk. So this is very practical, it’s extremely important… and it will deliver some really significant economic outcomes that will continue the progress in reducing disaster risk.  There are so many wonderful examples and you know this is one area where it’s not necessarily the wealthy countries that have the best examples. Many of the examples are in less developed countries. You know people talk about the limitations of least developed countries and developing countries to move agendas forward but if we take Bangladesh for example, they have made such huge progress in reducing disaster risk through early warning, evacuation, storm shelters. There were some major cyclones that struck Bangladesh decades ago that resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being killed. There was a recent, relatively recent storm track and people were killed and the headline was, “hundreds of people killed.”     But the actual headline should have been, “hundreds and thousands of people weren’t killed” because that was the progress that has been made. So there are wonderful examples in Bangladesh. In India they’ve dramatically improved the early warning for disasters; in Mexico, during Hurricane Patricia, they evacuated millions of people. We’ve seen that in other countries as well. There are wonderful examples in the Pacific. This is maybe another example of best case – we have the Pacific Island countries agreeing to integrate disaster risk, climate risk and development into one framework which is world class, not surprising given that small and developing States are particularly exposed to hazards and climate change. So it depends what you look at but there are many examples of best practice, and not just in the wealthy countries. Actually, developing and less developed countries have made wonderful progress and have much to share with even developed countries. Well, I think for me it’s very hard to imagine achieving the SDGs without reducing disaster risk, and climate risk as a fundamental part of disaster risk, because as I’ve mentioned, these costs of disasters, the economic costs – you know $3,4,5 billion, we actually don’t know the annual costs because we just don’t have the data comprehensively, particularly for lower level disasters that are not as visible in the media and so on – but those costs are going up dramatically. So it’s inconceivable that we’ll achieve the SDGs if we don’t get a handle on reducing disaster risk, including climate risk. And similarly, another way of looking at this is to say, if we look at our humanitarian emergencies that are increasingly destructive and costly and you see that the international community is struggling to allocate funding to deal with these, if all we do is react, we will never be able to meet the need. I think this is why focuses on prevention, prevention of conflict and prevention of disaster risk. The only way we will ever get ahead of this curve is by focusing on prevention. And disaster risk reduction has huge returns on investment and ultimately will reduce the need for humanitarian response.

418-> E-Governance: A powerful tool to combat, mitigate and sustainably manage disaster risks
E-governance plays a critical role in building inclusive, resilient societies both before and in response to disasters, according to a United Nations report issued this week. The highlights the complex challenges and varied opportunities of deploying e-government services. Contributing to the global report, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ( ) highlights that the use of information and communications technology during all phases of disaster risk management presents “substantial opportunities to , enhance coping capabilities, and provide inclusive preparedness and response.” Several regional case studies illustrate that it is critical to integrate emerging innovations in digital technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), social media, space applications and geospatial information for e-resilience efforts. To ensure undisrupted services and information to citizens before, during and after disasters, the report also reiterates the urgency of embracing e-resilience in e-government initiatives. The findings and recommendations come against the backdrop of several recent disasters, such as landslides in Japan, an unpresented heatwave in Pakistan and monsoon flash floods in Bangladesh and India, all of which serve to remind us how disaster risk is outpacing disaster resilience in Asia-Pacific. As the Asia-Pacific region is among the world’s , governments have stepped-up disaster risk reduction efforts through digital connectivity and innovations. “Digitally-driven emerging frontier technologies, such as AI, are expected to offer unparalleled levels of data availability, insights and coping capabilities to support countries address this formidable challenge and advance the implementation of the ( s), said . Broadband connectivity for all remains critical to the success of e-governance. Towards this end, ESCAP continues to support the Asia-Pacific Information Superhighway initiative to seamlessly increase the regional availability, affordability and resilience of broadband networks as a platform for e-resilience. Its implementation will be reviewed and discussed by countries and partners in Bangkok, from 27-28 August, followed by an ESCAP intergovernmental meeting of the Second Session of the Committee on Information and Communications Technology, Science, Technology and Innovation on 29 to 31 August 2018.

419-> Partnerships with civil society and youth ‘essential’ for a future that leaves no one behind: General Assembly President
Partnerships with civil society and youth are essential to achieving the goals of key UN-backed international agreements, such as the for Sustainable Development, and the on climate change, María Fernanda Espinosa, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, told delegates at the on Wednesday. Ms. Espinosa was speaking at the closing session of the event, which took place between 26 and 28 August in Salt Lake City, Utah, at which representatives from civil society and NGOs resolved to actively contribute to their communities to further the . Despite the many improvements made to people’s lives since the creation of the United Nations 74 years ago, too many still endure insecurity, said Ms. Espinosa. Inequality, and the negative effects of globalization, have led to a reaction against multilateralism, and a rise in racism, xenophobia and violence. “Every analysis shows that these challenges will not be addressed if we don’t work together. In our increasingly interdependent world, where shocks in one country can affect the lives and livelihoods of people across the globe, it seems clear that we need more cooperation, not less,” she said. Ms. Espinosa went on to praise the contribution made by civil society in shaping the work of the UN, stretching right back to its earliest days, from the recognition of the equal rights of women and men, to the progress made on children’s rights, indigenous rights, and on the rights of persons with disabilities. “I encourage you to continue to engage with your governments to ensure we use these opportunities to put us on the right path, and work in your communities on local solutions and initiatives that have the potential to be scaled-up and replicated.” In our increasingly interdependent world, we need more cooperation, not less.  The Assembly President also urged delegates to take forward the commitments outlined in the Conference outcome document which, she said, reflect a much-needed blend of individual action and responsibility, as well as transformative change at all levels of society. In the outcome document published on the Conference website, civil society activists underscored the need to understand cities and communities as central to the achievement of all the (SDGs), and highlighted the importance of inclusivity, peace, family, education, youth, and the empowerment of women and girls. Although the focus of this year’s Conference was ‘Inclusive Cities and Communities’, the outcome document recognized the interdependence of rural and urban prosperity, as well as the need to address the specific conditions of mountainous areas and small island developing States. Youth delegates focus on climate action The significance and potential of youth was also recognized in the outcome document, and young people played a major role in this year’s Conference. The activism of the youth groups present at the event was evident in the closing session, during which a separate outcome document, the Salt Lake City Youth Climate Compact, was adopted. The youth document contains several action points, from confronting policies that are harming the environment, to educating communities on the impacts of lifestyle choices, and prioritizing environmentally-friendly transport options, such as walking, cycling or public transport. The Compact declares that, with the world nearing the point of no return, from which life on the planet can recover, it is time for the youth to “unite in action against the climate crisis, harnessing their collective power to construct a future free of the devastation of the climate crisis”.

420-> CO2 emissions on the rise for first time in four years, UN agency warns
A released on Tuesday by the United Nations Environment Programme ( ) shows that global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions rose again during 2017 after a three year hiatus, highlighting the imperative for countries to deliver on the historic to keep global warming to below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The report comes just days before the key UN climate change conference known as , taking place in Katowice, Poland, with the agency urging nations to triple their efforts to curb harmful emissions. The report comes hot on the heels of the watershed Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) , released in October, which cautioned that emissions had to stop rising now, in order to keep temperature increases below 1.5°C, and reduce the risks for the well-being of the planet and its people. “If the IPCC report represented a global fire alarm, this report is the arson investigation,” said UNEP’s Deputy Executive Director Joyce Msuya. “The science is clear; for all the ambitious climate action we’ve seen – governments need to move faster and with greater urgency. We’re feeding this fire while the means to extinguish it are within reach.” Heat-trapping CO2 gas in the atmosphere is largely responsible for rising global temperatures, according to the overwhelming body of scientific evidence. UNEP’s 2018 Global Emissions Report, show global emissions have reached historic levels. Total annual greenhouse gases emissions, including from land-use change, reached a record high of 53.5 Gigatons in 2017, an increase of 0.7 compared with 2016. “In contrast, global GHG emissions in 2030 need to be approximately 25 per cent and 55 per cent lower than in 2017 to put the world on a least-cost pathway to limiting global warming to 2°C and 1.5°C respectively,” said the report. What’s worse, the report notes that there is no sign of reversal of this trend and that only 57 countries (representing 60 per cent of global emissions) are on track to bridge their “emissions gap” – meaning the gap between where we are likely to be and where we need to be. Increased emissions and lagging action means the gap published in this year’s report is larger than ever. UNEP stresses that while “surging momentum from the private sector” and “untapped potential from innovation and green-financing” offer “pathways” to bridge the emissions gap globally, the “technical feasibility” of limiting global warming to 1.5°C “is dwindling”. The authors of the report note that nations would need to triple their efforts on climate action without further delay, in order to meet the 2°C-rise limit by mid-century.  To meet the 1.5°C limit, they would have to quintuple their efforts. A continuation of current trends will likely result in global warming of around 3°C by the end of the century, with continued temperature rises after that, according to the report findings. “The kind of drastic, large-scale action we urgently need has yet to been seen,” said UNEP. The report offers concrete ways for Governments to bridge their emissions gap, including through fiscal policy, innovative technology, non-state and subnational action, and more. This ninth UNEP emissions report has been prepared by an international team of leading scientists, assessing all available information. “When governments embrace fiscal policy measures to subsidize low-emission alternatives and tax fossil fuels, they can stimulate the right investments in the energy sector and significantly reduce carbon emissions,” said Jian Liu, UNEP’s Chief Scientist. “Thankfully, the potential of using fiscal policy as an incentive is increasingly recognized,” said Dr. Liu, referring to the 51 initiatives already in place or planned across the world to charge for carbon emissions (called “carbon pricing”). “If all fossil fuel subsidies were phased out, global carbon emissions could be reduced by up to 10 per cent by 2030,” he added, explaining that “setting the right carbon price is also essential. At US$70 per ton of CO2, emission reductions of up to 40 per cent are possible in some countries.” The 2018 Global Emissions Report report adds yet another building block of scientific evidence to inform decision-making at the upcoming UN climate change conference – the COP 24 in Poland – which starts on Sunday and will last for two weeks. The key objective of the meeting will be to adopt an implementation plan for the 2015 .

421-> Threat of wildfires expected to increase as global temperatures rise – UN
The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) has warned that wildfires could become more frequent and more destructive as global temperatures rise and drought conditions plague many regions of the world. “Last year was the hottest year on record and was above average for the number of reported major droughts and heatwaves. This year we are seeing a similar pattern with new temperature records being set on a monthly basis,” UNISDR chief Robert Glasser said yesterday in a issued by the Office. He noted that a number of risk factors, such as lack of forest management, growth of urban areas in proximity to forests and human induced fires need to be addressed by disaster management authorities. “The most frightening scenario is when major towns are threatened as we have seen this week in the case of Funchal and Marseille,” the senior UN official added. According to UNISDR, firefighters on the Portuguese island of Madeira continue to battle wildfires that have reached Funchal, the island’s largest city, killing three people and destroying over 150 homes. The Government has also sought help to deal with nearly 200 fires on the mainland. Similarly, Around 2,000 firefighters have been battling 8,000 acres of wildfires in the French region of Provence. More than 10,000 people have been evacuated from the Rhone river delta area which has been affected by drought, and there had been concerns that one of the blazes was close to Marseille which houses a number of petrochemical plants. The fires are now reportedly under control but a high state of alert is being maintained. Meanwhile, wildfires continue to wreak havoc in Spain. Some seven per cent of the La Palma island, part of the country’s Canary Islands was “devoured” by a wildfire and wildfires have also spread across 9,120 acres of land in the northern Spanish region of Galicia, reported UNISDR. Additionally, UNISDR said that the Soberanes fire in northern California, near the Big Sur region, is now 50 per cent contained after growing to more than 67,000 acres. Some 4,800 firefighters have been deployed but 57 homes have been destroyed. The wildfire in the United States was caused by an illegal unattended campfire, added the press release. UNISDR also said that according to its Global Assessment Report, published in 2013, wildfires have a devastating impact on natural capital that has not be adequately accounted for, noting “Fires affect numerous ecosystem services including carbon storage, support to biodiversity, protection of water sources, reduction of soil erosion and land degradation and climate regulation.” It stated that such fires may be leading to a loss of ecosystem services in the range of $146 to $191 billion per year.

422-> INTERVIEW:  ‘Education has power to save lives,’ survivors say, ahead of first Tsunami Awareness Day
Ahead of the inaugural World Tsunami Awareness Day on 5 November, two survivors of the most devastating tsunami in recent history – a Czech supermodel and a member of the Spanish family featured in the film The Impossible (2012) – have joined the United Nations’ commemoration of the Day. “It’s like a concrete building, not water, falling on you,” Petra Nemcova, a 37-year-old fashion model and philanthropist, told the UN News Centre, describing the impact of the Indian Ocean Tsunami on 26 December 2004, which hit her and her partner in a bungalow on a Thai beach. There was no warning, she said. In seconds, the bungalow completely crashed and there was glass everywhere and they were trying to hold on for dear life. She almost drowned many times, but after holding onto a palm tree for eight hours, she was found by a Thai man who risked his life to save the lives of strangers. Her partner was a strong swimmer but the power of nature was too strong for anyone. Unfortunately, he was among the roughly 9,000 foreign tourists that perished in the disaster, which left more than 220,000 people dead. In that moment, I didn’t have a choice. But now I have a choice to help children “I’m happy to hear that finally tsunami has a dedicated international day to raise the awareness of the importance of early warning systems, education and preparedness,” she said, stressing that “the power of education is not just to transform lives but the power of education is to really save lives.” She said that there is usually time to evacuate in the wake of earthquakes. The 2004 tsunami took two hours to strike Thailand. “In two hours, you can save your lives if there is an early warning system and enough education.” “Time is of the essence here. There is no excuse for countries not to have an early warning system or education,” she said.  She defines herself as a supermodel, philanthropist and entrepreneur. Her tragic experience changed her perspective about life. While holding on to a palm tree, she heard children screaming. She couldn’t swim and help them because debris was around her. After half an hour she couldn’t hear their voices anymore, which meant that they couldn’t hold on any longer. “In that moment, I didn’t have a choice,” she said. “But now I have a choice to help children.” In 2006, she founded Happy Hearts Fund (HHF), whose mission is to rebuild safe, resilient schools in areas impacted by natural disasters. “I’m happy to announce that we have now rebuilt 150 schools in 10 countries,” including Thailand, Indonesia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, and Haiti. Ms. Nemcova said that tsunami awareness education should take place everywhere, not just in school, because everyone travels. She proposed “smart partnerships,” such as with airlines, which can introduce measures to warn passengers against disaster risks. Tomas Alvarez-Belon, now 20 years old, was only eight, when he, his father Quique, mother Maria and brothers Simon, five, and Lucas 10, were staying at a resort hotel in the Khao Lak region of Thailand. All survived and reunited. The story of his family was portrayed in the film, The Impossible. He was by a pool around 8 o’clock in the morning. “All of the sudden, the world started to shake, you don't understand what's happening. You suddenly see a black wall,” he told the UN News Centre. People imagine big waves they can recognize, but that was not the case. “A massive wall approaches so fast, and before you even understand what happened, you are being drowned or pulled into the water.” When he finally resurfaced, “you don't see the world, you see people floating, people screaming, you see torn buildings. It’s hard to recognize reality.”  As for , he said “it is important that the world can not only mark an occasion to remember the victims of the disasters that have changed the course of history, and the course of many of our lives, but also to raise the awareness that we can prepare better and can avoid future deaths.” “It's never easy to go back to the moment of a tsunami and what happened in the aftermath, but it is so important to get the message out,” he said, adding that he feels so fortunate to be able to share the story for a higher cause to fight for. When he tells his traumatic experience, there are two key messages he underlines. “First is the humanity of what we saw, how people helped each other anonymously – they did not have to be from the same country, from the same race, from the same religion. It was human helping human, and that is the core of my message,” he said. It needs to be a movement that is born here in the UN and then spreads to Governments, and then from Governments to their people “Second is that a lot of what happened on the day tsunami hit could have been avoided if the warning system had worked […],” he said, stressing that hundreds of thousands of lives could have been saved. Evidently, tsunami changed how he approaches nature. When he goes to a beach, he thinks about what the tallest building is around there and where he could evacuate. “It's not a human instinct to think that way because when you are on a beach, you want to have fun,” he said, stressing the need for local authorities to make visitors aware of tsunami risk. “People around the world look up to the UN as a voice of reason, impartiality and sanity,” said Mr. Belon, who is currently studying a B.S. in Science, Technology and International Affairs at Georgetown University. “It needs to be a movement that is born here in the UN and then spreads to Governments, and then from Governments to their people.” “We want to see concrete actions and we hope that the UN is the place where those actions begin,” he said. The tsunami experience has made him think deeply about what he wants to do with his life, how fortunate he is to be alive, how valuable each day is and how he needs to be dedicated to helping others. “At the core of it is the humanity that resides inside each of us,” he said.

423-> Runaway climate change still 'a real possibility': UN Secretary-General
Greater ambition, urgency and action are needed if we are to prevent ever greater climate-related crises, said UN Chief on Wednesday, at the launch of the 2018 report, at UN Headquarters in New York The document, published by the – a project comprising several UN bodies, and other institutions – finds that the benefits of smarter and clearer growth are significantly under-estimated, and that bold climate action could deliver $26 trillion in economic benefits through to 2030. Other benefits of switching to a clean economy include the creation of over 65 million new low-carbon jobs, and 700,000 fewer air pollution-related deaths. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Finance Minister of Nigeria and Co-Chair of the Global Commission, said that “policy makers should take their feet off the brakes, send a clear signal that the new growth story is here and that it comes with exciting economic and market opportunities. $26 trillion and a more sustainable planet are on offer if we act decisively now.” Speaking at the launch, Secretary-General Guterres said that momentum for climate action is growing every day, with over 130 of the world’s most influential companies now committed to using only renewable energy, fossil fuel-dependent countries looking to diversify, and over 250 investors with $28 trillion in managed assets signing on to the . Shifting to a sustainable growth path has many other benefits. Climate resilient water supply and sanitation could save the lives of more than 360,000 infants every year, restoring degraded lands means better lives for farmers, and clean air has vast benefits for public health. Mr. Guterres that clean energy systems help developing countries, where over 1 billion people still do not have access to electricity,” adding that “it can help deliver access to energy to the one billion people who currently lack electricity. For example, Bangladesh has installed more than four million solar home systems. This has created more than 115,000 jobs and saved rural households over $400 million dollars in polluting fuels.” said “we know we are grossly underestimating the benefits of this new growth story. And further, it becomes ever more clear that the risks of the damage from climate change are immense, and tipping points, irreversibilities, getting ever closer.” Underlining the risks faced by the world, the UN chief said that climate change is “running faster than we are”, and that women, the poorest and the most vulnerable are hit first and worst by storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising seas. Mr. Guterres reminded those present that the last 19 years included 18 of the warmest on record, that greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere continue to rise, and that there is still a significant gap between national commitments to lower emissions, and actual reductions. The Secretary-General told those present that climate change will be high on the agenda of the 2018 opening session of the General Assembly, as part of efforts to galvanise action ahead of the milestone 2020 meeting of parties to the 2015 .

424-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: Chocolate, a sweet success in Guatemala
The reintroduction of smallholder cocoa production in Guatemala is addressing both economic and environmental problems brought on by climate change, thanks to support provided by the UN Development Programme ( ). The cultivation of the plant, which is indigenous to Central America, has been replaced in recent years by cash crops such as sugarcane and rubber, as well as widespread cattle rangeland. The move to a more industrial agriculture has had serious consequences for natural ecosystems in Guatemala, but now smallholder farmers are being encouraged by the UN to replant cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, as a way to stabilize the land and provide a good income. about the cocoa farmers of Guatemala.

425-> Help build vulnerable island States’ resilience to extreme weather, urges senior UN official
With Small Island Developing States (SIDS) bearing the brunt of economic losses from climate change, making them more resilient to extreme weather events must be a priority, said Inga Rhonda King, President of the UN Economic and Social Council ( ), speaking at UN Headquarters in New York on Tuesday. Ms. King was speaking alongside Louis Alfonso De Alba, Special Envoy for the UN , and a number of other senior UN officials at the meeting, a follow up to an event in October 2017 convened in the aftermath of devastating that had swept over the islands of the eastern Caribbean a month earlier, prompting UN to describe the island of Barbuda as “ .” Referring to the recent special report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), Mr. de Alba warned that the climate situation is not going to improve: “On the contrary it may worsen very quickly. And that’s why building resilience is an urgent matter, but Small Island Developing States find themselves in a very difficult situation, and that’s why we need to address these issues.” Greater investment in disaster risk reduction, recovery and reconstruction efforts and financing were identified as important steps in helping affected and vulnerable countries to recover and adapt to the consequences of climate change. With regards to the issue of financing, Mr. De Alba welcomed the mobilization of over $1.6 billion in reconstruction funds from across the Caribbean, with the support of the UN, but expressed concern that at least $1 billion in loans and debt relief need to be taken into account: he urged the international community to recognize the specific challenges faced by the region. Ms. King said that, between 1998 and 2017, the 10 countries most severely financially affected by climate-related disasters, in terms of the percentage of their gross domestic product, were small Caribbean countries or territories: Dominica’s losses after Hurricane Maria were equivalent to 259% of its GDP. Mr. De Alba reminded the delegates that, last year, thousands were made homeless, and key infrastructure for transportation, water, health, tourism, and education were devastated: “Between 70 and 95 percent of houses were damaged in Anguilla, the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos Islands, British Virgin Islands (BVI), Barbuda and Dominica,” he said. Tuesday’s meeting, said Ms. King, was an opportunity to make the case for vulnerability to be used as a criterion when deciding when countries get access to financing. Looking ahead to 2019, Ms. King noted several key events of particular importance to Small Island Developing States, including the (HLPF), the of the Secretary-General, the SDG Summit and the high-level mid-term review of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action ( ) Pathway.

426-> Mozambique: UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Orlando Bloom meets the child cyclone survivors who’ve lost everything
Visiting storm-ravaged Mozambique, UN Children’s Fund Goodwill Ambassador Orlando Bloom, listened to devastating stories of children who lost everything in Cyclone Idai, while observing on Thursday that UNICEF-built safe spaces have given them “a sense of normality”. During the week, the actor travelled to the coastal city of Beira, one of the areas worst-affected by Cyclone Idai, which killed over 600 people and destroyed nearly 240,000 homes when it made landfall in March. Sitting on the sandy floor of a tent at the Samora Machel site for internally displaced people, named after the country’s founding president, Mr. Bloom listened to children recount devastating stories of how they lost everything in the cyclone. PRESS RELEASE & MULTIMEDIA: Goodwill Ambassador visits children displaced by in   Thirteen-year-old Alzina Lopes described the moment Cyclone Idai made landfall, leaving her stranded in waist-deep floodwaters. Now she wants to go back to school, and dreams of becoming a traffic officer. “It’s remarkable to see children, who have been through so much, gain a sense of normality in the safe spaces set up by , where they are free to sing, dance, play and just be children,” said the Goodwill Ambassador. “These are children and young people with dreams, they want to be in school”, he continued “but almost everyone I’ve met here has lost their classrooms, their books and crucial identification documents due to the cyclones”. Mr. Bloom said that it was “heartbreaking” that without IDs “they are unregistered, almost invisible and vulnerable to exploitation”. In the aftermath of tropical cyclones Idai and Kenneth, 1.1 million children remain in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. UNICEF is supporting families affected by the cyclones to either return home or relocate to safer places. It is also providing healthcare, nutrition, education, sanitation and protection services. In the days following the storm, UNICEF and its partners restored water supplies to thousands of people in Beira and procured and administered one million doses of the cholera vaccine, curbing a large outbreak. At the Mutua resettlement area in the city, currently home to around 1,500 cyclone-affected people - half of whom are youth - Mr. Bloom danced and sang with young children and spoke to them about their hopes and dreams. The actor also visited a primary school in Beira, which the students themselves repaired after the cyclone. Wrapping up his trip, Mr. Bloom spent an afternoon with young volunteers at an interfaith group on the beachfront – a poignant venue, as the deadly storm barrelled in from the sea. They told him that the pain and suffering they saw after the cyclones, had strengthened their resolve to help others. “Thousands of children and families in Mozambique have seen their lives upended by these devastating cyclones and it’s going to be a long road back,” said UNICEF Mozambique Representative, Marcoluigi Corsi. “We’re working on the ground with our partners to help get children and their families back on their feet by providing support in healthcare, nutrition, education and protection”. Mr. Corsi pointed out that as part of the recovery effort, “we’re also trying to help affected communities become more resilient to future weather-related events that could happen more often because of climate change”. UNICEF has launched an appeal for $122 million to support its humanitarian response for children and families devastated by the storm and its aftermath in Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi.

427-> UN and African Union in ‘common battle’ for development and climate change financing
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has called for a “quantum leap” in funding for development and climate change for Africa, speaking to journalists on Monday, following the plenary meeting of the latest United Nations-African Union (AU) Conference, which took place in New York. Mr. Guterres declared that the Organization’s work to promote peace and security, human rights, development and climate action, can only progress in Africa if the UN works hand in hand with the AU. The UN chief emphasised the “alignment” between the UN’s and African Union’s respective plans to ramp up inclusive and environmentally responsible economic development: the UN’s for Sustainable Development, and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. The common battle they face, he continued, is to secure the necessary financing for development, particularly for Africa. Mr. Guterres said that development there is a “fundamental precondition” for a more peaceful world, and for well-managed migration, and, therefore, that improved funding is “in the interests of the whole international community.” With regard to climate change, the Secretary-General warned that more ambition is needed, because “we are not winning the battle,” and Africa is disproportionately affected: “the African continent practically does not contribute to climate change, but the African continent is one of the areas of the world where the impact of climate change is more dramatic and devastating.” A joint communiqué released on Monday by the UN and African Union welcomed the “strong cooperation and collaboration between the two organizations”, and committed to continue to work closely together in addressing peace and security issues, and achieving sustainable development issues in Africa. The communiqué described the , which will take place in September, as “critical to mobilize the needed partnerships, resources” necessary to achieve international climate action goals, and noted the agreement of the leaders of both organizations to further strengthen their cooperation on adaptation for climate change ahead of the Summit and beyond.

428-> Capacity of cities to tackle climate change key in ‘crucial battle’ for planet’s preservation, says UN chief
Cities – hubs of creativity and new ideas – can provide solutions to resolve humanity’s “suicide war” against nature, and lead the world towards a sustainable future, UN Secretary-General said on Saturday in Lisbon, which has been named the 2020 European Green Capital. Nature has responded to this “suicide war” many times, “as we have seen through hurricanes, fires, and severe drought in various regions of the world,” Mr. Guterres told the ceremony, at which the European Commision honoured Lisbon’s push for a green transformation that could serve as a role-model for other European cities. But the UN chief stressed that no matter how much harm we do to the Earth, “it will continue to spin around the sun for millions of years.” The real problem is that “humanity is destroying itself, and the possibility of being able to live on the planet,” he explained. Congratulations to Lisbon - Europe’s Green Capital for 2020. I’m very proud of the transformation my hometown has undertaken to become a more sustainable, inclusive and green economy. The future for all economies. Cities can be the basis of success against climate change Mr. Guterres emphasized that in the “crucial battle for the preservation of the planet, and above all, for the preservation of our presence in the planet” are two essential factors: the capacity of the cities and the European commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. Highlighting that cities have half of the world population, two thirds of the European population, and account for 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions, the Secretary-General said: “Cities can be the basis of our success.” As for the European commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, he stated that “our hope is that Europe will lead the example and convince other super powers to enter the right path to defeat climate change”. A New Year, a renewed push for sustainability In his remarks, Mr. Guterres also spotlighted 2020 as the year to make the fight against climate change more efficient. He identified three opportunities to start breaking the “cycle of war, which we are waging against nature”: The Secretary-General pointed out that these major events will take place during Lisbon’s presidency as the Green Capital of Europe, and at a time when three major battles are being lost: one million of the Earth’s species are at risk of disappearing; pollution is increasing, especially plastics in the ocean; more efforts are needed to ensure the is an effective tool to fight climate change. Looking ahead with hope The Secretary-General, however, expressed optimism because the international community knows what needs to be done. There is “no reason to continue to rely on fossil fuels,’’ when other technologies already exist. He also stressed that another hopeful development is the growing mobilization of youth who are demanding the “political will to drive these transformations.” “We see cities defending the environment, defending a green perspective and fighting against climate change,” he continued. Mentioning C40, the network of the world’s megacities committed to climate action, Mr. Guterres praised the cities that are the most determined to fight the battle against climate change. “Those cities are available to do everything that is necessary to guarantee that we can defeat climate change. The problem is that often governments [hinder] their action and the action of the regions in achieving a green economy, in leading an effective battle against climate change,” the Secretary-General added.

429-> FROM THE FIELD: Sourcing clean water in Ghana
Communities in northern Ghana are benefiting from the rehabilitation of water sources which is expected to boost livelihoods and build resilience against climate change, thanks to a supported by the UN Development Programme (UNDP). Around 50 per cent of the population in the north of the West African country does not have access to clean drinking water, leaving them vulnerable to illness and disease. But now the rehabilitation and construction of new boreholes and dams as well as irrigation systems in 50 communities is helping meet domestic water needs and provide innovative opportunities for growing crops in a region affected by climate change. One group of farmers has discovered a new crop which is boosting incomes. Read more about how fresh water is bringing fresh hope to some of the most vulnerable people in Ghana.

430-> Lesotho: Tens of thousands ‘one step away from famine’ as drought impacts harvests and UN launches flash appeal
Devastating drought in the southern African nation of Lesotho has left more than half a million people facing severe food shortages and tens of thousands “one step away from famine”, UN humanitarians said on Friday, in an appeal for funds. The $34 million flash will support more than 260,000 people “with lifesaving interventions” until April next year, Jens Laerke from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ), told journalists in Geneva. A total of half a million people – more than 1/4 of the population of – are facing severe food insecurity because of severe drought which has gripped the country. today launched a USD 34 million flash appeal to support Lesotho. “Most of the food insecure people are in rural areas and we estimate that at the peak of the lean season, which runs from January to March, some 71,000 people will face emergency conditions in rural districts. That is IPC phase 4 – one step away from famine,” the spokesperson added. Ten districts in the small landlocked southern African nation are already “severely food insecure”, according to OCHA, with rural smallholders worst-hit. Increasingly, women and girls “have reportedly left their rural homes to urban areas or South Africa in search of work, mostly as domestic workers trading sex for money or food” it warned. One worry linked to this migration is that Lesotho has the second highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, at more than one in four people. “It makes particularly women and children, girls in particular, very vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse,” Mr. Laerke said. Citing the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification food security assessments, often referred to by the acronym IPC, the spokesperson explained that the 2018/2019 planting season had been badly affected by late rains and scorching temperatures. And with forecasts indicating that Lesotho will receive below-average rainfall during the current 2019/2020 season – October to March - communities now face three back-to-back failed harvests. The most vulnerable are in Leribe and Maseru districts. More than 25% of the country severely food insecure Today, “a total of half a million people – that’s more than a quarter of the population of Lesotho…are facing severe food insecurity because of severe drought which has gripped the country at the same time as people are approaching the peak of the lean season”, Mr. Laerke said. According to OCHA, food insecurity levels are 64 per cent higher than last year, when the number of food insecure people was around 309,000 (257,283 in rural areas, 51,683 in urban zones). Highlighting the catastrophic impact of the extreme weather on harvests, Mr. Laerke said that overall cereal production had decreased by more than 60 per cent compared to 2018. Individual crops have suffered even greater losses, such as maize and sorghum, which respectively saw reductions of 78 and 93 per cent. “The Government of Lesotho on 30 October declared a national disaster and issued a drought response and resilience plan,” he said. “Our flash appeal will support that plan.” The UN appeal aims to conduct awareness-raising sessions and distribute life-saving information materials about risks of irregular migration, gender-based violence, violence against children, child marriage, trafficking in persons and how to report abuse. Lesotho’s $83 million Drought Response and Resilience Plan aims to help more than 508,000 people, including 68,250 children.

431-> Climate change: ‘A moral, ethical and economic imperative’ to slow global warming say UN leaders, calling for more action
It is nothing less than a “moral, ethical and economic imperative” to take more action to mitigate the existential threat posed by climate change, from across the United Nations system on Thursday. Calling on Member States to take “urgent action to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”, the leaders of more than 30 UN agencies and entities, issued a formal, joint appeal for governments everywhere to “step up ambition and take concrete action” ahead of the landmark , which has been convened by UN chief António Guterres this September. The appeal noted that to keep rising temperatures down, countries had to strive to "fulfil their obligations on human rights, including the right to health, the right to food security, the right to development, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women, intergenerational equity, and decent work and a just transition for all, as stated in the .” We call upon Member States to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020 -  As set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) , limiting global warming to 1.5°C “is necessary to prevent irreversible changes. Achieving this goal will require changes on an unprecedented scale at all levels, but it is still possible if we act now”, said the UN system-wide appeal. “With great urgency we call upon Member States to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020 and in support to the implementation of the .” The communique issued after consultations during a meeting of the , called on countries to ensure that appropriate “adaptation measures” are taken to protect people, jobs and ecosystems, “particularly people in those regions most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change including those at risk through forced displacement and migration.” Climate change is a race we can win, but we must step up ambition now. Today, the is committing to concrete steps and calling on countries for ambitious commitments ahead of our Summit in September. On the crucial issue of paying for the ambitious measures which need to be taken, the appeal described climate finance as "critical to deliver action on the necessary scale to address climate change…developed countries must deliver on the goal of mobilizing governments and the private sector to achieve the goal of $100 billion per year by 2020, to support climate action in developing countries and further enhance their efforts on scaling-up financial resources.” And in the race to innovate, the appeal calls for greater ambition, noting that “the Fourth Industrial Revolution offers tremendous potential for a paradigm shift to low-emission, climate-resilient development pathways.” The UN system is supporting “the enhancement of capacity of Member States to develop and utilize relevant data and technological innovations, to find solutions for climate and sustainable development challenges and disaster risk reduction and management, including the use of new and emerging technologies, including information and communication technologies, data and tools. And the UN is going to practice what it is preaching from the Secretariat and beyond. “We will present our system-wide efforts towards reaching climate neutrality in our internal operations by 2020 and enhancing environmental and social sustainability in all UN activities”, says the joint appeal.

432-> Ocean Conference has potential to be a ‘global game-changer’
The second global taking place in Portugal in a few months’ time promises to be “a critical moment” for the health of life under water and on land, the President of the UN said on Tuesday, as preparations got underway. “ ”, said . The ocean produces “half of the oxygen we breathe” and provides food for millions of around the world, playing a “fundamental role in mitigating climate change as a major heat and carbon sink”. The Ocean Conference, which will run in Lisbon from 2 to 6 June, aims to propel science-based innovative solutions in the form of global ocean action. The worldwide ocean economy is valued at around $1.5 trillion dollars annually, as aquaculture is the fastest growing food sector and 350 million jobs world-wide are linked to fisheries. “A healthy marine environment holds untold potential for achieving the entirety of the ”, he said. “Yet the unsustainable use – and misuse – of ocean resources, climate change, and pollution all threaten the ability of our ocean to provide for us all”. Boosting life under water In this first year of the and Delivery, acceleration is needed on the Sustainable Development Goal ( ) targets that are due to be met this year, two-thirds of which relate to the health of our environment. Mr. Muhammad-Bande spelled out: “We must reach several targets related to : Life Under Water…to reframe our understanding of nature as an accelerator for implementing the ”. Life under water and on land have a “symbiotic relationship”, he said, noting that “pollution hampers the ocean’s ability to provide for people”. He referred to last year’s ’s ministerial declaration calling for a reduction of single-use plastic products by 2030 as demonstrating “multilateral commitment to forging a better world” and maintained the importance of emulating this leadership at the Ocean Conference “to ensure that the declaration has a transformative impact on life under water”. Ocean health While coral reefs are home to a quarter of all marine life, half have been lost, adversely impacting global food security. And illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing further burdens ecosystems. Moreover, sea level rise induced by climate-change poses an existential threat, with small island developing States at the frontline. Remember that 3 key UN events—the UN Ocean Conference, UN Biodiversity Conference and —are all linked. They all relate to lowering carbon emissions, and we’ve got to make sure we build toward Glasgow to get the results we need. —    “We must stand with them in solidarity and support. This is for us all”, the Assembly President stated, further emphasizing improving ocean health as “key to safeguarding our future”. Transitioning to a green economy is “essential to protect our oceans and our world”, he said, recalling that next year marks the beginning of the . Sustainable use of the ocean , Special Envoy for the Ocean, and himself a former President of the General Assembly, outlined five major problems facing the oceans. Pollution – from plastics to industrial agricultural sewerage – and the sustainability of fisheries in the face of harmful practices, are both “eminently fixable by 2030”. However, more difficult to fix are problems associated with acidification, deoxygenation and ocean warming, all of which are linked to greenhouse gas emissions. “We find ourselves in a much longer fixing period when it comes to those three”, he said, noting that although they would continue for hundreds of years “even if we do the right thing tomorrow”, indeed we must start doing, so “we can start turning the corner”. ‘Positive tipping points’ Mr. Thomson urged everyone to focus on the “positive tipping points”, claiming they “are closer than you think”. These include “scaling up of science and innovation” and other solutions “that we will be concentrating on in Lisbon”, he elaborated. The UN envoy spoke about the “strong will” of developing countries to participate in sustainable agriculture, windfarms and the greening of shipping, stating that “we are now on the cusp of a great positive revolution”. Vicious climate crisis cycle And speaking at a press conference for correspondents in New York, UN chief highlighted the importance of oceans to the on-going climate crisis, and solutions to alleviate it. He that “as oceans warm, ice melts and we lose the vital service the ice sheets perform – reflecting sunlight, thus further increasing ocean warming”. And, as ice melts and the oceans warm, sea levels rise and more water evaporates, “fueling ever greater rainfall, threatening coastal cities and deltas”. The UN chief pointed out that last year, ocean heat and mean-sea level reached “their highest on record”, revealing that scientists now say “that ocean temperatures are now rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second.”

433-> Coal addiction ‘must be overcome’ to ease climate change, UN chief says in Bangkok
In Thailand for the ASEAN Summit, United Nations visited a climate mitigation project in Bangkok's new Centenary Park on Saturday where he told journalists that “coal addiction must be overcome”. The world’s addiction to coal “remains , warned  Mr . Guterres, adding that one of his  messages to the summit is that Southeast Asia is one of the most vulnerable areas to climate change”. Deeply impressed by the innovative project at Bangkok Centenary Park to mitigate floods by absorbing millions of gallons of rain water in this vulnerable city. Climate action is a global issue but cities should play a critical part. The UN chief informed the press of a recently published report saying that climate change was causing ocean levels to rise much faster than previously forecasted. “According to this new report, unless we are able to…defeat climate change, in 2050, the research has forecasted that 300 million people will be flooded by sea water in the world”, Mr. Guterres stated, and called climate change “the biggest threat to the planet at the present moment, [and] the defining issue of our time”. Pledging his commitment to raising global attention on the need “to abide by what scientists tell us is necessary to do”, he argued that that “we need to contain the rising temperatures 1.5 degrees until the end of the century” and “to be carbon neutral in 2050 and reduce the emissions by 45 per cent in the next decade”. “We have to put a price on carbon”, he continued. “We need to stop subsidies for fossil fuels and…the creation of new power plants based on coal in the future”. He also maintained that South East Asian nations must set an example, “to be in the front line of carbon pricing, of stopping subsidies to fossil fuels, and of stopping the construction of coal power electricity plants in order to be able to defeat climate change and to preserve the beautiful cities like Bangkok and others that we want as a legacy to humankind forever”.

434-> 2020: the year for action, to ‘rise up’ and safeguard ocean life
With the ocean in deep crisis, members of civil society and philanthropic organisations are urging governments and corporations to take bold action to safeguard the ocean.  After a two-day preparatory meeting in New York ahead of June’s UN Ocean Conference in Portugal, activists handed over what they termed “A Blue Call to Action” to the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, on Wednesday. Multiple stressors are eroding the ocean’s ability to function as the planet’s life support system, and so defending its capacity to produce oxygen, sequester carbon and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people is vital, delegates heard. The provides the air we breathe, the food we eat, yet we barely understand its mysteries. If we are to survive, there is only one way: we have to !  With that in mind, in May last year, the Oceano Azul Foundation partnered with Ocean Unite and Oak Foundation to bring together representatives of fisherfolk, indigenous peoples, ocean conservation organizations and foundations, to agree on common priorities and solutions needed to tackle the ocean crisis and raise the level of ambition for action. Gathering ministers and representatives from civil society organizations, the business community, intergovernmental and United Nations agencies, the preparatory meeting of the took place in New York this week, defining key areas of ocean action, and aiming to drive governments and other key decision-makers to deliver on their commitments. During the preparatory meeting, co-chaired by the Governments of Palau and Denmark, Tiago Pitta e Cunha, CEO of Oceano Azul Foundation, said that “the decisions needed to address the ocean crisis had been delayed for too long” similar to action on climate change. Highlighting the need to agree on concrete actions, he added that “now is the time to push tirelessly for such actions”. The , taking place in Lisbon from 2 to 6 June, aims to propel science-based innovative solutions in the form of global ocean action. ‘Take the momentum further’ According to recent data, the world has at most 10 years to win the battle to stay below the 1.5°C threshold above pre-industrial levels, and avoid the existential risks to nature and people that crossing it would bring. Briefing the press at UN Headquarters in New York on Wednesday, Ambassadors Ngedikes Olai Uludong of Palau and Martin Hermann of Denmark, emphasized that the conference in June was an opportunity to “take the momentum further”, the momentum achieved with the first UN Ocean Conference in 2017, and “drive a new chapter of ocean action”.  According to the group, “2020 is a huge opportunity for the global community to come together and raise the level of ambition.” , Special Envoy for the Ocean - who as UN General Assembly President, oversaw the historic first Conference - drove home the  importance of the UN , which is poised to strengthen the international cooperation and partnerships needed to develop the scientific research and innovative technologies for the wellbeing of the ocean. Also speaking to the press at UN Headquarters in New York, Karen Sack, President and CEO of Ocean Unite, added that “our ocean is essential to all life on Earth”, and called for more “ocean protection without delay.” Blue Call to Action / RISE UP targets:

435-> Extreme weather hit 60 million people in 2018, no part of the world spared
With some 60 million people affected by extreme weather in 2018, according to a new study, the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ( ) called for better management of the issue worldwide, in a statement published on Thursday. The study cited by the agency, from the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters ( ) –  showed that earthquakes and tsunamis claimed more lives than any other type of hazard, with over 10,000 lives lost in the last year; whilst floods, droughts, storms and wildfires affected more than 57 million. Floods affected the largest number of people – over 35 million – with 23 million in the Indian State of Kerala alone. Storms are expected to be the costliest type of disaster once final economic losses are compiled: the cost of the damage caused by Hurricane Michael, which inundated the eastern seaboard of the United States, is estimated to reach around $16 billion. 2018 was a record-breaking year when it came to wildfires, with the US experiencing its deadliest outbreak in over a century (it was also the costliest on record), and Greece suffering a record number of casualties from wildfires, with 126 losing their lives. As for drought, over 9 million people were affected worldwide, with the Kenyan population accounting for a third of the total, followed by Central American countries (2.5 million people), including migration hotspots Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.  The head of CRED, Debarati Guha-Sapir, acknowledged that the human impact of all disasters, particularly drought and extreme temperatures, is poorly reported, especially in low-income countries. Innovative approaches that measure progress and report on specific targets need to be urgently addressed by appropriate UN agencies, she added. Mami Mizutori, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction and head of UNISDR, said that, with time running out to limit global warming to 1.5˚C or even 2˚C, climate change adaptation needs to be a high priority, citing measures such as “reducing disaster risk in our cities, avoiding the creation of new risk by better land use, stronger planning regulations and building codes, safeguarding protective eco-systems, reducing poverty, and taking active measures to reduce exposure to rising sea levels.”

436-> Tropical Cyclone Idai affects 1.5 million across Mozambique and Malawi, as UN ramps up response
A major aid operation is under way in Mozambique and Malawi to help victims of Tropical Cyclone Idai, which has reached the densely-populated Mozambican port city of Beira, after registering maximum wind speeds of nearly 200 kilometres per hour, UN agencies said on Friday. Exceptional rainfall before the cyclone hit, has already affected a total of 1.5 million people in both Southern African countries and claimed more than 120 lives. The cyclone has now reportedly moved west, towards Zimbabwe. In addition, tens of thousands of people have been displaced and homes, roads, bridges and crops have been washed away, ( ) spokesperson, Hervé Verhoosel, told journalists in Geneva. “Tropical Cyclone Idai…has compounded destructive flooding that has already occurred as far inland as southern Malawi and eastern Zimbabwe,” he said. “The World Food Programme has been stepping up preparations to meet large-scale assistance needs.” The UN agency has already begun to assess the extent of the flood damage and prioritise needs among the most vulnerable, Mr. Verhoosel added. It is not yet clear how many people have lost their lives since the storm hit, although on 13 March, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs ( ) said that flooding had killed at least 122 people in Mozambique, where 66 are reported to have died, and Malawi, where the death-toll stands at 56. In issued on Friday, the António Guterres said he was "deeply saddened by the loss of life, destruction of property and displacement of people due to the heavy rains and flooding caused by Tropical Cyclone Idai." He extended condolences to the families of the victims. "The United Nations expresses its solidarity with the Mozambique authorities and stands ready to work with them as they respond to the humanitarian needs resulting from this natural disaster," he added. Casualty figures ‘changing constantly’ “We know already that some people sadly died in the past week and probably during the night,” Mr. Verhoosel said. “We don’t have any numbers to communicate for the moment as that number is changing constantly.” Satellite imagery shows that Malawi’s Chikwawa district has been particularly badly affected by flooding, while Mozambique’s Zambezia and Tete provinces have also seen tens-of-thousands displaced and more than 168,000 hectares of crops reportedly affected. “We expect that some of the zone will have difficult or no access at all,” Mr. Verhoosel said, noting that rising water levels on the Zambezi river will affect the many villages and small cities that line its banks and which rely on it for trade and transport. In Mozambique, help for people displaced by the flooding is being provided in 10 transit centres in Zambezia and two in Tete. A first round of needs assessments has been completed, but crucial follow-up visits have hampered by fallen powerlines, overloaded mobile phone networks and the fact that airspace is closed over Mozambique because of the weather conditions. In addition to helicopters already sent by the South African Government, WFP is sending at least one MI-8 transport helicopter to conduct emergency air operations in Mozambique. Its objective is to focus on remote locations that are likely to be cut off by floodwater “as soon as conditions allow, and air space is open”, Mr. Verhoosel said. Multiple dangers remain ( ) spokesperson Christian Lindmeier cautioned that multiple dangers remain. “Following the flooding which is coming with the rains, you have of course the risk of drowning and victims there, but you have also crush and trauma injuries through the flooding,” he said. “This is typically followed later by waterborne diseases and rise of airborne disease like malaria could also be expected.” Mr. Lindmeier added that there could be longer-term effects caused by damage to health facilities – “simple scenarios like assistance to pregnant women or deliveries, assistance to diabetes patients”, he said. Before Cyclone Idai hit, cited expert predictions that could be the strongest cyclone to make landfall in Mozambique since Tropical Cyclone Eline, which struck Mozambique in February 2000.

437-> Climate action: 4 shifts the UN chief encourages Governments to make
to young Māoris and people of the Pacific islands in New Zealand on Monday, UN said “nature does not negotiate” and emphasized four key measures that Governments should prioritize in order to reach carbon neutrality by 2050. : The clock is ticking for Pacific islands. Here are 4 shifts chief wants us to focus on: 1⃣Tax pollution, not people 2⃣No subsidies for fossil fuels 3⃣No new coal plants by 2020 4⃣Focus on a green economy More info ➡️  Acknowledging the role that youth needs to play in advancing climate action worldwide, he reminded the room of our common “central objective: not to have more than 1.5 degrees of increasing temperature at the end of the century. The international community, and especially the scientific community, has been very clear that to reach this goal we absolutely need to have carbon neutrality by 2050.” For this, he called on nations worldwide to make four pivotal shifts: 1. Tax pollution, not people The UN chief called for an emphasis to be placed on taxes on carbon emissions, known as “carbon pricing,” instead of being placed on salaries. 2. Stop subsidizing fossil fuels He stressed that taxpayer money should not be used to increase the frequency of hurricanes, the spread of drought and heatwaves, the melting of glaciers and the bleaching of corals. 3. Stop building new coal plants by 2020 Coal-based power is key according to UN-environment’s 2018 : all plants currently in operation are committing the world to around 190 giga tonnes of CO2, and if all coal power plants currently under construction go into operation and run until the end of their technical lifetime, emissions will increase by another 150 giga tonnes, jeopardizing our ability to limit global warming by 2°C as agreed upon in the . 4. Focus on a green economy not a grey economy “It is very important that around the world young people, civil society and those that in the business community have understood that the green economy is the economy of the future and the grey economy has no future,” said Mr. Guterres. “It’s very important that you convince governments that they must act because there’s still a lot of resistance,” he told the youth gathered in the room. “Governments are still afraid to move forward,” he deplored explaining that “they feel the costs of climate action forgetting that the costs of inaction are much bigger than any costs of climate action”. “Nature does not negotiate,” he added. “It’s very good to see youth in the frontline.” On 23 September, the UN chief is convening a to galvanize increased ambition for decisive climate action.

The world was off track in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals ( ) by 2030, even before the COVID-19 crisis erupted, but can get back on course by increasing investment in public services, showing solidarity on financing, and “reshaping” how people work, learn, live and consume. “We can turn this around, if we stay true to the ”, said Deputy Secretary-General , as she closed the High-Level Political Forum ( ) - an annual stock-take of the world’s progress in reaching the SDGs, but “the road ahead is now even steeper”, she added. During , we heard again & again a strong commitment to the . From Member States, civil society, experts and youth representatives, the message was loud and clear.   After eight days of discussions, she said the message is clear on the need for solidarity and foresight on financing, and greater investments in social protections, health systems, education, water, sanitation and digital connectivity. Staying true to the 2030 Agenda also means reimagining the way people work, learn, live and consume, and listening to young people, who are demanding justice and equality.  And it means investing in an inclusive, networked multilateralism, with the United Nations at the centre. “If we do all of this - consciously, concertedly, cooperatively - we can build a better world, our shared destination,” she assured.  All efforts must be made to step-up implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  “As an international community, we must rise to the test of this pivotal moment.” In the lead up to 2020 High-level Political Forum, have seen a 35 per cent increase in submissions and a 21 per cent increase in published actions, just within the last two months, featuring a total of 182 bold commitments in concrete terms to advance the goals that have been made by national Governments and other stakeholders. The Forum heard 47 countries present their Voluntary National Reviews (or VNRs), along with 150 speakers in the thematic sessions, including one Prime Minister and 31 ministerial officials, contributing online, representing all regions. “The 2030 Agenda remains our shared roadmap to achieve the future we want”, said Mona Juul, President of the Economic and Social Council, which hosted the two-week Forum. Stressing that should not change the commitment to “realizing the future we want”, she outlined areas for accelerated progress - first and foremost to advance human wellbeing.  Discussions centred on greater educational access for girls, which in turn, will reduce infant and maternal mortality. She highlighted the importance of creating integrated food systems to drive inclusive growth, agriculture, sustainability, and achieve zero hunger. Recovering better also means protecting the planet, she said, by addressing climate change and the “alarming” rate of biodiversity loss, land and forest degradation. 'New world of opportunities' Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy will be crucial to offering a “new world of opportunities” for billions of people, she said. In the area of urban development, she underscored the essential role of local governments in transforming global intentions into community action.  “All of our discussions have underlined that the recovery from COVID-19 represents a rare opportunity to shape a new normal”, she said.

439-> Humanity ‘at a crossroads’ as damage to planet poses growing risk to health, UN environment agency warns
Human activity is damaging the planet so badly, exacerbated by , that it will increasingly put our health at risk, warns a major report from the UN Environment Programme ( ), released on Wednesday at the , currently taking place in Nairobi. In a , UN Environment described the , which was produced by 250 scientists and experts from more than 70 countries, as the most comprehensive and rigorous assessment completed by the United Nations in the last five years. Unless environmental protections are drastically scaled up, the report says, there could be millions of premature deaths by the middle of this century, with pollutants in freshwater systems becoming a major cause of death by 2050. The science is clear. The health and prosperity of humanity is directly tied with the state of our environment   In addition, more chemicals, known as endocrine disruptors, will have an adverse effect on male and female fertility, as well as the neurological development of children. The UN Environment Assembly is the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment, where environmental ministers from around the world are meeting to tackle critical issues such as , accelerating the spread of , and the crisis of in the oceans. “The science is clear. The health and prosperity of humanity are directly tied to the state of our environment,” said Joyce Msuya, Acting Executive Director of UNEP. “We are at a crossroads. Do we continue on our current path, which will lead to a bleak future for humankind, or pivot to sustainable development? That is the choice our political leaders must make, now.” On a more optimistic note, the report makes clear that  the science, technology, and financing exists to move towards a more sustainable global economy, and ensure that the worst-case scenario is avoided, but political leaders, together with much of the public and private sector, is still wedded to outdated, polluting models of production and development. Ensuring a near-zero-waste economy by 2050 will require a new global business approach, and the report shows that “green investment” of just 2 per cent of countries’ GDP would deliver long-term growth comparable with a “business as usual” approach, but with fewer impacts from climate change, water scarcity and loss of ecosystems. As well as policy changes that address entire systems such as food and energy, the report advises the adoption of low-meat diets, and a big cut in food waste: these two measures alone would cut by half the amount of food we will need to produce in order to feed the projected 9-10 billion people on the planet in 2050. At present, the report states, a third of global edible food is wasted, and more than half of food produced in industrialized countries is thrown away.

440-> Voices of young climate action activists ‘give me hope’ says UN chief
In the wake of Friday’s demonstrations by schoolchildren across the world against climate change inaction, the has said he understands their fears, but is hopeful for the future. In a direct message to the youth activists who took to the streets, UN chief António Guterres said that he understood the anxiety and “fear for the future” behind their actions but added that “humankind is capable of enormous achievements. Your voices give me hope.” My generation has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change. This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry -  Writing in an opinion piece for The Guardian, Mr. Guterres said that the more he witnessed the “commitment and activism” of young people who were fed up with the pace of the international response to global warming, “the more confident I am that we will win. Together, with your help and thanks to your efforts, we can and must beat this threat and create a cleaner, safer, greener world for everyone,” he added. “These schoolchildren have grasped something that seems to elude many of their elders”, he said, adding that “we are in a race for our lives, and we are losing. The window of opportunity is closing; we no longer have the luxury of time, and climate delay is almost as dangerous as climate denial.” The Secretary-General acknowledged that his older generation “has failed to respond properly to the dramatic challenge of climate change.  This is deeply felt by young people. No wonder they are angry.” Global emissions are reaching record levels, and continuing to rise, he said, adding that concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is the highest it has been in 3 million years. “The last four years were the four hottest on record, and winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen by 3°C since 1990,” he added, noting also rising sea levels, the death of coral reefs, and a , as made clear in the UN’s , published this week. The historic 2015 signed by more than 190 countries to keep global emissions well below 2°C, “itself is meaningless without ambitious action,” said the UN chief. “That is why I am bringing world leaders together at a later this year. I am calling on all leaders to come to New York in September with concrete, realistic plans to enhance their nationally determined contributions by 2020, in line with reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent over the next decade, and to net zero by 2050.” The latest analysis shows that if we act now, we can reduce carbon emissions within 12 years and limit global warming to 1.5°” said Mr. Guterres. “But if we continue along our current path, the consequences are impossible to predict.”  “Momentum is building:, he added, “people are listening and there is a new determination to unleash the promise of the . The Climate Summit must be the starting point to build the future we need.”

441-> Build back better and preserve biodiversity after COVID-19 pandemic: UN chief
Recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic must also lead to countries uniting to preserve the natural world, in line with global commitments to achieve a better future for all people and the planet, top officials with the United Nations said on Friday, . In a video message for the day, UN focused on the symbiotic relationship between humans and all other life on Earth, stressing that preserving and sustainably managing biodiversity is necessary for mitigating climate disruption, guaranteeing water and food access, and even preventing pandemics. “ - which emanated from the wild - has shown how human health is intimately connected with our relationship to the natural world. As we encroach on nature and deplete vital habitats, increasing numbers of species are at risk. That includes humanity and the future we want”, he said. “As we seek to build back better from the current crisis, let us work together to preserve biodiversity so we can achieve our . That is how we will protect health and well-being for generations to come.” Fragile way of life threatened The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, provide a blueprint for global peace and prosperity by a deadline of 2030. They show why tackling global challenges such as poverty and inequality must be done in tandem with addressing climate change and preserving the natural environment. For the UN General Assembly president, the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified “the fragility of our way of life, our health systems and our global economy”, thus heightening inequalities and threatening the world’s most vulnerable communities. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande insisted that these issues are interconnected. He said hunger was already on the rise before the crisis, with more than 820 million worldwide not getting enough to eat. Food security was also being undercut by biodiversity loss, desertification and climate-related shocks, while one million animal and plant species are facing extinction. Nature has the solution With the pandemic as a backdrop, the International Day for Biological Diversity is being commemorated under the theme ‘Our solutions are in nature’. “Nature-based solutions have the capacity to protect, sustainably manage and restore both natural and modified ecosystems”, said Mr. Muhammad-Bande. “They can address the challenges posed by climate change, natural disasters, and food and water security.” Still time for action The General Assembly president stressed that there is still time to reverse biodiversity loss, but action must be taken now. He described the UN Summit on Biodiversity, due to take place for now in September, as “the key moment” to build political momentum. In the interim, the UN’s educational and scientific organization, , has been identifying solutions to ward against further species loss. Coronavirus Portal & News Updates  The agency is hosting a virtual meeting on Friday to share knowledge that has been developed across the world, including through its various networks and indigenous communities. “This disappearance threatens us directly: the living fabric that is biodiversity is not foreign to us; our food, health and well-being depend upon it”, said UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. “The pandemic must therefore compel us to think within this web of interdependence and to intensify mobilization, so that we turn away from the destructive trajectory we are on.”

442-> FROM THE FIELD: Liberia boosts efforts to guard against rising seas
With rising sea levels due to climate change already affecting coastal communities in Liberia, there are fears that densely populated parts of the capital Monrovia could be submerged, unless action is taken. It’s projected that a one-metre sea level rise could permanently inundate 95 square kilometres of land in Liberia’s coastal zone, which is already under threat of heavy seasonal rains and continuing erosion. What’s more, eroding infrastructure is causing massive repercussions for housing, education and livelihoods, with fishing chief among them. But the UN Development Programme ( ) has taken “28,000 steps in the right direction” during the second phase of its Coastal Defense Project to reduce vulnerabilities and build resilience. the full story.

443-> More funding needed to combat locust swarms ‘unprecedented in modern times’
Along with climate shocks, conflict and acute food insecurity, the East Africa region now faces a hunger threat from desert locusts, top UN relief officials warned on Tuesday, saying action now, will avert a major food crisis later. The locust upsurge is “a graphic and shocking reminder” of the region’s vulnerability, said from Qu Dongyu, Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ); Mark Lowcock, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator; and David Beasley, Executive Director of the World Food Programme ( ). “This is a scourge of biblical proportions”, the statement read. “Yet as ancient as this scourge is, its scale today is unprecedented in modern times”. East Africa is facing major threat from . The window of opportunity to help is still open & the math is clear: pay a little now, or pay a lot more later. is urgently asking for $138M to help governments control these devastating pests:  Growing plague Although the UN agriculture agency sounded the alarm in January, for financial assistance to control the outbreak, resources have been too slow in coming. Since FAO launched its first appeal to help what was at the time three affected countries, the locust swarms have moved rapidly across vast distances and as of 12 February, have been sighted in Djibouti, Eritrea, South Sudan, Uganda and Tanzania. Each day, more countries are affected. Last week, a swarm crossed into South Sudan, one of Africa’s most food-insecure and fragile countries. And just this week, one swarm reached the eastern boundaries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo – a country that has not seen a locust incursion since 1944. The potential impact of locusts on a country that is still grappling with complex conflict, displacement, Ebola and measles outbreaks and food insecurity would be devastating. Cost to combat swells As the locusts continue their invasion throughout eastern Africa, and more details emerge on the scale of need in affected areas, the cost of action has shot up to $138 million to support Governments in controlling the ravaging pests, especially over the next four months. The money would fund activities to combat the locusts before new swarms emerge, provide help for people whose crops or pastures are already affected and protect families and their livelihoods. Act now to avert food crisis Desert locusts have a reproduction cycle of three months. Acting now to avert a food crisis is a more humane, effective and cost-efficient approach than responding to the aftermath of disaster --  In just a few weeks, as crops begin to sprout, the next generation of locusts will take wing in a renewed frenzy of destructive swarm activity, threatening to devastate East Africa’s most important crop of the year.Today, mature swarms are laying eggs within vast areas of Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, many of which are already hatching. “But that doesn’t have to happen”, the UN leaders said. “The window of opportunity is still open. The time to act is now”. They maintained that action to control and contain the locusts before the new swarms take flight and farmers crops first break soil is “critical”. At the same time, FAO needs additional resources to immediately begin boosting the resilience of affected communities so they can better withstand some inevitable shocks. “Acting now to avert a food crisis is a more humane, effective and cost-efficient approach than responding to the aftermath of disaster”, the statement underscored. They welcomed the $33 million international donor response that has been received or committed. “But the funding gaps are clear, and needs are growing too rapidly”, they flagged. “We need to do more”. WFP has estimated the cost of responding to the impact of locusts on food security alone to be at least 15 times higher than the cost of preventing the spread now. It is time for the international community to act more decisively. “The math is clear, as is our moral obligation”, concluded the statement. “Pay a little now or pay a lot more later”.

444-> 24 billion tons of fertile land lost every year, warns UN chief on World Day to Combat Desertification
In a video message released in advance of the , marked on Monday, UN warned that the world loses 24 billion tons of fertile land every year, and that the degradation in land quality is responsible for a reduction in the national domestic product of up to eight per cent every year. “Desertification, land degradation and drought are major threats affecting millions of people worldwide,” said the UN chief, “particularly women and children.” Mr. Guterres said that it is time to “urgently” change such trends, adding that protecting and restoring land can “reduce forced migration, improve food security and spur economic growth”, as well as helping to address the “global climate emergency”.  ‘Let’s grow the future together’ The World Day, which raises awareness of international efforts to combat desertification, was established 25 years ago, along with the , the sole legally binding international agreement linking environment and development to sustainable land management. Running under the slogan “Let’s grow the future together”, the 2019 World Day focuses on three key issues related to land: drought, human security and climate. By 2025, says the UN, two-thirds of the world will be living under “water-stressed” conditions – when demand outstrips supply during certain periods – with 1.8 billion people experience absolute water scarcity, where a region’s natural water resources are inadequate to supply the demand. Migration is likely to increase as a result of desertification, with the UN estimating that, by 2045, it will be responsible for the displacement of some 135 million people.  Restoring the soil of degraded land, however, can be an important weapon in the fight against the climate crisis. With the land use sector representing almost 25 per cent of total global emissions, the restoration of degraded land has the potential to store up to 3 million tons of carbon annually. The importance of ensuring that land is well-managed is noted in the UN’s , which declares that “we are determined to protect the planet from degradation, including through sustainable consumption and production, sustainably managing its natural resources and taking urgent action on climate change, so that it can support the needs of the present and future generations”. Specifically, Goal 15 states our resolve to halt and reverse land degradation. What is desertification? ‘It isn’t just about sand’ In his message, , the Executive Secretary of the UN Convention, there are only three things all people need to know about the World Day to Combat Desertification: “It’s about restoring and protecting the fragile layer of land which only covers a third of the Earth, but which can either alleviate or accelerate the double-edged crisis facing our biodiversity and our climate,” he said. The international community, he continued, has acknowledged the central role our land plays in our lives and livelihoods, and since the creation of the Convention, some 196 countries, including Brazil, Indonesia, China and India, as well as the European Union, have signed up to coordinated actions for sustainable land management. “However, there are even more stories about how poor land management has degraded an area twice the size of China and shaped a farming sector that contributes nearly a quarter of all greenhouse gases,” he said, stressing that there are even more stories about how half the people on the planet are affected by that damaged land or live in urban areas, consuming resources that require 200 times as much land as their towns and cities and generating 70 per cent of emissions.  “Yet, the world is determined that by 2030, we will switch from destroying the Earth to making it productive enough to grow a better future for everyone. If we take action to restore our degraded land, it will save $1.3 billion a day to invest in the education, equality and clean energy that can reduce poverty, conflict and environmental migration,” noted Mr. Thiaw. And while, better land management does not hold all the answers, it offers a stepping stone to reach global goals by 2030 and then act as a natural multiplier of their benefits. “So, for this World Day to Combat Desertification, I am calling on everyone to drive this change from the ground up; to make choices and take action, either privately or professionally, as producers or consumers, to protect and restore our land. Let’s grow the future together,” he said.

445-> Artificial intelligence summit focuses on fighting hunger, climate crisis and transition to ‘smart sustainable cities’
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is at the forefront of fighting hunger, mitigating the climate crisis and facilitating “the transition to smart sustainable cities", said the chief of the UN agency which specializes in information and communication technologies, Houlin Zhao, kicking off the third in Geneva. “This summit is the leading United Nations platform for dialogue on artificial intelligence”, explained the Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union ( ) on Tuesday, adding that it “also raises complex questions about privacy and trust and poses other challenges, from job displacement and potential bias in algorithms, to autonomous weapons and social manipulation”. More than 2,000 participants from over 120 countries joined AI leaders and humanitarian actors to highlight its potential for advancing education, healthcare and wellbeing, social and economic equality and space research. 17 ways can help meet the for    Unable to attend in person, sent a message lauding "the promise" of AI while also warning against its potential dangers. "If we are to harness the benefits of artificial intelligence and address the risks, we must all work together – Governments, industry, academia and civil society – to develop the frameworks and systems that enable responsible innovation", he said. "These systems must be nimble and adaptable, capable of developing norms and self-regulation standards alongside legally binding laws and instruments when needed, as in the case of lethal autonomous weapons". Noting that the UN is "well placed" as a forum on "how best to guide progress to better serve humanity," Mr. Guterres underscored that "we must seize the moment, in partnership, to deliver on the promise of technological advances and harness them for the common good". In his opening address, Petteri Taalas, Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization ( ) spelled out that climate change is accentuating the need for tailored information to improve resilience to extreme weather events. “WMO deals with big data every day, running a 24/7 operational prediction system based on a huge amount of data gathered around the world,” he said, identifying AI as a potentially valuable tool to help meet this challenge. Deliver on the promise of technological advances and harness them for the common good –  Guided by its inter-disciplinary audience, this year’s summit aims to generate 'AI for Good' projects and ensure that associated technologies will be developed safely, allowing equal access for all. Francis Gurry, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) said that 340,000 AI patent applications have been filed since the 1950s: “Artificial intelligence is one of the most important of the technologies that are currently transforming our economy and society.” He acknowledged there were pressing economic, social and ethical questions surrounding AI, saying that “we are at an extremely early stage, but the common characteristic is that the underlying technological activity…is occurring at a much more rapid speed than our capacity to formulate” responses. Organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - in partnership with the XPRIZE Foundation, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and 37 UN entities - the summit, which will run from 28-31 May, aims to identify practical applications of AI to accelerate the . “We need to ignite a bigger conversation centered around how to use AI and data to help find scalable solutions to the biggest challenges facing humanity," XPRIZE CEO Anousheh Ansari said. It will also debate unintended consequences of the AI revolution, and propose actions for high-potential solutions in achieving global scale, along with a so-called “learning day” to offer an audience with leading AI experts and educators. “By bringing together AI technologists with leaders in government, industry, and humanitarian initiatives, new ways to apply AI to pressing world challenges are imagined and realized,” stressed Vicki L. Hanson, ACM CEO. What is clear to ITU chief Zhao is that “no one nation, no one organization, no one company and no one community can meet these challenges alone”. “The path to a transformative but also a safe, trusted and inclusive AI will require unprecedented collaboration between government, industry, academia and civil society", he concluded.

446-> UN allocates $20 million in emergency funding, as Cyclone Idai disaster unfolds
As the full scale of the devastation caused by Cyclone Idai in southern Africa continues to be assessed, the UN and humanitarian partners are ramping up the provision of emergency food, shelter, water and health care supplies to hundreds-of-thousands who have been affected across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund ( ) on Wednesday to ensure aid reaches those most affected. The cyclone made landfall on Thursday night near Beira City, in central Mozambique, bringing heavy rains and flooding to the three countries and forcing thousands from their homes. To date, it is feared that over 1,000 may have died in the disaster, with more than 200 confirmed dead in Mozambique, over 100 in Zimbabwe, and around 60 in Malawi. Hundreds are injured and many more unaccounted for. The cyclone wreaked havoc in Mozambique, the worst-affected of the three countries, causing damage to 90 per cent of Beira City. Inhambane, Manica, Sofala, Tete and Zambezia provinces have been heavily affected. About 400,000 are internally displaced. A national state of emergency has been declared. In Zimbabwe, the east of the country was particularly affected with close to 1,000 homes destroyed in the districts of Chimanimani, Chipinge, Mutasa, Mutare, Buhera, Chikomba, Gutu and Bikita districts. Through rapid needs assessments in Malawi, it is estimated that over 82,500 were displaced. These figures are expected to rise in the days ahead as the full extent of the damage and loss of life becomes known. “The funds will complement the three Governments’ immediate efforts to provide life-saving and life-sustaining assistance to affected communities, including in health, food security, protection, nutrition and education,” said UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock. “Vulnerable groups such as children, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with disabilities, and those affected by chronic illnesses will be prioritized”. The allocation will also help humanitarian organizations to rapidly support critical logistics and emergency telecommunications and scale up water and emergency health services to reduce the risk of vector and waterborne diseases. Mr. Lowcock explained that CERF funding was just the beginning, and much more will be needed, especially in terms of food assistance in the short- and medium-term as the flooding occurred in the middle of the crop-growing season. Much of the livestock is believed to have perished in the flooding, in areas that were already facing ‘food-crisis’ levels of food insecurity. The warehouse of the UN’s World Food Programme ( ) in Beira was by Idai, but some food stores remain intact and is being distributed to displaced people in the city and in Dondo, higher north. Twenty tons of high-energy biscuits have been airlifted in, to be distributed by helicopter in cut-off regions. WFP is also funding drones to support Mozambique’s disaster management agency, the INGC, with emergency mapping. To enable the humanitarian workers to operate, an emergency wi-fi connection was set up in Beira by the UN. The UN disaster and assessment coordination ( ) team was deployed to help coordinate the response, but access to affected areas is a major constraint in the delivery of aid, as much of the infrastructure such as roads and bridges were destroyed by the cyclone. “The situation is very bad. The damage is quite serious,” the head of the UN’s migration agency ( ) in Mozambique, Katharina Schnoering. “It Is very difficult to get a clear overview of what is going on. There are many communications issues, there’s no power in Beira. There is no road access because the Buzi River came up and washed out the road.” In Malawi, the representative of the UN Children’s Fund ( ), Johannes Wedenig, emergency supplies have started arriving in the country but that many were already “pre-positioned in areas of Malawi that are regularly affected by natural disasters”, allowing the UN to move quickly to meet people’s immediate needs, in particular in terms of water and sanitation, medicine, insecticide-treated bed nets, and schools supplies for the establishment of temporary classrooms.

447-> Green economy ‘not to be feared, but an opportunity to be embraced’ says UN chief as COP25 gets underway
A green economy is “not one to be feared but an opportunity to be embraced”, UN Secretary-General António Guterres , in a keynote speech to delegates at the opening of the COP25 UN climate conference in Madrid on Monday. The tasks are many, timelines are tight, every item is important Mr. Guterres outlined the work programme for what will be a busy two-week event covering multiple aspects of the climate crisis, including capacity-building, deforestation, indigenous peoples, cities, finance, technology, and gender. “The tasks are many”, he said, “our timelines are tight, and every item is important”. In several regions of the world, coal power plants continue to be built in large numbers. Either we stop this addiction to coal or all our efforts to tackle the climate crisis will be doomed. We need ambitious now. My remarks at :  The conference must convey a firm determination to change course, demonstrate that the world is seriously committed to stopping the “war against nature”, and has the political will to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, he continued. COP25 marks the beginning of a 12 month process to review countries’ “Nationally Determined Contributions” or NDCs (the commitments made under the 2015 ), and ensure that they are ambitious enough to defeat the climate emergency. Overcome divisions, put a price on carbon Encouraging signs of progress, noted Mr. Guterres, came out of the UN’s Climate Action Summit, held in September, which saw initiatives proposed by small island nations and least-developed countries, major cities and regional economies, as well as the private and financial sectors. The stated intention of some 70 countries to submit enhanced NDCs in 2020 - with 65 countries and major economies committing to work for net zero emissions by 2050 – while governments and investors are backing away from fossil fuels, were also cited as positive signs. The UN chief called for leaders to end division over climate change, and reach consensus on carbon pricing, a crucial tool for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Doing so, he said, will “get markets up and running, mobilize the private sector, and ensure that the rules are the same for everyone.” Is this the generation that ‘fiddled while the planet burned?’ However, failing to decide on a price for carbon will, warned Mr. Guterres, risk fragmenting the carbon markets, sending a negative message that can undermine efforts to solve the climate crisis. Throughout his speech, the Secretary-General was crystal clear about the urgent, existential level of the climate crisis. Failure to act, he said, will be the path of surrender: “Do we really want to be remembered as the generation that buried its head in the sand, that fiddled while the planet burned?” The signs of potential disaster are unmissable, he declared. For example, the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is comparable to that seen between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer than now and sea levels were 10 to 20 metres higher than today. Other indicators include the fact that the last five years have been the hottest on record, and have seen extreme weather events and associated disasters, from hurricanes to drought to floods to wildfires. Ice caps are melting at a rapid rate, sea levels are rising, and oceans are acidifying, threatening all marine life. Meanwhile, coal plants continue to be planned and built, and large, important parts of the global economy – from agriculture to transportation, from urban planning and construction to cement, steel and other carbon-intensive industries – are still run in ways that are unsustainable. “There is no time and no reason to delay”, concluded Mr. Guterres. “We have the tools, we have the science, we have the resources. Let us show we also have the political will that people demand from us. To do anything less will be a betrayal of our entire human family and all the generations to come”. Time for politicians to lead, not follow Speaking at a roundtable with Heads of State and government attending COP25, Mr. Guterres urged them to lead, and not follow, at a time when public opinion over the environment is evolving very quickly, and cities, regions and the business community are taking action to tackle the climate crisis. The Secretary-General reminded them that at the recent G20 meeting of the world’s leading economies in Osaka, a group of asset management companies, representing some $34 trillion dollars had asked political leaders to enhance climate action, end subsidies to fossil fuels, and put a price on carbon. The private sector, he added, is increasingly demonstrating a strong commitment to move forward, and complaining that it’s governments who are lagging behind: regulation is inadequate, fiscal systems are not favourable, subsidies are still going to fossil fuels, and companies face obstacles to climate action. With a head of steam building for action, it is for political leaders to “to be able to take profit of this movement and to lead, for us to be able to defeat climate change”. Climate crisis mostly affecting ‘those least responsible for it’ The Secretary-General also addressed a forum of “climate vulnerable” countries, where he pointed out the “great injustice” of climate change: its effects fall most on those least responsible for it. He cited examples, including Mozambique and the Caribbean, ravaged by storms that cause devastation, in terms of lives lost, communities uprooted, and economies crippled; and drought in the Sahel and the Horn of Africa. Nevertheless, some of the most vulnerable nations are in the forefront of climate action, showing leadership at September’s Climate Action Summit: Mr. Guterres expressed his hope that their example will be followed by the world’s big emitters.

448-> Failing to agree on climate action would ‘not only be immoral’ but ‘suicidal’, UN chief tells COP24
With continuing at the climate change conference over how to implement the  historic 2015 Paris Agreement, United Nations chief returned to Poland on Wednesday, to challenge the more than 100 Government leaders gathered in Katowice to find consensus and “finish the job.” “In my opening statement to this conference one week ago…I warned that climate change is running faster than we are and that Katowice must — in no uncertain terms — be a success, as a necessary platform to reverse this trend,” said Secretary-General Guterres. Since 2 December, the conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with one key objective: adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the , when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2°C – and as close as possible to 1.5° – above pre-industrial levels. To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal -  With only three days left at the conference for the negotiations, the UN chief regretted that “despite progress in the negotiating texts, much remains to be done”. On Wednesday, given the complex state of discussions, the Polish Presidency of proposed a text to act as a “new basis for negotiations”. “Key political issues remain unresolved,” said Mr. Guterres. “This is not surprising—we recognize the complexity of this work. But we are running out of time,” he warned, referring to the alarming issued in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ). “Over the last 10 days”, he said, addressing the country delegations which are locked in negotiations, “many of you have worked long, hard hours and I want to acknowledge your efforts. But we need to accelerate those efforts to reach consensus if we want to follow-up on the commitments made in Paris.” He called on negotiators to boost their ambition, with regards to “predictable and accessible financial flows for the economic transition towards a low-emission and climate-resilient world.” The Secretary-General reminded the audience that developed countries had a financial obligation to support the efforts of developing countries, as established by the UN Climate Change Convention ( ), under which the falls, and which was signed in 1992, more than 25 years ago. “It’s very difficult to explain to those suffering from the effects of climate change that we have not managed to find predictable support for the actions that must be taken,” he remarked. Mr. Guterres hailed various financial announcements made since the beginning of COP24, including by the World Bank, multilateral development banks, and the private sector. However, he urged developed nations to “scale up their contributions to jointly mobilize $100 billion annually by 2020”, as laid out three years ago in Paris. Balance the responsibilities 'of all countries' to beat climate change In addition to increased resources, the UN Secretary-General also called for the development of a “flexible but robust set of rules” to implement the Paris Agreement – as 2018 was set by the UNFCCC parties themselves, as the deadline for these guidelines, so countries can move forward with climate action in a transparent way. “Countries have different realities, different capacities and different circumstances,” noted the UN chief, as he explained that “we must find a formula that balances the responsibilities of all countries” and that is “fair and effective for all”. To achieve this, Mr. Guterres stressed the importance of building trust through a “strong transparency framework to monitor and assess progress on all fronts: mitigation, adaptation and provision of support, including finance, technology and capacity building”. The UN chief said we have the know-how, as well as “incredible momentum from all segments of society” adding that “what we need, is the political will to move forward”. “I understand that none of this is easy. I understand some of you will need to make some tough political decisions,” he acknowledged, “But this is the time for consensus. This is the time for political compromises to be reached. This means sacrifices, but it will benefit us all collectively.” Challenging the delegates and ministers to overcome their national preferences and work “together” and “finish the job” with raised ambition “on all fronts”, Mr. Guterres concluded: “To waste this opportunity in Katowice would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.”

449-> Preserving biodiversity vital to reverse tide of climate change, UN stresses on International Day
The food people eat around the world is becoming “alarmingly homogenous” according to UN data, even though access to a wide variety of nutritious food has never been greater. That warning comes as the world marks the International Day for Biological Diversity on Wednesday, which this year highlights the impact of environmental neglect on food security and public health. Biodiversity in plant and animal life in the world – in terms of species, habitats and genetics – leads to ecosystems that are healthier, more productive and better able to adapt to challenges like climate change, says the UN, and human activity is threatening the fate of species around the world like never before, according to earlier this month. The theme “Our Biodiversity, Our Food, Our Health” aims to leverage knowledge and spread awareness of how much all life depends on biodiversity. In his to mark the day, celebrated every 22 May, UN , notes that “the quality of the water we drink, the food we eat and the air we breathe all depend on keeping the natural world in good health”, also underlining that biodiversity was essential to achieve the 17 and to address climate change. Healthy ecosystems can “provide 37 per cent of the mitigation needed to limit global temperature rise”, he said, warning that the “current negative trends in biodiversity and ecosystems are projected to undermine progress towards 80 per cent of the targets for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We cannot allow this to happen." What is ? It’s the existence of many different types of plants and animals that makes the 🌍 a healthier and more productive place. We wouldn’t be able to survive without it! Learn more 👉    “The world’s current food system is increasingly broken.  Billions of people lack access to proper nutrition”, said the UN chief. “Approximately one third of what is produced is lost or wasted.  The ways in which we grow, process, transport, consume and waste food are leading causes of biodiversity loss, while also contributing to climate change.” Addressing the issue of deforestation, Mr. Guterres said it had caused the “loss of more than 290 million hectares of forests that help to absorb harmful carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere”. Mr. Guterres urged all governments, businesses and civil society to “take urgent action to protect and sustainably manage the fragile and vital web of life on our one and only planet”. Highlighting the galvanizing effect of biodiversity for human health and well-being, the Secretary-General stressed that “solutions exist”. “By halting environmentally harmful practices, diversifying our food systems and promoting more sustainable production and consumption patterns, we can improve global health, increase food security and strengthen resilience to climate change", he concluded. How can you help? By choosing to eat only seasonal and local produce, we can ensure that the demand for the right foods is high in the right season. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), more than 90 per cent of traditional crops have disappeared from farmers’ fields, while half of the animals bred by humans have been lost. All of the world’s 17 main fishing grounds are being fished at or above their sustainable limits. FAO also that agricultural biodiversity is fundamental for coping with a changing climate, and helping to remove carbon from the atmosphere, and securing the future of diverse sources of healthy and nutritious food.

450-> New UN forestry project bids to help countries meet climate change commitments
More than two dozen countries across Asia, Africa and Latin America are set to benefit from a UN project to help tackle climate change through better forestry management. Under the scheme, announced on Monday by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), 26 nations will soon be able to provide improved data on forest and land use – a key of all State signatories to the Accurate monitoring of forest and land use is essential if countries are to track progress towards the sustainability goals ( ) as they adopt climate change-mitigation and adaptation measures, FAO . “Forests are more than trees and fundamental for food security and improved livelihoods”, FAO said in a statement. “They contribute to resilience of communities by regulating water flows, providing food, wood energy, shelter, fodder and fibre, generate income and employment as well as harbour biodiversity. Furthermore, forests support sustainable agriculture and human wellbeing by stabilizing soils and climate.” ! & team up in a new $7.1 million project to make forest data more transparent, accessible and available. The initiative will help developing countries meet the 's enhanced transparency requirements. 👉   The $7.1 million initiative is being implemented by FAO and national officers, who already support 70 countries with forest-monitoring to ensure more sustainable land management. The data gathered on the status of the world’s forest resources is available via FAO’s ( ) reporting platform. Welcoming the launch of the project, Hiroto Mitsugi, from the agency’s Forestry Department, explained that many developing countries are unable to generate reliable forest data to highlight their “climate achievements”. “This project will provide an essential platform for more transparent forest-related data, helping countries to compile, analyse and disseminate better data in line with the 's requirements," he said. In concrete terms, the scheme will support an e-learning course on transparency in the forest sector for national forestry staff. The course will also be made available more widely, to universities, the private sector and intergovernmental organizations, FAO said. on 12 December 2015, the Paris Agreement calls on countries to combat climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future. To date, 187 Parties have ratified the Agreement, out of 197 Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change ( ). The United States formally announced its withdrawal just last week. The Agreement’s central aim is to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Countries are also expected to pursue efforts to limit the planet’s temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and invest in ways to strengthen their ability to deal with the impacts of climate change. All Parties to the Agreement are also required to implement “nationally determined contributions” ( ) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. This includes requirements that all Parties report regularly on their emissions and on their implementation efforts and participate in a global stock take every five years to assess progress.

451-> Youth, indigenous peoples, migrants and refugees boost hope for human rights: Guterres
People’s rights are under fire “in many parts of the globe,” told the on Monday, before insisting that he was not “losing hope”, thanks to the progress made by powerful grassroots movements for social justice. Addressing the Geneva-based forum on the opening day of its , Mr. Guterres underlined the Council’s key role as the “epicentre” for dialogue and cooperation on all human rights issues: civil, political, economic, social and cultural. Beyond its doors, other key voices were also demanding their rights and making their voices heard, he said, particularly “youth, indigenous people, migrants and refugees”. Milestones have been reached in recent years, that are key to human rights, the UN chief maintained. “One billion people have been lifted out of extreme poverty in just a generation,” he said. “More than two billion people have gained access to improved sanitation. And more than 2.5 billion people have gained access to improved drinking water resources. The mortality rate for children under five has declined by almost 60 per cent.” Despite this, the UN chief insisted that ongoing gender inequality remains a major modern-day challenge: “Untold women and girls still face insecurity, violence and other violations of their rights every day,” he insisted, while glass ceilings “abound”. “It will take two centuries to close the gap in economic empowerment,” he continued. “I do not accept a world that tells my granddaughters that economic equality can wait for their granddaughter’s granddaughters. I know you agree. Our world cannot wait.” In his 15-minute address, Mr. Guterres touched on his own experience living under the dictatorship of António Salazar, the authoritarian ruler of Portugal who oppressed both his fellow citizens at home and the people of the then-Portuguese colonies in Africa. “It was the human rights struggles and successes of others around the world that moved us to believe in change and to make that change happen,” Mr. Guterres said of Portugal’s struggle to rid itself of the Salazar regime. “Human rights inspire and drive progress. And that truth is the animating spirit of this Council. It is the DNA of our Organization’s founding . And it is vital to addressing the ills of our world.” The Secretary-General’s concern about conflict and instability around the globe was echoed by the President of the UN General Assembly, , in her address. “Political crises, wars, transnational organized crime, social exclusion and lack of access to justice, constitute clear threats that demand adequate answers from this Council and from the entire international system for the protection of human rights,” she said. In common with the UN chief, Ms. Espinosa expressed concern about the widening gap between the planet’s haves and have-nots. “Perhaps one of the most sensitive challenges for the human rights agenda is inequality,” she said. “The concentration of wealth has increased to such an extent that, in 2018, 26 individuals had more money than the 3,800 million poorest people on the planet.” In her address to the Council, Michelle Bachelet, , highlighted the dangers of ignoring climate change. “How can any State’s interests be advanced by policies that damage the well-being of all humans?” she said. “This is true of climate change; you may know the saying, ‘If you think economic interests are more important than environment, try counting your money while holding your breath.’”  Ms. Bachelet also hailed the young climate activists inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg. The 16-year-old who had grabbed the attention of the world’s media, recently travelled to the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) in Switzerland where she called for the world’s decision makers to take swifter action to limit carbon dioxide emissions and reduce global temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrial levels. “In recent weeks I have watched children marching for sound climate change policies and other measures,” the High Commissioner said. “As a parent, a grandparent and quite simply as a human being, they inspire in me a fierce determination to continue our struggle to uphold their rights.” In addition to improving women’s rights, the UN Secretary-General expressed alarm about the “shrinking civil space in every region of the globe”; and a rise in harassment, attacks and inflammatory rhetoric. “Hate speech is a menace to democratic values, social stability and peace,” Mr. Guterres said. “It spreads like wildfire through social media, the internet and conspiracy theories. It is abetted by public discourses that stigmatizes women, minorities, migrants and refugees and any so-called ‘other’. Indeed, hate is moving into the mainstream, in liberal democracies and authoritarian States alike.” To tackle this, the UN chief announced the creation of a fast-track strategy to scale up the organization’s response to hate speech and present a global plan of action, headed by his Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, . This kind of initiative was necessary in light of the political capital earned at the expense of migrants and refugees, who some leaders had blamed for a rise in crime and terrorism, the Secretary-General insisted. “We must re-establish the integrity of the international refugee protection regime and continue to work for common values and international cooperation to reassert rights and help protect people from ruthless traffickers, smugglers and other predators,” he said. The current session of the continues until 22 March.

452-> Shining a light on sustainable power: how clean energy is helping to improve camps for displaced people
Hauwa, from Borno State in north-eastern Nigeria, fled her home village of Adamari with her husband and four children in March, when violence struck. Now, she is in the relative safety of a UN-run camp but, with little electricity available at night, lighting is scarce, and darkness can mean danger. However, thanks to a solar-energy initiative from the UN migration agency IOM, that is beginning to change. El-Miskin, where Hauwa and her family are sheltering, sits at the edge of the capital of Borno State, Maiduguri. It is one of several camps for internally displaced people (IDP) in the region, victims of the fighting between armed groups and Nigerian forces that has persisted for almost a decade. Newcomers to El-Miskin camp live in makeshift shelters made of straw, and energy is hard to come by. This means that safety is an issue, particularly for women and girls: without proper lighting, they often have to walk in the dark to use the latrines and other water, sanitation and hygiene facilities. For Hauwa, even the cost of batteries to power a small lamp is beyond her means, so when she was given a solar-powered lamp – purchased with financial support from GOGLA, the global association for the off-grid solar energy industry – in early April, as part of the initiative, her daily routine improved drastically. Hauwa recalls that during the distribution of the lamps, IOM staff assisted her and taught her how to use it. “I think it is very easy to use,” she says as she proudly shows IOM staff how to fix the lamp on her roof to charge it. With the lamp, Hauwa feels safe when she uses the latrines at night. “The lamp helps me see the path when it’s dark, but I still need to be careful not to step on a lizard!” she jokes. “Our member companies have already provided 245 million people with access to electricity with clean and affordable off-grid solar solutions. We know they can reach many more. However, some of the most vulnerable communities, such as displaced persons, are often out of reach for the market. That’s why we are glad we could support IOM in bringing the power of off-grid solar to more than 2,100 displaced persons in north-east Nigeria,” said Koen Peters, GOGLA Executive Director. Smart tech to keep refugees, and forests, alive But safety is not the only advantage that renewable energy has brought to humanitarian camps, as Djamila Fatime Harine, a Nigeria-based IOM Programme Manager explains. “With solar lights, children can continue to learn without the health and safety risks of smoky firewood or kerosene lamps, which also pose health hazards such as burns and respiratory problems”. Where there is a large-scale concentration of refugees, anything that can reduce the need to burn wood, would have a huge impact. In Bangladesh, near the border with Myanmar, for example, some 700,000 Rohingya refugees have few options other than firewood for their household energy needs. The UN refugee agency, , estimates that a staggering 820 tonnes of trees – equivalent to 4 hectares – are being cut down for firewood by Rohingya refugees every day. This is causing tensions with local people, who want to protect their natural resources and livelihoods, and increases the risk of assaults on refugees. As for the health risks, the smoke created by around 191,000 families in such a densely populated area is having a negative effect on the whole population, especially those directly involved in tending fires and cooking. Cases such as Bangladesh explain why UNHCR, IOM, and other humanitarian organizations, have a strong motivation to find ways to power refugee camps with cheap, clean energy. For example, at UNHCR’s two largest refugee camps, in Jordan, a solar plant has been providing clean, reliable electricity to over 100,000 Syrian refugees since 2017. Whilst it cost US$17.5 million, it is now saving the agency an estimated US$12.5 million per year in energy costs, and cutting carbon emissions by around 20,000 tons a year. In South Sudan, where thousands of displaced people fled to a UN-protected base in Malakal, in the Upper Nile region, following attacks on communities in 2013, clean water was a priority. IOM initially trucked in water, and then began using diesel-run generators to pump in water from the Nile. However, since last year, the camp’s supplies come from a solar-powered pump, providing some 29,000 residents, and around 300 humanitarian workers, with around 20 litres of water every day. The environmental footprint of the camp is now much smaller, as fuel consumption has dropped drastically. This also means that the pump will have paid for itself by the end of 2019, thanks to savings on transportation and diesel fuel. With the costs of renewable energy installations continuing to fall, more and more humanitarian centres will be powered by clean power sources, and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. To speed up the process, a group of UN-related bodies, along with other partners, co-led by IOM, have made the switch to clean energy a priority, and joined together to bring about a global sustainable energy plan of action, part of the aim to achieve Goal 7 of the UN’s : safe access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services for all displaced people.

453-> Education critical to ensure future of forests, and reverse their destruction
The UN drew attention to the vital role that forests play in addressing some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges on Thursday, and the importance of tackling the issues that threaten them, such as deforestation, and land degradation. The UN drew attention to the vital role that forests play in addressing some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges on Thursday, and the importance of tackling the issues that threaten them, such as deforestation, and land degradation. Education is a critical step to safeguarding natural resources for future generations. It is essential for children to learn about forests at an early age.  Marking the 2019 , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) launched new forestry education initiatives aimed at raising awareness amongst young people about their sustainable use and conservation, and some of the major challenges related to forestry education. Despite the well documented and important role that forests play in keeping the environment healthy and helping to address global challenges such as climate change through the capture of greenhouse gases, many people have little knowledge of the many ways that forests support human life, or the grave dangers many forests face. As more and more people move to cities, becoming oblivious to the plight of rural areas, says the FAO, this problem is growing. In a , José Graziano da Silva, FAO's Director-General, said that "education is a critical step to safeguarding natural resources for future generations. It is essential for children to learn about forests at an early age."Education, however, can challenge and reverse this situation. The FAO has identified deficiencies in the way that forest-related issues are taught, describing forestry education as generally “inadequate,” and failing to address emerging challenges. The opportunities to study forestry at all levels, the Organization says, are few and far between. As part of the global celebrations marking the day, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs ( ) held a special event at UN Headquarters in New York on Thursday, featuring remarks by senior UN and government officials, as well as a panel discussion and general discussion by Member States and UN bodies. Opening the event, Mr. Hossein Moeini Meybodi, Senior Forest Policy Officer at the UN Forum on Forests, was positive about the effect that education, awareness raising measures and improved forestry management can have on the future of forests: “It is our sincere hope that by sharing positive messages on solutions that exist for forests, and the communities that they support, we can learn from each other and together create a greener, more sustainable world for future generations.” Forestry Facts

454-> COP24: World sports join team UN in race against climate change
Major organizations from the world of sport are joining an increasing number of private sector businesses in the race to beat global warming. At the United Nations’ conference in Poland on Wednesday, 17 major players representing sporting bodies, athletes and fans, added their names to the collective scoreboard, with the launch of the . is a two-week conference that has brought together the 197 parties to the UN Climate Change Convention ( ), as well as activists, non-profits organisations, and the private sector, to define the guidelines to implement the historic , aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. The 17 the represent the starting line-up of the Sports Climate Action Framework, include major players like the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), and the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). Other signatories include the French tennis federation, Roland Garros, Formula E, the International Sailing Federation, organizers of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics, the Rugby League World Cup 2021, and the World Surf League. “With its global reach, universal appeal and the power to inspire and influence millions of people around the globe, sport is uniquely placed to drive global climate action and encourage crowds to join in,” said Prince Albert II of Monaco, who chairs the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission, during the in Katowice. “As countries here in Katowice prepare to turn their climate commitments into reality, we stand ready to leverage the power of sport to support their efforts,” he stressed. The sports industry bears responsibility for extensive carbon emissions on several fronts; including through travel, overall energy use, venue construction, and catering. With this initiative, it recognizes the need to unite behind a set of principles to get on track for a net-zero emissions economy by 2050. “We recognize the critical need for everyone to help implement the and accelerate the change needed to reach greenhouse gas emission neutrality in the second half of the 21st century,” said FIFA Secretary-General Fatma Samoura. The sentiment is echoed by UEFA’s President Aleksander Čeferin: “Climate change is the biggest challenge facing the planet. UEFA firmly believes that football, with its strong and ever-growing environmental conscience, in particular in areas such as sustainable event management, has a duty to play a role in addressing this issue.” The result of a collaboration between the representatives of various sports organisations and the UN, the Framework not only aims to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emission stemming from sports operations, it also calls for leveraging the popularity of sporting role-models, and the passion of many fans, to help change public opinion about the dangers of irreversible climate change. “You know playing in five different World Cups for my country, it’s one of those things. But at some point, as an athlete, you start to see the platform that you have, and you see your voice is for a reason, and the power of using it,” former football goalkeeper and , told . “Whether you have a reach of Cristiano Ronaldo with 360 million followers or you’re a teacher who has a classroom of kids, it’s about starting the conversation, on how we can all impact change… And the idea of being in a race, with everybody being in the same team, I think that’s what inspires me,” she explained. Some concrete initiatives have already seen the light of day. The IOC, in collaboration with the secretariat, has produced two guides: “Sustainability Essentials: Sports for Climate Action” and “Carbon Footprint Methodology for the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games,” meant to provide essential climate action guidance to sports federations and others. In early 2019, the adopters of the Sports for Climate Action Framework will be invited to form working groups to plan, pursue and enhance work under 16 principles laid out in the Framework.

455-> In 2019, ‘reasons for hope’ in a world still on ‘red alert’: UN chief Guterres
Last year, United Nations Antonio Guterres issued “a red alert” over a range of dangers confronting the world, which “still persist” as 2019 looms: “These are anxious times for many, and our world is undergoing a stress test,” the UN chief said on Saturday in his message for the New Year. He reiterated one of his clarion calls during 2018 over climate change, saying that it was still “running faster than we are,” and that deepening geo-political divisions are making conflicts more difficult to resolve. Record numbers of people are moving in search of safety and protection, inequality is growing and “people are questioning a world in which a handful of people hold the same wealth as half of humanity,” he said. Moreover, he stated that intolerance was on the rise while trust is declining.  ‘Reasons for hope’ “But”, Mr. Guterres continued, “there are also reasons for hope”, notably in Yemen where breakthrough talks have created an opportunity at least, for peace. The Secretary-General also cited the September agreement signed in Riyadh between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which has eased long-running tensions and brought improved prospects to an entire region as cause for optimism. When international cooperation works, the world wins –  Likewise, he pointed to the agreement between warring parties in South Sudan which has revitalized chances for peace, “bringing more progress in the past four months than in the previous four years.” The UN was also able to bring countries together in Katowice, Poland, to agree on a programme to implement the on climate change. “Now we need to increase ambition to beat this existential threat,” asserted Mr. Guterres. “It’s time to seize our last best chance” and “stop uncontrolled and spiraling climate change.” In recent weeks, the UN also oversaw landmark global agreements on migration and refugees, “that will help to save lives and overcome damaging myths.” And people everywhere are mobilizing behind the (SDGs), which he called “our global blueprint for peace, justice and prosperity on a healthy planet.” “When international cooperation works, the world wins”, the UN chief stressed. He maintained that in 2019, the UN “will continue to bring people together to build bridges and create space for solutions” , keeping up the pressure for change. “As we begin this New Year, let’s resolve to confront threats, defend human dignity and build a better future – together,” concluded the Secretary-General, wishing the world a peaceful, prosperous and healthy 2019.

456-> Wednesday’s Daily Brief: climate challenges for the Pacific, new global health tool, updates on Yemen, the Gulf and Somalia
This Wednesday, top stories includes: the UN chief’s continued visit in the Pacific to raise awareness on the impacts of climate change; in Yemen, the fatal price that children are paying due to a conflict they did not cause; a new tool to track medical products worldwide; drought in Somalia; and updates on tensions in the Gulf. UN chief outlines ‘intertwined challenges’ of climate change, ocean health facing Pacific nations on the ‘frontline’ Visiting Fiji for the first time as Secretary-General, António Guterres two “fundamental challenges” facing leaders attending the Pacific Islands Forum on Tuesday, namely climate change and the world’s rising ocean, which threatens to submerge low-lying nations. “The Pacific region is on the frontline of climate change”, he said. “That means you are also our important allies in the fight against it”. The UN chief said that he was there “to see the region’s climate pressures firsthand, and to learn about the work being undertaken by communities here in Fiji and elsewhere to bolster resilience”.\ Noting that the last four years were the hottest on record, Mr. Guterres highlighted recent ice losses in Greenland and Antarctica, saying that “sea levels will rise a full meter by 2100”. Find . Yemen war ‘a test of our humanity’, and we’re ‘badly failing’ warns UN Children’s Fund chief “Fifteen million children in Yemen are asking you to save their lives,” the head of the UN Children’s Fund ( ) told the 15 members of the on Wednesday, in an impassioned plea for action to end four years of fighting which has left at least 7,300 children killed or seriously injured. “These are verified numbers. The actual numbers are no doubt higher”, said Henrietta Fore, who began her address with a quiet intensity, telling the horrifying but tragically now mundane story of how one classroom was shattered by shrapnel last month in the capital Sana’a: “Imagine the pain endured by the families of the 14 children who never made it home...In any conflict, children suffer first. And worst.” Read . WHO launches online tool to tackle ‘urgent need’ to combat threats to global health In a bid to improve the treatment of neglected diseases and threats to global health, the UN health agency, , on Wednesday, designed to guide research into new health products. The free-to-use Health Product Profile Directory, which the WHO describes as “an essential tool for realizing universal health coverage,” so far contains research information on 196 products, with a strong focus on infectious diseases. The Ebola outbreak that began in 2014 in West Africa, highlighted the importance of centralizing information in order to fight neglected diseases, antimicrobial resistance and diseases with the potential to spread pandemics, so that research and development is more effective, and better coordinated. Nearly a fifth of Somalis at risk from ‘disastrous’ drought A drought in Somalia described by the UN food and agriculture agency ( ) as ‘disastrous’ could hit around 2.2 million people in the country: almost a fifth of the population. On Wednesday, FAO put out a special alert, warning that the number of hungry people in Somalia is likely to be 40 per cent higher than it was at the beginning of the year, and that there has been a sharp increase of acutely malnourished children being admitted to feeding centres. People in the country are more vulnerable this year because, on top of the drought itself, they are dealing with increasing conflict, and a reduction in humanitarian aid. In an effort to stave off the crisis, FAO is calling for urgent funds for critical livelihood support such as cash assistance, seeds and farming tools. UN chief following rising tensions in Gulf ‘with growing concern’ Rising tensions in the Gulf this week – including drone attacks on Saudi oil facilities and damage sustained by oil tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – are being followed “with growing concern” by the UN Secretary-General. Briefing reporters at UN headquarters in New York, Spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said that “hardening rhetoric” in the region threatened to “further destabilize an already volatile situation”. In particular, he said Mr. Guterres condemned the attacks off the coast of UAE on Sunday, which the Government has referred to as acts of sabotage, and further investigation is needed “to determine the facts and hold accountable the perpetrators.” “He also condemns the drone attacks on oil facilities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, for which the Houthis have claimed responsibility”, said Mr. Dujarric. A Houthi spokesperson reportedly said on Tuesday that the multiple drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities were in response to the Kingdom’s leading role in the pro-Yemeni Government military coalition. “The Secretary-General calls upon all actors to exercise maximum restraint and prevent any escalation amid heightened tensions”, he concluded. Speaking in the Security Council on Wednesday, UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, said he was also very concerned about the drone attacks. “Events like this are a reminder that hard-won achievements can be wiped away very easily”, referring to the step forward made by Houthi rebels in withdrawing from the key Yemeni port of Hudaydah. Countries dependent on exporting commodities hit 20-year high More than half the world’s countries now depend on exporting their raw materials to keep their economies ticking over, and it’s a potentially massive brake on their development, UN analysts from said on Wednesday. Using trade data from 189 countries, UNCTAD’s State of Commodity Dependence Report 2019 finds that, in 102 States, more than 60 per cent of what they make from exports comes from selling raw products linked to industries such as farming and mining. That’s 10 countries more than at the turn of the century. With recent average commodity prices “substantially below” peaks seen in 2008-2012, the UN economists say that this has contributed to an economic slowdown in 64 countries – and several have gone into recession. “Given that commodity dependence often negatively impacts a country’s economic development, it is important and urgent to reduce it to make faster progress towards meeting the ,” said UNCTAD Secretary-General, Mukhisa Kituyi. The phenomenon almost exclusively affects poorer nations; in particular, 85 per cent of the most vulnerable “Least Developed Countries”, 81 per cent of landlocked developing countries and 57 per cent of small island states. In regional terms, sub-Saharan Africa countries are most dependent on commodity exports (89 per cent), followed by the Middle East and North Africa (65 per cent). In Latin America, the Caribbean, East Asia and the Pacific, meanwhile, half of the countries there are commodity-dependent.

457-> Make this the year of ‘transformative solutions’ to avert disastrous climate change: UN Deputy Chief
It is within our power to make 2019 the “year of transformative solutions” and “avoid the disastrous effects of climate change“, which threaten ecosystems, the global economy, health and security, the UN Deputy Secretary-General told delegates gathered in Nairobi for the , on Thursday. said that she had been inspired by the ideas discussed at the conference – the world’s highest-level decision-making body on the environment – in support of UN environment’s ( ) #SolveDifferent campaign to find innovative solutions to environmental challenges. She urged the audience, which included Heads of State and government ministers, to “reshape the global economy into one that rewards careful stewardship and punishes waste and pollution.” Addressing the main topic of the Assembly – the need to shift to sustainable forms of consumption and production – the deputy UN chief reminded the audience that we are all living with negative consequences of the current “Take, Make and Dispose” global economic model. Examples include the harmful environmental and health impacts associated with the extraction of metals used in mobile phones; the millions of tons of plastic waste flowing into the oceans; and the huge amount of electronic waste generated every year. Every day we live with the shortcomings of a linear economic model based on 'Take, Make, and Dispose'  The UN’s solution to breaking out of an unsustainable system that is wreaking havoc on the environment, said Ms. Mohammed, is to change the perception that it is necessary to deplete natural resources in order grow the economy: “We can in fact achieve greater economic benefits from innovative approaches to how we eat, purchase, travel, and discard waste.” This major shift would mean moving away from a model of built-in obsolescence, creating products that last longer, and ensuring that all products can either be recycled or reused The Deputy Secretary-General gave specific examples showing how governments, the private sector and civil society are making a positive change. She noted that several large hotel chains are committed to reducing water consumption and waste by 50%; countries including India and Costa Rica are committed to eliminating single-use plastics; and she cited a project in the Kiribati Islands, which is providing families with a unique hydroponic system to make food without soil. It is time, she added, to take a “big ambition leap,” in the build up to the in September, convened by , which will aim to inject momentum into the fight against climate change. Ms. Mohammed said the UN chief expects world leaders to come to the Summit “not with a speech, but with a plan”, that will explain how countries expect to drastically reduce emissions, create decent “green jobs”, and build sustainable cities. The plans, she said, must be credible and ambitious enough to “convince all the people taking to the streets, that they are taken seriously.”

458-> FROM THE FIELD: India’s plastic waste revolution
The recycling of plastic waste in India is boosting the incomes of impoverished women and helping build roads and fire cement furnaces, thanks to support from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Waste collectors, or ragpickers as they are known more colloquially in the cities of Bhopal and Indore, in Madhya Pradesh state, are being encouraged to hand over plastic waste to local collection centres. Single-use plastics, which would have ended up in landfill sites, are now being used to fuel cement furnaces and build roads, providing an additional income source for the ragpickers. The project, under the Global Environment Facility's (GEF) Small Grants Programme (SGP), implemented by , has been so successful that it has been extended across India and has been replicated in neighbouring Bangladesh. about how India is revolutionizing the recycling of plastic waste.

459-> ‘Going green’ is good business says private sector at UN’s COP24 climate conference
Businesses across the world should no longer be viewed solely as greenhouse gas emissions culprits, but more as indispensable partners for climate action, who stand to increase profits from “going green”. That was the key message as the United Nations COP24 climate change conference went into its second week in Katowice, Poland. For years, sectors such as construction, transport, farming and retailing, have had the finger pointed at them for being major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally and for putting profit ahead of environmental protection. But increasingly, new technologies and models are transforming the private sector so that business leaders no longer have to choose between making money and taking better care of the planet. This is one of the key issues being discussed here at the conference, where negotiations are continuing on the implementation of the climate action agreement adopted in Paris, in 2015, when 197 parties committed to try and limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. “We are calling on all companies across sectors and regions, to set their science-based targets to a new level of ambition, one that aligns with the 1.5°C target,” said Lise Kingo, who heads the , a network of 9,500 small and large private companies which have committed to invest more in sustainable development. Speaking at a press conference at COP24, along with the heads of Maersk - the Danish global shipping company – as well as US confectionary giant Mars, and the French-based water and waste management conglomerate, Suez, she stressed that “this is the only way we can reach the ambition of the and the UN sustainable goals by 2030”. According to the Global Compact, nearly half of the Fortune 500 list of leading US corporations, have set clear energy targets or greenhouse gas reduction goals. Moreover, in 2016, 190 of those companies captured a total of US$3.7 billion in savings thanks to their emissions reduction measures. 1000 solutions to protect the planet while making money To make it easier for the private sector to adopt environmentally-friendly solutions while also boosting profits, one NGO – the Solar Impulse Foundation – has endeavoured to gather together 1,000 solutions already in operation, and vet them for their positive environmental impact and their profitability before presenting them to governments and the private sector at large. “This is where can make a big difference for the protection of the environment… showing that it is profitable, that people can create jobs and make money with it,” said the founder of the foundation, Bertrand Piccard, who was also the first person ever to complete a round-the-world flight powered only by solar energy, in 2016. Seeking to “bridge the gap between ecology and economy”, the 1,000 efficient solutions initiative was launched over a year ago and, so far, more than 1,500 companies have joined, with over 600 projects in the pipeline. So far, 58 solutions having already received the Solar Impulse Efficient Label on sustainability and profitability. “The point I’m trying to make is that the biggest industrial market and financial opportunity of the century is in transforming the old devices, systems and infrastructures which are inefficient and polluting, into efficient and clean and much more profitable industrial processes, devices, systems, technologies and solutions,” Mr. Piccard told in an interview at COP24. From solutions which make homes carbon-neutral, to developing cleaner cooling systems, or producing stainless steel more efficiently and more economically, the pioneer hopes the initiative will help make the case that climate action can happen now. He said it should not have to wait until 2050, and can be about “winning, not losing” - something he believes to be particularly critical for the poorer and more remote communities across the world, which are often dependent on others for all their energy needs. “Energy – if they make it locally with sun, with wind, with biomass, with waves, with hydroelectricity on a small river – would allow them to develop their wealth, their social stability and peace. They would not need to fight for energy, as they would produce it themselves,” he explained, acknowledging that such a shift would require an initial investment by an external entity willing to share the profits with the communities. “Today we are seeing that the most profitable solutions need a little bit more upfront investment, and afterwards, they bring much more money back,” noted Mr. Piccard. “Take electric buses: an electric bus is just a little bit more expensive to buy than a diesel bus, but over ten years, which is the usual lifespan of a bus, if it’s electric, it brings about $400,000 in savings.” Big clothing brands commit to showing the (run)way to sustainable practices Along with the construction and buildings sector, as well as fossil-fuel energy producers, the fashion industry is often criticized for wasteful, polluting and highly unsustainable practices. To course-correct, on Monday, at COP24, dozens of leading companies in the fashion industry – including Adidas, Burberry, Esprit, Guess, Gap, Hugo Boss, H&M, Levi Strauss & Co., Puma, Inditex - which owns brands like Zara and Bershka, as well as retailer Target, signed the , under the auspices of the UN Climate Change Convention secretariat, .   “The fashion industry is always two steps ahead when it comes to defining world culture, so I am pleased to see it now also leading the way in terms of climate action,” said chief Patricia Espinosa. The document, open for others to join, and aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, presents a vision for the industry to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and defines issues to be addressed every step of the way in the life of fashion products, including: the use of environmentally sustainable materials, low-carbon transport; consumer awareness-raising; ‘scalable’ solutions through resource and political mobilization; and exploring ways to extend the life expectancy of fashion products as well as recycling possibilities. “I congratulate the signatories of this important charter, which represents a unique commitment and collaboration from an array of fashion leaders. The Charter, like the renowned fashion runways of the world, sets an example that I hope others will follow,” noted Ms. Espinosa.

460-> Preparing Africa for ravages of climate change ‘cannot be an afterthought’ – COP24
Africa is at a “tipping point” as global warming increases, and urgent action needs to be taken across the continent now, to mitigate risks and safeguard a decade of social and economic gains, according to a new report launched on Thursday by the United Nations Development Agency ( ) at the climate conference, in Katowice, Poland. For two weeks, the conference has brought together thousands of climate action decision-makers, advocates and activists, with one key objective: adopting global guidelines for the 197 parties of the 2015 , when countries committed to limiting global warming to less than 2°C – and as close as possible to 1.5° – above pre-industrial levels. Ahunna Eziakonwa, Director of ’s Africa Bureau made the tipping point analogy, while noting that despite major structural inequalities, nations across the continent have achieved “impressive economic, political and social growth in recent decades.” But she argues that “climate change, droughts, floods, changing rainfall patterns and conflict have the potential to unravel efforts to reduce hunger and achieve the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, and the .” The UNDP study shows that, should the world fail to limit global warming to less than 2°C, families will find it harder and harder to feed themselves, and the risk of famine and increased poverty will rise along with temperatures. Higher levels of poverty would further limit the capacity of communities to manage climate-related risks, according to the report, placing further stress on already overstretched coping mechanisms, and could translate into more risky migration patterns, serious epidemics such as the 2014 Ebola outbreak across West Africa, and greater political instability. Drawing on years of data from projects geared to enabling communities to adapt to a changing climate and build resilience, the shows that as emissions continue going up, support for climate adaptation initiatives must be increased urgently and accelerated across the continent, especially across the 34 African “least developed countries.” “They are among the most vulnerable to climate change, yet the least able to adapt. In many cases, they lack the technical, financial and institutional capacity to identify the best ways to build resilience,” said Gustavo Fonseca, from Global Environment Facility, an institution that has been funding many climate adaptation projects in Africa. Hunger rising along with temperatures According to recent estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( ), for the first time in over a decade, world hunger is on the rise, affecting 11 per cent of the global population. This is in part due to extreme droughts induced by an abnormally strong El Niño cycle, which led close to 40 million people in Africa to be in need of humanitarian assistance. “Taking reactive approaches to food security and disaster recovery costs the people of Africa billions of dollars in lost GDP, and syphons off government resources that should be dedicated to education, social programmes, healthcare, business development and employment,” said UNDP’s Ahunna Eziakonwa. “It cannot be an afterthought.” “For me the critical component is knowledge and capacity-building,” said Rohini Kohli, who leads Adaptation Planning at UNDP. However, measures to enable communities to adapt to the changing climate is a costly matter that will require creative financial mechanisms and substantial engagement with the private sector to meet. It will require developed nations to make good on their 2015 Paris Agreement commitments to dedicate $100 billion annually to supporting climate action in developing nations. The report analyses a number of noteworthy successes in climate change adaptation in Africa over the past decade, including projects aimed at improving food security in ; supporting governments in having improved climate information and early warning to ; and empowering to be effective climate action champions.

461-> Guterres underlines climate action urgency, as UN weather agency confirms record global warming
In the wake of data released by the United Nations World Meteorological Organization (WMO), showing the past four years were officially the ‘four warmest on record,’ UN Secretary-General António Guterres for urgent climate action and increased ambition, ahead of his in September.  His reaction on Wednesday came after issued a report confirming that 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 were the four warmest years recorded to date. The analysis, based on the monitoring performed by five leading international organisations, also shows that the global average surface temperature in 2018 was approximately 1° Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) baseline.  “The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,” said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. “The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. The degree of warming during the past four years has been exceptional, both on land and in the ocean.” “Temperatures are only part of the story. Extreme and high impact weather affected many countries and millions of people, with devastating repercussions for economies and ecosystems in 2018,” he said. “Many of the extreme weather events are consistent with what we expect from a changing climate. This is a reality we need to face up to. Greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate adaptation measures should be a top global priority,” said Mr. Taalas. Noting “with concern” this data, which was first released in November 2018, UN Secretary-General Guterres said it confirms “the urgency of addressing climate action”, and echoes the science presented by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) in its October 2018 on the impacts of a global warming of 1.5°C. The IPCC report that found that limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require “rapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities” and that global net emissions of carbon dioxide, attributable to human activity, would need to fall by about 45 per cent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching ‘net zero’ around 2050. The Secretary-General stated that, “to make these transformations, we need to significantly increase the global level of climate action and ambition”. In order to mobilize political will, Mr. Guterres is convening a Climate Summit on 23 September this year, focusing on nine key areas: The Secretary-General is working closely with Member States and non-party stakeholders to enable outcomes in these areas to the Summit, in order to send “strong market and political signals that can inject momentum into the race” to meet the goals of the , in which countries committed collectively to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Informing the discussions at the Summit alongside other key scientific reports, WMO will issue the full 2018 State of the Climate report this coming March.  It will provide a comprehensive overview of temperature variability and trends, high-impact events, and key indicators of long-term climate change such as increasing carbon dioxide concentrations; Arctic and Antarctic sea ice; sea level rise and ocean acidification. It will be accompanied by UN-wide policy recommendations statement for decision-makers on the interplay between weather, climate and water supply, and the United Nations’ (SDGs).

462-> Delhi Declaration: Countries agree to make ‘land degradation neutrality’ by 2030, a national target for action
A major UN conference on fighting desertification agreed on Friday to make the Sustainable Development Goal target of achieving “land degradation neutrality” (LDN), a national target for action. The Governments which are party to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification ( ), met in the Indian capital of New Delhi over ten days for , adopting a series of breakthrough measures in the accord, known as the . E.S. addresses the closing press conference of and shares key takeaways: Besides the LDN agreement - whereby countries have pledged to halt the degradation of land to the point where ecosystems and land use can no longer be supported - there was a landmark decision to boost global efforts to mitigate and manage the risks of crippling drought. Countries will also now be expected to address insecurity of land tenure, including gender inequality; promote land restoration to reduce land-related carbon emissions; and mobilize innovative sources of finance from public and private sources to support the implementation of these decisions at a national level. “We have woken up to the fact that we will see more frequent and severe droughts, a phenomenon that will be exacerbated by climate change”, said Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UNCCD. “To my mind, this was the COP where we put people at the heart of what we do”, he added, with Parties adopting a breakthrough decision on land tenure rights and drawing on the “unique voices, experiences of youth and women.” Mr. Thiaw also drew attention to the contribution of COP 14 to the upcoming in New York, stressing that land restoration, at scale, is one of the cheapest solutions to address the global crises of climate and biodiversity loss. He said the key message to the upcoming New York Summit was clear, “investing in land, unlocks multiple opportunities.” The UN desertification chief also drew attention to the role that the private sector can play in land restoration going forward. He said it was important for businesses to be incentivized to help conserve land for sustainable use, through national regulations that support sustainable land management, and reward conservation, restoration and innovation. The Conference drew the interest of nearly 9,000 participants. Delegates, including ministers, heads of United Nations and intergovernmental bodies, youth, local governments, business leaders and representatives of non-governmental organizations Prakash Javadekar, India’s Minister for Environment, Forest & Climate Change and President of COP 14, reiterated the country’s commitment to achieving land degradation neutrality by the SDG target year of 2030. He also promised to provide effective leadership to the UNCCD during his two-year presidency.

463-> Is the world living up to its climate commitments?
As the United Nations gears up for the September in New York, one of its most high-profile climate conferences in recent times, what progress is the world making in tackling the climate crisis, and how is that progress being measured? Around three years ago, the global community gathered in in order to build a common approach to fighting climate change. They agreed to make efforts to restrict the rise in global temperatures to “well below”  2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and, if possible, reach 1.5 degrees Celsius. However, in July of this year the temperature measured 1.2 degrees Celsius above those levels – matching, and even breaking, the record for the hottest month since records began – and the trend is continuing upwards. Extreme weather events across the world mean the planet is on track to record the five hottest years on record, according to the UN Secretary-General, António Guterres. Mr. Guterres says that we are engaged in a “race to limit climate change”. So are we winning? UN News decided to take a closer look at one of the key international instruments used to measure the fight against global warming: Nationally Determined Contributions, or . What are NDCs? It should be stressed that the on Climate Change is not legally binding in its entirety: it does not tell countries how they should reduce emissions or build climate resilience and adaptation, but encourages countries to write their own ticket: the NDCs. These climate plans outline what a country promises to do, and how much they plan to reduce emissions. Recognizing that developing countries often lack the resources, finance, and technology, the Paris Agreement calls for developing countries to show what they can do on their own, and what they can do with assistance from the international community. Why are they important? Countries have many options on how they can pursue the goals of the Paris Agreement.  This could involve legislation, financial incentives, or tax policies to promote activities that will reduce emissions.  For example, countries can decide to put a price on carbon, through a tax or by building a carbon trading system. The idea is that, if people have a clear idea of the cost of carbon pollution, they will invest and spend in areas, or fuels, that cost less.  For the average citizen, this could affect what kind of car, or heating, or cooling system they use, among a myriad of other facets of life. In addition, these policies can help regulate development in areas that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as coastal areas that are facing rising sea levels. Why are we talking about them now? Under the Paris Agreement, countries are supposed to enhance their NDCs every few years to show increased ambition over time. This is known as the “ratchet” mechanism, acknowledging that the initial submissions were nowhere near where we need to be: even if you added up the NDCs of all countries, we would only, at best, be a third of where we need to be, in order to achieve the Paris Goals. So, countries are supposed to submit updated and enhanced NDCs in 2020, and it is important to mobilize now, to push for increased ambition and action: this is why the Climate Action Summit is being held in 2019. Is it all doom and gloom? No! We are seeing a surge of action around the world to move to renewable energy, with huge solar power plants being built in Morocco and the United Arab Emirates, Portugal receiving most of its energy now from renewables, and increasingly, many countries finding that they can power their grids entirely on renewable energy. Investment in renewable energy is now outpacing that in fossil fuels, particularly in developing countries, and many countries and sub-regions have successfully enacted carbon pricing. At the same time, the bottom line is that the world is not moving quickly enough: global emissions are increasing, and the temperature is rising. Which regions are leading the way? No region is clearly surpassing others, but there are countries, and cities, that are showing great progress.  Many countries, including Pacific Island Small Island Developing States, have said that they are moving towards climate neutrality, or having a net zero carbon footprint. In practice, that means they are able to balance carbon emissions, for example from industry or even just car usage, with carbon removal from the atmosphere, via such techniques as planting more trees, which absorb carbon. It is a sad irony that these countries, among the most affected by climate change, have done little to contribute to the problem. Climate action requires investment, and that often requires sound government policies to provide the incentive. Alongside Portugal, several other countries have invested heavily in renewables – including Chile, Ireland, Kenya and Costa Rica –and many European nations have made major advances in reducing their emissions. How can we move faster? We need to see greater political leadership and political will. Carrying on with business as usual will be disastrous and will lead to a global temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius, or more, this century. Bold leadership, on the part of government, business and civil society leaders, is critical for advancing climate action. People make a difference as well: changing consumer behavior is important in moving toward a low-carbon economy, which is why the UN has promoted the , to offer basic ideas on the steps we all can take. So, can we solve the climate crisis? Yes. We have the solutions that we need to address climate change, but we need to use them.  We need to shift investment from the grey, dirty, economy, to the green economy.  The money is there. We have the technology, now we need to make it accessible to all people in all countries. But we need to take action now.  Every bit of warming matters, and the longer we wait, the greater the negative impact.

464-> Work to make the world a better place: 5 things you need to know about ‘green jobs’
Imagine a world in which practically everyone works in jobs that are helping to transform the global economy, and bring about a world where business can thrive and the needs of the most vulnerable people are met. For the UN, these “green jobs,” play an important role in realising the vision of the future that practically all countries signed up to when they adopted the landmark in December 2015, an international commitment to combat climate change, and significantly reduce human activity contributing to global warming. In the build-up to September’s , which will aim to inject momentum into the fight against climate change, UN has to come with concrete proposals for decent green jobs, declaring “don’t come with a speech, come with a plan.” UN News got in touch with Moustapha Kamal Gueye, coordinator of the at the International Labour Organization ( ) – the UN agency dedicated to promoting decent work – to find out more. 1. What exactly is a green job? The defines a green job as being one which contributes to preserving or restoring the environment. This can involve anything from improving energy efficiency, to actively de-carbonizing the economy and bringing down emissions of harmful gasses in the atmosphere. The ILO says that green jobs contribute to the transformation of economies, workplaces, enterprises and labour markets into a sustainable economy that protects the planet and provides decent employment opportunities for all. Whilst some sectors lend themselves more easily to green jobs, Ultimately, “all jobs could be greened,” says Mr. Gueye, “in the sense that the way the work is done reduces the environmental footprint of the company.” For the UN, green jobs must also be “decent jobs.” This means that they are productive, deliver a fair wage, social protection – which includes policies to reduce poverty and vulnerability, such as sickness, unemployment and disability benefits – and equality of opportunity for men and women. This refers back to the , the UN’s plan of action for people, planet and prosperity: one of the goals of the Agenda, , calls for “full and productive employment and decent work,” an aim which supports many other of the goals that make up the UN’s vision for an economy that benefits all, and causes less harm to the environment. 2. What is a green economy? Around the world many countries are trying to shift towards a cleaner economy, moving away from a reliance on energy produced by fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, towards a more sustainable supply by ramping up renewable energy sources, such as solar plants and wind farms.  This is an important example of the ways that countries can transition to a “green economy.” Whilst there is not a universally agreed definition of the term, the United Nations Environment Programme ( ), describes a green economy as being one which is “low carbon, resource efficient and socially inclusive.” At the UN’s conference on sustainable development in 2012, one of the milestone conferences on the road to the adoption of the , the outcome document declared that a green economy is “one of the important tools available for achieving sustainable development,” which should create “opportunities for employment and decent work for all, while maintaining the healthy functioning of the Earth’s ecosystems.” 3.  What kind of green jobs are being created today? The shift to a green economy opens up a “massive opportunity for job creation,” says Mr. Gueye. An obvious example is the energy industry, where the shift to renewable energies is creating new jobs in companies catering to solar plants, wind farms and other clean energy sources. But the opportunities stretch far beyond the energy industry, in both developed and developing countries, to include areas such as construction and manufacturing, where a host of innovative new techniques, often driven by digital technology, are designed to reduce waste and improve efficiency. In developing countries, the ILO Green Jobs Programme actively helps communities to adopt and implement sustainable practices, increasing their chances of securing an income. In rural , for example, the Programme has trained women to build homes using sustainable techniques, and how to assemble and install solar panels, in a country suffering from an energy crisis, and where many people have never had access to electricity. The skills they have learned have had positive, life-changing benefits for the community and, by reducing waste and pollution, have reduced the impact on the environment. 4. How many green jobs will be created in a green economy? The UN, including the ILO, is very bullish on the benefits to the job market of a green economy, and says that most scenarios suggest that the net effect will be positive. In its 2018 report, the ILO says that, by 2030, 18 million new jobs will result from taking the steps necessary to keep the increase in global temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius. On top of this figure, a further six million jobs are expected to result from the growth of the so-called “circular economy,” in which, rather than products being used over a short period and thrown away, there is more emphasis on repairing, re-using and recycling. 5. What will happen to people who aren’t working in green jobs? The UN doesn’t shy away from the fact that the shift to a green economy will that some six million jobs –particularly in industries that are contributing to the emission of harmful gases, and other drivers of global warming – are expected to disappear. This is why the ILO’s concept of a “ ” is so important. Workers and communities across the world are already being impacted by the changing economy, and this is only expected to continue. A Just Transition accepts that some will face hardships as certain industries and occupations decline, but puts in place initiatives to address the challenges. These can include income support, retraining opportunities and relocation assistance. For the Just Transition to function effectively, a range of actors need to work together, from trade unions, to national and local government, sustainability-conscious businesses and community-based organizations. And the prize couldn’t be bigger: a world in which all people work in decent, productive jobs, contributing to a global economy that protects the environment, for the benefit of all.

465-> Friday's Daily Brief: Desertification summit, Dorian death toll rising, UN project eases Mali tensions, Yemen funding crisis, hope for Cameroon
A recap of Friday’s main stories: Desertification solutions can ease other world woes; Dorian death toll expected to rise; UN moves to ease communal tensions in Mali; Yemen funding crisis threatens reproductive health nationwide; special report on countering terror in Cameroon. Investing in land restoration could not only help keep our planet healthy, but also be the starting point for resolving some of the biggest issues of our time, the head of the UN entity tackling desertification told journalists on Friday via video conference, from the ongoing on the issue, underway in India’s capital. Put concisely, we must “invest in land restoration as a way of improving livelihoods, reducing vulnerabilities contributing to climate change, and reducing risks for the economy,” Mr. Ibrahim Thiaw, Executive Secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) said, speaking on the sidelines of the 14th session of the Conference of the Parties, in New Delhi. Get our full story  As the UN and other aid partners respond to huge humanitarian needs in the hurricane-struck Bahamas, latest reports indicate that the death toll is likely to rise considerably. To date, 30 people are confirmed to have died after Hurricane Dorian hit the islands of Abaco and Grand Bahama last weekend with maximum wind speeds of 297 kilometres per hour - that’s 185 miles per hour. But the Government says that thousands are still missing after the Category 5 storm brought with it a storm surge of 18 to 23 feet high (5.5 to seven metres). Latest information suggests that some 76,000 people are homeless on the worst-hit islands. Our coverage . In Mali, a trial project is under way to help aid workers get a better understanding for the needs of communities vulnerable to escalating violence and armed extremists. The initiative is run by the UN’s aid coordination wing. It relies on a local individual going into villages and asking people what they want most. The project comes amid attacks by armed groups and militias, against both Government forces and UN peacekeepers in the centre and north of the country. According to , the number of people displaced in Mali has doubled in the last year, to nearly 170,000. In Yemen, lifesaving reproductive healthcare services for more than one million women are threatened, thanks to severe funding shortages, the UN Population Fund ( ) said on Friday. According to the agency, although donors made humanitarian pledges worth $2.6 billion in February, less than half has been received. Every two hours, a Yemeni woman dies from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and another 20 suffer preventable injuries, infections or disabilities. Executive Director, Dr. Natalia Kanem, said that unless more funds are found immediately, women and their babies could be at risk. When terrorists attacked and ransacked 30-year old Mamma Hamidou’s village in the Far North region of Cameroon four years ago, she faced an impossible choice. Hand over her young daughter or risk that her husband be executed on the spot. “The men came at night,” she told UN News in the town of Kourgui where she now lives. “They wanted to take my daughter, but I pleaded with them not to, because she was just 10 years old at the time.  I was polite because if you are rude the men will do terrible things to you.” Read and listen,

466-> ‘Nothing left to go back for’: UN News hears extraordinary stories of loss, and survival as Mozambique rebuilds from deadly cyclones
As UN Secretary-General António Guterres arrives in the southern African nation of Mozambique on Thursday for a two-day visit, he will be surveying the damage wrought by the deadly back-to-back cyclones earlier this year. reports from the ground, on some of the extraordinary stories of loss, courage, survival and recovery, that have defined the months since then. When the winds started blowing across Mozambique on the night of March 14, reaching a maximum speed of 195 kilometers per hour, the tin roof was the first thing to blow away at the home of the Mutizo family. Inside the tiny coastal house, held together with pieces of plastic, cardboard, and bricks, 62-year Laurinda, her two adult children, Teresa and Ernesto, together with Teresa’s one-year old baby and the two teenagers the family adopted years ago, hugged and huddled together. In a quick moment, Teresa’s hair salon, adjoining their house, simply flew away, she told . Moments later, it was Ernesto’s business shop, where the cyclone destroyed the copy machine and computer he had invested in, with the precious savings he had managed to put away, working as a barber. The family hoped their remaining source of livelihood, the two little where Laurinda grew rice, would survive, but in the morning, they found out that had been destroyed as well. As the Mutizos realized their livelihoods had vanished, many other families came to the same conclusion. The deadly cyclones had left behind only debris where there had been businesses. According to UN, Cyclone Idai affected 1.85 million people in the provinces of Inhambane, Manica, Tete, Zambézia and Sofala. In the bustling coastal city of Beira in particular, 90% of all the infrastructure was damaged. Pledging conference falls short Just six weeks later, as people struggled to recover, a second devastating monster storm - Cyclone Kenneth hit the northern provinces of Cabo Delgado and Nampula, affecting more than 400,000 people. Both cyclones were then followed by weeks of torrential rains. At one point, a UN humanitarian worker described the flooded area as “an inland ocean” that was as big as Luxembourg - about 125km by 25km across. Mr. Guterres will begin his mission on Thursday by meeting President Filipe Nyusi, and receive updated briefings from UN agencies in the field, before visiting some of the affected areas. Last month, the country hosted a donors’ conference, hoping to raise $3.2 billion to facilitate the reconstruction of the affected areas. International donors pledged only US$ 1.2 billion. At the time, the UN Secretary-General stated that “this is the moment to translate into concrete gestures our solidarity with a country affected by one of the worst weather-related catastrophes in African history.” For him, the disaster “also warns us about the urgency of tackling climate change.” Resilience, and building back In Mozambique’s second-largest city, Beira, one of the places Mr. Guterres will visit, is the School 25 de Junho. It’s in the neighbourhood where the Mutizos live, although now they sleep in crowded classrooms and eating meals distributed by UN agencies and partners, until they can patch up their damaged home, and move back. The principal of this school is Frederico Francisco. The school now hosts about 5,000 children, aged five to around 14. Organized in three shifts, starting at 6am, boys and girls dressed in dark and light blue uniforms, fill classrooms which take up to 90 students. “Before the cyclone, our priority was to build some bathrooms. We only have one toilet for boys and one for girls”, Mr. Francisco said this week. “But now the roofs are our main concern.” The school has five different pavilions. One was completed last year, built by the community. Windows remain broken and the tin roofs have been blown away, with some pieces that got ripped off, which observed was hanging over the students as they learn maths and sciences under the beating sun. In the middle of the campus, one pavilion survived intact. It opened in February, one month before the cyclone, and was built by , the urban development agency, with admirable consideration given to concerns for resilience to extreme climate events. That’s where Ivanilda Samuel, 10 years old, is studying Portuguese, her favorite subject. She wishes her school had a new roof. But she’s also happy she was back in school after only two weeks. She said she was “very scared” during the cyclone and getting back in class, with all her friends, helped her not think of that night. As Ivanilda tried to get back to normal life, so have most Mozambicans. The Mutizos are preparing “bolinhos”, a fried butter pastry, which they sell on the street with other candy. Beira was cleaned up, with the help of more than 40 trucks made available by private companies. In the areas most affected by Idai, the distribution of emergency food is coming to an end, after a period of three months and some extensions. The same is happening at the end of July in the districts hit by Kenneth. The World Food Programme ( ) emergency coordinator for Idai, Peter Rodrigues, said the agency has reached about 1.6 million people so far. In the second phase of food distribution, which will last until next crop season, around March 2020, WFP will help “around 600,000 to 700,000 more vulnerable people”, at a cost of US$110 million. Right now, all the temporary housing is being closed down. In Beira, there are around 46,000 people still living in 15 permanent resettlement camps. In the areas that have been badly affected by the second cyclone, there around 1,300 displaced in camps. Hortênsia Arnaldo Abreu Júlio, 26, and her three children are one of the families who are not going home. She lived in Mataquari, a neighborhood in Beira, but her house got completely destroyed. “I have nothing left to go back for”, she told us. When the cyclone hit, she and her kids, ages 5 to 11, moved to her mother’s place. When that house became unsafe, they took refuge in her brother’s car for a couple of days. She then lived in a temporary shelter at a school and was then moved to one in a community center. I prayed for a house and a piece of land. A place where I and my sons could be safe -  She says she “no longer had a way to find something to feed the children.” At these centers, she could “have something to feed them, at least a little bit of rice, flour, beans, something that we could eat.” She was then given a permanent place to live in the Mandruzi camp, some 40 minutes north of Beira, along with some 375 other families. They live in tents given by the UN Refugee Agency, , International Organization for Migration, , and other partners. Many come from villages that flood constantly and were deemed no longer safe to live in. Hortênsia’s three children have started having classes again at the camp supported by the UN, but she worries it’s not “a permanent school”, where they’ll get a certificate for their studies and progress in classes. She shows us around, and her tent is perfectly organized, with a division in the middle, and clothes perfectly folded and organized in little piles: there are pots and pans by the entrance closer to the fire, which she lights a few times a day to cook the rice and beans she’s given. Around the tent, she has been able to cultivate about a dozen different varieties of vegetable, in just a few short weeks. There are beans, sweet potatoes, onions, and she has even started harvesting some greens. Dreaming of a house again “A piece of land has always been my dream”, she says. She said she “cried a lot” after the cyclone, when her kids had to sleep with dozens of strangers in crowded rooms. “I prayed for a house and a piece of land. A place where I and my sons could be safe.” At the camp, she started dreaming about a house again. She’s hoping for materials and then she would build it herself. It was also at the camp that she discovered she has the name of a flower, hydrangeas, and marveled at how pretty they are when shown pictures on a smartphone. “Maybe one day I’ll plant them in front of my house”, she said. “Can you imagine, after all this, having a house and flowers? People wouldn’t believe it.”

467-> Bonn: At UN climate conference, Congo Basin youth spotlight their work protecting fragile forest ecosystem
Youth groups working in Africa’s Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and it is high time their voices were heard, a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 23) in Bonn, Germany, said Thursday. Youth groups working in Africa’s Congo Basin countries are supporting economic progress in isolated rural communities while protecting the forest, and it is high time their voices were heard, a young woman at the United Nations Climate Change Conference ( ) in Bonn, Germany, said Thursday. “Young people in the Congo Basin have been doing things on the ground that often go ignored,” explained Marie Tamoifo, President of the Cameroon Green Youth Association (Association de la Jeunesse verte du Cameroun – AJVC) and Regional Coordinator of the Youth Network for sustainable management of forest ecosystems in Central Africa (Réseau des jeunes pour la gestion durable des écosystèmes forestiers d’Afrique centrale - REJEFAC) in an interview with . REJEFAC brings together youth organizations from 10 Congo Basin countries – Burundi, Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe and Chad). Its aim is to promote the effective participation of young environmental actors in decision-making in the Congo Basin and “to contribute to the emergence in the region of a new type of leadership, more sensitive and open to the requirements of sustainable development.” “[As for] actions on the ground, there are reforestation, awareness and education programmes for young people. It's about strengthening the work that is done by governments,” said Ms. Tamoifo. A solar panel programme in isolated communities For several years, AJVC has been developing a programme in Cameroon for the electrification of isolated rural areas with solar panels. The programme started in 15 pilot communities in the east, in the center and in the far north of the country with the installation of solar panels in homes and schools. A contribution is made by the community itself, representing 25 to 30 per cent of the cost. “In these 15 communities, we trained 85 young people in solar installation techniques but also in psycho-socio-organizational methodology," explained Ms Tamoifo. “When we arrive in a community, we first hold a discussion with that community. We try to see with [them] what the glaring problems are.” The youth participating in this programme are from the community. They are trained and they provide maintenance for the solar panels that have already been installed. “For now, they are not really paid. They receive a small allowance,” added Ms.Tamoifo. The association needs more financial support to maintain and expand this programme. "We have received more than 100 requests from villages and we cannot answer them given [our] modest means. And young people who are trained today also need to make a living to be able to continue this work,” she said. A ‘climate caravan’ in Cameroon Among other actions carried out by young people in the Congo Basin region, the REJEFAC Coordinator mentioned a tree planting initiative by volunteers in the Republic of Congo, and a programme focusing on handicrafts and conservation of natural resources in Rwanda. Before coming to COP 23, the network organized a 'climate caravan' in Cameroon with the participation of young people from the ten countries of the Congo Basin to show what youth organizations are doing in terms of sustainable development and protection of the planet. "We organized this caravan which was named ‘the COP at home,’” said the Coordinator of REJEFAC. Young people have been designated as climate ambassadors. The ‘climate caravan’ travelled in the Douala region, coastal areas and went to Equatorial Guinea. “It showed how we could talk about the theoretical aspect and go on the ground to experience the realities of conservation parks and conflicts between humans and elephants,” concluded Ms. Tamoifo.

468-> UN staff support youth-driven global action on climate crisis
Staff at UN Headquarters in New York joined untold numbers of students, scientists, organized labour, and everyday people worldwide, who took to the streets on Friday, demanding action to address climate change. The global climate strike was inspired by weekly demonstrations held by the Swedish teen activist Greta Thunberg, and UN workers gathered in front of the Secretariat to show support for the Secretary-General’s efforts to bring about a greener future for all people. Ms. Thunberg is attending the schoolchildren-led march in New York, but millions of people of all ages have already joined children across the world in demonstrations, from the south Pacific region, to the west coast of the United States. UN chief António Guterres told students attending the annual ceremony marking the , observed on 21 September, that they are making a difference. “Like the millions who all over the world are demonstrating today in favour of peace with nature, your presence here today is very important for our work,” he said. Join me on my journey to Pacific islands on the frontlines of the climate crisis and meet some inspiring climate activists in this exclusive 360 video experience:  Climate change is indeed a youth issue, as the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development ( ) said in its . Nearly one billion of the global population aged 15 to 24, live in developing countries, according to . Around half, or just under 500 million, live in rural areas. “Countries with large youth populations are typically poor and still heavily agricultural, which is one of the sectors most directly affected by climate change,” the report stated. “Countries in West and Central Africa – notably the Central African Republic, Guinea Bissau and Sierra Leone – are in this position. These countries are also in the midst of post-conflict or fragile situations, making it all the more pressing to address the challenge of youth inclusion.” There is also a gender dimension to the climate crisis. As pointed out in a tweet posted on Friday: Taking #ClimateAction is also taking action to realize women's rights. While climate change affects everyone, the agency said it is the world’s poorest—especially women and girls—who suffer most following devastating storms, drought and other conditions brought on by extreme weather conditions. “Often, they are the last to eat or be rescued; they face greater health and safety risks as water and sanitation systems become compromised; and they take on increased domestic and care work as resources dwindle,” according to a recent UN Women . More than 700 young people are expected to take part in the UN Youth Climate Summit on Saturday, to showcase their solutions to address what the UN believes is the defining issue of our time. For UN Youth Envoy Jayathma Wickramanayake, the nearly two billion young people worldwide are “crucial” to the planet’s future. “Young people want and deserve a role in what should be a participatory process and the school strikes for climate action were born out of their desire to make global leaders aware of and act on their concerns,” she told ahead of the event. “They have a stake in the future as this is the planet they will inherit; it is they who will bear the impact of a changing climate.”

469-> CLIMATE CHANGE FOCUS: In Bhutan, nature and people benefit
Farmers in the mountain kingdom of Bhutan are being helped by the UN to boost their livelihoods using their traditional knowledge while protecting the country’s varied biodiversity. The farmers, mostly women in low-altitude and hard-to-access villages, possess unique knowledge of over 200 local plant species, such as mountain ginger and rhododendron, which can be used in the manufacture of essential oils, lip balms, organic candles, bio-soaps and other high-value products. A project supported by the United Nations Development Programme ( ), aims to further study and harness the potential of these plants, train the farmers on biodiversity protection, and then develop products for sale in lucrative domestic and international markets. on how benefits are ploughed backed into communities, incentivizing them to conserve and sustainably use their natural resources.

Tens of thousands of drought-resistant trees are being planted with the support of the UN in the Lake Chad region to restore vegetation cover around the lake, help farmers adapt to climate change, and support women's economic initiatives. Lake Chad - which originally reached from Chad into Nigeria, Cameroon and Niger - has lost 90 per cent of its surface area due largely to unsustainable water management and climate change. The UN Development Programme project ( ) is helping hold back the advance of the Sahara desert and provide the conditions for local people to farm sustainably, boost the availability of food and carry out income-generating activities. about how the UN is working to reverse the decline of Lake Chad.

471-> Multilateralism must weather ‘challenges of today and tomorrow’ Guterres tells Paris Peace Forum
In a speech to the in Paris on Monday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that to thrive, multilateralism had to adapt, mindful that “conflicts persist, creating suffering and displacement: our world is unsettled”.  He was speaking as commemorations took place in countries across the world, marking the official end of the First World War, in 1918. Drawing parallels with the geopolitical landscape in the early 20th Century, Mr. Guterres described today’s world as neither bipolar, unipolar, nor multipolar, but rather “chaotic and uncertain”. Prevention ‘more indispensable than ever’ Today, he said, conflicts are not between sovereign States, but rather consist of asymmetrical conflicts, in which countries are often pitted against non-State actors. When third-party states interfere, these conflicts take on a regional dimension, continued Mr. Guterres, at a time when relations between the most powerful countries are dysfunctional, and with a that is frequently paralysed. The UN chief declared that conflict prevention is more indispensable than ever, citing growing links to a new form of global terrorism, as seen in Libya and the Lake Chad region, and the danger of nuclear proliferation. He called for the root causes to be addressed, as well as the prevention of new tensions and conflicts. Mr. Guterres explained that international cooperation is the only way to solve these issues, which is why crisis prevention and mediation, as well as a framework for fighting violent extremism, and reinforcing peace and international security, are at the heart of his UN reforms. Five fault-lines that threaten the world The world is facing five major risks, declared the Secretary-General. Firstly, an economic, technological and geostrategic fault line. This sees the planet divided in two, with the two largest economies dividing the world between them, each imposing their own financial and economic rules on their spheres of influence. At the , Secretary-General says multilateralism is key to address the root causes of conflict, to prevent rising tensions and the eruption of new conflicts.  Read his full remarks (in French):   "We must do all we can to avoid this ‘Great Fracture’ and preserve a global system, a universal economy that respects international law, a multipolar world with solid multilateral institutions”. The second risk lies in the social contract between citizens and governments, leading to a wave of demonstrations around the world, said Mr Guterres, which demonstrates a growing distrust in institutions and political leaders. “The people are suffering”, he declared, “and want to be heard”. This leads to a third risk, said the UN chief: a solidarity gap, and rise in inward-looking attitudes, in which the most vulnerable – minorities, refugees, migrants, women and children – are the first to suffer: “Fear of foreigners is being used for political ends. Intolerance and hatred are becoming commonplace. People who have lost everything are being blamed for all the world's ills. This exacerbates the polarization of political life and the risk of divided societies”. The fourth risk, Mr. Guterres spelled out, is the climate crisis, a “race against time for the survival of our civilization, a race that we are losing”. The UN chief described record temperatures, receding icecaps, expanded deserts, and destructive storms, such as those he has witnessed as UN chief in Dominica, Mozambique and the Bahamas It’s not too late to act “If we fail to act now”, said Mr. Guterres, “history will remember that we had all the means needed to fight back, but that we chose to do nothing”. However, he continued, solutions exist and if countries find the political will to act, honour pledges to cut emissions, and mobilize funding for sustainable development, catastrophe can be averted. A technological divide, declared Mr. Guterres, is the fifth emerging global fault-line, because, whilst new technology has the potential to be a powerful tool for peace and sustainable development, it can also increase risk and accelerate inequalities. Solutions outlined by the Secretary-General include education systems that integrate lifelong learning, because “we must no longer simply learn, but learn how to learn.” Overcome hate, together Turning to the rise of hate speech and the manipulation of information, Mr. Guterres said that he plans to make the UN a place in which governments, companies, researchers and civil society can meet to “define together the red lines and best practice rules”. We must do all we can to preserve a global system that respects international law, a multipolar world with solid multilateral institutions  The threat of cyber-attacks and a new “cyber-arms” race involving killer robots and autonomous weapons must also be tackled, warned Mr. Guterres, who said that “machines that have the power and discretion to kill without human intervention are politically unacceptable and morally despicable”. The world must instead ensure, said the UN chief, that artificial intelligence is used to guarantee that everyone can live in dignity, peace and prosperity. Multilateralism must “adapt to challenges of today and tomorrow” The Secretary-General concluded his speech with a vision of multilateralism, that can adapt to the challenges of today and tomorrow, and make the UN more effective and agile. Multilateralism, he said, must be networked, and close to the people, working hand in hand with regional organizations, but also with international financial institutions, development banks and specialized agencies. It must also be inclusive, he added, with the full participation of civil society, including young people, business, academic and philanthropic circles, and tackle gender equality, an issue that the UN is addressing, with a strategy to achieve parity well before 2030. The UN chief called for a “sustained strategic vision” to solve the world’s interdependent and long-term challenges, noting that the international community has shown, in the past, that it can come together and rise to the occasion: “So let us fight, fight and not give up”.

472-> Climate change recognized as ‘threat multiplier’, UN Security Council debates its impact on peace
As climate change is increasingly recognized as a “threat multiplier” by scientists, political representatives, and civil society across the world, the United Nations Security Council held an open debate on Friday to discuss its concrete impact on peace and security, and focus on tangible ways to diminish the effects of global warming. “The relationship between climate-related risks and conflict is complex and often intersects with political, social, economic and demographic factors,” said , the Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs in her opening remarks. “The risks associated with climate-related disasters do not represent a scenario of some distant future. They are already a reality for millions of people around the globe – and they are not going away,” she stressed. The meeting took place almost two months after 197 parties to the UN Climate Change Convention on implementing the 2015 – which aims to keep global warming under 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels – and ahead of the , convened for 23 September this year. Climate risk: to debate or not to debate? Whether climate change is an issue that should be examined by the UN’s peace and security body to begin with, has been the subject of controversy. Some Member States believe that this is stepping on the toes of other UN entities, specifically mandated with taking a lead on social and economic development, or environmental protection. The risks associated with climate-related disasters do not represent a scenario of some distant future. They are already a reality for millions of people around the globe, and they are not going away –  The first ever meeting of the examining the linkages between climate change and insecurity happened in April 2007. Since then, the UN body has increasingly taken steps that effectively acknowledge that the two issues are related: in July 2011, another open debate on the matter was held; in March 2017, resolution 2349 was adopted highlighting the need to address climate-related risks in order to tackle the conflict in the Lake Chad basin; and in July 2018, a debate was held on “understanding and addressing climate-related security risks”. In a sign of how important the discussion is to many countries, the debate was attended by over 70 Member States and included statements in the Council chamber from a dozen Ministers, including Kuwait, Belgium, Indonesia, Germany and Poland. ‘Keeping up with the challenge’ After citing the various ways in which UN political missions, regional or country-based, are already actively seeking ways to address climate-related security risks, Ms. DiCarlo insisted on the need to focus on three key areas: “Most important, for all of us, is the recognition that deeds must follow words. Major armies and businesses have long recognized the need to prepare for climate-related risks, rightfully assessing climate change as a threat multiplier,” said the UN Political Affairs chief. “We cannot lag behind. We must act now, with a sense of urgency and a commitment to place people, especially those most marginalized and vulnerable, at the centre of our efforts,” she stated.  The Administrator of the UN Development Programme ( ), , also delivered remarks, by phone. An environmentalist by training, he noted that climate change is “not only affecting the atmosphere, but also the biosphere”, and that the world is “not keeping up with the challenge.” He called on the Security Council to recognize the science and empirical evidence, leverage all possible measures that can slow global warming, and invest in climate adaptation and risk reduction for the millions of people already suffering from the effects of climate change. Mr. Steiner cited some of the hundreds of projects carried out by in some 140 countries, including a water management system in the Maldives, the development of a vulnerability index to facilitate preparedness, and a financial support scheme for vulnerable households in the Caribbean. Scientists and youth to advise the Council For the first time in history, the UN World Meteorological Organization ( ) was invited to brief the members of the Security Council on climate and extreme weather issues. Professor Pavel Kabat, Chief Scientist at the brought some clear scientific data to the table, to inform the debate. “Climate change has a multitude of security impacts - rolling back the gains in nutrition and access to food; heightening the risk of wildfires and exacerbating air quality challenges; increasing the potential for water conflict; leading to more internal displacement and migration,” he said. “It is increasingly regarded as a national security threat.” He noted that WMO stands ready to support the UN and Member States with “cutting-edge science” and “expert information” so informed decisions can be made. Before the floor was opened to Members of the Security Council, a youth representative and a researcher on environmental security, Lindsay Getschel, was also invited to speak. She came to the meeting with three key asks for the UN body: She finished by reminding those present in the room that many across the world “do not have the luxury to not care about this issue,” and called on world leaders to “live up to their words.”

473-> UN chief appoints Luis Alfonso de Alba as Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Summit
United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday the appointment of Luis Alfonso de Alba of Mexico as his Special Envoy for the 2019 Climate Summit. Mr. de Alba will be the task of providing “leadership, guidance and strategic direction” towards Summit and will be engaging key strategic climate change leaders, including governments, and coalitions, to galvanize climate action ahead of the event. The 2019 Climate Summit will be held with the objective of building momentum, enhancing national ambition, as set out in the 2015 . Bringing together Heads of State and Government, business leaders, academics and scientists, youth, civil society representatives, local leaders and the UN system, it will aim to accelerate implementation of climate action worldwide. Mr. de Alba will work closely with Robert Orr, Special Adviser on Climate Change, as well as Peter Thomson, Special Envoy for the Ocean, Michael Bloomberg, Special Envoy for Climate Action and other UN senior officials. Prior to this appointment, he served since September 2017 as Mexico’s Under-Secretary for Latin America and the Caribbean.  Appointed Ambassador in 2001, he brings experience as Permanent Representative of Mexico to the Organization of American States, the International Organizations in Vienna, the UN, and other international organizations in Geneva, among others. As Mexico’s Special Representative for Climate Change, Mr. de Alba led negotiations for the 2010 UN Climate Change Conference (COP16) in Cancún, Mexico.  He also held several elected positions including Vice-President of the Economic and Social Council (2012) and First President of the in Geneva (2006-2007).  A diplomat since 1983, he undertook various other assignments at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Mexico. As the world is gearing up for the 24th Conference of the Parties in Katowice, to be held from 3 to 14 December this year, Mr. de Alba will play a key role in galvanizing international support for climate action ahead of the discussions.

474-> FROM THE FIELD: Comoros farmers battle climate change
Farmers in the Comoros islands are learning, with the support of the UN, to adapt to dramatic shifts in the climate which have contributed to the deterioration of agriculture across the Indian Ocean archipelago. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns including a severe decrease in rainfall have led to soil erosion and widespread deforestation as well as decreased crop yields. A UN climate change expert panel determined in a on Monday that the world needs to move much faster and more dramatically, if global warming is to be contained to anything like the levels demanded by the 2015 . The Comoros sits some 300 kilometres off the coast of East Africa and is amongst the most underdeveloped countries in the world. But now, a project backed by UN Environment has been launched to plant 350,000 trees per year across the three islands of the archipelago, in the hope that reforestation will protect the environment and boost development there.

475-> COP24: green, gender focus, as UN's crucial climate change conference gets underway
,  the two-week 24th conference of the parties of the United Nations Climate Change Convention ( ), started on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, with a special focus on carbon neutrality and gender equality. Days after the on the unprecedented levels of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, the world is gathering to define how the 2015 will be implemented and moved forward. Under the agreement, all countries have committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to limit the global average rise in temperature to well below 2°C, and as close as possible to 1.5°C. Cycling for the planet Kicking off the two-week event in Katowice, which has historically been a coal-mining town in the south of Poland, a on electric bikes arrived from Vienna, having biked 600 km to demonstrate the value of renewable energy to reducing emissions. The expedition was supported by the , a group of private sector companies committed to sustainable development. The cycling team, called “Moving for Climate NOW”, made up of about 40 people from different institutions and countries, was welcomed by UN Climate Change Deputy Executive Secretary, Ovais Sarmad, and Jakub Gibek, Head of the Climate Policy Unit of the Ministry of Environment of Poland. “I commend the cyclists involved in this bike tour for inspiring the world to move in the right direction to fulfil the promise of the Paris Agreement," said Mr. Sarmad. "This is the most important COP since the signing of the agreement, and we need initiatives like yours to testify that governments, the private sector and individuals can work together to tackle climate change by committing to multilateralism.” A green conference To limit ’s footprint and achieve carbon neutrality locally, the conference organisers have taken a series of different measures. First, public transportation in the city is free of charge for the duration of the conference, for all participants. In addition, reusable materials have been used to set up the conference rooms, including carpets and backdrops. Recycled cardboard furniture was installed in all the main meeting spaces. The conference will also enforce a strict waste management policy: distinct recycling bins will be available in all meeting rooms; the packaging of electronic equipment has been saved and will be reused after the conference is over; the packaging of catering products is environmentally friendly; single-use plastic products are limited across the space; and overall, the conference is dispensing with paper as much as possible, with official documents available only in digital versions. To limit greenhouse emissions from vehicles, "virtual" participation is being encouraged and supported through . Unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions due to the event will be tracked through a rigorous calculation by the organisers based on international standards. It is anticipated that COP24 will generate approximately 55,000 tons of CO2. To offset this, the Polish Government has committed to planting more than 6 million trees, capable of absorbing the equivalent of the conference’s emissions in the next 20 years. Focusing on gender Adopted at the previous COP, the Gender Action Plan (GAP) promotes the mainstreaming of gender into climate policy and action at all levels. Half-way into the implementation of the GAP, parties, observers and the Convention Secretariat the measures they have taken to date. Regarding the gender representation in the conference itself, the UNFCCC Secretariat has been monitoring since 2013 gender balance in technical and decision-making bodies established under the Convention. For the first time this year, more than half of these bodies have female representation of 38 per cent or more. Furthermore, there is a record number of female delegates elected to the position of Chair or Co-Chair of these bodies – nine out of a possible 28 positions. Though these improvements represent steps in the right direction to achieve the goal of gender balance, much remains to be done.  The conference in numbers This 24th COP will be hosting over 28,000 people. The figure includes: close to 13,000 people with the parties to the UNFCCC gathering to negotiate the Paris Agreement work programme, some 450 UN staff, over 7,000 observers from non-governmental organisations, and 1,500 media representatives. In addition to over 6,000 staff, the conference is employing about 500 volunteers. The conference space built by the Polish Government over the past six months, covers an area of close to 100,000 square meters. Nearly 2,000 people worked on its construction and outfitting. Well over 100 events will highlight action in transport, water, land-use, energy, the fashion industry, to name a few, representing the wide spectrum of climate action. They will include CEOs, mayors, governors and other leaders from civil society at large. On Monday, the grand opening ceremony will take place with about 40 heads of State and heads of Government in attendance, as well as UN Secretary-General, António Guterres.

476-> Monsoon rains turn millions of children’s lives ‘upside down’ across South Asia
Heavy rainfall, severe flooding and landslides across Nepal, India and Bangladesh have killed at least 93 children, and put the lives of millions more at risk, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), which is “responding urgently”. "Millions of children have seen their lives turned upside down by the torrential rainfall, flooding and landslides," Jean Gough, Regional Director for South Asia, said on Thursday. ⛈️ Extreme weather. 🏝️ Rising sea levels. 🚱Severe drought. 🌊 Floods. 🌩️ Hurricanes. 🔥 Wildfires. ⚠️ Natural disasters. 🌀 Cyclones.  This is the link between climate change and displacement. Estimates reveal that more than 12 million people have been affected so far. "As the rains continue, these numbers are only likely to grow," she added. Damage to roads, bridges and railways has rendered many areas inaccessible, and children are in urgent need of clean water, hygiene supplies, food and safe play spaces in evacuation centres. On the ground, UNICEF is working in close coordination with respective governments and humanitarian partners from the three countries to scale up its responses for affected children and their families. “UNICEF is , working with local authorities and partners to ensure children are kept safe, and provided the support needed”, Ms. Gough assured. Country-by-country toll In India, more than 10 million people have been affected in north-eastern states, including more than 4.3 million children. As the situation develops, these numbers are only likely to increase. While parts of the country have been suffering from heavy rainfall and flooding, other parts are still reeling from the aftermath of severe heat and water deficit, affecting almost half of the country. Turning to Nepal, of an estimated 68,650 temporarily displaced people, 28,702 are children. Some 88 people have died so far, including 47 children. At least 31 people are missing, and 41 others have been injured, according to the latest Government reports. Moreover, in central and eastern Nepal, nearly 12,000 households have been temporarily displaced. Extreme weather consequences: In Bangladesh, monsoon rains continue to impact most of the country, particularly the central-northern and south-east regions, where more than two million people have been affected by flooding, including over 700,500 children. Estimates reveal that 367,340 houses have been damaged or destroyed and 1,865 schools affected by flood waters. Cox's Bazar in the south-east of the country, home to more than a million Rohingya refugees, has also been heavily hit. Children pay ‘the heaviest price’ While individual extreme weather events cannot specifically be attributed to climate change, said , the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather – including recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving fronts – are in line with predictions of how human activity is influencing the global climate. In addition to death and devastation, such events contribute to the increased spread of malnutrition, malaria and diarrhea, among other major killers. "Across the region, we are seeing the devastating impact of extreme weather events on children and families,” warned Ms. Gough. "As weather events become more extreme, unpredictable and erratic, it is children who are paying the heaviest price.”

477-> #TakeYourSeat at the UN Climate Change Conference: a way for all people to join the global conversation
To bring the voice of the people to the upcoming Climate Change Conference in Poland (known by the shorthand ' ', from 2 to 14 December), the United Nations has the ‘People’s Seat’ initiative, calling millions of change advocates worldwide to submit messages for an address that will be delivered to leaders attending the conference, by renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough. “This is an opportunity for people from across the globe, regardless of their nationality or circumstances, to be part of the most important discussion of this century; the unprecedented action needed to reach the targets,” said Sir David Attenborough. “I encourage everyone to take their seats and to add their voice so that the People’s Address truly represents a mix of voices from across the world,” he added. The ‘People’s Seat’ initiative, launched by the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), calls for inputs for the address to be delivered during the opening plenary session of the , by Mr. Attenborough, on 3 December. Everyone and anyone who wants to add their message to voice the urgent need for action, can do so by using the hashtag #TakeYourSeat on Twitter. Michal Kurtyka, Secretary of State of Poland and incoming COP24 President, hailed the initiative, stressing that the conference wants to encourage “openness, listening and the full participation of civil society in global efforts to tackle climate change.” The call for global advocacy comes weeks after the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) issued a showing how urgent and possible it still is to limit global warming to 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels. The report warned that if no action is taken, the world is headed towards a warming of over 3°C. The aim of the COP 24 is to agree on a collective implementation plan for the 2015 , and raise ambitions to achieve its goals. The People’s Address will also trigger the launch of another initiative to engage global citizens: the ‘ActNow’ Bot via the United Nations’ Facebook Messenger account, recommending everyday actions – like taking public transport and eating less meat – and tracking the number of actions taken to highlight the impact that collective action can make on such a critical issue.

478-> Greenhouse gas levels in atmosphere break another record, UN report shows
Levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have reached another new record high, according to issued on Thursday by the United Nations weather agency, which reveals that there is no sign of reversal of this trend, responsible for climate change, sea level rise, ocean acidification and extreme weather. “The science is clear. Without rapid cuts in CO2 and other greenhouse gases, climate change will have increasingly destructive and irreversible impacts on life on Earth. The window of opportunity for action is almost closed,” said World Meteorological Organization ( ) Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. The Greenhouse Gas Bulletin shows that global concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane and nitrous oxide have been increasing steadily over the past years. In addition, the report notes a resurgence of a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-depleting substance called CFC-11, which is regulated under an international agreement to protect the ozone layer.  The WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin reports specifically on atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are what remains in the atmosphere, following a complex process of emissions and absorptions. Since 1990, there has been a 41 per cent increase in the warming effect by the various greenhouse gases on the climate – known as “radioactive forcing.” CO2 specifically accounts for about 82 per cent of the increase in radioactive forcing over the past decade, according to figures quoted in the WMO report.  “The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, when the temperature was 2 to 3°C warmer and sea level was 10 to 20 meters higher than now,” said Mr. Taalas.  The WMO report comes on top of the evidence presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ) special issued in October, which sounded the alarm on the need to reach zero net emissions of CO2 by mid-century, in order to keep temperature increases to below 1.5°C. The report showed how keeping temperature increases below 2°C could reduce the risks for the well-being of the planet and its people.  “CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer. There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere,” warned WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova. “Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases,” she insisted.  This new report adds yet another building block of scientific evidence to inform decision-making at the upcoming UN climate change conference – the – planned from 2 to 14 December in Poland. The key objective of this meeting is to adopt an implementation plan for the 2015 . Against the backdrop of the sobering report, Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has , telling them they have legal obligations under international human rights law to prevent climate change and try to mitigate its effects. “Human rights are under threat from a force which challenges the foundations of all life, as we know it, on this planet we share," she said, pointing out that the decisions taken CO P24 will govern climate action under the Paris agreement "for the indefinite future," and said that "the rights of the millions of people [are] threatened by climate change."  The global averages presented in the WMO Bulletin are based on a rigorous tracking of the changing levels of greenhouse gases as a result of industrialization, use of fossil fuels, unsustainable agricultural practices, increases in land use and deforestation. The UN calls for urgent actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the national and sub-national levels.

479-> At UN, Jamaica urges partnerships to tackle climate impacts, economic fragility in small islands
Galvanizing an effective global fundraising campaign to address climate change and achieve sustainable economic growth is key for small island developing States, Andrew Holness, Prime Minister of Jamaica, told world leaders at the seventy-third United Nations General Assembly on Thursday. Mr. Holness expressed concerns over his country’s vulnerability to a raft of social, economic, environmental, financial and trade-related hazards. “Together with persistent challenges linked to climate change and more frequent intense weather events; these all impact the pace of our development,” he told world leaders gathered in New York for the Assembly’s annual general debate. As a small island developing state, Jamaica is pursuing policies to secure its economic independence, Mr. Holness said, also stressing the importance for his country to foster traditional partnerships and build new ones. He went on to add that Jamaica’s representation for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) at outreach sessions this year demonstrated “extremely influential groupings of countries.” “Jamaica believes that groupings like these, have a unique opportunity, working alongside the international development partners, to address the problems that face weaker economies across the globe,” said Mr. Holness. Spotlighting that many SIDS are extremely indebted and vulnerable, he highly commended the work of UN ( ) to tackle the gap for middle-income countries. Prime Minister Holness further reiterated his call for collaborative partnerships with international financial institutions, UN member states and the private sector to mobilize funding for Jamaica’s sustainable development. On commemoration of the , Mr. Holness said Jamaica has been the first country to incorporate human rights into their foreign policy strategy, which is a principle that they guard fiercely. .

480-> For Valentine’s Day, UN environment wing is urging everyone to ‘break up’ with single-use plastic
As many countries prepare to mark Valentine’s Day, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is calling on people to end their “toxic relationship” with single-use plastic and find “new love,” with more environmentally sustainable options. In , a short video for its #CleanSeas campaign, the UN environment wing takes a lighter look at the very serious problem of marine litter and urges everyone to give up the use of single-use plastic products such as disposable cutlery, water-bottles, food containers and shopping bags. These environmentally unfriendly products ultimately end up in seas and oceans where they endanger fish, birds, turtles and other creatures who mistake it for food or become entangled. Plastic waste has also entered the human food chain with health consequences that are not yet fully understood. In addition to the impact on human and animal health, such pollution also hurt local businesses such as tourism, not only in areas where the pollutants originated but in far-away places, carried by ocean currents, and washing up on tiny Pacific islands and Arctic and Antarctic regions. The ’s #CleanSeas campaign aims to “turn the tide on plastic” by inspiring action from governments, businesses and individuals on ocean pollution. A simple, conscious, switch to glass or metal tumblers or cups, or carrying a reusable shopping bag can have a lasting impact on ridding the planet from the menace.

481-> Thursday’s Daily Brief: tobacco burn-out, cholera cases down, ‘shifting the needle’ on climate
Among today’s stories: more men are quitting nicotine than ever before, a big drop in cholera cases was recorded between 2017 and 2018, and the UN calls on developed countries to raise their climate ambitions, following the disappointment of COP25. Time to ‘move the dial’ on climate ambition Six days after the originally scheduled closing of COP25, the head of , the UN body tasked with organising the climate conference, has released a acknowledging that developed countries, particularly those responsible for the highest levels of harmful emissions, did not send a clear enough signal that they are ready to improve their climate strategies. Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of UNFCCC (the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change), noted that an agreement on guidelines for a carbon market was not reached: this was a major disappointment, as rules on a universally-agreed carbon market are seen as an essential element for raising climate ambition in the private sector, and generating finance for climate adaptation. “Developed countries”, she said, “have yet to fully address the calls from developing countries for enhanced support in finance, technology and capacity building, without which they cannot green their economies and build adequate resilience to climate change”. Although many positive signs of progress were announced at COP25, such as decisions taken in areas including technology, oceans and agriculture, gender and capacity building, Ms. Espinosa warned that “not enough major economies have signalled that they are ready to shift the needle on climate ambition through improved plans”. Looking forward, Ms, Espinosa called for stakeholders to focus on the next steps, particularly COP26 in Scotland, next November, and further strengthen trust in the multilateral process. Tobacco use falling at last among males, says WHO Two decades of increasing tobacco use around the world are set to go into reverse, UN health experts have said, after publishing data indicating that fewer men and boys are smoking than before. According to the World Health Organization ( ), this is the first time that nicotine product use has begun to fall among men and boys, who represent four in five smokers: around one billion males use tobacco and that number rose by 40 million between the year 2000 and 2018. But thanks to tough Government measures against smoking, the WHO believes that, by 2020, at least two million fewer males will be using tobacco, with a further three million kicking the habit by 2025. Cholera cases decreased globally by 60 per cent in 2018: WHO The UN health agency also announced on Thursday that the number of cholera cases decreased globally by 60 per cent in 2018, compared with 2017. This points to successful prevention and care of the sick in major cholera hotspots, which include Haiti, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. According to data from 34 countries, there were around 500,000 cases of cholera in 2018 and almost 3,000 confirmed deaths - although the true global number is likely to be much higher. Outbreaks are still ongoing in several countries, including war-torn Yemen, where the UN agency says that reporting is “imprecise”. Nonetheless, it still believes that there has been a “significant downward trend” in the transmission of cholera, which affects mainly the people of developing countries who lack access to clean water. Guterres chief praises vital role of Italy UN service centre in peace operations After touring the UN Global Service Centre in Brindisi, Italy,  its work in supporting “some of the most difficult peacekeeping operations” over the last 25 years. The Centre provides critical logistics, technology and training to UN missions, agencies and other parts of the UN system worldwide. The UN chief called the Centre “a key part of the UN’s Department of Operational Support and a vital tool in the service of peace”, and commended the determination of UN personnel to advance innovation, information and communications technologies, engineering and environmental support, and welcomed its efforts to help non-UN partners, such as the African Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Centre “has the tools and the expertise to be effective,” according to Mr. Guterres, who added that “now is also the time to make responsible choices”, particularly “in reducing our carbon footprint in the field”, which means “committing to clean energy, recycling…and other steps that will benefit people and planet alike”. Escape from Nigeria conflict inspires musical of hope And finally, a story of hope from Nigeria, where a theatre production that was inspired by the humanitarian crisis in the country’s north-east, premieres on Thursday. Bintu, the musical, takes its name from a young girl whose dreams of going to university are cut short by armed insurgents. After finding refuge in a camp, Bintu receives international assistance and slowly rebuilds her life. Written and directed by Nigerian playwright Agozie Ugwu, with the help of the World Food Programme ( ), the performance relies on song, dance and poetry to depict people’s struggles and their will to survive – along with the life-saving aid they receive. The show opens in Lagos and transfers to Abuja early next year. “This work goes beyond a theatre piece,” Mr. Ugwu said. “It is a call to action from humanity to help humanity.” To date, conflict between extremists and State forces in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states has driven an estimated two million people from their homes. Nearly three million people struggle to meet their food needs in the three crisis-affected states - almost double the number at the same time last year. In 2019, WFP and partners have served an average of 800,000 people with food or cash every month.

482-> Nature ‘one of most effective ways’ of combatting climate change
Nature is “one of the most effective ways” of combatting climate change and should be part of every country’s climate strategy according to the Executive Director of the UN Environment Programme ( ) Inger Andersen. World leaders will be gathering at the United Nations in New York next week at a convened by the UN and Ms. Andersen will be there to promote the idea of nature-based solutions to combatting climate change. is supporting one of the nine summit action tracks designated by the Secretary-General under the leadership of the Governments of China and New Zealand.  UN News asked Ms. Andersen how nature can help to reverse climate change. The world’s climate is changing rapidly and these changes are evident on a daily basis. Global temperatures are rising, rainfall patterns are changing and the weather in many parts of the world is more erratic and unpredictable than ever before. The effects are widespread; natural habitats are changing, biodiversity is being lost, farming cycles are being disrupted and water stress is becoming more common than not. Natural hazards such as floods, droughts, hurricanes and heatwaves are becoming more extreme and frequent costing countries billions of dollars and destroying homes, infrastructure and livelihoods. The climate crisis is threatening people’s well-being, food security and worsening poverty. In June this year, the UN Secretary-General said the world needs to create conditions for “harmony between humankind and nature.” Nature-based solutions are actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems, that also address societal challenges, thereby simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. So, whether its food security, climate change, water security, human health, disaster risk or economic development, nature can help us find a way. And climate change is a very important part of the solution puzzle. There are many ways to address climate change, but one of the most effective and immediate ways is using what is on our door step… nature. For example, nature-based solutions can focus on reducing emissions from deforestation and agricultural practices and enhancing the ability of natural ecosystems to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Remember, it is carbon dioxide that contributes to the greenhouse gases that lead to global warming. The UN Secretary-General’s Climate Action Summit provides an opportune moment to catapult nature-based solutions to the forefront of climate action. Most nature-based solutions for climate change come from strengthening or restoring existing natural ecosystems. For example, forests don’t just absorb carbon, they also defend us from its most devastating impacts. Carefully planted tree species can act as firebreaks, keeping trees next to farmland can protect crops from the erosive forces of intense rain, and forests can alleviate inland floods due to the sponge-like way they absorb water.  Mangroves provide effective and cheap natural barriers against coastal floods and shoreline erosion. Changing our land practices alone could deliver 30 per cent of the emissions reductions that we need to achieve the goals of the on climate action by 2030. Restoring peatlands and other natural ecosystems are also effective nature-based solutions. Nature is available now and we should use it; there are no quick technological fixes that have the same scale of impact that nature-based solutions offer. In fact, these solutions could deliver more than a third of the emissions reductions needed globally by 2030. Crucially, what is urgently required is an increase in investment to unlock the potential of nature. Right now, these solutions receive less than three per cent of available climate funding, even though they are extremely cost effective. And, they offer a very high return on investment potentially adding trillions of dollars to the global economy. For example, the an ambitious project to reverse desertification in the Sahel region of Africa could create 10 million jobs there by 2030 and have other benefits including slowing migration. These solutions have to be integrated into climate adaptation and mitigation efforts. Globally, governments must align their efforts and commit to investing in these solutions as part of their national policies. nature-based solutions The bottom line is that we cannot limit warming to 1.5°C (or 2°C for that matter) without natural climate solutions. Nature-based solutions have the potential to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by 12 gigatons each year. This is roughly equal to emissions from all the world’s coal fired plants. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind, firstly, that increasing ambition requires us to commit simultaneously to an energy transition and greater investments in nature.  And secondly, if we don’t act on nature now, then nature’s ability to protect humanity will diminish even more. So, nature is on the table as a solution to climate action, but only just and we have to seize the moment. The good news is nature is forgiving and it’s time we gave it the chance it deserves. We are in a period of global emergency, but also in a period of unprecedented momentum. Young people are holding us to account, and every week a government somewhere in the world, commits to climate action. Nature-based solutions are immediately available, cost-effective and can be scaled up depending on need. And every country in the world can act. And we have many examples of success. When the Great Green Wall is completed in 2030, restored land will absorb carbon dioxide equal to keeping all of California’s cars parked for 3½ years. In Niger, farmer-led reforestation has improved tree cover, reducing women’s time in collecting firewood from three hours to 30 minutes. And Medellin in Colombia reduced temperatures by more than 2°C through turning their concrete jungles into urban forests. So, we need to scale up initiatives like this, build on political momentum and deliver at the scale and pace needed to propel us beyond the ambitions of the Paris Agreement because when we give nature a chance, we have a better shot at achieving the .

483-> UN chief praises New Zealand premier’s ‘admirable’ response to Christchurch attacks
Speaking to media in the New Zealand capital Auckland on Sunday, alongside New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, UN Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his solidarity with the victims and families of the March , which killed 51 people, and praised Ms. Ardern’s leadership in the aftermath of the killings. Mr. Guterres pointed out that he normally pays a “solidarity visit” to a Muslim country during Ramadan but, this year, he decided to visit the Muslim community in Christchurch, “to pay tribute to their courage, to their resilience, but also to pay tribute to the extraordinary unity and to the message of solidarity that was given by the people and the government of New Zealand.” During visit to Island States, pays tribute to leading role legislation is playing in and  More on the story here: … The UN chief also expressed his admiration for Ms. Ardern’s rapid and decisive response to the mass shootings, which saw the Government immediately take measures to significantly strengthen gun control legislation, and her call to prevent hate speech on social media and the Internet. Ms. Ardern’s appeals and leadership, he added, were extremely important in the context of the UN initiatives to fight hate speech, and to better support countries in the protection of holy sites. New Zealand ‘on frontline’ of climate action The Secretary-General's visit to New Zealand is part of a tour of the Pacific Island States in which the  urgent issue of climate change figures strongly : in his remarks to the press,  Mr Guterres thanked New Zealand for its leading stance in combatting the “climate emergency,” and the country's support for the Pacific Island States, which he described as being on the frontline of the dramatic impacts of climate change. “I’ll be visiting Fiji, Tuvalu and Vanuatu and conveying a very strong message from the Pacific to the rest of the world: we absolutely must catch up, we absolutely must be able to stop this dramatic trend, to reverse this dramatic trend. We cannot allow runaway climate change. We need to protect the lives of all people and we need to protect our planet.” The Secretary-General also noted New Zealand’s introduction of legislation to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050, and keep global warming to 1.5 degrees by the end of the century, a goal reiterated by the scientific community in a released in October 2018, described at the time by Mr. Guterres as “an ear-splitting wake-up call.” However, he said that political will has been fading in other countries, even though they are conscious of the need to act, which is one of the reasons for launching a special to be held at UN Headquarters in New York in September.

484-> COP25: Support business efforts to tackle climate change, urges Guterres
The UN Secretary-General has called on business and civil society leaders to press Governments into articulating policies that support private sector efforts to address climate change. António Guterres issued the charge on Wednesday in a speech to the annual Caring for Climate Meeting, held during the on-going UN COP25 climate conference in Madrid. The magnitude of the climate emergency is jeopardizing our future and life as we know it. I have come back to to appeal for a successful conclusion of the conference and increased and ambition. “I’m meeting more and more business leaders that complain that they cannot do more because governments will not allow them to do so, because of the environment that is still created in the bureaucratic, administrative, tax regulatory and other frameworks that are under government control”, he said. Business sector fights climate change mobilizes business leaders to implement and recommend solutions and policies to beat climate change. It was launched in 2007 and is convened by the , the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), and the UN Environment Programme ( ). With the climate crisis increasingly jeopardizing life on the planet, the Secretary-General stressed that more collective action will be needed from governments, regions, cities, businesses and civil society. “While we see some incremental steps towards sustainable business models, it is nowhere near the scope or scale required”, he said. “What we need is not an incremental approach, but a transformational approach. And we need businesses to unite behind the science by taking rapid and ambitious action across their operations and value chains.” The “science” refers to the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, in line with the 2015 on climate change. This will require reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming, by 45 per cent by 2030, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Business and finance cannot act alone Business and financial leaders have been doing their part to beat climate change, as the Secretary-General acknowledged. He was encouraged that 170 major companies have committed to set scientific, verifiable emission reduction targets through the ‘Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees’ campaign. However, he said the business and financial sectors cannot act alone. Next year, many governments will present plans to reduce their emissions, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement.  Mr. Guterres forecast that these enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions ( ) will include carbon neutral strategies and green initiatives in sectors such as energy, industry, construction and transport. “In support of these efforts, I am calling on you, leaders from the private sector and civil society, to challenge your Governments to use this opportunity to make clear their economic development policies that will enable your companies to invest decisively in a net-zero future,” he said. The UN chief added that millions worldwide, particularly young people, recognize that more must be done to limit the worst impacts of climate disruption. “That’s why they are calling on leaders from all sectors to do exponentially more to address the climate emergency,” he said. “We are quickly nearing our last opportunity to be on the right side of history.” In his speech to the COP's  high-level event,  the Secretary-General  urged the world’s biggest emitters to do more on climate. “If we do not reach carbon neutrality by 2050, all our current efforts to promote sustainable development will be undermined,” he said. Mr, Guterres also laid out 10 priorities to tackle the climate crisis.  They including  securing commitments from the main emitters of more ambitious national commitments by 2020, ensuring that all governments follow the example of the 75 countries that committed to coming forward by next year with net zero emissions strategies for 2050, and ensuring that national commitments include a just transition for people whose jobs and livelihoods are affected in the transition to a green economy.  Greta Thunberg’s visit The teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg was at the UN conference on Wednesday, urging participants to focus on the science behind climate change. She explained it was important to keep to the 1.5-degree threshold “because even at one degree, people are dying from the climate crisis.” “Because that is what the united science calls for, to avoid destabilizing the climate so that we have the best possible chance to avoid setting off irreversible chain reactions such as melting glaciers, polar ice and thawing arctic permafrost. Every fraction of a degree matters.” Ms. Thunberg at the UN’s Climate Action Summit in September that they were “failing” her generation, by not taking action to ease the climate crisis fast enough, and on Wednesday, the 16-year-old Swede who founded the school strike movement, was named by TIME magazine as their 2019 Person of the Year. The UN Secretary-General has welcomed this acknowledgement  of young people's role in climate action, his deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told journalists in New York. "As I understand it, this is a recognition of the effect that youth have been having on this debate, and the Secretary‑General has been very clear about the need for the world's leaders to listen to youth.  It is their world that we are currently damaging through our inaction and our delayed action.  One day, they will be the inheritors of the world that we have left for them, and we need to make sure that we have done right by them.  And it's good to see recognition, both of the powerful role they can have when they make their voices heard and of the importance of listening to them," he said.

485-> UN launches new global data collection tool to help reduce disaster, losses taking ‘a huge toll’
The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) kicked off on Thursday a historic new effort to collect comprehensive global data on disaster losses. “It is impossible to prevent disasters and to manage risk if a country is not measuring its disaster losses, particularly at the local level, for both small-scale and large-scale events,” said the Secretary-General’s newly appointed Special Representative of the for Disaster Risk Reduction, Mami Mizutori. “Such losses are a great setback for efforts to eradicate poverty,” she added. The for Disaster Risk Reduction – the first major agreement of the post-2015 development agenda – launched its online tool: The . This tool captures data on the achievement of the Framework’s five targets of reducing mortality from disasters; the numbers of disaster affected people; economic losses; and reducing damage to critical infrastructure; along with recording the number of countries with national and local strategies for disaster risk reduction. “The Sendai Framework Monitor will provide inputs to the first report on achieving progress on implementing the [SDGs] in July,” Ms. Mizutori said in a statement marking the launch. In a world where climate change and extreme weather events contribute to pushing 26 million people into poverty every year, she underscored “improving how we manage risk is vital and this requires a deeper understanding of where these losses are occurring and not just for major internationally recorded events.” “The silent, small-recurring events, such as floods and droughts can take a huge toll on communities which lack essential health services and other coping capacities,” she concluded.

486-> Paradise islands of Pacific increasingly vulnerable to climate change, as UN boosts resilience
A seeming paradise, life on the Pacific islands is threatened by climate change and extreme weather, frustrated by remoteness and a lack of educational and economic opportunities. Secretary-General António Guterres begins a visit to the region this weekend, where he will speak to people living on some of the islands and see for himself how the UN is helping to mitigate some of the biggest issues. Simona Marinescu is the UN Resident Coordinator for the 28 islands that make up Samoa, Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. Speaking to UN News ahead of the Secretary-General’s visit, she described some of the issues facing the region, including how to get young people to gain more schooling and skills to get or start their own businesses on the islands – and how to make the islands more enticing for businesses. Ms. Marinescu by describing a trip to Tokelau, whose farthest island is 50 hours away by boat form Samoa. The greatest threat to the way of life in the Pacific is climate change. Ms. Marinescu said one of the main concerns for Governments in the region is keeping the balance between access to finance and tools for adapting to climate change, while also growing their economies. Many of the small island Pacific nations are developing, and once they “graduate” to middle-income, doors to financing mechanisms close. “They are proud to graduate,” said Ms. Marinescu. “However, they still remain fragile. They remain exposed to climate change. So a big debate right now is how we can decouple graduation from access to major funding streams that help them build resilience.” Samoa, for example, jumped from the Least Developed Country to Developing status in 2014. It also received $65 million; one of the largest country allocations from the Green Climate Fund, for a six-year project on flood management – which means building seawalls and river walls to protect housing, and rethinking housing design. Mr. Guterres will begin his visit to the region starting in Auckland, New Zealand, on Sunday. Follow all the highlights on UN News.

487-> As COP25 goes into the night, Guterres calls for more climate ambition
With national delegations thrashing out an outcome agreement at the UN COP25 climate change conference in Madrid, the UN chief has called on countries to be more ambitious, side strongly with science, and commit to stronger action. “Today is the last day of the COP25 in Madrid”, said . “And I appeal to the delegates of all Member States to convey a message of ambition to the world”. He urged all to align “their objectives with science” to make sure that “temperatures will not rise above 1.5C at the end of the century”. On the last day of I appeal to countries to send a message of ambition to the world - to align their climate objectives to science, and commit to stronger . Mr. Guterres maintained that a “spirit of compromise is necessary for a successful conclusion of the regulations related to the implementation of the ” of 2015, which was signed by 193 countries to limit the damage caused by a warming world. He also underscored the importance of “showing a very strong commitment and a very strong ambition in climate action”. The UN chief congratulated the European Union for its announcement on Friday, committing to carbon neutrality by 2050 and called for this example of climate action “to be followed worldwide”. Only coal-reliant Poland out of the 28-member bloc, decided it would not commit. to his spokesperson, the Secretary-General continues to meet with various parties at the Conference as talks go into the night, with the possibility that proceedings may continue into Saturday. All eyes ‘are on us’ At an on-site press conference, Andres Landerretche, COP25 Presidency Coordinator, spelled out: “The eyes of the people are on us”. Recalling that a consensus between 193 States was needed before the conference could be concluded, he acknowledged that “negotiations have always been very difficult”. While “our priorities are always a call to ambition, mitigation efforts and adaptation” he flagged that the underlying issue underpinning final negotiations, was the “key element” of finance. “Some groups ask for more financing to move forward with climate action plans”, including for technology transference and capacity building. Everyone has a role to play Mr. Landerretche stressed that while governments are responsible for frameworks, a cultural change must take place, with everyone asking themselves three fundamental questions: What am I doing to reduce my carbon footprint, resilience and vulnerabilities? Because, added, “everybody has to be on board”. The coordinator told journalists that his mood was one of “general-moderate optimism” and he was “quite pleased” with comments from the floor in terms of a final text, which he hoped would “crystalize into a very good outcome”. “Our intention is to finish the programme”, he concluded.

488-> Climate crisis ‘affecting quality of life and fuelling discontent’
The climate crisis, as well as persistently high inequalities, and rising levels of food insecurity and undernourishment, is affecting the quality of life in many societies and fuelling discontent, the UN warned on Thursday, on the publication of the 2020 World Economic Situation Report ( ). Switch to renewables and low-carbon energy urgently needed The UN economic experts behind the report are unequivocal in their call for “massive adjustments” to the energy sector, which is currently responsible for around three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. If the world continues to rely on fossil fuels over the next few years, and emissions in developing countries rise to the level of those in richer nations, global carbon emissions would increase by more than 250 per cent, with potentially catastrophic results. The report’s authors insist that the world’s energy needs must be met by renewable or low-carbon energy sources, which will lead to environmental and health benefits, such as lower air pollution, and new economic opportunities for many countries. However, the 2020 WESP finds that the urgent need to switch to clean energy continues to be underestimated, noting that countries are continuing to invest in oil and gas exploration, and coal-fired power generation (read our story on the the move away from coal ). This reliance on fossil fuels is described as “short-sighted”, leaving investors and governments exposed to sudden losses, as the price of oil and gas fluctuates, as well as contributing to deteriorating climatic conditions, such as global warming. “Risk associated with the climate crisis are becoming an ever-greater challenge”, concludes the report, and “climate action must be an integral part of any policy mix”. Strategies and technology for a transition to a clean economy that delivers accessible to reliable and decarbonized energy already exist, continues the report, but will require political will and public support. Failure to act will significantly increase the ultimate costs. East Asia forges ahead, as Africa stagnates The East Asia region continues to be the world’s fastest growing region, with China’s economy growing at a rate of 6.1 per cent in 2019. Although growth is expected to level off, China will still see world-beating growth of 5.9 per cent by 2021. The more economically developed parts of the world are seeing much slower growth, with the USA expected to see a slowdown from 2.2 per cent in 2019, to 1.7 per cent in 2020. The European Union is only expected to grow by 1.6 per cent, although this is an improvement on 2019, when the bloc only grew by 1.4 per cent. The sluggish growth in both regions is blamed mainly on global uncertainty. Africa, meanwhile, continues to suffer from near stagnation. In a third of developing countries dependent on commodities, including Angola, Nigeria and South Africa, average real incomes are lower today than they were in 2014 and, in several sub-Saharan African countries, the number of people living in extreme poverty has risen. Setback for UN development agenda Although the report assumes that trade tension will ease, the potential for a relapse is high, says the report, as the root causes behind disputes have not yet been tackled. Continuing weak growth in the global economy will make it harder to achieve the . The Agenda, the UN’s blueprint for a better future for people and the planet, includes commitments to eradicate poverty and create decent jobs for all. What is the WESP? It is produced annually by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), the UN Conference on Trade and Development ( ) and the five UN regional commissions (Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and Western Asia). On the launch of the WESP, UN warned of the potential impacts of a slowdown: “These risks could inflict severe and long-lasting damage on development prospects. They also threaten to encourage a further rise in inward-looking policies, at a point when global cooperation is paramount”. Growth alone is not enough The authors of the 2020 WESP conclude that it is not enough to simply focus on economic growth, at any cost, and governments must ensure that growth is inclusive. “Policymakers should move beyond a narrow focus on merely promoting GDP growth, and instead aim to enhance well-being in all parts of society”, said Elliott Harris, UN Chief Economist and Assistant Secretary-General for Economic Development. In order to improve well-being for all, Mr. Harris emphasizes the importance of prioritizing investment in sustainable development to promote education, renewable energy, and resilient infrastructure, and called for governments to pay closer attention to the implications of their policies on the environment, and a fairer distribution of wealth within their countries.

489-> MARRAKECH: UN seeks to build climate resilience through new initiative
As the United Nations Climate Conference under way in Marrakech, Morocco, ( ) is discussing implementation of the , the UN is also seeking to build climate resilience through the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s resilience initiative called A2R (Anticipate, Absorb, Reshape), launched a year ago. In the past two decades, 4.2 billion people have been affected by weather-related disasters such as floods, droughts and storms. The landmark has raised the profile of climate resilience. There is now a global goal for climate adaptation and it is recognized that adaptation represents a challenge with local, national and international dimensions. The objective of the Secretary-General’s , a global UN-led, multi-stakeholder initiative, is to accelerate action under its three pillars: anticipate climate hazards and stresses; absorb shocks; and reshape development pathways to foster climate resilience. The initiative was launched in late November 2015 in Paris during the previous Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change ( ), known as , and it brings together governments, international agencies, regional initiatives, the private sector, civil society and academia.  The discussed the issue of climate resilience with Maarten Van Aalst, Director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, who moderated a panel discussion at COP 22 on how countries can adjust their financial decision-making to build climate resilience.  We all know that the climate is changing, risks are rising. We are seeing more disasters around the world and at the same time we have a growing [global] population to feed. We want to get rid of extreme poverty and the place where all these global ambitions meet is actually this concept of resilience, making sure people can cope with shocks and stresses and can actually thrive to a good development even in a changing climate. What A2R is trying to do is to bring together all the good initiatives that are trying to work on that around the world. There are local Mayors that want to try to keep their cities safe and their citizens in the city prepared for disasters, safe from flooding. It is about working with companies that are looking at their supply chains. It is about looking at national plans that governments are making to adapt to a changing climate. And then it is about bringing all of that together into something that becomes a global ambition. Again, this is global ambition that links to what has already been expressed last year in all these global agreements, the (SDGs), the Paris Agreement, and the . Later on, we had a discussion at the about how to deal with the increasing burden of disasters and conflicts.  All of these goals have already been expressed, and A2R brings all these great initiatives together. It also shows that we are making progress on these agendas. And it is especially important in the Paris Agreement which, on the one hand, commits the world to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, so that risk does not get out of hand in the second half of the century; and on the other hand, it also commits us to building resilience to cope with the risks that are already changing today and will continue to change. So A2R brings together all the stakeholders and makes it visible that we are making progress.  If you look at the implementation of the Paris Agreement, everyone is now talking about the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Whereas in the Agreement itself, there are actually two big global goals, one is mitigation and the other is adaptation, dealing with the rising risks. And if you look at the most vulnerable countries, their primary concern is actually those risks right now. And part of the deal that was struck in Paris is actually that the [most vulnerable countries] get support, that we are standing together as a global community and that we will help them. It is not just a matter of small projects that come from financing instruments negotiated in the UN. This is something we need to do all together, and what the UN Secretary-General has tried to do with A2R is to galvanize all these initiatives, make them visible, promote them but also ensure that they get the support they need.   The resources are of two kinds. One part is the increased resources from the global community. This is the sort of financing mechanism we are also discussing here in Marrakech, the ; the existing development finance. The second part of it is doing all the things we already do better and smarter. There are trillions (of dollars) of investments made every year and a lot of that frankly is not made in the smartest way. We are building infrastructure in places where we know there is a high risk of it getting washed away. We are doing agriculture in ways that we know put it at risk to floods and drought. So if we can be smarter with the investments we are making, we can make a lot of progress on resilience without necessarily needing a lot of additional international finance.

490-> INTERVIEW: Hurricane-hit Caribbean nations can build back better, says UN development official
Mere mention of the Caribbean conjures up images of pristine waters, beautiful beaches and fun in the sun. However, the images emanating from the region over the past couple of months have painted a very different picture. Mere mention of the Caribbean conjures up images of pristine waters, beautiful beaches and fun in the sun. However, the images emanating from the region over the past couple of months have painted a very different picture. “A paradise turned into hell,” was how United Nations António Guterres described Barbuda earlier this month after visiting the island that was ravaged by Hurricane Irma. During a two-day visit to the Caribbean, he also witnessed the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria on the small island nation of Dominica. Mr. Guterres was accompanied by Stephen O’Malley, the ) for . “People want to live here for very good reason – they’re beautiful islands, it’s where people have lived for centuries, their families have lived here for centuries,” Mr. O’Malley said in an interview with on the side lines of the Secretary-General’s visit. “So how do you make sure that you use the right techniques to keep yourself as safe, and your country as safe, as possible?” Mr. O’Malley, whose remit includes Barbados and nine other countries in the region, describes what it was like for him to see the aftermath for the first time, what the priority needs are, and what countries can do to mitigate the risks as well as build back better following such disasters. Dominica, maybe I’ll start there because I’ve been to Dominica probably 10 times over the last four years. It’s a country that I feel I know quite well. When we were flying in and you were looking down at this ‘nature isle’, as it’s called, and it was totally brown… you could see the trees blown over and hardly any green at all. We came in to land at this small airport and there are all these logs which had come down from the hillsides. They were all along the waterfront. We started driving into the city and, literally, it was like going… I’m from Canada… it was like going into a city after there’d been a snowstorm but the storm was mud and not snow. It had all been pushed up to the banks, on the sides of the street. You had galvanized sheeting, you had plastic, you had mattresses, all kinds of stuff. I had seen the pictures and I have to say it was still very emotional for me to see the effect. They’re very different places. Barbuda is part of a twin-island State – Antigua and Barbuda – and is a relatively small island. There’s about 1,600 people there. So they were very badly affected… I mean the infrastructure was very badly hit and then we had another storm coming, another hurricane right behind that. So the Government took the decision, I think wisely, to evacuate the population. Their houses were destroyed. They had nowhere to properly shelter. So they were evacuated to Antigua by plane and by boat in one day, which was really pretty amazing. And since then they’ve been sheltering here, and the Government has been working on cleaning up the island. What does that mean? It’s pumping out all the standing water. When I went there two weeks ago, you were just covered in clouds of mosquitoes because of the breeding. So clean up the standing water… and then clean up dead farm animals and other animals… and establish a health post… and try and make it a place where, as people are able to, they can come back and they can start working on their homes bit by bit to restore them. They’ve lifted the mandatory evacuation order but for now, people go back and forth during the day. Understandably, the people who are here [Antigua], who were evacuated, the Barbudans, like people everywhere else, they want to go home. They have one thought in mind – how can I go home? When can I go home? And so in the meantime they’ve been in shelters, and the United Nations – , , , – we’ve been supporting them in those shelters. So has the Government, of course. And then some people are with family or friends. But, people want to go home. So, how can that be done in a safe way? What are the minimum conditions that people need? And of course, there wouldn’t be any operational schools there. So what do you do if you have school-age children? The biggest challenge is that the storms are getting stronger. Dominica, I was there two weeks ago, and I was just there the beginning of this week as well. You could see the change. You could see that there was actually some green on the hillsides and the roads were clear. There’s a bit more order to things. Civil servants were coming back to work because they were able to get into the city. But you know they still have some very big challenges. I mean we’ve managed to help the Government distribute 60 metric tonnes of food in the last week. We have to keep that up so that people feel safe and secure, that they do feel like ‘okay I’m being properly taken care of, I have enough food, I have enough water, I have enough shelter, things are getting better.’ People have to believe that and if they believe that, that’s a very important psychological boost. They can get the medical care they need, etc. So, it’s getting better but we have a long, long way to go, and there’s still parts of the country we’ve only maybe been to once or twice because the access has been so difficult. We were very fortunate that we had support from a number of different foreign militaries and they airdropped via helicopter or took boats in and dropped stuff off to a range of coastal communities. More than 50 different coastal communities received some kind of food and/or water drop from, primarily, the Dutch and French military but also the Americans, the Canadians, the Brits and the Venezuelans. I think the most immediate thing is to keep that good flow of relief aid to people so that they feel comfortable and they feel they’re being properly taken care of. I mean, the water system is coming back up slowly, electricity is coming back up slowly but that’s still mostly in the capital city of Roseau. It’s people in the rural areas who we have to reach in one way or the other. So we need to make sure they have the food and the water, then they can start to shelter themselves. But we still have two more months in this hurricane season left. I think it will be expensive to rebuild. Two years ago, there was a tropical storm over Dominica – Tropical Storm Erica. It was mostly heavy rainfall... In six hours, it did about $480 million worth of damage. Even two years later, in some places the country’s still recovering from that. So now we have damages which are clearly going to be higher than that. And so where do you get the money, as a small island developing State, to redevelop? So we have the money part. I think the other big piece… and this is where I think the Government in Dominica is working hard… is what’s the strategy? You need to have a way to get money back into people’s hands. You want to get the economy going again, and then you want to start building real climate-resilient infrastructure. On Barbuda, I think it’s how do people get back and start rebuilding their lives there. Here you have people who are displaced and they want to go home. How can they do that in a way that’s safe and in a way that contributes in a positive way to the redevelopment of the country? Again, you need a good strategy and certainly there’ll be some funding requirements as well. I think the biggest thing was the sense of shock at how fierce the storm was. I know people across the region. I know people who were in Dominica, people who told me ‘you know I was sitting in a house’ – a concrete house, we’re not talking about a flimsy, wooden building or a tin-walled shack, we’re talking about concrete-block wall houses – and people telling me ‘I thought I was okay. I was in this house, and then the wind just ripped the roof off.’ It was a terrifying experience for a lot of people. I think that’s a very important question. The countries know their location. The biggest challenge is that the storms are getting stronger. And that seems to be the consensus of scientists, that these storms are going to get stronger for a variety of interrelated reasons – the warming Caribbean Sea and other things. We may get more frequent storms but the storms we get will be stronger. So, what do you require to have a house or an office building that can withstand that? It’s interesting, you know you can go to communities and you can see three or four houses that are really badly affected and another one that isn’t. You can look at that house and you can say, ‘well I can see that this house was constructed to building code.’ How do you make sure everybody has the resources they need, because not everybody has the money to build to code. And then, those houses that already exist that need to be retrofitted, again you have to help people with that. So for me, the technologies are not difficult. They’re not complex. People know them. It’s how do we enforce the building codes. And then, it’s the reality of some of these islands… I mean Dominica is a mountainous island. You have these very steep hillsides and a coast road running along there. In the best of times, you’re getting rock fall and other debris coming down the mountains. So what can you do about that so that every time you have a serious storm, you don’t have your entire road network go down for a week to two weeks? What are some of the other things you can do with the power systems? Now they have one interconnected power system, one interconnected transmission grid, and the electrical company is looking at the question of ‘well, maybe we should split this grid into different pieces so that it might be less vulnerable.’ You can bury the lines. You can see that in the Caribbean, you still have a lot of lines that are strung on poles. And that’s another question – could we bury more of the lines and that would stop the electricity from going down. So there are things we can do. People want to live here for very good reason – they’re beautiful islands, it’s where people have lived for centuries, their families have lived here for centuries. So how do you make sure that you use the right techniques to keep yourself as safe, and your country as safe, as possible.

491-> In the eye of the Caribbean storm: one year on from Irma and Maria
“It was angry. That's what it sounded like to me. When the roof came off, there were these horrible screeches, this horrible noise. It was devastating, and we all had to run”. In September 2017, Primrose Thomas was at her home on Barbuda, when disaster struck: two Category 5 hurricanes, Irma and Maria, swept over the islands of the eastern Caribbean, wreaking chaos and destruction. “The first time I came back, I didn’t know where to go. I couldn’t recognize anywhere. I had to ask for directions to my own house.” Thousands of people in the region found themselves in the same situation as Primrose, and the UN played a major role in helping affected communities get back on their feet. Click for more first-hand accounts of the hurricane. UNDP November 2017 In this two-part report – one year on from the hurricanes – we look at the ways in which the Organisation provides aid to those in need and, in a world increasingly affected by the effects of climate change, is finding ways to make the region better able to withstand such events in the years to come. This is how the UN Secretary-General, , described Barbuda in the aftermath of the storms: Irma and Maria were “Category 5” hurricanes, described by the US Government’s National Hurricane Center Website, as winds reaching 157 miles per hour or higher, during which “catastrophic damage will occur”. Irma reached record-breaking sustained speeds of over 183 mph, longer than any other Atlantic hurricane on record. The most severely affected nations were the two-island State of Antigua and Barbuda, and Dominica; but many other Caribbean islands suffered damage, including Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, The Bahamas, and Turks and Caicos Islands. Haiti and St. Kitts and Nevis; St. Maarten as well as Cuba; the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, were also impacted. On 6 September 2017, Antigua and Barbuda was battered by Irma, the first of the two mammoth Atlantic hurricanes tearing westward along Hurricane Alley, the name for the body of warm water that stretches from the west coast of northern Africa to the east coast of Central America and the Gulf Coast of the United States. For the first time in its history, the entire population of Barbuda, some 1,600 people, was evacuated to the larger island of Antigua. Ninety per cent of homes and buildings in Barbuda were affected, 40 per cent of the roads were damaged, and the entire energy distribution network was destroyed. Dominica also saw 90 per cent of buildings destroyed by the storms, affecting over 70,000 people.   In the aftermath of Irma and Maria, a UN-wide Crisis Management Unit sent waste management and debris removal experts into the affected areas, opening up roads, collecting garbage, and restoring the water and power networks. Emergency work programmes created temporary jobs and training for affected women and men, quickly injecting cash into communities. Small businesses were given grants to help them to recover: On the Turks and Caicos Islands, the large majority of MSMEs (Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises) were severely impacted by the hurricanes, and the UN supported a wide range of businesses, from pest controllers and farmers, to taxi drivers and people renting out holiday homes. Like 70 per cent of the inhabitants of South Caicos, Henry Handfield relies on fishing for a living. One of the 40 MSME owners selected for a hurricane relief grant, he says that the $550 received made an impact: “(My boat) was flipped upside down and one portion of it was broken off. The top of the engine was smashed up, the roof was destroyed…all I had was the hull of this boat.” Handfield recalls. “The help I got from (the UN Development Programme) was very helpful. I was able to take that and put with some other monies to remodel this boat.” Financial support also came in the form of an innovative direct cash transfer scheme, which puts money directly in the hands of affected families. Run by the Government of Dominica, the programme is supported by and the World Food Programme and funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. Between December and February 2017, it provided 8,000 of the most vulnerable families affected by Maria with monthly payments ranging between $90 and $239, depending on the number of children in the household. Yvonne Hill Williams lives in Roseau, Dominica. A shopkeeper and foster carer who also looks after her five grandchildren, Yvonne lost all of her merchandise when the nearby river overflowed during Hurricane Maria. She found that the cash initiative came in handy during a difficult time: “We bought clothes, shoes, and a little shopping and groceries. You feel that you can buy certain things in town. It’s a good feeling…I appreciate it very much.” In Dominica, the priority for women farmers was to be able to get back on their feet as soon as possible. facilitated this by providing seeds, labour and equipment to bring their farms back into production as soon as possible. Eileen Lloyd, of the Bellevue Chopin Farmers Group in Dominica, is one of the beneficiaries. She described the support provided by UN Women as a blessing: “After Maria, it was very difficult to get seeds, and then we were promised some seeds and tools from UN Women and we appreciate them handing them over to us,” she said. The organisation also worked closely with the to provide displaced Barbudan women and girls with sanitary items not easily found in relief packages. They distributed “dignity kits”, containing basic health and hygiene products such as soap and sanitary towels. One year on, the most vulnerable people affected – those with no income or insurance, single people and those with disabilities – risk getting lost in the system. The International Organization for Migration ( ), has focused on helping the most at-risk communities. has helped hundreds in Dominica by reconstructing their homes. Wyzell Philogene, a single mother, spent almost a month sharing a space at a friend’s house, along with around 15 others. Her roof was ripped off, and she lost nearly all her belongings. Wyzelle qualified for IOM humanitarian assistance and, a week later, a brand-new roof was erected at no cost to her. She is now able to focus on making a living, through a landscaping job made available through the National Employment Programme, and she is making sure that she is prepared for the next hurricane season. Wyzell is not alone in thinking about how to survive in the future: the UN’s longer-term planning and development teams have been working closely with emergency humanitarian workers from the very beginning of the crisis. In part 2 of this special report, we will look more closely at the efforts underway to make the region more resilient, in the face of climate change and the likelihood of more frequent, and more extreme, natural disasters.

492-> Guterres's message for 2020: In world of turmoil, youth are its ‘greatest source’ of hope
As the world enters 2020 with “uncertainty and insecurity all around”, the United Nations chief maintained that the world’s young people are its "greatest source” of hope. Against the backdrop of persistent inequality, rising hatred, “a world at war and a warming planet”; with climate change as “a long-term problem” and “a clear and present danger”; said in his New Year’s message that “we cannot afford to be the generation that fiddled while the planet burned”. But “there is also hope”, he continued, paying tribute to the power of youth around the planet. The United Nations stands with you, and belongs to you  –  “From climate action to gender equality to social justice and human rights, your generation is on the frontlines and in the headlines”, he said. “I am inspired by your passion and determination”. Noting that young people are “rightly demanding a role in shaping the future”, he said: “I am with you”. “The United Nations stands with you – and belongs to you” spelled out the Secretary-General. He pointed out that 2020 marks the 75th anniversary of the Organization and said that “we are launching a Decade of Action for the (SDGs), our blueprint for a fair globalization”. “This year, the world needs young people” to keep speaking out, thinking big, pushing boundaries and keeping up the pressure, concluded the Secretary-General wish wishes for “peace and happiness in 2020”.

493-> Stop escalation, urges UN chief, as geopolitical tensions reach ‘highest level this century’
The UN Secretary-General called on world leaders to de-escalate geopolitical tensions on Monday, which as being “at their highest level this century” as the new decade dawns. The New Year has begun with our world in turmoil. We are living in dangerous times”, said the UN chief, noting that turbulence is only escalating. Secretary-General tells reporters: The New Year has begun with our world in turmoil. Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century. And this turbulence is escalating. “Even nuclear non-proliferation can no longer be taken for granted” he added, without specifically referencing the events of recent days following the targeted killing by a United States drone, of Iran’s most influential general, Qasem Soleimani, in Iraq last Friday. Iran has vowed to avenge the killing of the elite Quds Force commander, and on Sunday it signified it would no longer be bound by the restrictions on its nuclear programme, outlined in the 2015 deal known as the , or JCPOA. The deal was debated in the  . 'Cauldron of tensions' On 1 January, Mr. Guterres also expressed at the announcement by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), commonly known as North Korea, that it was ending its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear missile testing. On Sunday, the Iraqi parliament also passed a non-binding resolution calling for US troops to leave the country, in a clear response to the killing of the Iranian general on their soil. In response, President Trump has threatened Iraq with sanctions if forced to withdraw its forces, and also threatened on Twitter, to destroy multiple sites of “cultural” significance within Iran, if there are reprisal attacks against Americans. Mr. Guterres told the noon stakeout for correspondents at UN Headquarters in New York, that a “cauldron of tensions is leading more and more countries to take unpredicted decisions with unpredictable consequences and a profound risk of miscalculation. At the same time, we see trade and technological conflicts that fracture world markets, undermine growth and widen inequalities”, he added. Furthermore, said the UN chief, “our planet is on fire.  The climate crisis rages on. In many parts of the world, we see many people frustrated and angry.  We see increased social unrest and growing extremism, nationalism and radicalization, with a dangerous advance of terrorism, notably in Africa. He said it was clear that “this situation cannot go on. I have been following the recent rise in global tensions with great concern. I am in constant contact with leading officials around the world. The UN chief had a clear four-point message for what needs to happen now, in capitals across the world: “Stop escalation. Exercise maximum restraint. Re-start dialogue. Renew international cooperation.” “Let us not forget the terrible human suffering caused by war,” he concluded. “As always, ordinary people pay the highest price.  It is our common duty to avoid it.”

494-> Caribbean hurricane season ‘will be different this time’
In September 2017 two category five hurricanes swept across the Caribbean, devastating island communities in the region.  In the 2nd part of this special report marking the one year anniversary of hurricanes Irma and Maria hitting the Caribbean, UN News looks at how the UN has responded, helping communities to get back on their feet, and preparing them for the inevitability of more damaging hurricanes in the future. 15 year old Ahijah Williams is terrified by the idea of another hurricane season. He is a student at North East Comprehensive School in Wesley, Dominica. He remembers how he felt when Hurricane Maria, a devastating Category 5 storm, ripped through his community 12 months ago. “I was extremely horrified to hear those winds howling like wolves in the sky and houses flying away and people dying.” Although fearful of the dangers that the 2018 hurricane eason could bring, he says he “would like to be more ready this time: prepare for the season, stock up on food, repair houses." Dominica has been rebuilding its education system in the aftermath of Maria and preparing for the coming hurricane season. The European Commission provided the UN Children’s Fund, – working with the Government of Dominica and IsraAID – with 500,000 euros to support the education sector across all 72 schools The rebuilding has not just been taking place in the physical sense, but also in terms of preparing teachers and students to respond appropriately during a natural disaster like a hurricane. "I want to learn how to prepare for a hurricane and what we do after a hurricane. It is my responsibility to help as a member of the Dominica Cadet Corps,” says Ahijah. “I am looking forward to learning safe practices. It’s going to be different this time” UNICEF also launched a “Return to Happiness” programme for the thousands of children affected by the hurricanes, helping them to work through their trauma using play, writing, drama and poetry. The people of Dominica are not alone. Across the islands of the eastern Caribbean, citizens, communities and governments are developing ways to improve their hurricane readiness. And the UN is playing a major part in helping them to become more resilient, and better able to withstand the next season, as extreme weather events grow in frequency and scale. The eastern Caribbean islands are no stranger to life-threatening weather conditions. The UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ( ) has identified the region as the second most hazard-prone in the world (after the Asia-Pacific region). As well as hurricanes, inhabitants face threats such as floods and volcanoes, with regular annual losses from disasters estimated at $3 billion per year. In its , ECLAC recommended that governments in the region improve resilience by undertaking recovery and reconstruction assessments. Following the back-to-back batterings from Irma and Maria, Dominica has taken this message on-board. Shortly after the hurricanes, Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit said: “Our devastation is so complete that our recovery has to be total, and so we have a unique opportunity to be an example to the world, an example of how an entire nation rebounds from disaster and how an entire nation can be climate resilient for the future.” To reach this goal, the Dominican Government created a task-force to determine best practice across every sector and enforce new disaster mitigation measures throughout the island. The UN played an important role and, even in the very early days of the humanitarian recovery efforts, started planning for resilience. The UN Development Programme, , restored over 800 buildings for the most at-need people in Dominica and Antigua & Barbuda, trained hurricane-affected Dominicans to rebuild their own communities, and ensured that roofs were put up in accordance with improved building codes. In addition, the looked at existing building standards and, where necessary, reviewed them and raised them to bolster resilience. The aim is to enable Dominica to rebound from a Category 5 storm in a matter of weeks, rather than months or years. Raúl Salazar, Head of the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction ( ) for the Americas and The Caribbean says that preparedness in the region has improved over the last year: “With the contribution of the international community and cooperation among countries of the region, the affected islands have initiated a process of ‘risk informed’ recovery in sectors as diverse as education; with a safe schools perspective, where schools are able to resist the impact of hurricanes; tourism, with a strong engagement of the private sector to re-establish services; and the building of national disaster risk reduction plans.” However, one of the big fears for the coming years, according to Raúl Salazar, is the unpredictability brought about by climate change: “Through changing temperatures, precipitation and sea levels, amongst other factors, global climate change is already modifying hazard levels and exacerbating disaster risks,” he said, adding that “climate change will contribute an additional $1.4 billion to the expected annual losses from cyclone wind damage alone.” Raúl Salazar’s concerns are echoed in the 2018 ECLAC Caribbean Outlook report, which predicts that “disaster-related costs are expected to escalate in the Caribbean in the face of population growth, rapid urbanization, increased exposure of assets and climate-change-related damage.” For the UN Secretary-General, Antonió Guterres, climate change remains an overriding factor in the devastation wreaked by hurricanes Irma and Maria. Speaking on a visit to Dominica and Barbuda shortly after the hurricane struck, he said: As more and more countries are affected, and the associated costs, human and financial, continue to rise the international community is moving towards meaningful action. In 2015, the was signed, committing all countries to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change. And, because reducing carbon emissions is no longer enough to halt climate change, States agreed to a “ , strengthening the ability of the most vulnerable countries to deal with its effects. For more on Dominica’s “war” on climate change click : One of the crueller ironies of climate change is that, whilst they contribute less than 1 per cent to total greenhouse gas emissions, the tend to suffer disproportionately from its effects: just weeks after the hurricanes devastated his nation, Dominican Prime Minister, Roosevelt Skerrit, in an emotional , told the UN General Assembly:

495-> New SDG Advocates sign up for ‘peace, prosperity, people’ and planet, on the road to 2030
As the UN and partners around the world push towards reaching the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030, six new influential public figures came on board as official on Thursday, committing themselves to the pursuit of the 17 goals on behalf of “peace, prosperity, people, planet, and partnerships.” “We have the tools to answer the questions posed by climate change, environmental pressure, poverty and inequality”, said , António Guterres. “They lie in the great agreements of 2015 – the and the on climate change.” “But tools are no use if you don’t use them. So, today, and every day, my appeal is clear and simple. We need action, ambition and political will. More action, more ambition and more political will,” said the UN chief. 2019 announced Thurs to advance . tells us why she's a Advocate: “I believe in gender equality, reducing inequalities, I fundamentally believe in inclusive security, and that the only way we can get ahead, is if we go together”. They are joining and overall group of 17, who are all committed to raising awareness, inspiring greater ambition, and pushing for faster action on the SDGs, which include the end of extreme hunger, poverty, and quality healthcare for all. The Advocates represent the universal character of the SDGs themselves, hailing from Governments, entertainment, academia, sport, business and activist organizations around the world. “By joining forces to achieve our goals, we can turn hope into reality – leaving no one behind,” said Co-Chair of the SDG Advocates group, Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway. “This is a time of great hope for the world. If we work smartly together and stay on course, we can raise millions out of poverty and significantly expand basic social services for many more by the 2030 end date of the SDGs,” added Co-Chair of the SDG Advocates and President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo. Mr. Guterres has appointed some members of the previous group of SDG Advocates as SDG Advocate Alumni and said on Thursday he was looking forward to their ongoing support and engagement.

496-> UN emissions report: World on course for more than 3 degree spike, even if climate commitments are met
Even if countries meet commitments made under the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world is heading for a 3.2 degrees Celsius global temperature rise over pre-industrial levels, leading to even wider-ranging and more destructive climate impacts, warns a report from the UN Environment Programme, released on Tuesday. The annual , which compares where greenhouse gas emissions are heading, versus where they need to be, shows that emissions need to fall by 7.6 per cent each year over the next decade, if the world is to get back on track towards the goal of limiting temperature rises to close to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 🔴 We're on perilous ground 🔴 We are on track for a temperature rise of over 3°C. This would bring mass extinctions & large parts of the planet would be uninhabitable. We need to supercharge our ambition NOW to close the :  If the world warms by more than 1.5 degrees, we will see more frequent, and intense, climate impacts – as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), has demonstrated in several hard-hitting reports – such as the heatwaves and storms witnessed in recent years. “Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions”, said Inger Andersen, ’s Executive Director. In December 2020, countries are expected to significantly step up their climate commitments at the UN Climate Conference - - due to be held in Glasgow. However, the urgency of the situation means, said Ms. Anderson, that they cannot wait another year: “they – and every city, region, business and individual – need to act now”. “We need quick wins to reduce emissions as much as possible in 2020, then stronger Nationally Determined Contributions to kick-start the major transformations of economies and societies. We need to catch up on the years in which we procrastinated”, she added. “If we don’t do this, the 1.5°C goal will be out of reach before 2030.” Developed countries, the biggest emitters, must take the lead The UNEP report calls on all countries to reduce their emissions, and substantially increase their “Nationally Determined Contributions” (the commitments made under the ) in 2020, and put into place the policies to implement them. The lead, however, must be taken by the world’s most developed economies (the G20), which contribute some 78 per cent of all emissions: currently, only five of these countries have committed to a long-term zero emissions target. The solutions exist The study points out that it is possible to reach the 1.5 degree goal by 2030; the technology exists, and there is increased understanding of the additional benefits of climate action, in terms of health and the economy. Many governments, cities, businesses and investors are engaged in ambitious initiatives to lower emissions. Developing countries, which suffer disproportionately from climate change, can learn from successful efforts in developed countries, says UNEP, and they can even leapfrog them, adopting cleaner technologies at a faster rate. The UNEP chief said that despite the figures, it was possible to avert disaster: "Because of climate procrastination which we have essentially had during these (past) 10 years, we are looking at a 7.6 per cent reduction every year" in emissions. "Is that possible? Absolutely. Will it take political will? Yes. Will we need to have the private sector lean in? Yes. But the science tells us that we can do this.”

497-> In Pakistan, Guterres urges world to step up climate action, praises support to Afghan refugees
UN Secretary-General on Sunday began a three-day visit to Pakistan, recognizing the country’s decades of “outstanding generosity and solidarity” as one of the world’s largest hosts of refugees, and highlighting its commitment to climate action. “One of the main purposes of my visit is to spotlight the real Pakistan — with all its possibility and potential,” Mr. Guterres in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, alongside Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi. I am closely following vital peace efforts in Afghanistan to reduce violence, especially against civilians. By building regional consensus, Pakistan’s role in this process remains crucial.  The UN chief started out his day in Islamabad by meeting with refugees from Afghanistan, Yemen and Tajikistan. On Monday, he will speak at an marking 40 years of hosting Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran, one of the world’s largest and longest-standing refugee populations. Organized by the Pakistan Government and the UN refugee agency ( ), the conference will also be addressed by the agency’s chief, . The Secretary-General is also expected to meet with refugees and senior Pakistani officials during the visit. Speaking to reporters after participating in a tree planting ceremony and on climate change and sustainable development, Mr. Guterres said it was time for the world to take a step back and “look at Pakistan through a wider frame.” Indeed, he said, the role Pakistan had played in sheltering and protecting Afghan refugees with limited international assistance, as well as its support to UN peacekeeping, and its steps to take concrete climate action with the ‘10 Billion Tree Tsunami’ campaign among other initiatives, were vital aspects of the South Asian country’s contribution to the region and the wider international community. “The United Nations will continue to support Pakistan, and I call on other countries to support Pakistan and indeed show similar leadership in sharing this responsibility in this region and around the world,” said Mr. Guterres. ‘Our sustainable future is at stake’, but the battle can be won In his ‘Special Talk on Sustainable Development and Climate Change’, Mr. Guterres “like other developing countries, Pakistan has contributed little to the problem yet faces disproportionate vulnerability because of it.” Commending Prime Minister Imran Khan for highlighting climate change in his address to the UN General Assembly last September, the Secretary-General also congratulated Pakistan on becoming co-chair of the , the UN-backed mechanism that helps developing countries reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance their ability to respond to climate change. I am convinced we can tackle [the climate emergency] if only we can generate the political will and the unity we need to make a difference — UN chief Guterres Noting Pakistan’s climate-focused initiatives like the ‘10 Billion Tree Tsunami’ campaign and the Clean and Green Pakistan Movement, he expressed his admiration for the decision to abolish plastic bags in Islamabad and elsewhere in the country. “Plastic pollution is today one of the central concerns that we have, especially for the protection of our oceans”, said the UN chief, who held up a bag made of fabric, and urged everyone in attendance to use similar ones when the did their shopping. The answer to the climate crisis is global solidarity backed by global action, said the Secretary-General, adding: “We are in a battle for our lives. But I firmly believe it is a battle that can be won.” Indeed: “Technology is on our side. We have all the tools and knowledge we need to move from the grey economy to the green economy as it was seen in the slides. We have the on Climate Change. We have the (SDGs). 2030 Agenda: ‘Our common vision for the future we want’ As he went on to urge scaled-up action towards achieving the for Sustainable Development, Mr. Guterres acknowledged that today’s challenges to sustainable development and human progress do not respect borders. “They are not confined to individual nations,” he explained. With only 10 years left before the 2030 deadline [for the SDGs], there is an urgent need to step up action. And every nation, every community and every person can and must make a contribution — UN chief Guterres He noted that Pakistan was among the first nations to integrate the SDGs, including through a national poverty alleviation programme – , or compassion, to expand social protection and safety nets and to support human development. A national youth development programme – – seeks to create 10 million jobs for young people in five years. But “we are off-track globally”, according to the UN chief, especially in the areas of hunger, inequality, biodiversity and climate action. “Gender inequality – in business, in the home, in schools, in government, in the technology sector – is denying women and girls their rights and opportunities across the world,” he continued and added that vulnerable populations, such as migrants, young people and persons with disabilities, remain at risk of being left behind. “Our collective efforts are not approaching the scale we need to deliver the SDGs by 2030,” he said, but stressed that the recently launched calls on governments, businesses, civil society and individuals everywhere to combine to create “unstoppable momentum” for the Goals. Inspiring stories of Afghan refugees Earlier on Sunday, the Secretary General and the head of the UN refugee agency, Mr. Grandi, met with three generations of Afghan refugees, listened to their compelling stories and expressed solidarity and compassion with their cause. Though this marks Mr. Guterres’ first trip to Pakistan in his capacity as UN chief, he noted that he had visited the country many times during his tenure as UN High Commissioner of Refugees. “I gained an enormous admiration for the resilience, courage, determination, generosity and the solidarity of Afghan refugees,” said Mr. Guterres, adding that he had “drawn inspiration from their courage”. also had an opportunity to meet some of the refugees, who despite their hardships, had been able to help others and to give back to their communities. Fazal Nabi, a 35-year-old, born in Pakistan, is passionate about helping refugees with disabilities. He drives a rickshaw to earn his living but spends most of his earnings buying equipment to help persons with disabilities. Asked what he dream of doing if he took up another job, Mr. Nabi said that he would like to open a factory to manufacture assistive technologies, mobility aids or tools that could ease the everyday lives of persons with disabilities. Jammu and Kashmir A reporter at the joint press conference asked a question about tensions in and the Secretary General explained that he had offered, from the beginning, his good offices in relation to the situation, noting however that “good offices can only work when accepted by both sides”. He maintained the UN position that the relevant resolutions of the on the issue should be implemented and for effective de-escalation, dialogue, and another very important condition: full respect for human rights and [fundamental] freedoms of those in Jammu and Kashmir. When asked about ceasefire violations in the disputed region, the UN chief mentioned his visit to the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan ( ), noting that it “should have full freedom of movement; it has on the Pakistani side - we hope that this will also be achieved on the other side, and we will be strengthening its equipment capacity in order to better be able to implement its mandates”.

498-> ‘Save Tuvalu; save the world’; UN chief echoes rallying cry from front lines of global climate emergency
Further inaction on climate change is “simply not an option”, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres said on Wednesday in an where he called for “rapid and deep change in how we do business, generate power, build cities and feed the world.”  If the world is to prevail against climate change, “then we must find the political will to take transformative measures,” declared the UN chief. “Leaders must come to the UN summit in September armed with solutions as well as speeches”, he stressed, referring to the action-focused meeting he is convening in September to mobilize political ambition on climate change and push forward the goals of the , which encompass greenhouse-gas-emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. On his recent to the frontlines of the global climate emergency, he heard the rallying cry “Save Tuvalu; save the world,” while visiting the tiny island archipelago that is battling sea level rise and coastal erosion as warming temperatures threaten the region. “I was there to show solidarity with those suffering the worst impacts of climate change and to draw attention to the innovative climate action underway in the region,” explained the UN chief. Sea level rise in some Pacific countries is “four times greater than the global average”, he stated, saying that it poses “an existential threat to several island States”. “Oceans are in serious trouble, from coral bleaching to biodiversity loss to plastic pollution”, he warned. “Extreme weather events are on the rise, jeopardizing lives and livelihoods”. Mr. Guterres spelled out: “Nowhere have I seen the heartbreaking impacts of climate change more starkly than in Tuvalu, a remote coral atoll nation where the highest point is less than five metres above sea level.” He recounted a visit to the home of a family “who live in a state of perpetual anxiety about inundation by the relentlessly rising seas just steps away”. The UN chief was “deeply moved by the warmth of the Tuvaluan people and their intense devotion to their land, way of life and cultural heritage”, he said, adding that while these communities have contributed almost nothing to climate change, because of big emitters, “they are now fighting to preserve their country’s very existence”. The ‘whole planet’ at stake “Make no mistake: it is not just Tuvalu, or small islands, or the Pacific at stake”, underscored the Secretary-General. “It is the whole planet”. What is happening to these countries “is a sign of what is in store for the rest of us”, he warned. “People all over the world are starting to feel the impacts of the climate emergency – and these will only worsen”. The UN chief recalled meeting young children who “are already fearful for their future and are relying on my generation to secure it”. “As Secretary-General of the UN, I have many battles”, he . “But as a grandfather, the struggle against climate change is the fight of my life”. Noting that “we are not winning”, Mr. Guterres urged that political will must be fund “to take transformative measures”. “We must acknowledge the moral authority of the Pacific nations, frontrunners in the race against the climate emergency”, he stated “And we must find sustainable solutions, invest in renewable energies and increase resilience and adaptation”. Achieving ‘essential’ goals The clearly laid-out goals of the scientific community to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and limit global warming to 1.5C by the end of the century, are “essential”, according to the UN chief. As the global community pursues those goals, he restated his message to Governments to “shift taxes from salaries to carbon”, saying “we should , not people”. He also urged them to “stop subsidizing fossil fuels” because “taxpayers’ money should not be used to boost hurricanes, spread drought and heat waves, and melt glaciers”. “Stop building new coal plants by 2020”, he continued. “We need a green economy, not a grey one”. He stressed that we have the to tackle the climate crisis, to “save lives and property, breathe less polluted air, access cleaner water and protect biodiversity”. “Climate action could also yield a direct economic gain of $26 trillion, compared to business as usual, through to 2030, making it a cost-effective option” argued the UN chief. Turning to his climate action summit, Mr. Guterres that he is asking world leaders to come “not just with speeches” but with “plans to transform energy, mobility, industry and agriculture”, and to implement their commitments to climate financing, “not out of generosity but enlightened self-interest”. “Urgent climate action is a choice we can – and must – make”, concluded the Secretary-General. “As the people of Tuvalu know all too well: Saving them will save us all”.

499-> End fossil fuel subsidies, and stop using taxpayers’ money to destroy the world: Guterres
“We need to tax pollution, not people”, and “end subsidies for fossil fuels,” Secretary-General António Guterres told the World Summit of the R20 Coalition on Tuesday, a UN-supported environmental organization, founded by former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The idea that subsidizing fossil fuels is a way to improve people’s lives could not be more wrong, said the UN chief in the Austrian capital, Vienna, because it means spending taxpayers’ money to “boost hurricanes, to spread droughts, to melt glaciers, to bleach corals: to destroy the world.” Mr. Guterres went on to call for the decarbonization of urban infrastructure, a halt to coal plants, and the promotion of sustainable consumption and production: “in short, we need a green economy, not a grey economy.” Financing a ‘post-carbon’ society In the lead up to the UN this September, the Secretary-General has enlisted the President of France, the Prime Minister of Jamaica and the Emir of Qatar to mobilize international support to secure the $100 billion goal agreed by UN Member States at the Paris climate conference in 2015, necessary for advancing climate mitigation and adaptation in the developing world. Investors need to stop “financing pollution”, scale up green ventures and increase lending for low-carbon solutions”, he insisted, adding that the private sector and investment communities must support a “bold and ambitions climate agenda”, because climate action is not only good for people and the planet, it can also be good for business. Fossil fuel subsidies mean using taxpayers' money to boost hurricanes, spread droughts & melt glaciers. As taxpayers, I believe we would like to see our money back rather than see it used to destroy the world. My remarks at :   ‘Silver lining to the looming cloud’ Recounting his recent trip to Tuvalu, a low-lying island state in the South Pacific that risks being inundated by rising sea levels, Mr. Guterres highlighted the fact that “rarely a day goes by,” without news of yet another disaster, such as floods, droughts, wildfires and extreme storms. However, there is a “silver lining to the looming cloud”, because, although the current situation is extremely serious, the shift to a green economy would see profound benefits for societies around the world, with cleaner water and air, less pollution, more chemical-free agriculture and reduced biodiversity loss. Regional action is ‘key to addressing the climate crisis’ The R20 Austrian World Summit is a long-term initiative to help regions, states and cities to implement the , and meet the global climate protection targets outlined in the to limit climate change. R20 aims to develop the summit to become the most important European meeting place for climate action solutions. One of the other high-profile speakers at the was outspoken Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who initiated the school strike for climate movement in November 2018, at the age of 15. Ms. Thunberg said that millions of children have been gaining lots of attention for the climate emergency, but they, like scientists, are not leaders, unlike many of the politicians, CEOs and celebrities attending the Summit: “people listen to you, and are influenced by you. You have an enormous responsibility, a responsibility that most of you have failed to take.” Climate change is an emergency, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced  Such influencers, she added, cannot rely on people to read between the lines or search for scientific information. They must explain repeatedly, no matter how uncomfortable or unprofitable that may be. Ms. Thunberg reminded the audience that, although climate change may be a chance for green growth, it is primarily “an emergency, the biggest crisis that humanity has ever faced.” The work of Governor Schwarzenegger and the R20 coalition, in highlighting the importance of climate action at a “sub-national” city and regional level, was praised by the UN chief, who described sub-national action as being “key to addressing the climate crisis”, not only because regional and city governments are closer to the people, but because “regions and cities are the main engines of the world economy.”

500-> Climate crisis: Antarctic continent posts record temperature reading of 18.3°C
Fresh fears of accelerating damage to the planet’s ice sheets and sea level rise have been fuelled by from the UN’s weather agency that the Antarctic likely saw a new temperature record of more than 18°C on Thursday. Speaking to journalists in Geneva, spokesperson Clare Nullis from the World Meteorological Organization ( ), said that the record reading taken in the north of the continent, would be considered unusual, even during the current warmer summer months. WMO will set up expert panel to verify new record temperature for the continent reported by of 18.3°C on 6 Feb at Esperanza research base. Latest news on this and Antarctic glaciers at  “The Argentine research base, which is called Esperanza, it’s on the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula; it set a new record temperature yesterday: 18.3°C, which is not a figure you would normally associate with Antarctica even in summertime. This beat the former record of 17.5°C, which was set back in 2015.” Experts at will now verify whether the temperature extreme is a new record for the Antarctic continent, which is defined as the main continental landmass. It should not be confused with the Antarctic region, which is everywhere south of 60 degrees latitude, and where a record temperature of 19.8C was recorded on Signy Island in January 1982. ‘Foehn’ phenomenon The WMO experts are expected to examine the meteorological conditions surrounding the event, particularly whether it is associated with a weather phenomenon known as "foehn". A common feature of life in Alpine regions, episodes of foehn often involve high winds at altitude and the rapid warming of air as it heads down slopes or peaks, driven by significant air pressure differences. “It’s among the fastest-warming regions of the planet”, Ms. Nullis said of the Antarctic. “We hear a lot about the Arctic, but this particular part of the Antarctic peninsula is warming very quickly.  Over the past 50 years it’s warmed almost 3°C.” Amid steadily warming temperatures, Ms. Nullis also noted that the amount of ice lost annually from the Antarctic ice sheet “increased at least six-fold between 1979 and 2017”. Most of this ice loss happens when ice shelves melt from below, as they come into contact with relatively warm ocean water, she explained. Melting is especially marked in west Antarctica, according to WMO, and to a lesser extent along the peninsula and in east Antarctica. Accelerated glacier retreat Turning to glacier melt, Ms. Nullis warned that around “87 per cent of glaciers along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula have retreated in the last 50 years, with most of these showing an accelerated retreat in the last 12 years”. Concern is particularly high over the main glacier tributaries to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, in particular the Pine Island glacier, where two large rifts that were first spotted in early 2019 have each grown to some 20 kilometres long. “There’s quite a lot of conversation on Twitter at the moment; the satellite image showing cracks in the Pine Island glacier in Antarctica”, said Ms. Nullis. “They’ve been growing rapidly over the past few days. The European Union has a satellite called Sentinel that’s been measuring and monitoring these, and there are pretty dramatic images.” Roughly twice the size of Australia, the Antarctic is cold, windy and dry. The average annual temperature ranges from about minus 10C on the Antarctic coast to minus 60C at the highest points of the interior. Its immense ice sheet is up to 4.8 kilometres thick and contains 90 per cent of the world’s fresh water, enough to raise sea level by around 60 metres, were it all to melt. Millions at risk from ice melt In a from the highly respected UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( ), researchers warned that hundreds of millions of people are at risk from melting ice in the planet’s polar regions, linked to sea level rise.

501-> Monday’s Daily Brief: biodiversity and forests, labour and road safety, women’s rights, and fallen UN staff remembered
This Monday, we cover: how one million species face extinction; the importance of safeguarding forests; a look at labour inequalities worldwide; efforts to tackle road safety; a new intergenerational campaign for the realization of women’s rights; and a memorial service honouring fallen UN staff. World is ‘on notice’ as major UN report shows one million species face extinction A hard-hitting report into the impact of humans on nature shows that nearly one million species risk becoming extinct within decades, while current efforts to conserve the earth’s resources will likely fail without radical action, UN biodiversity experts said on Monday. Speaking in Paris at the launch of the Global Assessment study – the first such report since 2005 – Director-General Audrey Azoulay said that its findings put the world “on notice”. Find . UN Forum works to safeguard world’s forests The global community gathered at UN Headquarters in New York on Monday, to take action on behalf of the world’s forests. With an estimated 1.6 billion people – or one quarter of the overall population – dependent on forests for subsistence, livelihood, jobs and income, they are essential for human well-being, and play a vital role in promoting economic growth. They are also increasingly important to combat climate change. The runs until Friday and will take stock of progress in implementing the UN Strategic Plan for Forests, which provides a blueprint for including them in the and achieving the (SDGs). The Strategic plan and its associated targets provide a global framework for sustainably managing all types of forests and trees, halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation, and increasing forest area by 2030. Labour report shows half of workers frequently exposed to physical risks A based on 1.2 billion people has found stark differences in the number of hours that many of us spend earning a living. According to the International Labour Organization ( ), one-sixth of workers in the European Union (EU) toil away for more than 48 hours per week, but more than half of all employees in Chile, the Republic of Korea and Turkey, put in the same long hours. Jobs involving tight deadlines and stress, apply to one in three people in the EU, rising to one in two in the United States, Turkey, El Salvador and Uruguay. Physical risks are also “frequent”, the report finds, with more than half of workers exposed to repetitive hand and arm movements, and about one-in-four, to high temperatures. Among the study’s other findings are that while 70 per cent of workers were positive about their managers, up to 12 per cent said they faced abuse, including bullying, unwanted sexual attention and harassment. And while up to 84 per cent of staff in the EU, Uruguay and the US said they learn new things while they’re working, only 30 per cent of workers agreed with this in the Republic of Korea, and just 55 per cent in China. Regardless of the country, least-educated workers are less likely to develop their skills, the report says, highlighting also that good working conditions “contribute to the well-being of workers and the success of enterprises”. Finally, across all 41 countries covered in the , women were found to earn significantly less than men – and they are also “over-represented” at the lowest end of the salary scale. Advocates, UN, speak up for road safety Despite progress, road traffic deaths continue to rise, with an annual 1.35 million fatalities. Road traffic injuries are now the leading killer of children and young people aged 5-29 years. The warning comes from the World Health Organization ( ), in the context of the which started on Monday. During the week, thousands of safety advocates from around the world are expected to highlight the need for more effective leadership for road safety, through the #SpeakUp campaign. Calling for a “world free from road traffic deaths and injuries”, WHO’s Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, described a world in which all people benefit from universal health coverage, rehabilitation and psychological support. Pedestrians and cyclists account for 26 per cent of all road deaths, while motorcycle riders and passengers account for 28 per cent. WHO’s Director, Dr. Etienne Krug, called on governments and their partners to “accelerate action to save lives by implementing solutions that work”. General Equality: a new campaign for the realization of women’s rights To mark the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, considered the blueprint on women’s rights and empowerment, gender agency UN Women announced on Monday a new multigenerational campaign, titled “ ”. In 2020, it will be 25 years since 189 Governments committed to taking bold actions in 12 critical areas of concern regarding gender equality: poverty, education and training, health, violence, armed conflict, economy, power and decision-making, institutional mechanisms, human rights, media, environment, and the girl child. “Today, the reality is that not a single country can claim to have achieved gender equality. Despite some progress, real change has been too slow for most women and girls in the world, and we see significant pushback in many places against their leadership and agency,” said UN Women Executive Director, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka. The Generation Equality campaign will bring together several generations of women’s rights activists to galvanize attention and action on key issues including equal pay, equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work, an end to sexual harassment and all forms of violence against women and girls, health-care services that respond to their needs, and their equal participation in economic and political life and decision-making in all areas of life. UN honours fallen colleagues and friends who ‘risk all to promote peace’ The lives of 115 colleagues who lost their lives between the beginning of last year and the end of March, serving the United Nations, were honoured on Monday at the annual Memorial Service for Fallen Staff, in New York. UN said that it was a “sad reminder of the often-perilous nature of our work” but also “testament to the commitment of the thousands of women and men from around the globe who are prepared to risk all to promote peace and provide assistance to some of the world’s most vulnerable and needy people.” Read .

502-> Thursday’s Daily Brief: Ebola in DR Congo, malnutrition in Laos, baby health, support for Sahel force, #ClimateAction
On Thursday, we cover: more support needed for Sahel force, fears in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) as Ebola response funding dwindles; food and nutrition concerns in Laos; an update on low birthweight babies across the world; and the UN chief’s trip for climate action in the Pacific continues. ‘Time for action is now’ senior UN peacekeeping official says, urging more support for Sahel force The five-year-old force working to stabilize Africa’s Sahel has shown great potential, but needs more support from the international community to reach full operational capacity, a top UN peacekeeping official said on Thursday, calling for enhanced political and economic solutions to help tackle the strife-torn region’s myriad challenges. Dubbed the ‘G-5 Sahel’ after the group of countries that comprise it (Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger) the Joint Force, proposed by the African Union and backed by the UN , aims to bolster coordination to “neutralize” armed groups in the region and strengthen Cooperation on economic development and security. “The G-5 Sahel has taken additional steps to operationalize the joint force following the devastating terrorist attack on its headquarters in June,” Bintou Keita, UN Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, told the Security Council today. Our full report . Fears over rising Ebola infections in DR Congo, lack of funding for safe burials Ensuring the safe and dignified burial of people who have died from Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – regarded as a key way to prevent disease transmission – is under threat from a lack of funding, a key UN-partner said on Thursday.  Amid an uptick in the number of infections in north Kivu and Ituri provinces, the Red Cross says it has just two weeks’ worth of funding to support its burial teams. Since the start of the latest Ebola epidemic in DRC last August, the virus has claimed more than 1,100 lives and infected 1,671 people, making it the second deadliest outbreak to date. Twenty per cent of those cases occurred in the last three weeks, according to DRC authorities, who are grappling with insecurity and attacks on health centres by armed groups in north-eastern DRC. Highlighting the value of the work of the burial teams, Emanuele Capobianco, Director of Health and Care at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), explained that in the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, up to 80 per cent of people were infected during unsafe burials. Faced with a US$16 million shortfall, IFRC has called on the international community to urgently increase its investment in Ebola response, before the outbreak escalates further. Healthy diets vital for progress in Laos say UN food agencies Good nutrition depends not only on raising awareness about healthy foods and choices, but also on sustainable systems of delivery. With that in mind, UN agencies have been working with the Government and population of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic – or Laos as it’s commonly known – to achieve Zero Hunger, with initiatives that help farming families’ lives and livelihoods. The heads of the Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), the World Food Programme ( ) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( ) ended a three-day visit on Thursday, with a call for greater investment in nutrition, after seeing first-hand the impacts of their joint programmes.  WFP Executive Director said that he “could feel the sense of optimism from people in the communities” and that the work being done “helps create a better future for schoolchildren, for farmers and for families throughout the country." Laos has made good progress over the past twenty years in reducing poverty and hunger, but malnutrition remains an obstacle to the country's aim of becoming a middle-income country. Countries must up their game to reduce low birth weights, warns UN-backed report Many countries need to invest more and take greater action to reduce the number of babies born with low birth weights which put their health at risk, urges a United Nations-backed report released on Wednesday. Around one-in-seven babies worldwide weighed less than 5.5 pounds, or 2.5 kilogrammes at birth, according to latest data from 2015. The Lancet Global Health research paper was developed by experts from the World Health Organization ( ), UN Children’s Fund ( ) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which not only reveals that more than 20 million babies that year were born with a low birthweight, but that 80 per cent of the world’s 2.5 million low weight newborns die every year, because they are either pre-term and/or small for gestational age.

503-> Promoting gender equality a ‘crucial contribution’ in effort to restore, protect our planet’s oceans
Women are engaged in all aspects of interaction with our ocean, yet their voices are often missing at the decision-making level, the head of the United Nations cultural agency said on , emphasizing that “we must ensure diversity and gender inclusiveness at all levels” to set a balanced course for humanity and foster innovative solutions for the ocean. “We need to empower each and every citizen to take care of the ocean and enable all women to play transformative and ambitious roles in understanding, exploring, protecting and sustainably managing our ocean”, said , Director-General of , pointing out that this year’s “special edition” of World Oceans Day links the themes of gender equality and ocean preservation. Women engage in all aspects of ocean interaction, yet in many parts of the world, women’s contribution, both towards ocean-based livelihoods like fishing, and conservation efforts, are invisible and, gender inequality persists “from the marine industry to the field of ocean science”.  The UN says there is also very little data and research on these issues, and a concerted action towards gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls is still needed in all ocean-related sectors to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5 ( ). Not only is the ocean an increasingly important battleground for achieving gender equality, Ms. Azoulay said, “but building a more gender equal society also means empowering women and girls to be the actors of positive ocean change”. Citing UNESCO’s Global Ocean Science Report, Ms. Azoulay highlighted that women represent only 38 per cent of all ocean scientists. And while women make up 50 per cent of the marine and coastal industries workforce, “their wages continue to be lower than those of men”. “Mainstreaming gender equality throughout the Ocean Science Decade will help ensure that, by 2030, women as much as men are driving ocean science and management, helping to deliver the ocean we need for a prosperous, sustainable and environmentally secure future”, stressed the UNESCO chief. Pointing out that it is the source of the world’s fresh water, she recalled in her message on Saturday that the ocean “produces half of the oxygen we breathe, and powerfully affects our climate”. “Yet the ocean is endangered”, she lamented, saying that global warming, acidification, pollution, dead zones, harmful algal blooms and ecosystem degradation “reveal how far human activities have impacted on our oceans”.  Women segregated to ‘unrecognized labour’ In his message, flagged that for too long, “women have also been unable to share equally in ocean-supplied benefits”. They are often “segregated into low-skilled and unrecognized labour”, such as fish processing, and “denied a decision-making role”, he elaborated, adding that “similar treatment occurs in related sectors”, such as shipping, coastal tourism and marine science, “where the voices of women are frequently not heard”. The UN chief highlighted that "confronting gender inequality is essential” to achieving the ocean-related Goal and targets of the . “We must ensure an end to unsafe work conditions and guarantee that women have an equal role in managing ocean-related activities,” he underlined. In closing, Mr. Guterres urged governments, international organizations, private companies, communities and individuals to “promote gender equality and the rights of women and girls as a crucial contribution to meeting ocean challenges”. Preserving our common heritage Plastic pollution in the ocean is an especially pressing issue, having increased tenfold since 1980, according to the first Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, launched on 6 May in UNESCO. Moreover, plastic debris leads to the deaths of more than a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals every year. “This situation should engage us all in the preservation of our common environmental heritage”, Ms. Azoulay said. “It should drive humankind to understand the paramount importance of maintaining a healthy ocean, which we all depend on for life, climate, well-being and, more essentially, our future”. Against the backdrop, she noted that because “ocean challenges require urgent and collective action to reverse current trends”, the General Assembly proclaimed 2021-2030 as the Ocean Science Decade for Sustainable Development. Coordinated under UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the decade aims to “encourage international scientific collaboration as well as sustainable management of our oceans and coasts through the interplay of science and policy”, she continued. It also aims to mobilize citizens across cultures, gender and generations to preserve the ocean “because it is about our very survival as a species”, she maintained. Combatting plastics on the water Meanwhile, World Scouting has teamed up with the UN Environment Programme ( ) to create a new movement to battle against plastic pollution. Since its introduction in five countries across Africa, including Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius and Tanzania, some 27,000 youth from the Scouts, Girl Guides, Junior Achievement and various Universities, have undertaken a new Plastic Tide Turners Challenge Badge. “The Challenge Badge has made me live by the 3Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle,” said Yussif Kamara, a Scout from Accra in Ghana, who also participated in the badge programme. As part of UNEP and The Youth and UN Global Alliance’s (YUNGA) Clean Seas campaign, the aim is to mobilize a direct youth-led contribution to SDGs 14 and 15, Life Below Water, and Life on Land. And for the first time in World Scouting’s history, the badges will be made from ocean recovered plastic with the first certificates awarded to young leaders that have completed all three levels of the badge. At UN Headquarters in New York, storytellers and speakers globally have gathered to share their perspectives on building greater ocean and gender literacy and discovering ways to promote gender equality in ocean-related activities, such as marine scientific research, fisheries, labour at sea, migration by sea and human trafficking, policy-making and management.

504-> Climate chaos to continue in 2018, UN chief warns; Will the world rise to challenge?
Climate change “is still moving much faster than we are,” United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned on Thursday, calling for the political will, innovation and financing to cut global emissions by at least 25 per cent over the next two years. “Scientists are now worried that unless accelerated action is taken by 2020, ,” the UN chief told reporters at the world body’s New York Headquarters. The on climate change, adopted by world leaders in December 2015, aims to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursues efforts to limit the temperature increase even further, to 1.5 degrees. I am beginning to wonder how many more alarm bells must go off before the world rises to the challenge. “I am beginning to wonder how many more alarm bells must go off before the world rises to the challenge,” Mr. Guterres said, noting that 2017 had been filled with climate chaos and 2018 has already brought more of the same. “Climate change is still moving much faster than we are,” he warned, calling the phenomenon the greatest threat facing humankind. Recent information from the World Meteorological Organization ( ), the World Bank and the International Energy Agency shows the relentless pace of climate change. For instance, the UN chief said, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions rose 1.4 per cent, to a historic high of 32.5 gigatonnes.  Moreover, weather-related disasters caused some $320 billion in economic damage, making 2017 the costliest year ever for such losses. In social as well as economic terms, the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was devastating, washing away decades of development in an instant. In South Asia, major monsoon floods affected 41 million people. In Africa, severe drought drove nearly 900,000 people from their homes. Wildfires caused destruction across the world. Arctic sea ice cover in winter is at its lowest level, and the oceans are warmer and more acidic than at any time in recorded history. “This tsunami of data should create a storm of concern,” Mr. Guterres said, noting that next year he will convene a climate summit in New York aimed at boosting global ambition to meet the level of the climate challenge. “The Stone Age did not end because the world ran out of stones. It ended because there were better alternatives. The same applies today to fossil fuels,” he said, stressing the need for a further cut in greenhouse gas emissions of at least 25 per cent by 2020.  Responding to a question about the to pull out of the , Mr. Guterres said he received information from his Special Envoy on climate change and former New York City Mayor, , that there are expectations that the US – independently of the position of its Administration – might be able to meet the commitments made in Paris as a country due to the positive reactions of the American business community and local authorities. “All around the world, the role of governments is less and less relevant. The role of the economy, the role of the society is more and more relevant,” he said.

505-> Wednesday’s Daily Brief: #NoTobacco Day, China’s economy, family farming, #ClimateAction
This Wednesday, we cover: the dangers of smoking for World No Tobacco Day; China’s creative economy; sustainability through family farming, floating cities and #ClimateAction. Don’t let smoking steal life’s breathtaking moments, urges UN health agency Tobacco use continues to claim around eight million lives a year, the World Health Organization ( ) said on Wednesday, in a call for faster action from governments to tackle smoking and the “enormous” health, social, environmental and economic costs it entails. Ahead of World No Tobacco Day, marked on Friday, 31 May, WHO’s Dr Vinayak Prasad, acting Director, Department for the Prevention of Noncommunicable Diseases, highlighted the damage that tobacco causes to the lungs of smokers and non-smokers alike. Find . China’s ‘remarkable’ creative economy marches ahead China’s creative economy – which includes books, film, music and video games – is growing faster than other countries, making it the world’s driving force in the field over the past 15 years, says a new UN trade report. The study from the UN Conference on Trade and Development, , tracks national performance in the trade of creative goods and services between 2002 and 2015, and shows that China is the biggest single exporter and importer, with trade growing “exponentially” over the period. China’s performance is described in the report as “remarkable”, because of its sustained growth over three decades, its dominance of the world market for creative goods and services, and its role in sustaining the regional and global creative economy. Speaking to UN News, Amy-Louise Shelver from UNCTAD said the report shows that the view of China as simply “the factory of the world” is now outdated: “I think that’s a one-dimensional view of what’s actually happening in China. Obviously China’s growth over the past 20 to 30 years has certainly been based on its performance as a factory of the world: that’s what it’s used to kickstart its economy. Subsequent to that, there’s been a massive broadening of China’s goods and services offering, and it’s important to see it as a multi-dimensional economy, not simply a manufacturing hub.” Family farms are ‘drivers of sustainable development’ Launching the in Rome on Wednesday, two UN agencies have lauded family-run farms, which account for over 90 per cent of the sector, as “key drivers of sustainable development,” that play a major role in ending hunger and malnutrition. The Food and Agriculture Organization ( ) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( ) also announced a to upgrade support for family farmers, particularly those in developing countries, with detailed guidance for the international community. Although farmers produce most of our food, they are vulnerable to poverty, especially in developing countries, and the plan highlights the need to increase access to social protection for farmers, as well as finance, training and opportunities to generate income. Mozambique cyclones a ‘wake-up call’ to boost resistance: UN weather agency The havoc caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth across Mozambique is “a wake-up call” for vulnerable countries “to build resistance" against further high-impact tropical storms, coastal flooding and intense rainfall linked to climate change, according to the United Nations weather agency chief. A World Meteorological Organization ( ) fact-finding mission to Mozambique recommended on Wednesday a package of disaster-risk-reduction priorities to strengthen the country’s early warning systems and reduce damage due to weather, climate and water-related hazards.

506-> Earth Hour: UN joins iconic landmarks ‘going dark’ globally with a call to protect environment
The United Nations this evening turned off the lights at its iconic Headquarters in New York as well as at other facilities around the world in observance of “Earth Hour” – a global event highlighting the need for climate action and sustainable energy consumption. In a video message, UN urged people around the world to join him in “turning out the lights and turning up the pressure” for a healthy planet. “Climate change is moving much faster than we are. Its alarming impacts are upon us; resources and ecosystems across the world are under assault. Earth Hour is an opportunity to show our resolve to change,” he said. “Protecting the environment is preserving life itself,” stressed the UN chief. Organized by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Earth Hour encourages individuals, companies, organizations and Governments throughout the world to switch off their lights for one hour at 8:30 p.m. local time. This year, Earth Hour is stressing the link between climate change and biodiversity loss, as thousands of plant and animal species are threatened with extinction as a result of increasing temperatures. First launched in 2007 in Australia, Earth Hour has been commemorated every year since, mobilizing hundreds of millions of individuals to participate and growing to become one of the world’s largest grassroots movement for the environment and climate action.

507-> Hunger rates remain high amid conflict, climate shocks, warns UN food security report
Increased hunger and food insecurity, fuelled by conflict and climatic challenges, continues to inflict suffering on populations in different parts of the world, forcing them to remain dependent on humanitarian assistance, a new United Nations report has warned. According to the report, issued Monday by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( ), the need for external food assistance in 37 countries – either affected by conflict or adverse climate shocks – remains unchanged compared to the situation three months back. “Civil war and insecurity are direct reasons for high hunger rates in 16 of those countries, ranging from Burundi to Yemen,” said FAO in a announcing the findings. “Conflict is displacing millions of people, hampering agricultural activities and, in many cases, also driving basic food prices up sharply,” it added. At the same time, inadequate and erratic rainfall is also posing a growing threat to food security in southern and eastern Africa, where many rural households have suffered from four consecutive drought-affected agricultural seasons. In Somalia, aggregated cereal production for the country’s “deyr” rainy season is estimated at 20 per cent below average, and similar pattern in rainfall and yields has been observed in north-eastern Tanzania. Furthermore, prices of staple cereals such as wheat, millet or sorghum continued to remain high as a result of removal of subsidies, increased demand, and weakening of currencies. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, inflation pushed prices to more than double in 2017 to a 42 percent annual rate. Another factor driving up prices was the disruption of traditional trade routes due to violence, such as in and around the Sahel, as a result of which countries dependent on these routes (such as Libya) witnessed much higher prices as well as facing food shortages. The FAO report lists the following 37 countries as currently in need of external food assistance: Afghanistan; Burkina Faso; Burundi; Cameroon; Central African Republic; Chad; Congo; Democratic People’s Republic of Korea; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Djibouti; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Guinea; Haiti; Iraq; Kenya; Lesotho; Liberia; Libya; Madagascar; Malawi; Mali; Mauritania; Mozambique; Myanmar; Niger; Nigeria; Pakistan; Sierra Leone; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Swaziland; Syria; Uganda; Yemen; and Zimbabwe.

508-> Central Africa’s iconic mammals threatened by poachers, armed groups – UN environment wing
Elephants, giraffes, rhinos and other magnificent mammals targeted in wildlife conservation areas of Central Africa are under threat of extinction, caught in the crosshairs of armed groups and highly-militarized poachers, the United Nations environment wing warned on Friday. “The importance of , and of enhancing their alternative livelihoods, has now been widely recognized across various national, regional and global fora” said Bianca Notarbartolo of the UN Environment Programme ( ). “But such commitments have yet to be matched by enough effective implementation,” she added. UNEP’s warning comes in the wake of the release last month by the non-governmental organization Traffic of a report reflecting the grim reality the negative impact of armed groups on wildlife in Central Africa. As recently as three decades ago, thousands of elephants strode majestically across the wildlife conservation areas of Central Africa. Today, their population has been decimated, according the 2017 report. In the 1980s, the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Garamba National Park was home to 20,000 elephants. That number has dwindled to an estimated 1,100 – 1,400 today. The situation appears even grimmer for the giraffes. In many African societies, the flywhisk, usually made from the animal’s tail, is a symbol of authority. The flywhisk from the Kordofan giraffe is particularly prized, putting this species in danger from poachers and other armed groups. Consequently, only about 40 giraffes remain in the Garamba Park. Some of the armed non-State groups and militia operating in the restive region include Sudan’s Janjaweed militia, Uganda’s Lord’s Resistance Army, Central African Republic’s rival Anti-Balaka and Seleka fighters, as well as Sudan’s People’s Liberation-In Opposition and poachers – making conservation a dangerous undertaking. Chimpanzees have also not been spared from the onslaught. The population of eastern chimpanzees in eastern the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) has declined by 80 to 98 per cent, mainly because of poaching for bushmeat – attributed to demand for protein, particularly intense around artisanal mining and logging camps. The dual effect of insufficient nutrition, coupled with mining pollution is likely to exacerbate the threat to the region’s biodiversity, resulting in a downward spiral that could jeopardize future livelihoods of numerous local communities. In May 2016, UNEP and other UN partners launched the campaign, which has been raising awareness, promoting the enactment and enforcement of laws, and increasing support for efforts by local communities to halt the illegal trade in wildlife. Elephants and Rhinos are among the species targeted by the campaign. “Strengthening the role of local communities in wildlife management should be at the centre of any strategy to combat illegal trade in wildlife and to secure wildlife and biodiversity for the future,” stressed Ms. Notarbartolo.
