0-> MODERN INDIA IN FICTION; In "The Burnt Offering" Mrs. Cotes Gives a Picture of Conditions That Form the Political Problems of To-day
IT is as well to admit frankly in the beginning that we are incapable of writing an adequate review of Mrs. Everard Cote's strong novel.

--------
1-> SENSITIVE SENATORS.
Sensitiveness in politics is sometimes calculated. When Senator COBB with an appearance of great indignation resented the words "weaklings" and "crooks" used by Senator HINMAN in exposing the devices by which the investigation into corruption has been "queered" in the Senate report, he must have known that Mr. HINMAN made no personal application of those words.

--------
7-> STIMSON WANTS DIX TO ANSWER QUESTIONS; Asks How He Stands Regarding the Public Service Law -- Did He Favor Its Repeal?
KINGSTON, N.Y., Oct. 18 -- More like a campaigner and less like a lawyer than ever, Henry L Stimson went through Ulster and Delaware Counties to-day pleading his cause.

8-> THE FUNERAL PROCESSION.; Roosevelt in Eighth Carriage -- Lunches with King Afterward.
LONDON, May 20 -- In the procession which followed the body of King Edward through London's streets to-day with a pomp and pageantry which far exceeded that which attended Queen Victoria's funeral, and in which nine Kings followed the dead ruler on horseback, the order of precedence so far as related to the soverigns was governed by kinship. 
--------
9-> RELIGIOUS MUSIC.; Would Have a Great Festival an Annual Affair.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The Church of the Strangers, in Fifty-seventh Street, just west of Eighth Avenue, has acquired the commendable habit of having singing at its front door before the regular evening services begin.

--------
11-> Hardships of House Servants.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I can heartily sympathize with "A Workingman," who writes in to-day's issue on house servants. Few who read of the lot of the shirtwaist strikers have any idea of the conditions under which servants labor. A man or woman in a private house is little better than a puppet, as he is subject to the slightest whim or fancy of the employer.

13-> REINCARNATION.
As the idea that Master SIDIS of Harvard is a reincarnation of some great intellect of the past was first promulgated in THE NEW YORK TIMES, by one of its readers, and not by any Boston Theosophist or Cambridge psychologist whatsoever, we feel justified in proudly commenting upon the wide publicity it has received, and the measure of favor accorded to it in select imaginative circles.

--------
16-> "COMMERCIAL WOLVES."

--------
28-> OFFERS LEISHMAN LOAN OF HER HOME; Mrs. Baldwin Would Turn Rome Apartment Over to the Ambassador's Family.
ROME, March 5. -- To say, as has been done, that Mr. Leishman, the American Ambassador, has found an apartment is so misleading a statement that it requires explanation.

AS a student of mental problems the literary detector (shall we so call him?) has his uses.

Mme. Nazimova's reappearance last night in a new theatre which bears her name, though accomplished in a play of Ibsen's which never can be popular in the playhouse, and always leaves the reader in some doubt, nevertheless was artistically accomplished.

926-> SCRIMMAGE SCORES KEENE'S FIRST RACE; Wild Mint Colt Wins Ozone Stakes in a Wet Day's Sport at Aqueduct.
Aside from some scattering race results at the Aqueduct course yesterday the weather was the dominating thing. Ola patrons of the Queens County Jockey Club could hot recall a worse day, and the track was so bad that the time fairly approximated trotting records.

Bernhardt presented Rostand's play of Christ and the Woman of Samaria, "La Samaritaine," yesterday afternoon, for the first time in New York.

957-> A NOBLE EDITOR
IT does not comport with our general notion of the composition of the British nobility, that one of its members should have won his title by reducing the price of a morning newspaper from three pence to a penny.
