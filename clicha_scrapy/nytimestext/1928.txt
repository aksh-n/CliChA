309-> THE SCREEN; The Spell of Beauty.
"Skinner's Big Idea," the current film attraction at the Hippodrome, is a title that arouses expectations. It is, however, a photoplay constructed along the lines of least resistance. The so-called "big idea" works out well enough in motion-picture theory, but it would probably meet with no little ridicule in the ordinary course of human events. Mr. Skinner nevertheless finds that his brain-wave goes along without the least friction, but the action of this story does not impress one with the young man's genius.In this tepid effort there are a few mildly amusing periods, but there is nothing particularly original in the direction or the narrative. It is a case of an idea being overwhelmingly successful, and the director, Lynn Shores, has not seen fit to include much in the way of conflict.Mr. Skinner, at the opening of the story, is appointed a partner in his firm, and the senior members suggest that Mr. Skinner ought to get rid of the three elderly gentlemen who have been, faithful and loyal to the concern for many years. Mr. Skinner has a soft place in his heart for these old fellows, and he decides to try out his idea, which is to employ an attractive girl in the office. Jack McLaughlin, the son of the senior partner, happens to be in love with an actress, and it is this girl whom Skinner employs to stimulate and invigorate the office force. This Dorothy, a stranger to business offices, apparently is a clever girl, for she soon understands the work, and through her charming appearance and vivacity the old employes begin to carry out their alloted tasks with unusual enthusiasm. The bald-headed man elects to wear a wig, and the others become greatly interested in their personal appearance. They even take up golf, and it is through this that they are able to obtain the order that saves the firm from ruin. And they do this after young McLaughlin has tried out his ideas as a go-getter salesman.Martha Sleeper is attractive as Dorothy. Bryant Washburn is rather dull as Skinner."His Majesty Dozes."At the Greenwich Village Theatre, where Dr. Paul Fejos's picture, "The Last Moment," is still on exhibition, Marion Green, the baritone, is appearing in quite a charming musical sketch known as "His Majesty Dozes." It was written by Hunter Williams, and Friml, Romberg and Bennett are responsible for the music. Mr. Green figures as a court singer, and the other characters include Mme. Pompadour and Louis XV.

378-> BRITISH FILM HISTORY; The Talking Films. The Royal Family.
THERE is nothing new under the sun. Icarus was the first aviator and in his courageous attempt to fly to the sun we have a precedent for more recent projects to shoot rockets at the moon. The Chinese invented gunpowder a thousand years ago and the Romans had central heating.Similarly, talking films are over twenty years old. It seems rather hard on Mr. Lasky, their latest discoverer, but as far back as 1907 the film sensation of the year was the "chronophone" or talking film. The English, who are interested in the past and particularly the past of the motion picture because they claim to have invented it, have lately been indulging in screened reminiscences of the screen's early days. Within the past fortnight two extraordinarily interesting films of considerable chronological value have been trade shown in London. One is called "The Evolution of the Film" and the other "Just Twenty Years Ago." The first is the history of the film industry, the second is—just history.The English, as has been said, claim to have invented the film, and one of their grievances against America is that America will not admit it. In "The Evolution of the Film" they seek to make their contention good for all time. They show that an Englishman, William Friese-Greene, was the father of all films and are able to quote a United States Supreme Court decision against Thomas Edison and other claimants. It was Friese-Greene who first thought of using a continuous strip of material perforated at the edges so that it could run over sprocket wheels. In 1889 this West Country photographer, whose name—like that of most people connected with the very early history of the film industry—is now scarcely known, made the first film, which was a picture of London traffic at Hyde Park Corner. A few years later, so the record runs, Edison produced his kinetoscope and with it the super-films of that time, which reached the unprecedented length of forty feet.The Talking Films.Lumière was also experimenting in France and had evolved a piece of film mechanism that is still unique, since it was camera, printer and projector combined. It was Lumière who staged in London in 1896 what is claimed to be the first actual exhibition of films. "The Evolution of the Film" reproduces some of these and they are of remarkable intrinsic as well as historical interest. Among them is a picture—made in 1895—of a train arriving at a Paris station. It is on record that several members of that early audience found this film too realistic and hurriedly left the old Polytechnic, where it was being shown. Film audiences are not so easily impressed today.The film "Just Twenty Years Ago" is a real proof that the motion picture business is no longer an infant industry, that it is older, in fact, than the generation which makes up the greater part of modern audiences. In this film Englishmen are shown events that happened before they were born. It is a faithful record of representative aspects of the late Victorian and early Edwardian periods. It is interesting, instructive, and forms a basis for excellent comparisons with the times in which we live. As I write, for instance, it is Wimbledon tennis week in London. Miss Helen Wills is hitting as hard and Se∼orita de Alvarez as soon as most men. But twenty years ago we see two highly respectable young females—women were females in those days—decorously patting the ball to each other or gathering up their trailing skirts to take a few mincing steps in pursuit of any return not within arm's length. Any ball that could not be reached without loss of dignity is let alone, and one can imagine the reproachful glance with which this "unladylike" conduct on the part of the opponent responsible for it was received.The Royal Family.Then again, the ornament of the modern bathing beach clad in thin "maillot," or the Channel swimmer attired even more simply in nothing but a coating of grease, is put to shame by a seaside scene which shows how our mothers and fathers did these things in the timid days of old. From cabins on high wheels by the water's edge primly emerge figures clad from neck halfway to ankles in stiff and shapeless serge, generously braided. They proceed with due gravity into the sea, there to bob decorously up and down or perhaps, with costume ballooning a foot above the water, to take a few gasping strokes.Of greater interest is a picture of King Edward, clad in a long cape and setting off on a pony for a day's shooting. A wasp-waisted figure near him is easily identified as Queen Alexandra, an erect and stately girl as the present Queen Mary, and a fourth figure as King George V. then Prince of Wales. Another section of film shows Persimmon winning the Derby for King Edward in 1896. This was incidentally the last royal victory in England's classic racing event. Film patrons of today who were not even old enough to see the great war are taken really far back into history by a picture of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee procession with its columns of British and colonial troops, many of whom afterward fought in the Boer War of twenty-eight years ago.Milton Sills's next starring picture for First National, "The Barker," will have sound effects. Screening on the production has just been completed, with cast including Dorothy Mackaill, Betty Compson and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.

432-> KENTUCKY COURAGE" FAIR.; Richard Barthelmess Is Good Only in Parts of Film at Strand.
The best that may be said of this picture is that it is only fair. Mr. Barthelmess does not make a good rugged type of youthful hero and many of the good parts have been cut from John Fox Jr.'s "The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come," on which the plot is based. Even Jack, the dog, keeps facing the camera rather than his master's voice.The story is of a mountain boy who loses his mother while he is young and who "never had a pappy." A friend of his mother offers to care for him, but the boy and his dog run off. They meet the Dillons and then the Turners. The latter take the stranger in and presently an itinerant schoolmaster offers to show him the sights of the city. They go down the river in the Spring.In the first large city at which the pair stop, Chad, the boy, buys a horse and is lost from his companion, the schoolmaster. A Major Buford finds him, and his own son having died, adopts the little wanderer. Next door lives General Dean, a lifelong friend of the Major, with his wife and daughter, Margaret.While Chad is in college the Civil War breaks out, so he comes back South to tell his friends and the Major that he is to fight in the Union Army. The Major bids him a sorrowful goodbye; Margaret turns from him in scorn. Later in the war, when Chad is a Captain, he is sent back to the mountains to clean out the notorious "Dillon Gang"—headed by his old enemy, Daws Dillon. Melissa Turner, the daughter of the mountain family which first took him in, is the only one remaining true to him."The Little Shepherd" as a book went smoothly and logically along with a natural swing; the picture does not. There are gory fights, and rainstorms and horseback riding, making a turbulence of what was once a particularly fine story.Mr. Barthelmess, in the title rôle, is all right as soon as he gets to the college stage of his career. In earlier life, however, when he is homeless and alone, he is absurd. Melissa, played by Molly O'Day, is the most carefully drawn character.

452-> THE SCREEN; A Melodrama, of Ireland. Messrs. Dane and Arthur. The Soul of a City. Other Photoplays.
Sure, it's a fine horse race in Hangman's House," that new picture at the Roxy Theatre. It is exactly like a race in old Erin, and it makes you think quite a bit of the Grand National, and, as every one knows, it's invariably an Irish horse that wins at Aintree. It's a great picture this, with the mists hanging over the dear old roads, the green, he cottages and the water. The black-hearted scoundrel now and again, it's true, gives you too much of his infernal smirking, and John Ford, the director, a man from Irish stock, makes this villain drink too much. Sure he's always carrying the bottle with him through the rooms of the fine old castle, the place that's known as "Hangman's House," for it's there that James O'Brien lives. And he's the fellow who sees in the Ïreplace of his library all the men and women he's sentenced to death.Victor McLaglen, with a cuss every how and again on his lips for John Darcy, is grand as Citizen Hogan, that splendid fellow who poses as a monk and then as a blind beggar, so as to even up matters with Darcy. It's he who weds first Hogan's sister, and deserts her, and then takes for his bride Connaught O'Brien, who is in love with that upstanding young chap, Dermott McDermott. It's Dermott, bless his soul, who wins the race on St. Stephen's Day, and it's that blackguard Darcy, who, after having caused a jockey to be murdered, shoots the poor horse.This story has an excellent start, for Citizen Hogan is introduced as an officer in the French army in Algiers, and it's after returning from ??? patrol that he receives a telegram ???etting him know that his sister died shortly after Darcy deserted her. What would you expect a man like Hogan to do? Just what he does. He stands up at the mess table and ???ays to his commandant:"You'll have to be excusing me for ??? while, as I've got a man to kill."You don't then know why, but you suspect that any man that Hogan's going to kill deserves all that he gets. There's no shilly-shallying about Hogan, for he travels to Ireland to find his man, risking capture by the British, who have offered a reward for him, dead or alive. The first glimpse that Darcy catches of Hogan, dressed as a monk, causes Mr. Darcy to expect that his end's coming soon and that it's not going to be a very comfortable exit from the world.Faith, and the Judge's daughter, Connaught, surely inherited her prettiness and her kindness from her mother. She's so sweet that when the selfish old Judge asks her to marry Darcy she consents to do so to satisfy this father of hers. The old man at the time is told by his physician that he may live a day or so and possibly a month, but no more. That's his sentence for sending so many poor people to the gallows. And he doesn't live a month. The knowledge that he's going to die soon causes the monster to reflect on his inhuman sentences, and this hastens the end. Anyway, his daughter is unlike him. She has a charming nose, eyes like the reflections in Killarney's lakes, real eyebrows that haven't been plucked and lips, which, although the picture isn't colored, bring to one's mind a red rose. And in real life all this beauty belongs to June Collyer, whose acting is good, but occasionally it seems as though she were a little nervous. And, seeing all that's happening around her, with a bearded villain winning her hand in marriage, it's no wonder that she is occasionally kind of scared.Larry Kent is a nice young man. He plays Dermott, who wins the horse race and also, as you expect, Connaught. It is a man named Earle Foxe who officiates as Darcy. Mr. Foxe is pretty good, for he makes Darcy just about as bad a villain as one would hope to see. But Mr. Foxe is a trifle too fond of smiling in a sinister fashion when he's got the upper hand. It's the smile of anticipation, like that of Victor MeLagIen, that means something. Those old-fashioned villains always used to snort and smirk, but the new type, although just as bad, don't care to reveal their gratification at an ignoble victory.And, just before "Hangman's House" flows to the screen, there are sundry features of considerable interest, especially a charming affair preceding the picture. It has nothing to do with Ireland. It's a Venetian fantasy, rich and lovely, with a fine sense of color combinations and graceful dancing. A Melodrama of Ireland.HANGMAN'S HOUSE, with Victor McLaglen, June Collyer, Larry Kent, Earle Foxe, Hobart Bosworth, Belle Stoddard, Joseph Burke, Eric Mayne and others, adapted from Donn Byrne's novel, directed by John Ford; overture, impressions of "Faust"; "The Miser's Death," a dramatic episode; Beatrice Balkin; a "Kaleidoscopic Dance"; "The Spirit of Labor"; Movietone news reel; "Notte Venezia," with Markert's thirty-two Roxyettes. At the Roxy Theatre.At the outset, "Circus Rookies," the current film attraction at the Capitol Theatre, promises to be an intelligent piece of fun, but it is not long before it drops into a valley of stupidity. Some of the knockabout stuff is mildly amusing and it created some tittering and giggling in the audience yesterday afternoon, but when the picture had faded from the screen, precious little lingers in one's mind, beyond, perhaps, the puddles of water that are always strangely ready to receive Karl Dane's bulk when wrapped in an ice-cream suit. So far as this water hazard is concerned, it keeps up to the bitter end, for in one of the last flashes Mr. Dane is beheld receiving a ducking in a cattle trough from a temperamental gorilla.The first stage of this film is by far the best. It rather reminds one of the sideshow Wild Man, in every-day life a brow-beaten husband who shudders with fright as the manager contemplates permitting a huge negro to enter his cage. In this picture Mr. Magoo, the circus manager, has been unfortunate with his gorillakeepers. Periodically, the huge animal claws the men and renders them utterly unfit for work for at least one season.Mr. Thrush (Mr. Dane) is anxious to get a job and, as the weather is fine and he delights in outdoor life, he thinks that he would prefer to work in a circus than in a cellar or a speakeasy. The circus manager is not at the moment desirous of adding to his payroll. Soon, however, the gorilla goes on a tear and another keeper is sent to the hospital.Mr. Thrush is then thought to be an excellent selection for this hazardous position. He is not told anything about the viciousness of the brute, but merely instructed to "clean out that cage." The manager goes on talking of tickets and graft when he chances to look in the direction of the gorilla's cage. Mr. Thrush is perceived sweeping. Asked excitedly where the monster is, Mr. Thrush replies that he cleaned him out. Subsequently the gorilla is found. The brute has taken a great liking to Mr. Thrush, apparently because Mr. Thrush has had the good sense to share his bananas with the animal. It is with relatively little difficulty that the gorilla is persuaded to return to its cage. This amazes the manager, especially when Mr. Dane puts his face to the bars and says to the gorilla:"Kiss Papa."The rest of the production is wild, bringing in occasionally the gorilla, a train, constant fighting and dodging by Mr. Thrush and Francis Byrd (George K. Arthur).The acting is very good, but the direction and the story are a disappointment.The most interesting feature on the Capitol program is a Technicolor picture of a bridge game, in which the leading part is acted by Milton C. Work. Mr. Work also appears on the stage and talks lightly and enthusiastically about bridge. The film, called "Auction Bridge," shows Mr. Work making a grand slam after having bid one heart and being raised to three hearts by his partner. This film is well arranged for the screen, the four hands and also every play being clearly seen.There is to be a bridge party at the Capitol at 10 o'clock this morning. Mr. Work will give hints to the players, who will be seated at tables on the mezzanine floor. Messrs. Dane and Arthur.CIRCUS ROOKIES, with Karl Dane, George K. Arthur, Louise Lorraine, Sydney Jarvis and Fred Humes, directed by Edward Sedgwick; "Auction Bridge," a Technicolor pictorial subject with Milton C. Work; Mr. Work's short talk; "Capitol Gambol," with Walt Roesner and others. At the Capitol Theatre."Berlin, A Symphony of a Big City" is an exceptionally clever production in which there are flashes of a variety of activities in a metropolis from dawn one day to dawn the next. It was conceived by Carl Mayer and executed by Karl Freund, the cameraman who was responsible for the remarkable photographic feats in "Variety" and "The Last Laugh." It is much the best picture of his type that has been made, and while it, of course, has no story it is always interesting. As the scenes pass on one realizes the diligent, resourceful and imaginative task in the making of this subject. There is nothing haphazard about it, for the sparks of life are filmed with serious continuity and a keen sense of the artistic.The first "shot" is that of a slothful body of water at daybreak. From that the producer takes his audience to trains coming from the suburbs, to street cars and buses, and then the empty city streets are depicted. Finally stragglers come along, then an increasing number of people are beheld pursuing their daily goal. The various occupations of the hosts are brought out by crisp scenes of factories, turning out electric light bulbs and other articles.An excellent episode is that dealing with the luncheon hour. Not only are the shopgirls, the clerks and their employers depicted feeding the inner man, but there are scenes in a zoo, showing that eating is popular on all sides.Toward evening the picture-makers have shrewdly decided to add to the effect by showing the streets after a gentle rain. The reflections of the lights on the asphalt paving are really beautiful. Gradually the workers are perceived leaving their toil and lights are turned on in houses, hotels and stores. This follows a fair conception of sports on water and land.Then the theatres are shown and subsequently cabarets, and in the end sleep conquers the life of the metropolis.Other interesting features at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse include that charming prize color production, "The Nightingale," also a Langdon comedy called "The Bridegroom" and a very old Mary Pickford film.Other Photoplays."Tempest," with John Barrymore, will be presented on Thursday evening at the Embassy Theatre.At the Rivoli the feature is "Ramona," with Dolores Del Rio."Steamboat Bill Jr." is at the Rialto.At the Hippodrome is "Speedy," with Harold Lloyd."Sealed Lips" is at the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse."The Raider Emden" is at the Cameo, "The Trail of '98" at the Astor, "The Man Who Laughs" at the Central, "Wings" at the Criterion, "Abie's Irish Rose" at the Forty-fourth Street, "Four Sons" at the Gaiety, "Street Angel" at the Globe, "Carmen" at the Greenwich Village, "Mother Machree" at the Times Square, "Glorious Betsy" at Warner's and "Speedy" at the Broadway.

He arrives running. However, the woman has a word to say to him, and, as she surmised would be the case, the millions of the husband quickly reattract the wife.Miss Griffith manages the leading rôle pleasantly enough, save when it jumps heavily into comedy. The other woman in the case is played by Kathryn Carver, and Edmund Lowe is the man.The Movietone News includes scenes of the Etna eruption, talks by two survivors of the Vestris and an attempt by Robert Benchley to cut the Thanksgiving turkey.

1339-> OUTLOOK IN GERMANY; Gloomy Situation, Without Pictures of Exceptional Quality, Described by Writer A Sparkless Picture. A Post-War Yarn. You Never Can Tell.
DURING the seven years that I have been in Germany never has the film situation looked so black as at the present moment. The Ufa, still in the strongest position, has not brought out a single picture of exceptional quality—indeed, I should even go further and class not one of their releases as of interest for general American consumption. One or two other concerns are none too affluent, and the newly formed Defina, backed by First National, does not promise pictures of anything of more than average calibre.Just look, for instance, at the program of the Ufa and the Parufamet, the distributing organization in which Paramount and Metro have a share. Its backbone is the Eichberg and Schuenzel comedies, the Henny Porten dramas and farces. The Eichberg pictures, though popular in Germany, are utterly unthinkable for America. Beside the skillful and often subtle work of the Hollywood comedy directors this German product seems the crudest knock-about. Reinhold Schuenzel, as well, is a purely national figure. The Teutons like his dry humor, but he is a limited player and his scenarios are without continuity or originality. Henny Porten, who may be remembered by a few for her work as Anne Boleyn in "Deception," is, on the contrary, a real artist. Her farces are often actually funny and her dramas of high quality, but her buxom figure bars her from ever winning an American following.The season is half over and not one of the big Ufa features for which the tom-tom has been vigorously beaten has lived up to expectation.You already know the operetta film "The Last Waltz," so I need not report how sad it seemed after the delicate "Waltz Dream." Its reception in Germany was: "Just another operetta picture!"A Sparkless Picture.THEN Karl Grune's "Am Rande der Welt" (On the Edge of the World) came and sprawled down sickeningly. This director has been touted as one of the big German megaphone handlers, but I personally could never catch the spark in his work. His last film is one of those abstract pacifistic affairs which are commendable in tendency but don't help their cause because of their sterilized impersonality.It seems that two nations with equally comic uniforms are making war upon each other. In a mill which lies near the border a spy is at his evil work with a concealed telephone. Boom! Boom! The enemy capture the mill. The spy sends wrong messages to save the miller's daughter, whom he loves, but she falls for the young enemy Lieutenant. The spy is found out. Boom! Boom! The mill is bombarded and goes up in flames. The two lovers go off hand in hand. To the wife of the miller's son a child is born (I strongly suspect symbolism here).Even such a suggestive actress as Brigitte Helm of "Metropolis" is leaden under Grime's touch. After this sour lemonade one rushes out longing for a good strong draft of the refreshing concreteness of "What Price Glory" or "The Big Parade." Whew!A Post-War Yarn.A PARTICULAR disappointment to me was another Ufa picture, "The Love of Jeanne Ney." Its director, G. W. Pabst, has been a favorite of mine for years and I was glad to see his talent come to fruition in the brilliant Freud film "Secrets of the Soul." In this last film, however, he has missed the mark by half a house. The novel by Ilya Ehrenburg from which the picture was taken is, I am told, an excellent and suggestive piece of work, but the scenario is lacking in concentration and consistency.It begins in the Crimea just after the close of the World War. Jeanne, the daughter of a French journalist, and Andreas, a Soviet leader, are attracted to each other. The Soviets take the city and Jeanne's father is killed. But she herself is helped by her lover to escape to Paris. There she takes a position as secretary to her uncle, a callous private detective. His daughter is blind and Chalybieff, a swindler who has been partially responsible for the death of Jeanne's father, is making love to the blind girl in order to get her dowry. Andreas is sent to Paris on a secret mission and he and Jeanne meet often. The uncle has a very valuable diamond in his safe and is murdered by Chalybieff while he is stealing the jewel. The swindler is able to throw suspicion on Andreas, who is unwilling to tell his whereabouts as he had spent the night with Jeanne. Jeanne, however, remembers that Chalybieff had seen them together on the night of the murder and goes to ask help. He believes that she knows the truth and gives up the jewel.The scenes in Russia are promising in their melancholy drabness, but so soon as the action shifts to Paris all atmosphere is lost. The uncle is handled in a cheaply humorous style and the blind daughter is such a side issue as never to awaken our interest or sympathy. Also, Chalybieff is overplayed in the most exaggerated manner, a typical ten-twenty-thirty villain and one can almost hear his "Ha! Ha! Ha! Foiled again!" And then the two young lovers: Uno Henning was satisfying from a Continental viewpoint, but Edith Jehanne is one of those film beauties with two expressions, of which one is "dumb." Why did Pabst choose this French player when he could have any number of German actresses who would have been far better in the rôle? For instance, Brigitte Helm, who is sentenced to the thankless part of the blind girl. I suppose the idea is to make the picture more salable in France—an attempt to put into practice the much discussed Franco-German alliance against America. If this is going to be typical of the results (as I am afraid it will be), Hollywood will be able to sleep nights again.Of course, the season is hardly half over and all my gloomy prognostications may be refuted in the Spring. Surely nothing could be more desirable, as Hollywood without European stimulation is unthinkable. And several of the promised Ufa releases read most encouragingly. Fritz Lang of "Metropolis" has completed "Spione," Elisabet Bergner will star in "Donna Diana," "The Mysterious Mirror" is said to bring entirely novel technical effects. And Erich Pommer is back again with a series of three films in view.You Never Can Tell.NOT to leave a bad taste in your mouth, let me mention briefly the gay little film "Das K. und K. Balletmaedel" (The Royal Ballet Girl), which has been made independently by the Hugo Engel Film Company. Its story is not violently original: It merely concerns a little dancer whom a Viennese Grand Duke takes a liking to, but who really cares for and finally gets his aide-de-camp. But its director, Max Neufeld, has caught the easy superficiality of Vienna before the war. Its characters are in love with life but sympathetic and jolly with it all. Particularly is the little coryphée played by Dina Gralla with grace and charm. An elfin sense of humor, not at all Teutonic in its piquancy, sets her off from the other feminine stars.

1386-> THE SCREEN
Further evidence of the potentialities of the talking film was offered last night by Warner Brothers, when they launched at Warners' Theatre the Vitaphoned version of George M. Cohan's stage comedy. "The Home Towners." Having been produced with a sense of restraint and an intelligent conception of the coupling of the cinematic values with the lines, it provided an agreeable entertainment. It has, it is true, mechanical defects, for sometimes the voices were a trifle explosive and on other occasions they were not a little too weak. But it was plain that with experience the players will learn to control their voices, or, perhaps the directors will eventually learn more about the control of sound.It is perhaps the first feature-length production, in which there is no singing, that actually holds the interest through the story. It has its quota of amusement as well as suspense, and because several of the players were accustomed to the stage, they played their parts without being intimidated by the fact that microphones were in the offing.This Vitaphoned conception of "The Home Towners" is a great stride in the right direction for talking films, and one of the principal reasons is the fact that the adapters have used common sense in what changes they made in the play. They give certain scenic additions with sound, but these episodes enhance the worth of the production. A conversation is carried on in an automobile, and it is an integral part of the story. There are other sections that take place aboard a train. In the beginning the camera is switched from a compartment on board the train to a flash of the train itself as it speeds on through the darkness.The director is a little too fond of jangling telephone bells and a buzzer that sounds abnormally loud, but, even so, it is not irritating. However, if these sounds were more subdued, it would add to the general realistic idea of the picture. There are other sounds that strike one as being artificial, even though they undoubtedly are obtained from the real thing. There are also periods of silence when one expects to hear a buzz or rustle.Richard Bennett, who appears as "Vic" Arnold, a rôle acted on the stage by William Elliott; Robert McWade, who portrays the same character he did before the footlights, and Robert Edeson, as Mr. Calhoun, do a great deal to cause one to take this feature more seriously than any others. Mr. McWade was given to shouting on the stage, and his voice is even more stentorian in this shadow translation. He is, however, thoroughly amusing as the fault-finding and suspicious South Bend man who causes all the trouble.Mr. Bennett grasps better than any of the other players what is wanted in this talking picture, for his intonation is most pleasing and his diction invariably clear.Mr. Edeson has a minor rôle, that of the publican whose daughter is to marry "Vic" Arnold, but he reveals that in spite of his long absence from the stage he has not forgotten that words must be accompanied by suitable actions and expressions. Gladys Brockwell, a screen actress, figures as Mrs. Bancroft, and she does quite well with this character.Doris Kenyon is charming as Beth Calhoun, the girl who is engaged to "Vic" Arnold, but much more was to have been expected from the vocal side of her performance.This comedy, it may be remembered, is concerned with the disappointment of the elderly P. H. Bancroft of South Bend, when he discovers that this old friend "Vic" Arnold is engaged to marry a girl less than half his age. Bancroft, who eventually is alluded to as a man with a "Main Street mind," suspects in turn the brother, the husband and even the mother of Arnold's bride-to-be of conspiring to get money from Arnold. He hears that old Calhoun has invented a bottle washer and that Arnold has bought 51 per cent, of the stock for $200,000. Arnold tells him that Beth Arnold's brother Wally is now earning $15,000 a year in his (Arnold's) brokerage concern, and that Arnold expects to make Wally a member of his firm.From Wally, to Bancroft's surprise, he learns that this young man has been approached by another firm. Bancroft, an overbearing personality, forms his own conclusions and "Vic" Arnold resents his friend's insulting Beth. Bancroft eventually antagonizes the Calhoun family, and in the end the man from South Bend wilts under a tirade from Wally. Bancroft has spoken of brigands and bandits, but he subsequently discovers that the invention was worth while, that Wally really did have an offer from a rival broker and that Beth really loves Arnold. A Talking Comedy.THE HOME TOWNERS, with Richard Bennett, Doris Kenyon, Robert McWade, Robert Edeson, Gladys Brockwell, John Miljan, Vera Lewis, Stanley Taylor, James T. Mack, Patricia Caron, an all-talking film based on George M. Cohan's play of the same name, directed by Bryan Foy; Vitaphone features of the Jesse Stafford Orchestra; Willie and Eugene Howard and John Charles Thomas. At Warners' Theatre.

1403-> 'BEWARE OF MARRIED MEN.'; Film at Hippodrome Has the Usual Villain and Stock Scenes.
Archibald Remyew, the chronic plot-guesser, took one brief look at the first hundred feet of this picture, then grabbed his hat from the seat and started out."No you don't," he remarked. "The title warned me; nevertheless, I had hopes. But when the villain comes on and I see that his hair is parted in the middle, I know it's no use. I'm going to the zoo for the rest of the afternoon."Had he stayed, Archibald would have seen great hordes of the scenes and situations he had met with before. Not only did the villain part his hair in the middle, but he had a meager mustache, an apartment and a country house. To his apartment came ladies who should have known better and others who just wanted to save their sisters from his fell clutches. And he even had an expensive cocktail shaker and a Japanese servant all ready for their visitations.The plot revolves around the secretary of a noted divorce lawyer, her sister and his newest client. The client owns the mustache and the apartment. The sister visits him. Then the secretary (who is going to marry the lawyer, by the way) pays a call to beg him to give up the sister. Then the sister marries, and the situations go all over again with reverse English; for she (the newlywed) visits him (with the mustache), begging that he (ibid.) give her (the secretary) up for ever and ever. There is a happy ending.The picture has sufficient comedy intertwined with its alleged tragedy to make Miss Rich's attempts at grandeur seem somewhat pathetic, and her sister's (Audrey Ferris's) altruistic plans near the end quite impossible. There is one amusing scene in the play, however, which even such a hardened old sinner as Mr. Archibald Remyew would have enjoyed. Film at Hippodrome Has the Usual Villain and Stock Scenes.BEWARE OF MARRIED MEN, with Irene Rich, Myrna Loy, Audrey Ferris, Clyde Cook, Richard Tucker, Stuart Holmes and Hugh Allan, based on the story by Franz Jacques, directed by Archie L.

1421-> 'BURNING DAYLIGHT' GLOOMY; Film Based on Jack London Story Shown at the Mark Strand.
Jack London's story trudged gloomily across the screen at the Strand yesterday, punctuated only by the soft foot-falls of persons quietly leaving before the appointed time. Maybe they had seen the last ??? showing, more than likely they just observed that the affair was too long for the dramatic interest involved.The plot concerns a man named Burning Daylight, who makes a million or so in the Klondike, then goes to San Francisco to enter "big business." The latter proves too crooked for a man from the Klondyke, however, and he loses his fortune on the Stock Exchange. Undaunted, and with the spirit of old, he goes to the office of his business associates and at the point of a gun demands his money back. He gets it, which apparently makes a happy ending; if that is not enough, he also gets the girl.London's stories are notable for both their laughter and tears, but the picture built around Buring Daylight has attempted to get along without either. There are moments of implied comedy, to be sure, but they are not very funny and are soon swallowed up in the general monotony of the whole. And there are breaks from one theme to another without due regard for the small matter of transition.Mr. Sills is not overly impressive in the part of Burning Daylight. He seems like a good poker player, but as either a lover or a dog-team driver something is radically amiss. Doris Kenyon in the rôle of Virginia, trots amiably, but of necessity haltingly along, first a cabaret dancer, then a secretary, finally a fiancée. Jane Winton as Martha Fairbee does her best with an astonishingly peculiar part. Film Based on Jack London Story Shown at the Mark Strand.BURNING DAYLIGHT, with Milton Sills, Doris Kenyon, Arthur Stone, Guinn Williams, Jack McDonald, Jane Winton, Lawford Davidson, Frank Hagney, Harry Northrup, Stuart Holmes, Edmund Breese and Howard Truesdale; from the story by Jack London; news reel, stage features. &c.
