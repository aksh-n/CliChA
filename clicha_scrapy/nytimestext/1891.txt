THE WINE-DRINKING BABY. CAPRI. -- When wandering one evening toward the Villa di Tiberio, I stumbled on a curious scene. A mother sat on a wall by the roadside with her infant in her arms, while the father, a strapping young farmer, poured wine from a black bottle down the eager throat of the baby. 
--------
1-> OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI.
CINCINNATI, Oct. 15. -- The Ohio and Mississippi Railway stockholders' meeting, adjourned from last week, was held at the general offices to-day. The principal business to be transacted was the election of three Directors in place of three whose terms expired, but much interest was manifested owing to the negotiations which are said to have been completed, subject to ratification, for making the Ohio and Mississippi a part of the Baltimore and Ohio system. 
--------
2-> RUSSIA TAKES A HAND.
If a Victoria telegram to the Herald may be trusted, Russia has at last committed herself in the dispute over Bering Sea. Heretofore Russia, while formally asserting her exclusive jurisdiction, has diplomatically closed her eyes to all intruders, leaving to her co-tenant, the United States, the burden of defending their common interest and title. 
--------
3-> RIFLEMEN AT OTTAWA.; A DAY FAVORABLE TO MARKSMEN AND GOOD SCORES MADE.
OTTAWA, Ontario, Sept. 1. -- On the second day of the rifle practice the meteorological conditions were favorable for high scoring. The light was a subdued one, steady and dull, so dear to the hearts of prize shots, and as a result some high scores were registered. What little wind there was did not interfere with good shooting. It was steady from the left front and of moderate speed.

4-> MEDIAEVAL STORIES.; THE EXEMPLA OR ILLUSTRATIVE STORIES FROM THE SERMONES VULGARES OF JACQUES DE VITRY. Edited, with Introduction and Notes, by THOMAS FREDERICK CRANE, Professor in Cornell University. London: Published for the Folk Lore society by DAVID NUTT, 1890.
Parables, fables, and short well-known tales probably never took so prominent a place in Europe as they did in the Middle Ages. Christianity was narrow, suspicious of the heathenism that was latent in all lands and jealous of the prestige won by Mohammedanism, not to speak of Judaism and its ancient claims to superiority in learning. 
--------
5-> ITALY AND THE DREIBUND.; THE PREMIER TELLS WHAT HIS WOULD DO IN A EUROPEAN WAR.
ROME, April 13. -- Premier di Rudini, in an interview to-day in regard to the Dreibund, held that the renewal of the triple alliance was of secondary importance as compared with a constant agreement with England. On many occasions, said the Premier, the policy of the Dreibund harmonized perfectly with British ideas, yet Lord Salisbury, for special reasons, had never adhered to the Dreibund treaty.

HARTFORD, Conn., April 14. -- A great deal of interest is felt here in the quo-warranto proceedings which were instituted at New-Haven this afternoon in the interest of Judge Morris. Gov. Bulkeley remained at the Capitol with his executive secretary through most of the afternoon in order that the papers in the case might be served without trouble should the New-Haven Sheriff arrive during business hours. 
--------
7-> GAME IN THE YELLOWSTONE.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. -- Capt. Anderson of the Sixth Cavalry, the Acting Superintendent of the Yellowstone National Park, has submitted to the Secretary of the Interior his report for the last fiscal year. 
--------
8-> A MUSEUM AT NORWICH CASTLE.
The following letter from Lord Walsingham appeared in a recent edition of the London Times: "The work of converting the old Norman keep of Norwich Castle and the prison buildings around it to the purposes of a museum is now in progress. A meeting has lately been held at which additional subscriptions from his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and others were announced. 
--------
9-> STRIKERS CAUSE A RIOT.
LONDON, April 13. -- Ten thousand of the striking miners assembled to-day to protest against the action of the authorities in prohibiting a meeting which had been planned. The police attempted to disperse them, and met with so stubborn a resistance that the military were summoned. Even then the strikers were dispersed with difficulty, many of all concerned in the riot being injured. About a score of the rioters' leaders were arrested. 
--------
10-> TO CONTEST CALL'S SEAT.; GOV. FLEMING DENOUNCED FOR APPOINTING DAVIDSON.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Sept. 16. -- The appointment of ex-Congressman R.H.M. Davidson of the First Florida District to succeed Senator Call in the alleged vacancy in the United States Senate is the result of long deliberation and a long internal fight in the ranks of the anti-Call Democrats. 
--------
11-> TO HELP FOREIGN EXHIBITORS.; SECRETARY FOSTER TO SECURE MODIFICATIONS OF CUSTOMS LAWS.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 16. -- The conference between the World's Fair Foreign Commissioners and the principal officers of the Treasury Department respecting the modification of certain features of the customs regulations so as to facilitate the free entry of foreign exhibits at the fair was held at the Treasury Department this morning. 
--------
12-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
Gold shipments have again given Wall Street a chill. Something over $3,000,000 went out the past week, and one might suppose that a direful calamity had happened to the country. If money goes west in response to the demands of trade, or if it goes east, the only question of speculative interest at this centre is how far the movement has or will affect interest rates. 
--------
13-> FREEDOM OF WORSHIP AND CRIME.
The form in which the so-called Freedom of Worship bill appears in the Legislature this year shows that its supporters feel the necessity of disguising its character and purpose. The demand for this kind of legislation has come invariably and solely from the priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church. 
--------
14-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Postmaster Van Cott has been informed by telegraph from San Francisco that the steamship Oceanic arrived at that port Wednesday with mails from China, Japan, , of the following dates: Shanghai, Dec. 19; Hongkong, Dec. 19; Yokohama, Dec. 27; Honolulu. Jan. 7; due to arrive in New-York the morning of Monday, Jan. 19. 
--------
15-> THEOSOPHY IS A HUMBUG.; THE OPINION OF A CONVERTED HIGH-CASTE BRAHMIN.
ST. LOUIS, May 16. -- The Rev. Narayan Sheshadri, D.D., and son, of Bombay, India, are now in St. Louis. The doctor is a native of India. In the course of a long interview with THE TIMES'S correspondent he said: 
--------
16-> NEWS ABOUT RAILROADS; THE PENNSYLVANIA ELEVATED STATION IN USE. TRAINS BEGAN RUNNING OVER THE NEW STRUCTURE IN JERSEY CITY EARLY THIS MORNING -- ALL LOCAL TRAINS WILL USE THE ELEVATED TRACKS.
The mammoth new passenger station of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Jersey City was illuminated last night, and soon after midnight the first train was sent out over the elevated structure that crosses Jersey City. It was the "owl train" for Philadelphia, and the "owl train" from Philadelphia came into the new station early this morning. 
--------
17-> HER POINT OF VIEW.
Here is a story from Western Pennsylvania which matches any told by Miss Wilkins and other delineators of New-England thrift and unconscious humor. A young woman whose maiden home was in one of the small cities of interior New-York followed the fortunes of her husband, a Calvinistic minister, to his first charge, a "Centre" Church near the Ohio line of the Keystone State. 
--------
18-> CLUB NEWS AND GOSSIP.
New-York City has long been recognized as pro-eminently the club city of America, but possibly that indefinable, intangible personage, "the average clubman," has never realized that it is just as pre-eminently the yacht club city of the Western Continent. There are more yacht clubs with quarters in New-York -- that is to say, in "the greater New-York" -- than in any other American city. 
--------
19-> A CHANCE FOR A CHOICE.; DETAINED IMMIGRANTS MUST BE MAINTAINED ON SHIP OR ON SHORE.
When the new immigration law went into operation a month ago a number of steamship companies protested against being held responsible for the custody of immigrants debarred from landing. The stand taken by Col. Weber, the Superintendent of Immigration, soon convinced them that they would avoid much fruitless trouble and expense by yielding compliance with the requirements of the law. 
--------
20-> LIEUT. RUSSELL'S PARTY SAFE.
SEATTLE, Washington, Oct. 15. -- Apprehension felt for the safety of Lieut. Russell and party, sent out by the Smithsonian Institution to survey Mount St. Elias, has been allayed by the receipt of a letter from Lieut. Russell dated Sept. 23. The party was then at Yokatel. The revenue cutter Corwin touched at that point on Sept. 1, and the party not being there then, fears were entertained for its safety. 
--------
21-> CHEERS AT THE WIGWAM; TAMMANY RATIFIES THE CANDIDATES IN LIVELY FASHION. SENATOR KENNA OF WEST VIRGINIA TALKS ABOUT THE TARIFF -- SPEECHES BY FELLOWS, COCKRAN, AND OTHER LIGHTS.
Tammany Hall last evening gave its customary ostentatious ratification to the Democratic candidates for the coming election. Fireworks, sounding brass, cheering and yelling, and speehces galore were the tiger's indorsements of the Democratic platforms. The meeting was held at the Fourteenth Street Wigwam. 
--------
22-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
Count VON MUNSTER'S denial "that the late Emperor WILLIAM had ever intended to dismiss Prince BISMARCK" was probably not made in the form in which it has been cabled. The Count could not have known the Emperor's intentions in this respect. What he probably denied was that he himself had said that the Emperor had expressed such an intention. 
--------
23-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The Rapid-Transit Commissioners seem to be rather chary of submitting their plan for an underground road for public discussion before the Board of Aldermen is asked to act upon it. It is admitted that they have reached a conclusion and that their final plan is ready, but they decline to say what it is before reporting it to the Aldermen for their "consent." 
--------
24-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; GRANGIER AGAINST KERENS. A NEW-YORK DRESSMAKER SUES A ST. LOUIS WOMAN OF FASHION.
Legal war, to be fought to the bitter end, has been declared between Mme. Anna Grangier, one of the fashionable modistes of this city, with a branch business in Paris, and Mrs. Richard C. Kerens of St. Louis, wife of one of the most prominent citizens of that city, who is Secretary of the St. Louis World's Fair Committee and President of the St. Louis, Arkansas and Texas Railroad. 
--------
25-> ON LONG BRANCH'S SHORE; MANY NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS MADE AT HOLLYWOOD. MR. HOEY'S SUBSTITUTE FOR SURF BATHING -- A POOL OF SALT WATER WITH NO DANGEROUS UNDERTOW -- INROADS AT THE BLUFF.
LONG BRANCH, July 2. -- The season at this place has opened, and certain doubts which lately clouded the air have been dissipated as the sea mist is under the morning sun in August. Not long ago the population (the permanent clam-digging population) of this interesting seaside resort was sad and solemn. The women had veils on their hearts and the men were wearing bands of crape around their souls.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H., March 15. -- The news of the wreck of the Galena was received with sorrow by several hundred workmen employed in the navy yard here, as the vessel was on her way there, where nearly $100,000 was to have been spent in repairs to be made upon her. 
--------
27-> FINDS AT ROME.; INTERESTING DISCOVERIES OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS.
The works in progress outside the tract of the city walls between Porta Salaria and Porta Pinciana continually bring to light some interesting object which recalls their attention to the study of ancient Rome. Quite recently a fine half-sized statue of Hygia (unfortunately headless) was disinterred. 
--------
28-> THE CHICAGO CONSPIRACY; A CONFIRMATION OF THE ALLEGED DYNAMITE PLOT. SECRETARY GIBSON DENIES ANY COMPLICITY IN THE AFFAIR -- COMMISSIONER MASON SAYS THE STORY IS SUBSTANTIALLY TRUE.
CHICAGO, Feb. 12. -- Charles J. Gibson, the Secretary of the Whisky Trust, who was arrested here yesterday, left for Cleveland last night. In an interview before leaving he said regarding the charges against him: 
--------
29-> THE BIG CRUISER NEW-YORK.; OUR LATEST WAR SHIP ALMOST READY FOR LAUNCHING.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 16. -- There will be a big time here at the Cramps' in the course of a month or six weeks, when the New-York leaves the ways and is launched into the Delaware. Preparations are already being rapidly made for this event, and the launching cradle, so narrow and slight to the unprofessional eye, even now lies under the huge hull. 
--------
30-> A GREAT CITY'S DISGRACE; POOL SELLERS DISOBEYING THE LAW WITH IMPUNITY. A POLICE COMMISSIONER WHO COMPLAINS THAT WITHOUT FURTHER LEGISLATION THE DEPARTMENT CANNOT COPE WITH THE EVIL.
The publication in yesterday's TIMES of a description of the flourishing condition in which the business of pool selling is in this city at present evidently caused much commotion in the ranks not only of the lawbreakers themselves, but among those who, although in authority, allow the lawbreaking to go on under their very noses. 
--------
31-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
The men at Saratoga to whom the credit of the sound action of the convention on finance is essentially due are Messrs. CROKER and STRAUS of this city. JENKS and BOODY of Brooklyn, and TRACEY of Albany. Mr. TRACEY brought the inspiration and prestige of the gallant fight against cheap money in the last Congress.

32-> THE BOARD INCOMPETENT; MAJORITY REPORT OF THE FORESTRY COMMITTEE. IT RECOMMENDS THAT THE TERMS OF THE COMMISSIONERS BE DECLARED ENDED AND GOV. HILL BE EMPOWERED TO APPOINT A NEW BOARD.
ALBANY, April 14. -- The following is the majority report of the Assembly Forestry Committee on its investigation of the State Forest Commission: 
--------
33-> INDICTED FOR BRIBERY.; FIVE CITIZENS OF COLORADO ACCUSED OF A SERIOUS CRIME.
DENVER, Col., April 14. -- Five of the most prominent citizens of Colorado have been indicted for bribery by the Grand Jury of Arapahoe County. They are Otto Mears, President of the Rio Grande and Southern Railway; Jerry Frank, the Hon. Fred Walsen, ex-Senator A.M. Stevenson, and the Hon. Edwin Mitchell.

34-> SETTING FOLLY AGAINST FOLLY.; LEON SAY'S VIEWS ON UNLIMITED COINAGE OF SILVER.
The following article upon the new political party in the United States, from the pen of M. Leon Say, will be published in the Journal des Debats to-morrow morning. M. Say is rarely a contributor to the newspapers under his own signature, and his views upon the latest political move in America must interest all nations where the same elements exist: 
--------
35-> HILL WILL DO HIS BEST.; HE WILL TRY TO HAVE DEMAREST IN HAND NEXT WEDNESDAY.
ALBANY, N.Y., Jan. 16. -- The announcement in the dispatches to-day that Assemblyman Frank P. Demarest of Rockland County is a self-confessed forger and embezzler has caused a good deal of consternation in Democratic circles. The Democratic margin of safety on joint ballot is slight enough at best, but if Mr. Demarest fails to appear when the election of United States Senator takes place next Wednesday it will be exceedingly fragile. 
--------
36-> HENRY S. IVES'S MOVEMENTS.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Jan. 16. -- It became known late to-night that on Wednesday evening Henry S. Ives visited here and had a secret interview with William Mckeen, President of the Vandalia line. He returned to New-York late the same night. 
--------
37-> CONNECTICUT CHURCH NEWS.; NEW ASSIGNMENTS FOR PASTORS, NEW CALLS, AND RETIREMENTS.
HARTFORD, Conn., May 16. -- The Rev. E.C. Hoag of Brooklyn, N.Y., has been assigned to the Methodist church pastorate in Simsbury, succeeding the late Rev. Arza Hill. The Rev. F.M. North of the Methodist church in Middletown has been granted a three months leave of absence by his congregation, and will spend the Summer in Europe. 
--------
38-> A POORHOUSE HOSPITAL; AN ABOMINABLE PLACE IN THE CHARLESTON JAIL YARD. REMOVAL TO CAMP DAVIDSON AT SAVANNAH -- A MAN WHO DREAMED OF ESCAPE -- CUTTING THROUGH THE FLOOR OF A FREIGHT CAR.
I thought Hospital Number Ten at Richmond the most wretched and hope-destroying place I had ever been in, and it certainly was up to that time, but it was as a palace to a morgue compared with the poorhouse in Charleston, S.C. The hospital ward must have been the filthiest, most stifling, and malodorous apartment in the building, for it would tax the imagination of Dante himself to conceive of anything worse. 
--------
39-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
The pestilence now ravaging a great part of Asiatic Russia bears that name of "Black Death," so familiar for centuries as describing one of the most fearful of those plagues which, appearing at irregular intervals, have devastated the globe. Presumably it was this same form of scourge that, starting also from Asia, spread over that continent and Europe about the middle of the fourteenth century, and is reputed to have had millions of victims. 
--------
40-> GOULD CARRIES HIS POINT; NO DIVIDEND ON MISSOURI PACIFIC THIS QUARTER. A FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTED TO THE DIRECTORS SHOWING A DEFICIENCY FOR NINE MONTHS OF $1,619,273.
The Directors of the Missouri Pacific Railroad accepted Mr. Jay Gould's financial statement yesterday and voted to pass the usual 1 per cent dividend for this quarter. The price of the stock promptly dropped from 63 34 to 59 34, and the fact that more than 56,000 shares changed hands during the day showed that there were eager buyers as well as sellers. 
--------
41-> THE UNSCRUPULOUS EGAN.; CHILEANS SUSPECT HIM OF HELPING IN A SPOLIATION SCHEME.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. -- For reasons of policy, which the public may or may not assume are wise, the State Department is preserving the strictest secrecy about such correspondence as it is having with Minister Egan, and with the result of a season of calm and confidence at the State Department in the restoration at Santiago of better relations between the government of Chile and our incompetent and irritating representative there. 
--------
42-> SLAVES IN NEW-YORK.; MR. E.V. MORGAN'S PAPER BEFORE THE HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31. -- Under the head of Economic History, the following papers were read before the American Historical Association this morning: "Historical Development of the Budget in the United States," by Ephraim D.

Willoughby, United States Department of Labor; "Slavery in the District of Columbia," by Mary Tremain.

43-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; DEPARTMENTS' REPORTS. THE IMMENSE VOLUME OF MONEY HANDLED IN ONE YEAR.
Several of the city departments made informal reports yesterday as to the amount of business done during the year 1890. The Public Works and Street-Cleaning Departments were not ready with their figures. 
--------
44-> TRUSTEES ARE WAKING UP; THEY ARE LEARNING NEW FACTS ABOUT THE NEW-YORK LIFE. POLICY HOLDERS CLAMORING FOR THE BANTA CHARGES -- WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SPANISHAMERICAN DEPARTMENT -- A CIRCULAR.
The statement published in THE TIMES last Thursday, calling attention to the fact that the Trustees of the New-York Life Insurance Company are just beginning to realize the position in which they are placed by the recent exposures of their company's methods, appears to have quite coincided with the views of nearly everybody who is in a position to know the sentiments of those gentlemen. 
--------
45-> HILL'S TOOLS OUTWITTED.; THE REGENTS ABOLISHED AN OFFICE WHICH WAS IN CONTROVERSY.
ALBANY, July 2. -- The examination for Inspector of Academies, under the Board of Regents, advertised to be held in the civil service rooms here to-day, did not take place. Five persons presented themselves for examination. They were informed that there was some uncertainty whether the position of Inspector of Academies under the Regents still existed and were advised to make inquiry at the Regents' office.

46-> READ CONTRADICTS LACEY.
PHILADELPHIA, June 14. -- United States District Attorney John R. Read said to-night, in regard to the statement of Controller Lacey, that he (Lacey) supposed him to be in full possession of knowledge of the criminal acts of Marsh: 
--------
47-> QUAY'S COMING STRUGGLE; HARRISON'S ASPIRATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED BY IT. THE POSITION OF MAGEE AND HIS RIVAL ON THE PRESIDENTIAL QUESTION -- QUAY HAMPERED BY HIS REPUTATION AND HIS AMBITIONS.
PITTSBURG, Penn., June 14. -- Pennsylvania's attitude upon the Republican Presidential nomination next year is the subject of a great deal of discussion. A careful reading of the newspapers of the State discloses the fact that popular sentiment has not taken shape in favor of any one candidate. It goes without saying that Secretary Blaine is Pennsylvania's "favorite son" over all comers any time he is avowedly an aspirant for the high office. 
--------
48-> A STORY FROM ST. PETERSBURG ABOUT THE MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR.
A curious story has just leaked out concerning what seems suspiciously like an attempt to bribe the Russian Minister of the Interior. The well-known Jewish banker Baron Ginzburg waited the other day upon the Minister in question, (writes the St. Petersburg correspondent of an English provincial press syndicate,) and, so runs the story, said to him, speaking in the name of the Jewish community: 
--------
49-> ABBETT MACHINE METHODS; THE SCHEME TO ROB SHORE OWNERS OF THEIR RIGHTS. HOW THE GOVERNOR FORCED THE PASSAGE OF A BILL THAT STRONGLY RESEMBLES A JOB BY WHICH SOMEBODY MAY MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
TRENTON, Aug. 16. -- Seven or eight years ago a party of audacious speculators conceived the idea of seizing the reef of rock extending from Ellis Island south for several thousand feet to the lighthouse off Staten Island for commercial purposes. The rock was to serve as the foundation for a neck of artificial land that was to stretch along the Jersey front of New-York Bay. 
--------
50-> AFFAIRS OF RAILROADS; ONE OF THE VANDERBILT ROADS KEEPS OUT OF THE BOYCOTT. THE NICKEL PLATE PROPOSES TO STAND BY THE CHICAGO AND ALTON IN THIS FIGHT, AS ALSO DO SOME OTHER ROADS.
A peculiar phase of the boycott declared against the Chicago and Alton Road by the Board of Rulings of the joint committee came to light yesterday. The New-York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (Nickel Plate) sent the friendly assurance to the boycotted road that it would not join in the boycott. 
--------
51-> CLEVELAND'S SILVER VIEWS; COMMENTS OF CONGRESSMEN ON HIS LETTER. THE COURAGE WHICH INSPIRED IT EVERYWHERE APPLAUDED -- ITS EXPECTED EFFECT ON THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12. -- Cleveland and his alver letter to the Cooper Union meeting was the subject of conversation in Washington today. The talk about the Watterson letter, which had been a most exciting and diverting topic, ceased to concern anybody, the superior importance of the latter totally eclipsing both Hill and Watterson. 
--------
52-> THE POPE'S CHAMBERLAIN.; A TALK WITH HIM IN ST. LOUIS, WHERE HE HAS JUST ARRIVED.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 15. -- Mgr. O'Breyn, Chamberlain of the Pope, has arrived here for the purpose of participating in the celebration of the golden jubilee of Archbishop Kendricks. He says that the Pope is in splendid health. After some preliminary skirmishing, he was to-day induced to speak of the recent Papal encyclical on the "Condition of Labor." 
--------
53-> FENCING BROOKLYN STREETS.; AN OUTRAGE UPON THE PEOPLE WHICH IS BECOMING TOO PREVALENT.
Ten or fifteen individuals and corporations have practically taken possession of over a score of streets in Brooklyn and have coolly erected fences and gates at the foot of such thoroughfares, thereby preventing the ordinary citizen from reaching the water front.

54-> SARATOGA'S NEW CAMP.; THE COLONY OF COTTAGERS TO BE ESTABLISHED ON THE LAKE.
SARATOGA, N.Y., Nov. 2. -- The cornerstone, figuratively speaking, of an enterprise that promises to become an enjoyable feature of Saratoga life was laid last week, in the purchase by a dozen well-known residents of the village and Summer visitors of Saratoga Lake property. These gentlemen have bought about fifty acres of land on the west shore of Saratoga Lake, nearly opposite the White Sulphur Springs Hotel and the famous "Snake Hill." 
--------
55-> METHODIST ASSIGNMENTS.; WORK OF THE NEWARK CONFERENCE BROUGHT TO A CLOSE.
WASHINGTON, N.J., April 15. -- The Newark Methodist Conference closed its week's meeting here to-day. This resolution, adopted this morning, was a notable feature of the day's deliberations: 
--------
56-> MR. ROOSEVELT'S OBJECT LESSON.
In the latter part of March and for some time in April Mr. ROOSEVELT, Civil Service Commissioner, was engaged, by the direction of the commission, in investigating charges of violation of the law and of the civil service rules in the Baltimore Post Office. His report to the commission is just made. 
--------
57-> THE NEW-ORLEANS AFFAIR.
The records of Judge Lynch's court probably afford no parallel to this bloody business in the city of New-Orleans. The lynching of a pair of murderers or horse thieves in the West or Southwest is not an event of such uncommon occurrence as to attract much attention. But the New-Orleans mob shot to death eleven victims. Two or three others upon whom it sought to carry out its notions of justice could not be found.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. -- Secretary Tracy has written a reply to Commander Reiter's letter, complaining of his recent reprimand and asking for trial by court martial for his conduct in the Barrundia affair. Not only is a trial denied, but a second public reprimand is added to the first. 
--------
60-> THE ADIRONDACK RAILROAD; WORK ON THE PROJECT ALREADY UNDER WAY. DR. SEWARD WEBB'S SCHEME FOR BUILDING A ROAD THROUGH THE WILDERNESS -- HOW THE PLANS WERE ORIGINATED AND PERFECTED.
MALONE, May 17. -- The unanimity and vigor with which all of the great journals of the metropolis have suddenly awakened to the fact that a railroad is to be built through the Adirondacks, is a little amusing here, where the enterprise has been the one absorbing topic of conversation and newspaper comment for more than a month. 
--------
61-> THEATRICAL GOSSIP.
The Casino has begun its Summer season with every promise of success. No prettier spectacle than the production of "Apollo," has graced the stage of this house in some time, and Lillian Russell's success as the priestess of the temple is pronounced. Verses in Italian, French, and German have been added to the duet for Edwin Stevens and Jefferson De Angelis, and the third act has been made the comedy act of the opera.

UTICA, N.Y., Sept. 30. -- Special American Express train No. 31, due here at 3:10 A.M. to-day, was robbed between here and Little Falls. The robber brought the train to a standstill a mile east of this city by applying the air brakes by means of the valve in the car, and then escaped in the darkness.

65-> WANTED --- A MAKER OF RAIN; THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY STILL FURTHER REDUCED. TEN DAYS MORE NEEDED TO EMPTY THE RESERVOIRS -- CITY OFFICIALS STILL PUTTING THEIR FAITH IN PROVIDENCE, AND HOPING.
THE TIMES last Friday pointed out that there was a shortage in the supply of the city's water. It was stated then that but fifteen days' supply remained on hand.

66-> NIEDRINGHAUS WAS READY; HIS VOTE ON THE TIN-PLATE DUTY NOW EXPLAINED. HE IMPORTED MANY CARLOADS OF GOOD WELSH TIN -- NOW HE SELLS AT THE INCREASED PRICE -- HIS LITTLE SECRET DISCOVERED, HOWEVER.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., July 3. -- In the course of a lengthy interview printed in the Globe-Democrat this morning, ex-Congressman Niedringhaus said he had positive knowledge that twenty-two firms in the United States are making preparation for the manufacture of tin plate, but that his establishment is the best equipped of any and was already at work. 
--------
67-> BOSTON TAKES THE LEAD
BOSTON, Sept. 30. -- The Bostons wound up the season at home by taking two more games and stepping into first place. In the first game they batted hard and fielded well, winning easily. Coughlin was hit in the spine by a batted ball in the fifth inning and gave way to Welch. 
--------
68-> A MAD DOG'S VICTIM.; DR. GIBLER DENIES THAT COLLENS WAS REFUSED TREATMENT.
PLAINFIELD, N.J., July 3. -- A mad dog ran through Washington Valley three weeks ago and bit so many other dogs, cows, and horses that wholesale slaughter had to be committed by the farmers to prevent an epidemic of hydrophobia. Four dogs owned by Andrew Collens of Glenside Park, on the road leading to Westfield, were among those bitten. 
--------
69-> BUNGLED BY MR. FOSTER; HE MADE A PRETTY MESS OF THE PLATE PRINTERS' AFFAIR. THE SECRETARY WROTE A LETTER OFFERING TO REINSTATE JORDAN, AND ACCUSED THE KNIGHTS OF LABOR OF STEALING IT.
WASHINGTON, July 3. -- Secretary Foster has gone to the mountain home of "Steve" Elkins to spend the Fourth of July, and perhaps to clarify his political vision in the atmosphere of West Virginia. He leaves behind a pretty mess as the result of his efforts to "square" the controversy in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing so as to help McKinley in his campaign for the Governorship of Ohio. 
--------
70-> SURE OF A GREAT MEETING; BATTERY PARK WILL BE PACKED NEXT FRIDAY NIGHT. AN ARREST FOR ILLEGAL TRACK LAYING IN EIGHTH AVENUE -- WOULD SERVES THE PEOPLE'S CAUSE BY GETTING INTERVIEWED AGAIN.
Next Friday night's meeting in Battery Park will be a great event. There is no special organization yet, but everybody is waiting for it eagerly, and, without a set programme or any out-and-dried action laid out, it may be fairly expected that the people will be heard from. The crowd and the enthusiasm are surely to be counted upon, and the rest may be left to inspiration. 
--------
71-> ON TRIAL.
To-day there will be a formal meeting of the Senate to take a recess to Monday, that being the longest period for which either house can adjourn without the consent of the other. When the Senators come together again on Monday or Tuesday it is probable that some definite issue will be sought from the vexed and complicated situation in which the majority have involved themselves. 
--------
72-> HILL'S USUAL INGRATITUDE.; THE STATE PRINTING TAKEN FROM THE "TIMES" AND GIVEN TO THE "ARGUS."
ALBANY, Dec. 31. -- The Albany Argues was designated the State paper to-day by the unanimous vote of the board, composed of Secretary of State Rice, Controller Wemple, and State Treasurer Danforth. The selection would have been made several weeks ago, but there has been a decided difference of opinion concerning the paper on which the rich pium should be bestowed. 
--------
73-> FOREIGN MONEY INVESTED HERE.; C.A. PILLSBURY'S STORY TO A COMMITTEE OF THE SALE OF HIS MILLS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 31. -- Senators Chandler, Hale, and Power, and Representative Owen were the only members of the joint Congressional Committee on Immigration present this morning when the investigation into the purchase of American industries by foreign capital was begun, with C.A. Pillsbury, the Minnesota miller, in the witness chair.

74-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; C.H. VENNER & CO. SUSPEND. THE FIRM DID A LARGE BUSINESS IN INVESTMENT SECURITIES.

75-> UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER.
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 17. -- The sophomores have distinguished themselves during the past week in making life especially miserable for the new member of the Faculty, Prof. Baker of the department of mathematics. Prof. Baker succeeds Prof. George D. Olds, who was always an especial favorite with the students. This may explain, to a certain degree perhaps, the hard row that Prof. Baker has had to hoe ever since his work began here.

76-> BROOKLYN'S WRETCHED STREETS.
The street-cleaning farce goes merrily on. The contractors and City Works Commissioner John P. Adams may be enjoying it, but the people of Brooklyn are miserable spectators. Mayor Chapin remains apparently indifferent, although every morning upon arriving at his office he is compelled to wipe from his eyes the particles of tilth taken in during his walk down from the park slope.

79-> HAL POINTER BEATEN.; HE BREAKS DOWN IN THE PACING RACE AT PHILADELPHIA.
PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 2. -- After carrying everything before him through six weeks of the Grand Circuit, Hal Pointer came to grief here to-day. His defeat was due to illness which overcame him as the race progressed, and he was not able to start in the last heat. The Judges rendered a most extraordinary decision in declaring bets off, as there was not a suspicion of anything crooked, and the favorite was beaten on his merits.

A committee of Republican politicians was appointed yesterday for the purpose of going to Washington to induce the National Committee of their party to select this city as the place for holding the next Republican National Convention.

PROVIDENCE, Aug. 4. -- In the Senate to-day the bill for the revision of the judiciary system was carried over to the January session by a vote of 13 to 12, the deciding vote, that of Democratic Leader Champlin of New-Shoreham, coming just in time, as the Senator arrived at the Chamber late.

The mystery enveloping the murder of the young woman whose body was found on Sunday morning at Glendale, just outside the Brooklyn city line, is as profound to-day as it was at the outset. The fact is now evident that Sunday was allowed to pass without any attempt to trace the murderer, although an experienced detective might then have found important clues on the ground where the body lay.

TORONTO, Ontario, Aug. 4. -- The annual report of the President of the Dominion Millers' Association, which is in session here, estimates the wheat crop of the Dominion at 55,160,000 bushels, a reckoning which allows 22,180,000 bushels for export.

OTTAWA, Ontario, July 18. -- Official advices from England confirm a recent intimation by cable that the Imperial Government will indemnity the Canadian sealing schooners for losses sustained by the adoption of a close season in Bering Sea. This decision on the part of the home authority is regarded as a good one, as it will tend to allay the popular outburst of British Columbia occasioned by the unexpectedness of the recent international agreement.

KINGSTON, N.Y., Aug. 17. -- As the time for holding the Democratic Convention for Ulster County comes nearer, what is called the "anti-Parker boom" begins to develop itself. Judge Alton B.

CHICAGO, Sept. 2. -- Anson won to-day, and he performed the act in the most approved style. In the opening inning the Colts touched up the curves of big Amos Rusie in a manner calculated to make him believe that his arm had lost its cunning.

The quarterly report of the Commissioner of Street Cleaning shows that he has begun with a rate of expenditure which will make it impossible to get through the year upon his allowance.

ALBANY, July 18. -- Controller Wemple continues to show his contempt for the civil service law and to violate its provisions.

95-> THE END OF THE INDIAN WAR.
The President and the Secretary of the Interior are the two men who ought to feel most relieved and most grateful that Gen. MILES has succeeded in averting the general Indian war that has been so long and so seriously threatened. For these two are the men immediately responsible for the threat, and upon them would have rested the frightful responsibility for the great battle that a week ago everybody expected to be fought.

" BOSTON, May 17. -- There is a possibility that the religious foundation of the historical old West Church may be transplanted and given an opportunity to grow up again.

CHIGAGO, July 3. -- Cleveland's players made three home runs against Chicago to-day, but failed to win. The hits were made when the bases were empty, and in consequence availed but little. On the other hand, Piefier's double and triple were made just when they were needed. Score:

The resignation of Ex Norton as President of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad was a surprise to railroad men, and it caused considerable comment in Wall Street yesterday.

111-> THE ATHLETIC REORGANIZATION.; WHAT EFFECT IT IS LIKELY TO HAVE ON AMATEUR ATHLETICS.
It would be unfair to pass judgment upon the reorganization of the Amateur Athletic Union before one has had an opportunity to see the practical workings of the organization in its new form.

The race for foals of 1887 was better contested, the favorite, Greenlander Boy, failing to get a heat.

114-> LYNCH LAW AND THE MAFIA.
It is not very likely that the dilemma offered to the citizens of New-Orleans by the acquittal of the murderers of HENNESSY will be presented, in the same form, to the citizens of any other American community. The Italian population of New-Orleans is apparently larger, in proportion, than that of any other city in the United States.

The annual club book of the American Yacht Club made its appearance last Thursday. Between its cream-colored covers there is a world of information for yachtsmen, and in point of quality -- that is to say, arrangement -- as well as quantity the little volume has no superior in its line.

Methodical statesmen and prosy old constitutional lawyers will be startled by the attempt of the Kansas Legislature to amend the United States statutes.

118-> INDUSTRIAL EMANCIPATION.
During the past few years an entirely new aspect has been given to the question of tariff reform.

BOSTON, Nov. 16. -- The Globe says there is bitter feeling and great disappointment among a large number of Harvard men over their inability to secure tickets to the Harvard-Yale football game next Saturday at Springfield, and they lay the blame upon F.W.

The native inhabitants of Nicaragua are a very interesting people. There is a strain of negro blood intermingled with the Caribs on the Atlantic or Mosquito coast, but the Caribs are of a different race from the inhabitants of the highlands and the Pacific coast, who are either pure Aztecs or of mixed Azteo and Spanish descent.

125-> THE LINDSAY EXPEDITION IN AUSTRALIA.
Nearly one-third of the continent of Australia remains to be explored. If a line be drawn from north to south, cutting off the eastern third of the continent, it will be seen that the area thus detached contains Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria. In the inland region, controlled by these colonies, there is scarcely anything left for the explorer to do.

LONDON, Aug. 5. -- Advices have been received here which give another illustration of the bitter hostility against the Jews in Russia.

Loantaka, winner of the Suburban, and Firenzi, the peerless and the winner of some of the most famous turf battles of the decade, were both among the starters at the Jerome Park races yesterday, and the fact that they were such served in great measure to bring to the track a somewhat larger number of people than usual.

It is no wonder that the election in South Moulton, upon which we have already commented, should have had a very depressing effect upon the Tories, and especially upon the "Unionists."

141-> BOWDOIN COLLEGE.
BRUNSWICK, Me., Feb. 28. -- Bowdoin's hopes of being admitted to the three-cornered eight-oared race this year have been blasted.

And at 11:30 o'clock a fourth fire was burning fiercely on the west side.

It is difficult to see where the farmer is going to get any benefit out of the kind of reciprocity, Mr. Blaine is trying to bring about, and the farmer knows it. The agriculturist's distrust of townspeople is deep-seated and centuries old. Feasting together, the farmer has always gotten the bones and the other feasters the meat. Naturally, they are suspicious and alert to get advantage when they can.

We are bound to say that in some respects the attitude of some of the New-York bankers toward the Secretary of the Treasury with reference to the extension of the 4 1/2 per cent. bonds is not altogether what it should be. If the Secretary's own skirts were clear, if he had from the first acted in a straightforward and businesslike manner, we think he would have some reason to complain. 
--------
151-> SPAIN'S DISASTROUS FLOODS.; HURRYING THE BURIAL OF THE DEAD IN CONSUEGRA.
MADRID, Sept. 17. -- The municipal authorities of Almeria, capital of the province of that name, estimate that it will require 2,000,000 pesetas to repair the streets and buildings damaged by the recent floods.

--------
154-> THE CHINESE INSURRECTION.
Very remarkable is the news that comes from China. Within a short space of time, less than a month, the foreign missions at Nanking, Wuhu, Tang Yang, Kin Kiang, and Wusueh have been raided by mobs and burned. Ching Kiang, Hart Kow, Soochow, and even Shanghai have been threatened with attack. 
--------
155-> ROOSTER TURNED HORSE TAMER.; HOW A POOR HINDU FAKIR OVERCAME A VICIOUS STALLION.
Hindus are very skillful in taming wild animals and snakes, and an incident was related the other day by an Indian traveler of how an Indian fakir tamed in a few minutes a refractory horse that no one else could manage. 
--------
156-> FRUITS NOW IN THE MARKET; FEW STRAWBERRIES, BUT ORANGES IN ABUNDANCE. CALIFORNIA PEARS AT FAIRLY MODERATE PRICES -- MALAGA GRAPES SCARCE AND DIFFICULT TO GET -- PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.
Notwithstanding the almost total failure of the peach crop of last season, an exceedingly short apple crop, and a general disaster to the fruit crop grown within five or six hundred miles of this city, our market is far from being fruitless. The great abundance of the California fruit crop enabled canners to pack an unusual quantity last season in State. 
--------
157-> FLEECED OF HIS EARNINGS; HOW TAMMANY APPOINTS ITS PARK POLICE OFFICERS. THOMAS COLE, A POOR CAR DRIVER, IS OFFERED A PLACE "ON THE FORCE" FOR $350 -- HE PAYS THE MONEY, BUT IS FOOLED.
An interesting and instructive object lesson in the methods employed by the Tammany machine to equip the forces of the Park police is furnished by the case of Thomas Cole, whose experiences as a candidate for appointment were brought to light yesterday for the first time. Cole is a poor man, earning $2 a day as a car driver on the Fourth Avenue Railroad. 
--------
158-> FROM ONE OF THE TARIFF MAKERS.
A verbatim report of the speech made in Boston a few days ago by Senator ALDRICH, which has been published by the chief organ of McKinleyism in that city, shows some curious and interesting assertions. Mr. ALDRICH may fairly be called the McKinley of the Senate, for he was the most prominent and industrious of the Republican tariff makers in that body. We find that in his speech he said: 
--------
159-> SAYS HE IS NOT A "TOUT."; HEFFNER MAKES A STATEMENT CONTRADICTING M.F. DWYER.
" Ed" Heffner, who was recently quoted by Chief Inspector Byrnes as authority for the statement that Michael F. Dwyer, while a part owner with him in the horse Dan K. had bet on the horse to win and told his brother to bet against him, thereby cheating Philip, was at Police Headquarters yesterday with a grievance. 
--------
160-> THE ADVISORY BOARD.; IT CANNOT DO WITHOUT GOULD AND WILL MEET IN THIS CITY ABOUT MAY 6.
CHICAGO, April 15. -- The Advisory Board of the Western Traffic Association met again this morning without a quorum.

161-> FEW CANDIDATES AT ANNAPOLIS.
WASHINGTON, May 18. -- The Navy Department is much concerned over the small number of cadets who have been nominated to appear at the Naval Academy for examination.

163-> PIG BREEDING IN SICILY.; CURIOUS STATISTICS OF AN EXTENSIVE INDUSTRY.
The last British consular report from Palermo contains some curious details respecting the breeding of pigs in Sicily, which in certain districts, and especially in mountainous parts, are reared in great numbers. Nearly all the small towns are overrun with them, and they are not only useful for food, but act as scavengers to the dirty streets. 
--------
164-> WILLIAM'S ROYAL GREETING; POMP AND CEREMONY THAT ENGLAND SELDOM HAS SEEN. BRITAIN'S BIGGEST WAR VESSELS THUNDER A SALUTE -- WELCOMED BY THE PRINCES -- A JOURNEY TO WINDSOR THROUGH FLOWERS AND BUNTING.
LONDON, July 4. -- The Emperor William arrived at Port Victoria, near Sheerness, this morning. He was enthusiastically received by the crowds assembled to witness the landing of the imperial party. All the British war ships anchored about Sheerness fired salutes of twenty-one guns. 
--------
165-> CHRISTIAN AND HEATHEN.
The text of the incendiary placards posted throughout Wuhu ought to be read by every American, regardless of whether or not he contributes to the funds of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Nothing but the details of the document can enable enlightened readers to appreciate the heathen point of view. 
--------
166-> THE IRISH NATIONAL LEAGUE.; NEW OFFICERS ELECTED AND NEW RULES FOR GOVERNMENT ADOPTED.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2. -- M.V. Gannon of Omaha was to-night elected President of the Irish National League of America, succeeding John Fitzgerald. Absolute independence on the part of the organization of any of the factions in Ireland or of their auxiliary bodies was the attitude assumed by the convention, as the result of a spirited struggle. John P. Sutton was re-elected Secretary and William Lyman of New-York was chosen Treasurer. 
--------
167-> MR. CHAPIN'S CERTIFICATE.; IT MAY BE FILED LESS THAN TWENTY DAYS BEFORE ELECTION.
ALBANY, N.Y., Oct. 17. -- Attorney General Tabor to-day gave an opinion with reference to the regularity of the certificate of nomination of Alfred C. Chapin, who has been nominated by the Democrats to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of David A. Boody from the Second Congressional District, comprising a part of the County of Kings. 
--------
168-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The presentment of the Grand Jury in respect to the Park Place disaster is a very temperate, and a very sensible document. That body declines to indict anybody upon the ground that no proof has been offered that would be likely to satisfy a petit jury of such gross and criminal negligence as alone would justify that proceeding. 
--------
169-> A GREAT DAY FOR POLES.; THEY CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF A GREAT HISTORIC EVENT.
The one hundredth anniversary of the adoption of the national Constitution by the Polish Congress of Nobles on May 3, 1791, was celebrated yesterday by over 2,000 Polish residents of this city and vicinity.

--------
172-> COL. JONES IS ALL RIGHT.
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 13. -- Regarding Mr. Cleveland's anti-free coinage letter the St. Louis Republic (Stalwart Dem.) will say editorially to-morrow: "This is, of course, merely the expression of his view as a single private citizen. Far from attempting to speak as a party leader or to control the party, Mr. Cleveland has waited until the attitude of the party became pronounced and unmistakable, and has then declared his private opinion.

The twenty-sixth annual regatta of the Atlantic Yacht Club was sailed yesterday and was remarkable for the introduction of forty-six foot yachts as a distinct class into the yacht racing annals of this country. They made a great race, and the new Herreshoff boat Gloriana ran away from all of her competitors in the handsomest style. Even the boats of those famous designers, Burgess and Fife, wore left far in the rear. 
--------
175-> WOMAN'S WORK IN TEMPERANCE.; FOURTH DAY'S PROCEEDING OF THE DUAL CONVENTION IN BOSTON.
BOSTON, Nov. 17. -- At the fourth day's session of the dual temperance convention to-day John G. Woolly spoke briefly of his reformatory called "Rest Island." E.H.

--------
176-> AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.; DECIDED THAT FOREIGN-BUILT YACHTS NEEDN'T PAY "LIGHT MONEY."
Judge Benedict, in the United States District Court, yesterday handed down a decision that will be hailed with joy by all American yachtsmen who own yachts made abroad, and who have feared that in accordance with the order of the Secretary of the Treasury they would have to pay "light money" of 50 cents a ton every time they entered an American port. 
--------
177-> NEWS ABOUT RAILROADS; UNION PACIFIC WILL ISSUE NEW SIX PER CENT. NOTES. THE FLOATING DEBT IS TO BE WIPED OUT BY THE ISSUE OF $20,000,000 OF THESE NOTES, WITH THREE YEARS TO RUN.
The Directors of the Union Pacific Railroad made a financial arrangement yesterday which is said to be satisfactory to a majority of the floating-debt creditors, but which may encounter spirited opposition from at least a portion of the minority. The purpose of the meeting was to provide for an extension of the company's floating debt for a period of three years. 
--------
178-> THE PHILADELPHIA SAILS.; BOUND FOR ST. THOMAS, THERE TO AWAIT DEVELOPMENTS.

Two European dispatches from different points show the curious confusion that has fallen upon the relations of Germany and France apropos of the recent visit of the Emperor's mother to Paris. On the one hand, the London papers, on the authority of correspondents in Paris and Vienna, state that the French Ministry has decided to recall M. HERBETTE, the French Ambassador at Berlin.

Minden's poolrooms were crowded from 2 o'clock until 5 yesterday afternoon, and the men who were at work there had all the business they could attend to.

GAINESVILLE, Fla., Sept. 4. -- This city is wild with excitement and joy to-day. The people are assured of peace now, for Harmon Murray, a noted desperado of this State with twelve murders to his name, was killed near Archer this morning by a young negro named Hardy Early. 
--------
183-> WHAT GOES ON IN BROOKLYN; POLICE CAPTAINS ANGRY AT THE EXPOSURE OF THEIR DEAL. OFFICE HOLDERS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE AFTER INCREASED SALARIES -- EVERYBODY EXCEPT ADAMS TIRED OF THE DIRTY STREETS.
The Brooklyn Police Captains were an indignant set of men when THE TIMES exposed the little political deal back of their recent dinner at the Academy of Music. They were particularly incensed at the statement that they had forced assessments from politicians and office holders, and several of the men who hold high places on the force denounced this allegation as false. 
--------
184-> THE MACQUEARY VERDICT.
The judgment that has been announced in the case of the Rev. HOWARD MACQUERY is hardly a square verdict, though three out of the five judges of the ecclesiastical court believe that he ought to be condemned. Two are for his expulsion from the ministry, one is for his suspension from office, and the other two hold that no penalty is demanded. 
--------
185-> FLOWER'S FIGURES GROW; THE DEMOCRATIC PLURALITY IS INCREASED TO 45,000. WHILE SHEEHAN RUNS BEHIND SOMEWHAT, HE HAS A HANDSOME PLURALITY -- THE LEGISLATURE IS VERY CLOSE, BUT INDICATIONS POINT TO A REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY.
The plurality by which Roswell P. Flowe has been elected Governor of the State of New-York is increased by later and more complete returns to 45,648. For Lieutenant Governor, Mr. Sheehan is elected by a vote somewhat smaller than that given for the head of the ticket. The official returns also show the election of the remainder of the Democratic candidates for State offices. 
--------
186-> A PROPOSED SHIP CANAL.; ULTERIOR OBJECT OF THE NEW-JERSEY RIPARIAN BOARD.
TRENTON, Aug. 18. -- The utter insincerity with which Gov. Abbett's Riparian Board is treating the State's shore owners in the matter of the seizure of the reefs off their holdings at Communipaw and Bayonne -- a project which is now under discussion between the Governor and the Federal authorities -- is shown by some disclosures made to THE TIMES'S correspondent to-day by some gentlemen connected with the State Board.

ALL FEATHERS. -- The biggest of all really powerful flying birds are, I believe, the wandering albatross and the South American condor -- for the roc I reject outright as worthy only of the most restricted Arabian and nocturnal ornithology. Seen on the wing, or even with the wings expanded, merely, both these great existing birds have a most majestic and colossal appearance.

188-> THE JOBS IN CONGRESS; SENATE OBSTRUCTIONS BEFORE THE SUBSIDY BILL. THE UPPER HOUSE IN NO HURRY TO APPOINT CONFERREES -- MR. VEST SHOWS OPPOSITION -- A SINGLE -- HEADED CIVIL-SERVICE COMMISSION.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28. -- The Senate was not in so great a hurry to appoint conferrees on the Shipping bill to-day. Mr. Frye wanted no delay and received some sympathy from Mr. Washburn, but the Senate conferrees are not yet selected. When the bill was received from the House of Representatives this afternoon Mr. Frye promptly moved to agree to the conference asked for by the House.

190-> MARQUIS RUDINI TO THE GALLERY.
The Prime Minister of Italy was questioned yesterday in the Chamber of Deputies at Rome touching the relations of Italy with the United States, growing out of the murders in New-Orleans. He made a reply which he was, no doubt, very glad of a chance to make. He said that "Italy could not admit the irresponsibility of the United States in regard to the acts of the single States of the Union. 
--------
191-> GEN. NEWTON HAS RESIGNED.
CHICAGO, April 16. -- Gen. John Newton of New-York, Consulting Engineer of the Chicago Drainage Canal, resigned to-day. It is said several of the Trustees will also drop out unless the State Legislature will allow a shallower excavation than the one originally proposed. 
--------
192-> THE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE.
A correspondent of one of our contemporaries who professes to know something about the workings of Mr. HARRISON'S mind asserts that the President would like to get rid of Secretary NOBLE if he could do so easily and safely, because this member of his Cabinet has displayed incompetence and has permitted many scandals to disgrace his department. 
--------
193-> PARKS AND RAILROADS.
The Board of Trade and Transportation is not a body which commands universal confidence and respect. There is commonly a suspicion when it delivers an opinion upon public affairs that some interested person has "captured" the organization and is using it for his own ends. There is even a suspicion that the "board" exists mainly for the purpose of being thus captured. 
--------
194-> SENDING BACK THE TROOPS.; THE INDIANS GIVING UP THEIR ARMS VERY SLOWLY.
PINE RIDGE, S.D., Jan. 17, via Rushville, Neb. -- The council between the friendly and the hostile Indians has tended to revive the anxiety of many white people and assure the Indians that their fear of being massacred by the soldiers was without foundation. Everybody to-day seems to feel that the trouble has been brought to a close.

197-> SALE OF THE MITCHELL LIBRARY.; GOOD PRICES OBTAINED AND NONE OF THE BOOKS BARGAINS.
Two hundred books of the library formed by Henry R. Mitchell were sold by Bangs  Co. yesterday in two hours for $3,954. If they were of the quality that the Elizabetho maniacs Chew, Bierstadt, and Marshall Lefferts collect, it would not be marvelous, but they were not. They were generally books that collectors discard after they have passed the experiential stage of their collecting.

198-> MRS. BLANK'S FIRST CALLER; SHE WAS A CHARMING AND SOCIABLE YOUNG WOMAN AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THE WEATHER AND SUNDAY SCHOOL WORK -- A CANVAS BAG AND ITS INTERESTING CONTENTS.
" She was handsome, dignified, and dressed, from her dainty French boots to the tip of her elegant bonnet, like a rich young Fifth Avenue woman," said the young matron who told the story. "Everything about her betokened refinement of a high degree, and her exquisitely gloved little hands were innocent of any incumbrance except a beautiful sunshade which she carried with the air of the accomplished daughter of luxury.

Dr. John Hall, pastor of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, has resigned from the Board of Directors of the Union Theological Seminary on account of the Prof. Briggs controversy.

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 18. -- William Evans was Secretary of the Morse Wool-Securing Company. He disappeared from St. Louis nearly a month ago under circumstances that led to an investigation of his books, and it was discovered that he was a defaulter for a large amount. The President of the company, beyond admitting that crookedness lead been discovered, refused to make a statement.

201-> THE LONDON LAUNDRESSES; THEIR HYDE PARK MEETING AND THE THINGS SAID. PLEASURE THE WOMEN FOUND IN THE OCCASION -- PERHAPS 60,000 PRESENT -- GOOD ORDER AND MODERATION IN THE SPEECHES.
" Never perhaps since washtubs were invented (in the opinion of the London Daily News of June 15) have the laundresses of London had just such a time of it as a great number of them had yesterday in Hyde Park. 'Oh! what a day we are having!' cried one frisky matron, and that seemed to be pretty much the feeling of the great majority of them. 
--------
202-> HALIFAX WHARVES BURNED.; GREAT DAMAGE DONE TO PROPERTY -- THE TROOPS CALLED OUT.
HALIFAX, N.S., Oct. 2. -- The most calamitous fire Halifax has experienced in many years occurred last night, when wharf property extending from Cronan's south to Cunard's north was almost entirely destroyed. The flames were first discovered in Martin's planing mill, a two-story wooden building on Taylor's wharf. Just below the mill was Louis A. Wilson's shipsmith's shop, containing considerable valuable property, which soon caught fire.

The members of the Produce Exchange, which includes many friends and admirers of Mr. Stuart Robson, have organized the largest theatre party on record. It will number between 1,500 and 2,000 persons, including many prominent in business and social circles. The party is so numerous that it will be obliged to see Mr. Robson in "The Henrietta" in two sections.

205-> LOW MASS ON THE NAIADA.; INTERESTING SERVICES HELD BY ARCHBISHOP CORRIGAN.
Yesterday was a great day for the officers and men on board the French flagship Naiade, which is anchored in the North River off Forty-second Street, for Archbishop Corrigan boarded their ship in the morning and held religious services. The Archbishop was accompanied by Mgr. Charles E. McDonnell. The services were held on the quarter deck beneath an awning built with the flags of all nations.

206-> YALE'S CLASS OF FIFTY-SIX.
" Ordo nootis abrosianae" was the quaint but significant title of the programme with which Yale's brilliant class of 1856 commemorated their thirty-fifth anniversary at the recent Commencement. Among the members to whom toasts were assigned were the Hon. A.J. Bartholomew of Southbridge, Mass., the Hon. Chauncey M. Depew of New-York, and the Rev. Dr. Wolcott Calkius of Newton, Mass., who appear in the "Ordo" after this fashion:

207-> JUDGE LOWERY IS DISGUSTED.; THE OHIO CLERKS WILL NOT SUBSCRIBE LIBERALLY TO HIS FUND.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. -- Judge Lowery of Ohio calculated that the 700 Ohio persons in office in Washington, with aggregated salaries of $500,000, would give at least $25,000 to help McKinley and protection. They have, it is understood, "paid up" only $1,000. The result of his appeal is said to be "disgusting," only fifty clerks having subscribed.

The stories of wholesale slaughter of malcontents in Port au Prince were supplemented yesterday by others of an even more atrocious nature. In Haiti's capital the alleged insurrectionists were killed outright, in the outlying towns they were subjected to lingering torture. Jacmel, a little town on the southwestern coast, furnished six of the victims.

It is said that Secretary TRACY will soon give names to all the new vessels now under construction or authorized which are thus far known by numbers.

--------
211-> ACCUSED BY AN EX-CLERK.; HE LOSES HIS POSITION AND CREATES A SENSATION.
The American Loan and Trust Company is assailed again. Its accounts are being overhauled by State Bank Examiners. Wall Street gossip, based on charges made by an ex-clerk of the institution, have led to this. But the investigation under way was asked for by the trust company itself. The officers insist that its affairs have been misrepresented and that the examination in progress will amply vindicate them. 
--------
212-> OBLIGED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS.; WASHINGTON SOCIETY WOMEN AND THEIR UNWELCOME CALLERS.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14. -- There is a general out-cry on the part of society entertainers at the manner in which they are imposed upon by the adventurers and aspirants for social honors who annually come to the surface. The majority of the latter class are harmless enough, except in the pretension which induces them to leave cards, on which their address is wrongly given, in some fashionable locality. 
--------
213-> A POWDERLY ASSEMBLY.; THE KNIGHTS INDORSE THE GENERAL MASTER WORKMAN AND ADJOURN.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Nov. 17. -- After a prolonged session, extending late into the evening, the delegates to the Knights or Labor General Assembly were able to complete their work.

NEWBURG, N.Y., Sept. 4. -- One year ago Elbert W. Rose was robbed of a horse and wagon valued at $600. Three months ago a sister of Rose saw the horse on a street in Newark, N.J., and the sale of the horse was traced to Philadelphia, Penn., where a firm named Kyle, Berry  Co. had purchased it from Allen Raymond Wright, a former resident of this city.

Peter J. Claassen was sentenced to six years in the Erie County Penitentiary by Judge Benedict, in the United States Circuit Court yesterday, under his conviction for misappropriating the funds of the Sixth National Bank.

216-> TRYING TO SAVE A PARK; ARGUMENT BEGUN BEFORE THE ALDERMEN'S COMMITTEE. A PRELIMINARY SKIRMISH IN THE FULL BOARD -- CORPORATION COUNSEL CLARK'S OPINION MAY BE ASKED ABOUT THE GRABBERS.
Interest at the meeting of the Board of Aldermen yesterday again centred and was absorbed in the Battery Park grab, which occupied the attention of the board during twenty of the forty minutes that the meeting lasted. The subject was introduced by Alderman John Morris, the mover of the anti-grab resolutions two weeks ago, who offered the following: 
--------
217-> THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.
It is a singular fact, which perhaps hardly accords with prevailing impressions, that for several years there has been a progressive decrease in the number of public school pupils throughout the country, as compared with the population. That is to say, while there has been no absolute retrograde, and, indeed, even a slight average gain, yet this gain is very much less than the gain in population. 
--------
218-> NEW-YORK AND LONDON.
New-Yorkers who are fond of comparing their city with London will find an unusually fertile field of analogies and differences in what is called the "day" census of London. Both the American and British national censuses are residential. That is, they are supposed to show where people have their homes. 
--------
219-> STATE POLITICAL NOTES.
Major -- not Major -- Gen. -- James W. -- not James S. -- Wadsworth now declares through a number of superserviceable friends and newspapers that it was all a mistake and that he will take the Republican nomination for Governor if it is tendered to him unanimously. In the meantime Sing Sing is singing the praises of Col. R.A. McAlpin. 
--------
220-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
There is little significance in the rest of the platform except in its treatment of the silver question and ballot reform. The approval of the McKinley tariff, the Fifty-first Congress, and the pension extravagance was to be expected. The silver question gave the platform makers some trouble. They undertook to settle the difficulty by diluting free coinage with protection, and carrying the Pennsylvania idea of protecting home industry into the currency.

221-> BOSTONS WIN WITH EASE; THEY DEFEAT THE GIANTS AND HAVE RUNS TO SPARE. BOTH WELCH AND STALEY WERE BATTED HARD, BUT THE VISITORS MANAGED TO BUNCH THEIR HITS -ANOTHER GAME FOR CHICAGO.
Welch pitched for the New-Yorks yesterday, and they lost another game to Boston. The latter is in excellent form and playing remarkably fine ball. In the opening inning the visitors measured up the curving of the New-York pitcher, and they batted out 3 runs. 
--------
222-> AN INTERESTING RUMOR.; TAMMANY SAID TO BE WILLING TO GIVE UP THE BRIDGE.
Some of the Tammany people in the Eighth Senatorial District have developed a desire to nominate Col. Alfred Wagstaff, President of the Board of Trustees of the New-York and Brooklyn Bridge, for the Senate. None of the heavy-weights of the Tammany bosses in the district has yet-publicly given his sanction to the boom, but there has been enough talk about the matter in the Senate district to set people wondering. 
--------
223-> NOT THE REFORM DEMANDED.; GOV. HILL REFUSES A HEARING ON A PERVERTED BALLOT ACT.
The application addressed to Gov.

--------
226-> THE GENERAL VERDICT.
The result of the elections of Tuesday, taken as a whole, is distinctly favorable to the cause of good government in the Nation and, with one marked exception, in the several States. Whatever may be said to the contrary, national issues were necessarily involved. In Massachusetts, as expressly declared by Gov. RUSSELL, and as maintained in the discussions of the canvass, there was little else.

Another great throng of women and children, with a man or two sprinkled in here and there, filled the big Madison Square Garden yesterday afternoon and evening, admiring the most successful flower show ever held in this country. Tuesday's crowd was thought to be quite equal to the full capacity of the Garden, but yesterday's was even larger, a fact which shows that the show is growing in popularity, as it deserves.

NEW-ORLEANS, July 19. -- The Picayune's West Point (Miss.) special says: "A suit involving property worth over $100,000,000 will shortly be filed in the courts of New-York City, and Col. H.

We find the following curious contribution to the literature of the tin-plate mystery on the editorial page of the Cleveland Leader, of the 6th inst., in a department of that journal where inquiring readers are instructed concerning the tenets of McKinleyism and other matters:

--------
236-> THE WARM FALL WEATHER.
Perhaps the past few days have been more trying than any "spell of weather" that has preceded them since the beginning of the Summer. Undoubtedly they have been more trying to the people who have only just, and as they now find rather prematurely, returned from the country, particularly if these people have been among the mountains, where "humidity" has no terrors. 
--------
237-> NATHALIE DRIVEN FROM SERVIA.; EXPELLED DESPITE THE SYMPATHY OF THE STUDENTS AND PEOPLE.

The twentieth annual meeting of the American Fisheries Society will be held Wednesday and Thursday. May 27 and 28, in the rooms of the National Museum, Washington D.C. The meeting will be of unusaul interest, and it is thought that that there will be a large attendance.

CINCINNATI, Ohio, May 19. -- The National Union Conference has met and organized, and its committees, appointed after the manner usual to "old-party" conventions, are now struggling with problems of membership, rules of order, and platform. If one were to attempt to predict just what the declaration of principles will be, he would undertake to do more than any person named on the Committee on Resolutions could tell to-day.

HANOVER, N.H., Oct. 3. -- The Dartmouth freshmen won their second game from the sophomores in the class series this afternoon by a score of 20 to 4.

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Oct. 3. -- The nomination of a Republican legislative ticket in this county put in the field the last important nominations in the State, and, with a few others made the same day, practically ends the preliminary fight between Sherman and Foraker over the Senatorship.

--------
246-> FOR THE SPEAKER'S EYE; THE COMMITTEES IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SUGGESTIONS FOR A FAIR DISTRIBUTION OF CHAIRMANSHIPS -- A NEW DEPARTURE DEMANDED -- QUESTION OF APPARENT HEIRSHIPS.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. -- Before long the Republican newspapers that have periodically made up paragraphs about "Rebel Brigadiers" in the Congress with undiminishing zest, notwithstanding the constantly-diminishing Brigadier, will turn from the contemplation of unpleasant news concerning the election to the business of scaring their readers about the danger, in the Fifty-second Congress, of a preponderance of Southern men at the heads of the committees of that body. 
--------

251-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The sealing season is practically ended, and its returns show a larger take, in the aggregate, than had been generally expected. The Pribilof Islands, in consequence of the limit in the modus vivendi, seem to have sent to San Francisco only about 13,000 skins, a considerable part of these being left over, at is said, from last season. This would be a falling-off of more than 8,000 from the take of 1890.

NEWARK, N.J., Jan. 2. -- James H. Van Ness, a milkman, drove his two horses into an alley leading from East Mechanic to Ferry Street this morning. Of a sudden both horses fell to the ground.

254-> Editorial Article 11 -- No Title
Ex-President Cleveland is entitled to a large share of the credit for the victories in New-York and Massachusetts. Without his timely and effective aid Flower and Russell would have been defeated, and as a consequence Cleveland stock is quoted higher than ever.

255-> A RULING AIMED AT ART; IMPORTERS DENOUNCE A TREASURY DEPARTMENT ORDER. THIS ORDER REQUIRES THE CONFISCATION OF MUSIC, PICTURES, &C., SENT THROUGH THE MAILS FROM ABROAD -- A PROTEST TALKED OF.
It is not unlikely that importers of music, pictures, including etchings, photographs, , and a large contingent of lovers of these things who are not dealers will unite in a protest to the Secretary of the Treasury against the ruling which instructs the customs officers to confiscate these articles when sent through the mails from foreign countries. 
--------
256-> AMATEUR BOXERS SCARCE.; THEY DID NOT COMPETE LAST NIGHT AS EXPECTED.
The New-York Athletic Club was to have given another "scrapping" entertainment last night, but it didn't. The "scrappers" have no use for that club any more.

--------
258-> SMALL SHIPS LOOKED FOR; NAVAL PROSPECTS UNDER THE COMING CONGRESS. WHY A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE SHOULD NOT DROP THE WORK A DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION BEGAN -- NEW VESSELS FOR THE REVENUE MARINE.
There is little likelihood of any large war ships being authorized to be built for the navy in the next two years. This fact is known not only to the Secretary of the Navy, but to shipbuilders in general. The coming House is a Democratic one. It has staring it squarely in the face the reckless expenditures of the Fifty-first Congress. 
--------

--------
261-> MONELL'S DEBT TO FLACK.; A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY WITH THE EX-SHERIFF AS BENEFICIARY.
To the minds of some people the fact that the late Ambrose H. Monell was heavily in debt to ex-Sheriff James A. Flack, furnishes a partial explanation of how he became involved in the notorious Flack case. All through the case, Monell, then a Justice of a civil court, was the legal adviser of Sheriff Flack. 
--------
262-> THE THEATRE LIBRE.; M. ANTOINE CLOSES THE SEASON WITH PROMISES FOR THE FUTURE.
PARIS, July 7. -- M. Antoine has finished his season at a very late hour, and he has seen fit to postpone all the sensational novelties until another season.

--------
265-> RAILROAD THIEVES ARRESTED.; LEADERS IN A CONSPIRACY TO ROB THE NORTHERN PACIFIC.
CHICAGO, April 17. -- The arrest here Saturday of H. Allen, who was booked as a vagrant, will probably result in breaking up a g'gantic conspiracy to rob the Northern Pacific Railroad Company.

The same day Sullivan went to Seattle, where another man was similarly arrested and lodged in jail. 
--------
266-> THE BOARD OF EDUCATION.
We published yesterday a very full statement of the condition of things in the New-York Board of Education and the probabilities of any reform in the immediate future. Briefly, it may be said that the hope of reform for the present lies with the President, Mr. HUNT. He has the appointment of the standing committees of the board. 
--------
267-> SQUATTERS IN THE PARK; ALL CLAIM FORFEITED TO THE USE OF THE BATTERY. UNLESS THE ELEVATED ROAD OWNS THE PARK COMMISSIONERS, THOSE OFFICIALS WILL ACT PROMPTLY -- NO EXCUSE FOR FURTHER DELAY.
It has been shown in THE TIMES that the elevated road has violated the conditions of the permit by which it was allowed to invade Battery Park. One of these conditions was that no advertising sign or other device should be displayed upon the structure at that place. Such a sign is now flaunted there so conspicuously that no visitor to Battery Park can avoid seeing it. 
--------
268-> THE SEAMEN'S UNION MEETING.
CHICAGO, April 17. -- A meeting of the Seamen's Union was held last night, at which Thomas J. Elderkin, who has returned from a trip along the lakes, said that great progress had been made in perfecting the organization. He stated that the union numbered about 7,000 men at different lake ports, and that men who made sailing a profession were coming into the association at every meeting. 
--------
269-> THROWING OPEN THE GATES.; ALL SORTS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES MAY SOON BE ADMITTED.
ALBANY, April 17. -- The Sullivan bill, which was drawn in the interest of insurance companies like the American Casualty of Baltimore, of which Superintendent of Insurance Pierce has been the attorney, and which has been refused permission to do business in New-York State by reason of the character of its charter, has passed the Assembly.

NEW-ORLEANS, Oct. 3. -- Gen. Ruiz Sandoval has been in this city for the past thirty days, and discusses freely the recent outbreak on the Mexican frontier. Gen. Sandoval says that although he is in sympathy with any movement that will lead to the overthrow of President Diaz, he had absolutely nothing to do with the recent revolution, which was simply a local outburst on the part of the Mexican people. 
--------
274-> OF NAVAL INTEREST.
The advantage in all recently-designed wardrooms aboard British war ships is the separation of the dining from the sleeping apartments. This separation can be appreciated more thoroughly by officers who have quartered in open wardrooms. The tendency to separate the dining and sleeping apartments is showing itself in some of the latest American-designed ships.

--------
276-> BOB WHITE SHOULD BE FED NOW.
During the past week there were heavy falls of snow in numerous sections of this country, and doubtless many sportsmen are concerned as to the welfare of the game birds. The favorite Bob White need considerable attention at the present time, and it behooves sportsmen to immediately attend to feeding them.

--------
280-> CENTRAL PARK DRIVES.; WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE PURPOSE THEY SHOULD SERVE.
In his recent message Mayor Grant of this city declares that the question of widening and improving the drives in Central Park is one which demands immediate attention.

--------
281-> RIGHTS OF FOREIGN POWERS.
LONDON, March 19. -- In the House of Lords to-day Lord Knutsford, Colonial Secretary, introduced a bill to revise certain provisions controling the Newfoundland fisheries rights of foreign powers.

--------
287-> THE SAILORS' SNUG HARBOR.; A CHALLENGE FOR ITS BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO CONSIDER.
I have read in your issue of Feb. 1 an article headed "Tyranny at the Sailors' Snug Harbor" and signed "American Shipmaster." Evidently "American Shipmaster" is well informed as to the management of the Harbor. I can corroborate all he says, and fully agree with him that a merchant sea Captain is not a proper man for the Governor of the Sailors' Snug Harbor.

The home of the Hapsburgs -- a gray hill castle in a poor Swiss lordship, so Carlyle described it -- is almost in the market.

Replying to addresses presented to him, he said that he had done his part toward the solution of the Irish problem, when he had the conferences with Mr. O'Brien, and the subsequent delay in arriving at a settlement of the difficulty was entirely the fault of others.

302-> THE PRESIDENT BLUNDERED.; THERE HAS BEEN NO DECISION IN THE ITATA CASE.
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 18. -- In his annual message to Congress President Harrison displayed an evident lack of information about the Itata affair by stating that a decision in the case had been given by the United States District Court of California. The President said:

The proposal to equip Alaska with a full Territorial Government, including a Legislature and a more extensive judicial system, will perhaps find favor in Congress, now that the census report credits her with 38,000 people. There are drawbacks, however, to ambitions of this sort, in the imposition of taxes, from which she has thus far been free. 
--------
304-> WONDERS IN NEBRASKA.; BY MONEY, FLATTERY, AND TRICKERY IT IS ONCE MORE REPUBLICAN.
LINCOLN, Neb., Nov. 5. -- Thirty hours after the polls closed it was not possible to say positively which party has carried the State, or, rather, which has elected its candidate for the Supreme Bench. As was stated some days ago, at the outset the Republicans faced an adverse majority of 55,000. The Independents matched them in numbers and were actively hostile.

305-> THEY MAKE A CLEAR CASE; PUBLIC SPIRIT ROUSING TO SAVE BATTERY PARK. PETITIONS STARTED ASKING THE PARK COMMISSIONERS TO DO THEIR DUTY -- HOW THE CITIZENS' MOVEMENT IS PROGRESSING.
The citizens who are in the movement to restore Battery Park to its proper uses as a pleasure ground are daily beset with questions by persons who are becoming interested in the movement and want to be stocked with arguments with which they can do missionary work in its behalf. These are some of the reasons why the park should be vacated by the elevated road:

LAKEWOOD, Jan. 31. -- The weather of the week has not been auspicious for the promotion of out-door society pleasures at this resort. Guests at the hotels and cottages appear to be waiting for some of the regular made Lakewood sunshine.

--------
309-> PROTECTING THE BIRDS.
ALBANY, Feb. 14. -- State Entomologist J.A. Lintner believes that the wanton destruction of our wild birds largely aids the excessive ravages of insect pests, which have rapidly increased each succeeding year of late, and it is essential that every bird which is of benefit to the agriculturist be protected. It is possible to declare definitely what particular birds are beneficial, what are of negative importance, and what are injurious. 
--------
310-> FRENCH SLANG.
Really, our French friends who enjoy -- and enjoy greatly -- a reputation for logic do not expend it recklessly on their current phrases. The joyous M. Prudhomme, with whom HENRY MONNIER enriched French literature some sixty years ago, is a personage very much delighted in still by the present generation of French writers, who seem to see in his characteristics something so exceptional that they can afford to laugh at him without reserve.

ASSOCIATIONS OF WILD HORSES. -- Life in societies is again the rule with the large family of horses, which includes the wild horses and donkeys of Asia, the zebras, the mustangs, the cimarrones of the Pampas, and the half-wild horses of Mongolia and Siberia.

TORONTO, Ontario, Dec. 4 -- Secretary Rusk's proposal to exclude from the United States Canadian as well as British cattle, in order to force the British authorities to revoke the order under which American cattle exported to Britain are slaughtered at the port of landing, causes great uneasiness and not a little resentment among Canadian breeders.

315-> OUT-AND-OUT ROBBERY; HOW IT IS PLANNED TO POCKET THE PEOPLE'S MONEY. FACTS ABOUT STEAMSHIP COMPANIES WHICH ASK FOR SUBSIDIES -- NO SERVICE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL TO THAT NOW PERFORMING.
If Postmaster General Wanamaker awards contracts for carrying the ocean mails to those bidders whose propositions were opened recently he will furnish a very comfortable thing for each of the steamship companies concerned. He will add to the revenue of each a considerable sum of cash, for which he will ask very little in return in the way of extra trouble or labor.

The results of the ball games yesterday no doubt pleased Capt. Anson. He won his game in Boston and the two clubs chasing him for first place -- New-York and Boston -- were beaten. As a result, the Cook County team has increased its advantage decidedly.

Two captures have been made in Bering Sea by the revenue cutters, but they do not seem to be very important, A British schoonen from Victoria was taken by the Rusk, not in the act of catching seals but with the evident purpose of continuing her sealing cruise notwithstanding the warning to desist, and was turned over to the British cruiser Nymphe and taken to Unalaska.

319-> A CHANCE FOR YOUNG SOLDIERS.; SIXTY-SEVEN NEW CADETS WANTED FOR WEST POINT.
WASHINGTON, AUG. 7. -- Unless the members-elect in sixty-seven Congressional districts in different States are diligent in hunting up as many young men who desire to enjoy the benefits of an education at the West Point Military Academy, there is danger that the new class at that institution will begin its studies in the Fall very far short of the number for which Congress has made provision.

321-> THE NAVY AND COMMERCE.
Every reflective person who has read the report of the entertainment given by the merchants of New-York to the officers of the White Squadron must have been struck with a certain sense of confusion if not of incongruity. It was not easy to see what was the precise public significance of this public function.

322-> THE JANITOR WAS A THIEF.; NEAT DETECTIVE WORK BY A SUB-TREASURY COIN TELLER.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Aug. 7. -- Ashton G. Bean, Chief Coin Teller of the Sub-Treasury in the Custom House, by some clever detective work succeeded in capturing this morning a thief who has made several raids on Uncle Sam's money recently. Mr. Bean had noticed the disappearance of several small piles of coin from his desk. Once a bag containing $62 in battered nickels disappeared, another time $10 in quarters.

It is clear enough that Senator Stanford of California is "willin'." Asked, the other day if he would accept the Republican nomination for the Presidency, he said: "I am not a candidate myself, and I don't propose to be. It will be time enough to determine that matter when the nomination comes, if it should come; but I have no idea that it will be offered to me.

PORTLAND, Me., March 2. -- Following are results in municipal elections in this State to-day:

325-> A PLAGUE OF SPIDERS.; MILLIONS OF THE INSECTS DESTROYING CALIFORNIA TREES.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 5. -- Millions of small red spiders have attacked the fruit orchards in and around the town of Lodi. The pest is far worse than a plague of locusts. The spiders first made their appearance about ten days ago, immediately after a season of very hot weather. The ground is red with the insects, and great damage to crops is the result. 
--------
326-> THE WATER-SUPPLY CASE; JENKS SECURES AN ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TO-MORROW. PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE OLD PLANT ARE DEJECTED -- CHAPIN, HOWEVER, FINDS SOME REASONS FOR CONSOLATION -- RUTAN IS MAD.
Citizen William Ziegler and Attorney William J. Gaynor held a reception in the Special Term room of the Supreme Court, Brooklyn, yesterday morning. Lawyers and politicians, both Republican and Democratic, crowded about them and congratulated them on their victory over the forces that had tried so hard to compel the taxpayers to buy the Long Island Water Supply Company's plant at the exorbitant price of $1,250,000.

--------
329-> M'KINLEY'S TIN PLATE.
In his address to the convention at Columbus Mr. McKINLEY was compelled to notice the protests of those who have pointed out that his promises concerning the tin-plate industry have not been fulfilled, and who are unwilling that the people should be taxed many millions of dollars to encourage the manufacture of tin cups for McKinley dinners and of a few boxes of tin plate to be shown in the windows of McKinley newspaper offices.

ST. JOHN'S, N.F., March 19. -- In the case of James Baird against Capt. Sir Baldwin Walker, a verdict was yesterday rendered for the plaintiff. This case has excited great interest both here and in Great Britain, and has been the cause of much diplomatic correspondence between the Newfoundland authorities and the British Foreign Office.

The shallowness of Gov. HILL'S bit of partisan clap-trap in refusing to honor Gov. BULKELEY'S requisition for the surrender of a Connecticut criminal because it would be a recognition of his title to office is effectually exposed by the proof that he had already recognized BULKELEY more than once since Judge MORRIS was declared by the Senate at Hartford to have been elected and went through the form of taking the oath of office.

At the recent annual banquet of the Boston Paper Trade Association there was read a letter from ex-Senator WARNER MILLER, in which he said:

Jacob Cram had entered his English cutters Violette and Kitz, and they started first and second respectively.

334-> MASSACHUSETTS REPUBLICANS.
The Secretary of the Republican Club of Massachusetts recently sent a circular letter to members of the club in which in roundabout way he asked what the Republican Party of Massachusetts should do to be saved -- on what issues it should go to the people this Fall.

The "boss" method of regulating party affairs is so prevalent and so persistent among the Republicans of Pennsylvania that it threatens to create serious trouble in the State League of Republican Clubs, which is supposed to be auxiliary to the regular party organization.

337-> THE INCORPORATION REFUSED.; A ST. LOUIS SOCIETY WITH AN UNPRONOUNCEABLE NAME.
ST. LOUIS, July 20. -- An application for a pro-forma decree of incorporation, filed by the Deutsche Oesterreichischer Unterstutzuage Verein von St. Louis, a proposed Austrian Society, was filed in the Circuit Court and referred to Col.

338-> TO IMPROVE THE BALLOT LAW.; FEATURES OF THE BILLS ALREADY INTRODUCED AT ALBANY.
ALBANY, Jan. 18. -- A determined effort will be made this Winter to amend the ballot-reform law. So far the attempt is confined to the Republicans. If there is Democratic opposition to the bill in its present form it has not yet manifested itself. Of course the proposed changes cannot be effected without the aid of the Democrats. 
--------
339-> HUNDREDS OF FISH CAUGHT.; FINE SPORT AT BARNEGAT SUNDAY -- STRIPED BASS NOT YET BITING.
FORKED RIVER, N.J., July 20. -- There is great fishing now in Barnegat Bay. Many persons from New-York, Jersey City, Newark, and other places in this State were on the bay yesterday, and catches of 75 to 15O weakfish to the boat were by no means uncommon. One party from Jersey City, consisting of five men and two boys, took over 200 weakfish.

340-> NEW MONEY FOR CHRISTMAS.; THE SUB-TREASURY STOCKED UP WITH FRESH BILLS AND FRESH COIN.
Untarnished coins of gold and of silver, fresh from the mint, and smooth, crisp United States notes which have never seen service in tradesmen's hands are passing over the counters of the United States Sub-Treasury in large quantities just now for Christmas purposes. From about the middle of December until Christmas Eve there is an extraordinary demand for "new money." 
--------
341-> "THE LEAGUE OF PEACE."
The events that have followed the expulsion of a French journalist from Bulgaria seem to demonstrate that the name of the "League of Peace," which has been given to the alliance thus far consisting only of France and Russia is a misnomer. The circumstances of the expulsion have not yet been transmitted enough in detail to enable us to understand it.

E.V. Skinner, General Eastern Agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, has received a dispatch stating that the steamer Empress of India, on her trip around the world, left Yokohama on the morning of April 17.

The Christmas programme at the theatres will be uncommonly interesting. At Daly's the comedy of "As You Like It" will be revived, and Miss Rehan's blithe Rosalind will be just in keeping with the mirthful spirit of the season. It is Mr. Daly's idea that the tone of this pastoral play should be gay and joyous, indicating the buoyancy of happy youth. This idea is perfectly carried out in his production of the comedy.

345-> TO SAVE THE ADIRONDACKS; THE FORESTRY COMMISSION AWAKENED AT LAST. LEGAL OPPOSITION TO BE MADE TO THE SCHEME OF THE NEW-YORK CENTRAL TO OCCUPY STATE LANDS WITH THE PROPOSED NEW RAILROAD.

NEW-BRUNSWICK, N.J., July 5. -- The New Jersey Bureau of Vital and Labor Statistics had devoted much time in the course of the past year to a consideration of the question of farm values and the extent of agricultural depression as shown by the abandonment of farms and other statistics. The report on the subject has been prepared by Statistician Fischer of this city and will be published in the forthcoming report.

St. Louis, June 2. -- The Lucerne petition to the Vatican asking for the adoption of a policy of nationalizing the Catholic Church in America has caused a controversy that promises to take a very wide range and develop some decidedly sensational features.

348-> UNDER SENTENCE OF DEATH; THE NARROW ESCAPE OF A CONFEDERATE PRISONER. A UNION GENERAL RUNS THE RISK OF BEING COURTMARTIALED BY STAYING AN EXECUTION -- DRAMATIC WAR STORY -- A SISTER'S DEVOTION.
As the principal characters in the story I am about to tell are still living, and I have not received their consent to use their true names, I must take fictitious ones, but this will not detract from the general accuracy of the narrative, while it will give me more latitude in the grouping and presentation of a series of incidents quite as startling in their way as ever the brain of romancer conjured up.

349-> THE JEWISH IMMIGRANTS.; A MOVEMENT IN ST. LOUIS TO EDUCATE THE RUSSIAN REFUGEES.
ST. LOUIS, July 5. -- The movement to educate the Jewish immigrants who come to this city has been set on foot under the direction of the Jewish Alliance, which to-day reorganized. At a meeting held this evening Jacob Furth, Moses Fraley, Isidor Busch, and others made stirring speeches, reviewing at length the condition of the Russian Jew. It was decided that the thing he most needed was information. 
--------
350-> CLUB NEWS AND GOSSIP.
The Catholic Club has long had a method of keeping its members posted on matters of interest connected with the club which a good many other clubs in this town might copy with profit. This method is nothing more nor less than the publication of a monthly newspaper. To be sure, this "newspaper" bears the name of the Bulletin of the Catholic Club; but it is a newspaper, just the same, small though it is.

351-> COMMISSIONER GILROY'S REPORT.; THE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY, STREETS, AND STREET LIGHTING.

352-> LOOKING AFTER RHODE ISLAND.; EFFICIENT POSTMASTERS KICKED OUT TO HELP THE REPUBLICANS.
PROVIDENCE. R.I., Oct. 3. -- Rhode Island, as one of the doubtful States, is evidently to receive the attention of the Republican managers, and they have begun early in their characteristic way. A Republican organ has been established in this city within a fortnight, and it printed for two successive days an editorial article signed by Headsman Clarkson. 
--------
353-> TWO JEALOUSIES.
It had all come to pass so gradually that Beatrice Danvers could not, although she strove to, remember how it had originated. And yet the bitter truth remained. She, who had begun her early married life in a glow of confidence in the future, was now past middle age, bereft of all illusions, confessing that her life was nought but an irrevocable, irredeemable failure.

The two meetings held in the Trunk Line Association offices in the Jersey Central Building yesterday were not productive of important results. The General Passenger Agents did nothing beyond routine work, because of the absence of representatives of the Canadian Pacific Road. It had been expected that the question of admitting the Canadian Pacific into the immigrant passenger traffic clearing house might be acted on.

355-> DR. FISHER'S PROMOTION.; TO BE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL.
BOSTON, Oct. 3. -- Dr. C. Irving Fisher, the head of the State hospital and almshouse at Tewksbury for the past eight years, has accepted the position of Superintendent of the Presbyterian Hospital of New-York. His salary will be far in excess of that allowed by the State of Massachusetts.

THE DANGERS OF HYPNOTISM. -- At Nancy I have seen a young woman return on three consecutive mornings to be hypnotized for a headache! After each seance she expressed herself as feeling quite relieved. Now, if the hypnotic cure of a headache has to be repeated three consecutive mornings, it has nothing to boast of over simpler remedies, whereas it may, as I have shown, be but substituting a dangerous neurosis for a headache.

357-> COLLIDING WITH A WAR SHIP.; A TUG MAKES THINGS VERY LIVELY FOR THE NAUTILUS.
Foreign men-of-war do not seem to be any more exempt from collision with peaceful traders than are our own cruisers. Yesterday he Spanish schoolship Nautilus, at anchor in the North River, was run into by a tug with a coal-laden canalboat in tow.

PLAINFIELD, N.J., June 1. -- By far the most brilliant and fashionable wedding ever witnessed in Plainfield was that which took place this evening, when Miss Elinor Matilda Shepard became the wife of John Doull Miller. The groom is a son of William Miller of Lancaster Gate, Hyde Park, London. The bride is a daughter of Augustus D. Shepard, one of the Vice Presidents of the American Bank Note Company.

359-> DANA AND JAY GOULD.; THEIR REAL OR PRETENDED IGNORANCE IN ELECTRICAL MATTERS. New-York Correspondence Western Electrician.
The rapid-transit question continues to crop up at various times and in various lights. The elevated railway people, balked in their endeavor to annex the best part of Broadway and the whole of the Boulevard, throw cold water on the electric underground scheme whenever it is discussed, and curiously they are backed up by one or two of the daily papers. 
--------
360-> THE GAMBLING SCANDAL.
At this distance there is no reason why it should not be said that Sir WILLIAM GORDON CUMMING seems to have been ill advised in bringing a suit for slander against certain persons who had promulgated the report that he had been detected in cheating at cards. British "society" is pretty well understood and not in the least respected by serious persons either in or out of England.

361-> THE BABYLONIAN EXPEDITION.; ANTIQUITIES HAVE TO BE SMUGGLED OUT OF TURKEY.
The Babylonian Exploration Party, which left New-York in the Summer of 1888, in charge of Prof. J.T. Peters of the University of Pennsylvania, has returned, after having made two exploring trips.

LANSING, Mich., May 6. -- Gov. Winans, in his inaugural address, neglected to recommend an appropriation of $50,000 to aid Detroit in entertaining the National Grand Army of the Republic at its encampment next August. A canvass early in the session showed that a majority of the members, reflecting the opinion of the State, were utterly opposed to the measure.

ST. PAUL, Minn., Dec. 4. -- On Nov. 18 the immense wholesale houses of Griggs  Cooper, and Farrell, Ozmun  Kirk, at Third and Waconta Streets, burned, and the loss footed up $1,000,000.

364-> ADVICE ABOUT CAMPING OUT.; SOME PLACES WHERE DWELLING IN TENTS WOULD BE ENJOYABLE.
Some of the members of the Young Boys' Camping Club of Harlem write to THE TIMES asking for some points about camping out. They also ask to have some places suggested where such pleasure can be indulged in. They also wish to know what rifles it would be best to take along. This sounds a little formidable, and the query about the rifles savors of expectation of big game if not of an Indian expedition.

PARIS, Feb. 2. -- From Rouff comes the fashionable light this week, and his hints and novelties show that tact and discretion which have made the repute and elegance of his dictates. Rouff says that skirts will continue to be long and plain and the basques even longer; that their materials and softer Spring and Summer goods may show more caprice in draping.

THE TIMES has an editorial article on the subject of the step taken by Mr. George Jones in 1884, when for the first time his newspaper opposed the nominee of the Republican Party for the Presidency. A reference to this event -- a very important event both for the party and for the newspaper -- was made in the Evening Post's sketch of Mr. Jones's life.

The New-York Conference began its annual session in the First Methodist Episcopal Church, Yonkers, yesterday morning. Bishop Fitzgerald presided. The Rev. C.W.

LONDON, April 1. -- It is reported here that a prominent Italian has warned Americans against the danger of touring in Italy this year, in view of the excitement and feeling caused in that country by the New-Orleans affair and Baron Fava's recall. 
--------
374-> FASSETT SHOWS HIS HAND.; CHANGES TO BE MADE IN THE CUSTOM HOUSE AT PLATT'S BEHEST.
Collector Fassett was at the Custom House yesterday for the first time since Tuesday. Soon after his arrival in the morning he called several of the heads of divisions into his private room, one at a time, and a messenger locked the door so that nobody could disturb the conference. Just what was said at these conferences none of those present would say. 
--------
375-> REGATTA OFF ONTARIO BEACH.; KATIE GRAY, MAUD E., AND THE VREDA WINNERS IN THEIR CLASSES.
ROCHESTER, N.Y., July 20. -- The annual regatta of the Lake Yacht Association took place to-day off Ontario Beach. The first-class start was as follows: Vreda, Onward. The Oriole was in this class, but did not start. The Onward had scarcely crossed the line and was getting under sail when her topmast was carried away. She was undaunted, however, and bravely kept on her way. 
--------
376-> BOSTON UNIVERSITY.
BOSTON, Dec. 19. -- The fifth annual catalogue of the Boston University and Tufts College Co-operative Supply Company has been recently issued by H.J. Bickford of the Law School. This contains a list of over sixty of the leading Boston tradesmen, who offer discounts from 5 per cent. to 40 per cent. to students holding tickets. Each student in the university has a ticket free of charge instead of having to buy one, as formerly. 
--------
377-> FRANCE AND THE CHURCH.
France has traversed a long and varied way since GAMBETTA electrified the party he was to lead to victory with the cry. "Clericalism -- that is the enemy." He would be the first to acknowledge to-day that though clericalism -- which by no means is the same as Catholicism -- is not subdued, it is no longer the chief enemy of the republic or even of the Republicans. 
--------
378-> TEACHERS WATCHED BY SPIES.; FEMALE EMPLOYES IN ST. LOUIS FOLLOWED BY DETECTIVES.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 20. -- A sensation of no small proportions has been caused by the report, and confirmation thereof, that the teachers in the public schools have been subjected to a system of espionage. There are 1,200 female teachers in the public schools, and concerning some of them reports of improper conduct have reached the board. 
--------
379-> THE HANOVER CLUB'S HOME.; FESTIVITIES AT THE OPENING OF ITS NEW CLUBHOUSE.
The recently-formed Hanover Club of Brooklyn celebrated the opening of its new clubhouse on Bedford Avenue and Rodney Street last night. The new clubhouse, formerly the Hawley mansion, is a substantial building of brick trimmed with brownstone. It was bought for $27,500 and is excellently adapted to club purposes. An extension has been constructed in which the billiard room and main reception room are situated. 
--------
380-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
Some light is thrown on the needlessly aggressive speech and behavior of the Italian Minister by our dispatches from Rome. The Government has just succeeded in carrying through the Chamber of Deputies a bill extending the age of liability to military service from thirty-nine to forty-two, or three years. 
--------
381-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The present squabble in Samoa seems to differ from former "political crises" in that island in not having been instigated by foreigners. The American, German, and British Consuls have united in a proclamation sustaining the monarch de facto, and that is the best evidence we can have that he is also a monarch de jure. 
--------
382-> ALLIANCE CONVENTIONS.; IMPORTANT ACTION IN VIRGINIA AND GEORGIA.
RICHMOND, Va., Aug. 20. -- The most important action to-day of the Farmers' Alliance State Convention was the indorsement by that body of the whole Ocala platform. They not only indorsed it in its entirety, but added: "And we further demand of our Representatives in Congress that if they cannot agree to these demands (Sub-Treasury bill and all) that they give us something better or as good." 
--------
383-> SEEN THROUGH LENSES.; EXHIBITION OF THE NEW-YORK MICROSCOPICAL SOCIETY.
Several hundred ladies and gentlemen derived pleasure and instruction from the twelfth annual reception of the New-York Microscopical Society in the American Museum of Natural History Friday night. There was a great variety of exhibits attractively arranged, and several officers and members of the society were present to explain the instruments and exhibits to the visitors. 
--------
384-> NEW-YORK AND THE CUSTOM HOUSE.
The words "New-York" attached to the Custom House at this port seem to have a purely geographical meaning for the politicians at Washington into whose hands the administration of Federal affairs has fallen. It is known to them that the Custom House is situated in the City of New-York, and that imports on which duties are fixed and collected in the Custom House are necessarily imports into New-York. 
--------
385-> TWO NEW SOUND STEAMERS.; THE NEW-HAMPSHIRE TO BE LAUNCHED NEXT MONTH.
WILMINGTON, Del., Dec. 19. -- The steamer New-Hampshire, which the Harlan  Hollingsworth Company is building for the Providence and Stonington Steamship Company, is now ready for launching, but, her machinery not being completed, the launch will not take place until the middle of January. Meanwhile, the interior work of the steamer will be rapidly pushed forward. 
--------
386-> THE FILLY VAUCLUSE SOLD.
CHICAGO, July 6. -- The crack filly Vaucluse, two years old, by Vauxhall, dam Jessie Hatcher, a stake and purse winner as well on the Western circuit this season, has been sold to Henry McDaniels, the well-known young trainer, for $2,000, by Joseph Desha of Cynthiana, Ky. 
--------
387-> ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT; UNSOLDIERLY BEARING OF THE MEN IN CAMP. THE SEVENTY-FIRST SERIOUSLY THINKING OF CHANGING ITS UNIFORM -- ONE OF THREE GUARD RUNNERS CAPTURED AND PUNISHED.
PEEKSKILL, N.Y., July 6. -- "What's a battery, boys?" asked a member of the Provisional Battalion of his companions on guard duty this morning. But even if that question were typical of the military knowledge of the country members of the National Guard, which it is not, it could be readily pardoned in consideration of other and more important qualities that the militiamen of these separate companies possess. 
--------
388-> PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATS.; THEY FEEL ENCOURAGED OVER PROSPECTS OF SUCCESS.
WASHINGTON, July 6. -- The leading Democrats of Pennsylvania are to hold a conference in Philadelphia July 10 to arrange a plan of campaign for this Fall. Ex-Representative Maish of Pennsylvania, who has been here a day or two, says that the trend of public sentiment throughout the State is such as to make it entirely probable that Quayism may receive another stinging rebuke. 
--------
389-> THE "BARON OF THE COLORADOS."; HE CLAIMS A GREAT TRACT OF LAND IN ARIZONA.
ST. LOUIS, July 6. -- The Peralta-Reavis land claim comes to the front with the regularity of Biela's comet, but more frequently. A few days ago it was telegraphed from New-York that Mr. J. Addison Peralta-Reavis would press his big suit and that Mr. Collis P. Huntington was one of his backers. Several prominent New-York lawyers were also mentioned as being "behind" the enterprise. 
--------
390-> WHO IS THE CITY TREASURER?; THE CASE BEFORE THE PENNSYLVANIA COURTS FOR DECISION.
PHILADELPHIA, June 2. -- The quo warran to proceedings of the Commonwealth against Richard G. Oellers, the present incumbent of the office of City Treasurer of Philadelphia, were begun here to-day before Judges Arnold and Wilson in the Court of Common Pleas. By agreement of counsel on each side the case was submitted without argument, and a pro forma decree entered by the court declaring Mr. Oellers to have been duly elected City Treasurer. 
--------
391-> HOW IT LEFT PISA.
Such biographical notices of Langfranchi as have been printed, though correct in the main, are wanting in details. In his naturalization papers taken out in New-York, 1893, he declared that he was born in Pisa, Italy, and was twenty-nine years old. Americans, prone to give foreigners nicknames, had dubbed him "Lanky Franky," supposably on account of his Quixotic mien. 
--------
392-> MR. RAUM COMPLAINS.; HE SEES NO REASON WHY THE PUBLIC SHOULD WORRY ABOUT HIM.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. -- Commissioner Raum talks about the public discussion of his forthcoming departure from the Pension Office as if it was none of the business of the public, and in language like that which made the name of a distinguished New-York railroad magnate famous a few years ago. He says: 
--------
393-> THE GRAND LODGE MEETS; GRAND MASTER VROOMAN REVIEWS THE YEAR'S EVENTS. INCREASE IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE MASONIC BODIES OF THE STATE -- THE ORDER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION -- RECOMMENDATIONS.
The one hundred and tenth annual communication of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the State of New-York was opened in Masonic Hall, Twenty-third Street and Sixth Avenue, yesterday afternoon by Grand Master John W. Vrooman with the usual impressive ceremonies. There was an unusually large attendance, 704 lodges being represented, and the large ball was filled when the Senior Grand Beacon. 
--------
394-> MAKING CITIZENS.
THE TIMES has often pointed out that the admission to citizenship of improper persons in large numbers is not the fault of the naturalization laws, but of the failure of the courts to enforce those laws. This truth is now receiving in this city an exemplification that is very discreditable to our courts, and that would horrify us if we were not unfortunately hardened by previous exhibitions of the same character. 
--------
395-> A NATURAL-GAS EXPLOSION.; FIVE PERSONS INJURED AND ONE WILL PROBABLY DIE.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Oct. 20. -- An explosion of natural gas in the cellar of the building occupied by George W. Snaman, carpet dealer, 133 Federal Street, Allegheny, at 11 o'clock this morning, badly damaged the building and dangerously injured five persons. The building took fire, as did several frame buildings in the rear. 
--------
396-> INDICTED FOR BRIBERY.; A SWEEPING INVESTIGATION OF THE OFFICIALS OF SCRANTON.
SCRANTON, Penn., June 2. -- No recent occurrence in Scranton has caused such intense excitement as the presentment of the Grand Jury of Lackawanna County in court to-day indicting the three members of the Common Council of this city on charges of bribery and corrupt solicitations. 
--------
397-> FIGHTING FOR THE PULPIT.; HELD FOR THE GRAND JURY FOR DISTURBING A RELIGIOUS MEETING.
POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., June 2. -- One Sunday evening four or five weeks ago the Rev. J.H. Boyce, then the alleged pastor of the Baptist church at Madalin, in the town of Red Hook, Dutchess County, had a fight in his own pulpit with some of the Trustees of the church for the possession of it. The Trustees believed he had no right there, and he was ejected. 
--------
398-> THE YANTIC'S DESTINATION.; BELIEVED THAT SHE WILL BE SENT TO BEHRING SEA.
Much curiosity was manifested in naval circles yesterday concerning the department's intention regarding the United States steamer Yantic, now at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This vessel was detached from Rear Admiral Gherardi's squadron last Summer, and since then has been undergoing extensive repairs and alterations necessary to fit the vessel for service as an apprentice training ship. 
--------
399-> EIGHT ACRES OF FLAMES; A MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRE IN LONG ISLAND CITY. MILLIONS OF FEET OF LUMBER DESTROYED -- THE YARDS OF W.R. GRACE & CO. AND E.W. M'CLAVE & CO. IN RUINS -- THE LOSS ESTIMATED AT $750,000.
A fire broke out in the Doncaster Iron Foundry, West Avenue and Flushing Street, Long Island City, at 10:40 o'clock last night, which is supposed to have been caused by a spark from a casting which had been made just before the shop closed. It must have smoldered for some hours, but when it appeared it blazed so fiercely that the whole place was totally destroyed in a few minutes. 
--------
400-> ONE SPEECH THREE TIMES; A BUSY EVENING FOR MR. PLATT'S CANDIDATE. ATTACKS ON TAMMANY A FEATURE OF HIS ADDRESS -- MR. FASSETT KEEPS HIS COAT ON IN SPITE OF INVITATIONS TO TAKE IT OFF.
J. Sloat Fassett made one speech three times night in small halls to mixed audiences of men, women, and children. The burden of this discourse was the cleanliness of the streets in the City of Berlin. There was a long array of figures quoted glibly about the tax rates, which Mr. Fassett insists have been increased by "the striped abomination of Fourteenth Street." 
--------
401-> BEWARE OF BURGLARS.; How Houses are Protected During the Owner's Absence -- The Mutual District Messenger Co.'s Unrivaled Service.
It is certain that if the absolute security to householders against the raid of burglars which modern invention now affords was more widely known, there are none, especially among those preparing to leave town for the Summer, who would not gladly avail themselves of it. This protection is secured to them, and at moderate cost, by the Mutual District Messenger Company, 458 Broadway. 
--------
402-> THREE GAMBLERS LYNCHED.; SUMMARY VENGEANCE FOR THE MURDER OF A COMRADE.
NEW-ORLEANS, June 2. -- The meagre details of the shooting and killing of a negro man and the lynching of three men connected with the murder by a mob on the Grand Bay plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish, near Hermitage, has reached this city through passengers arriving from Bayou Sara. 
--------
403-> FAILURES IN BUSINESS.
Cornwall Brothers of Louisville, Ky., soap manufacturers, made an assignment last night. A statement of the liabilities cannot be obtained to-night but they are estimated at $500,000. William Cornwall, Sr., William Cornwall, Jr., and Aaron Cornwall each made an individual assignment, which were precipitated by the filing of several suits against them by local banks. 
--------
404-> HARVARD-YALE BOAT RACE.; IT IS NOT YET SETTLED WHETHER IT WILL COME OFF AT NEW-LONDON.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 3. -- Representatives of the Harvard and Yale Boat Clubs met the representatives of the New-London Board of Trade at the Crocker House, New-London, yesterday, and drew up a set of stipulations under which these colleges agree to row on the Thames course for five years more. 
--------
405-> ALMY SENTENCED TO DIE.; CHRISTIE WARDEN'S MURDERER TO BE HANGED IN DECEMBER, 1891.
PLYMOUTH, N.H., Nov. 19. -- When the Court House doors were opened this morning the waiting crowd came in with a rush, packing the building to suffocation. Almy came into court wearing a haggard look, but he appeared unconcerned and took his accustomed place. The court was called to order quickly, and Counsel Burleigh began his argument for the defense. He admitted murder, but only in the second degree. 
--------
406-> THE DREIBUND'S ADVICE; ENGLAND'S POSITION IN THE DARDANELLES INCIDENT. THE CONFERENCES BETWEEN VON CAPRIVI AND KALNOKY -- THE PLAN TO RESTORE THE POPE'S TEMPORAL POWER -- FRANCE AND THE KAISER.
BERLIN, Sept. 5. -- The conferences between Chancellor von Caprivi and Count Kalnoky, the Austrian Prime Minister, at the Maires Schloss, near Schwartzenau, have ended in their advising the English Government not to be in a hurry to take any diplomatic action in connection with the Dardanelles incident. The tone of the official press here indicates distinctly that the Government is averse to joining England in any hasty remonstrance against the Porte's agreement with Russia. 
--------
407-> GELBITE IN ACTUAL WAR.; AN AMERICAN SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY CHILEAN INSURGENTS.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 5. -- In the press dispatches from Chile it has been stated that the insurgent party used smokeless powder in their small arms, and much has been written about the great range of their guns and the penetration of their bullets. As they used the Mannlicher rifie it has been taken for granted by many army and navy officers that they used the German smokeless powder. 
--------
408-> BLAINE WILL BE THERE.; REPUBLICAN CLUBS ASK TO MEET HIM IN CINCINNATI.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 3. -- Gen. Russell A. Alger passed through Birmingham Saturday last, and it was given out that the was on his way to Florida. He was met at the station here by Col. Noble A. Smithson, a leading Republican, by special appointment, and they had a long conference. 
--------
409-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
There is nothing about the Union Pacific Company to-day which has not been known for months to the few. There is a great deal more known about it to the many. Therein consists largely the difference in the speculative position of the stock; and it may be added, of the bonds also. The market the past week has hinged considerably on the movements of Union Pacific. 
--------
410-> TSUDA SANZO'S OFFENSE; THE TRIAL OF THE CZAROWITCH'S ASSAILANT. JAPANESE AUTHORITIES UNABLE TO FIND ANYTHING IN THEIR CODE COVERING SUCH A CASE -- THE RUSSIAN PRINCE'S GRATITUDE.
YOKOHAMA, Japan, May 25. -- The difficulty in the trial of Tsuda Sanzo, the Japanese police constable who wounded the Czarowitch, is that no article in the Penal Code of Japan removes his crime from the category of an ordinary murderous assault. The one hundred and sixteenth article of the code says: 
--------
411-> VON DER AHE'S SCHEME FAILS.
ST. LOUIS, March 3. -- A new phase was added to the baseball war to-day when the President of the St. Louis Club tried to have Mark Baldwin arrested. Mr. Von Der Ahe, his attorney Walter McEntire, his Secretary George Munson, and Al Spink called upon Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Thomas Estep to swear out a warrant, charging conspiracy against Mark Baldwin, manager of the Pittsburg Baseball Club. 
--------
412-> TRULY A SAD REMINDER.
The New-York Sun recently published from Belford's Monthly a three-column eulogy of Isaac Pusey Gray, ex-Governor of Indiana, by John A. Holman. It advises its patrons to road it and says: 
--------
413-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The verdict against the Government in the Philadelphia hat trimming case, if it should be finally sustained, will be a pretty serious matter, as a good many million dollars may be recovered for duties paid under the ruling of the Treasury Department in excess of the legal rate. These rulings, which raise the rates of duty and are afterward upset, have two serious drawbacks. 
--------
414-> AMUSEMENTS.; THE ACTORS' FUND BENEFIT.
A large sum of money, almost $2,500, was added to the treasury of the Actors' Fund, through the medium of the benefit performance at Palmer's Theatre yesterday afternoon. This is the important point for the Fund, which naturally looks principally to the financial results of the entertainment. To the large audience in attendance, the artistic result was of more importance, and that was of a nature to amply repay every person who attended the performance. 
--------
415-> EDITOR DANA ANALYZED.; HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS DESCRIBED BY AN ORGAN OF THE ALLIANCE.
ATLANTA, Ga., April 1. -- The Southern Alliance Farmer, official organ of the State Alliance, is bitter in its denunciation of Charles A. Dana of the New-York Sun, who "jumped" on the Alliance in a recently-published interview. Editorially the Farmer, in its issue of yesterday, says: 
--------
416-> AFFAIRS ABOUT RAILROADS; TRYING TO STIFLE OPPOSITION TO THE NEW ASSOCIATION. PRESIDENTS JAY GOULD, PERKINS, AND HUGHITT WILL ENDEAVOR TO PERSUADE MR. STICKNEY AND THE CHICAGO AND ALTON PEOPLE.
Two or three private dispatches were received in Wall Street from Chicago yesterday saying that the Chicago and Alton Railroad and the Chicago, St. Paul and Kansas City Railroad had abandoned their attitude of hostility to the new Western Traffic Association and would probably join the organization. Such dispatches were commonly regarded as expressing more of hope than of fact. 
--------
417-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
Senator QUAY is said to have abandoned his purpose to resign his place in the Senate and seek some more "vindication" at the hands of the Legislature of Pennsylvania. The exposure of his little scheme in our Harrisburg dispatches has disturbed his plans, and there seems to be some doubt whether the "pipe" he had laid so carefully would be found in working order. 
--------
418-> A WORLD-WIDE SCANDAL; NEWSPAPER COMMENTS ON THE NEW-YORK LIFE AFFAIR. HOW THE REPLY OF THE COMPANY TO THE BANTA CHARGES IS VIEWED BY A WELL-KNOWN FRENCH INSURANCE JOURNAL -- MUCH TI THE POINT.
Newspapers, letters, and reports from all parts of the world indicate the profound impression produced by THE TIMES'S exposures of the management of the New-York Life Insurance Company. The excitement is not confined to any special locality. From the Atlantic to the Pacific in this country, in Mexico, Central and South America, the West Indies, Canada, and Europe, the press literally teems with the New-York Life scandals. 
--------
419-> Article 4 -- No Title
SANTIAGO, Nov. 6. -- The newspapers here have for several days been publishing wild stories about a conspiracy, formed among the refugees at the American Legation, to kill Gen. Canto. 
--------
420-> PICTURES IN AUTUMN DAYS; AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS HAVE HAD PLENTY OF WORK. THE FINE WEATHER HAS ENABLED THEM TO USE THEIR CAMERAS TO GREAT ADVANTAGE -- SOME NOTES OF INTEREST FOR THE CRAFT.
Amateur photographers have awakened to the fact that the Autumn days this year have been most excellent for photographing purposes, and they have lately been taking advantage of the fine weather. Until the cold spell of Thursday, for many days there has been a good chance for them to get out in the woods and take pictures. 
--------
421-> A BIG FIRM EMBARRASSED.
MONTREAL, Jan. 19. -- The wholesale dry goods firm of McLachlan Brothers is financially embarrassed, and if it goes into liquidation the amount involved will be between $600,000 and $700,000. It is by no means certain that the firm will be obliged to take this extreme step, but if it does the assets are so considerable that the creditors will be well covered. 
--------
422-> A PRETTY WEDDING IN BOSTON.; MISS GERTRUDE CHASE MARRIED TO HARCOURT AMORY.
BOSTON, April 18. -- Harcourt Amory, the treasurer of the Lancaster Mills, and Miss Gertrude, daughter of George B. Chase of Beacon Street, were married to-day in Emmanuel Church.

--------
423-> HARVARD'S RAPID GROWTH; INTERESTING FIGURES FROM THE FORTHCOMING CATALOGUE. OVER THREE THOUSAND STUDENTS RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE UNIVERSITY -- NEWS AND GOSSIP FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 19. -- The annual catalogue of Harvard University for 1891-2, which is soon to be issued, will clearly set forth the wonderfully rapid growth of the university during the last year. In this period Harvard has risen to the leading educational institution in point of numbers, a position which her friends believe she has long held in intellectual attainments. 
--------
424-> BIG AND LITTLE AUTOCRATS; ESTABLISHED BY ABBETT ALL OVER NEW-JERSEY. BUT THE FIGHT AGAINST BOSSISM IN NEWARK IS FINDING IMITATORS ELSEWHERE AND THE GOVERNOR IS STEADILY LOSING HIS GRIP.
TRENTON, N.J., Sept. 20. -- The spirit of the citizens of Newark is beginning to assert itself all over the State. The local struggle against the oppression of the bosses brings into bolder relief the iron-bound autocracy Gov. Abbett has established all over his empire. What Boss James Smith, Jr., is to Newark the Governor is to the Commonwealth. The imperialism which one applies to local affairs the other applies to State affairs. 
--------
425-> AMERICANS IN PARIS.; CONDENSED CABLEGRAMS.
PARIS, July 20. -- Mr. and Mrs. P.D. Armour of Chicago arrived here to-day from Carisbad. 
--------
426-> THE SAENGERFEST ENDED.; BROUGHT TO A CLOSE WITH A PARADE AND PRESENTATION OF PRIZES.
NEWARK, July 7. -- The great national Saengerfest closed this evening. The day began with a street parade, but the awarding of the prizes in the afternoon was the chief attraction. Major Carl Lenz was the spokesman of the judges, and a bevy of young ladies in white graced the platform from which he made the announcement to the thousands of listeners gathered on the floor of the pavilion. 
--------
427-> TREZZA MUST DIE.; THE COURT OF APPEALS PASSES FINALLY ON HIS CASE.
ALBANY, N.Y., Oct. 20. -- In the Court of Appeals to-day the order affirming the order of Justice Pratt, refusing a stay of proceedings in the case of the People, respondents, vs. Nicola Trezza, appellant, was affirmed. This was an appeal from an order of the General Term, Second Department, affirming an order denying a motion of a stay of proceedings. 
--------
428-> POLITICS IN KINGS COUNTY.; REPUBLICANS JOINING THE DEMOCRATIC RANKS -- BIRKETT ON THE WARPATH.
The Rev. Dr. Edward P. Ingersoll is the latest Republican to follow the Rev. Dr. Cuylor into the Democratic camp in Brooklyn. The disgust among Republicans at the ridiculously weak tickets handed out to them by the order of "Boss" Platt is growing every day, and gentlemen who have been and are still Republicans on national issues are coming out for Boody and Kenna. 
--------
429-> DIED OF LEPROSY.; A VICTIM OF THE DREAD DISEASE IN JACKSONVILLE.
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., June 2. -- Jack Simmons, a colored longshoreman, died yesterday of that fearful plague, leprosy. He was a native of Jamaica, and came here four years ago and married a daughter of a colored drayman. They separated a year ago, and the woman is quite healthy and living here. 
--------
430-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Whatever may be the soundness of Attorney General MILLER'S opinion that silver certificates may lawfully be issued for the difference between the bullion value and the coinage value of the silver bullion bought under the act of 1890, we hope that nothing of the kind will be done. It would be a petty and shameful trick. 
--------
431-> Article 11 -- No Title
HOW TO REVIEW SHELLEY'S "SKYLARK." -- If Shelley were unknown, were alive, and were to publish his "Skylark" to-day, one can well imagine how it would be reviewed. 
--------
432-> A SPIRIT OF DISCONTENT.; CAUSES THAT LED TO A FEELING OF REPUBLICANISM IN PORTUGAL.
LISBON, Jan. 31. -- News of the revolt in Oporto of a portion of the garrison of that place caused no uprising here. The city remained perfectly quiet. The mutiny is said to be the result of a movement in favor of the establishment of a republican form of government in Portugal. 
--------
433-> GOSSIP FROM KINGS COUNTY; MR. COOMBS'S TARIFF BILL ATTRACTING MUCH ATTENTION. THE BARTHMAN SCANDAL GROWS WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER -- BLAINE'S FRIENDS MOVING TO CONTROL PRIMARIES -- JOHN Y. M'KANE'S SCHEME.
The tariff bill prepared by Congressman William J. Coombs, and given to the public through the columns of THE TIMES, has certainly done one thing it was intended to do -- it has given the Democrats something to talk about. The politicians have been discussing it constantly, and they say it seems to be, in its main idea, just what they want -- a scheme that is simple and can be easily explained. 
--------
434-> A WASHINGTON VIEW.; REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL PREFERENCE TO GOVERN THE SELECTION.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. -- On Monday next the Republican National Committee will meet at the Arlington Hotel in this city, to name a time and place for holding the next National Convention, and to issue the necessary call. 
--------
435-> THE FLUE HAD COLLAPSED.; MATE CABLE TELLS THE STORY OF THE EXPLOSION ON THE ANNIE ROBERTS.
PITTSBURG, Jan. 4. -- Carlton Cable, mate of the Pittsburg steamer Annie Roberts, on which five men were killed and mangled by an explosion at Portsmouth, Ohio, on Friday returned to the city yesterday and gave an account of the affair.

--------
436-> THE DAVIS WILL CONTESTS.; INDICATIONS THAT FORGERY IS TO BE MADE AN ISSUE.
BUTTE, Mon., Jan 4. -- The District Court will to-morrow consider an application for the appointment of Commissioners to take the testimony of twenty-two witnesses residing at Eldon, Iowa, in the interest of Henry A. Root of New-York and others, who claim a large share of the $10,000,000 left by the late Judge Andrew J. Davis. 
--------
437-> AMUSEMENTS.
The third appearance at the Lyceum concerts of Campanini was the most striking feature, perhaps, of the concert last night. His selections were such as to show that he is by no means confined to Italian music, and that his perfect vocal culture is available for music of which the characteristic is dramatic expression as well as for that which aims only at melodious sweetness. 
--------
438-> RACES IN MUD AND RAIN; A TAME DAY'S SPORT AT THE SHEEPSHEAD BAY TRACK. KINGSTON, HA'PENNY, WALCOTT, SOHO, KINGMAKERS AND RACELAND WON THE RACES, AND BERGEN RODE THREE OF THE WINNERS.
It was hard work to get up any enthusiasm over the races at the Sheepshead Bay track yesterday. The weather was all against it -- chilly, damp, and penetrating. Showers fell at intervals, and the track was so heavy that a number of entries were scratched. As there were good fields in four of the six races, there was a lively bit of speculation on these. 
--------
439-> HILL'S POSSIBLE ACTION; SAID TO INTEND TO NOMINATE A NEW HEALTH OFFICER. A ROUNDABOUT SCHEME TO REWARD THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS FOR THEIR PART IN THE PIERCE BARGAIN -- WILL HE CARRY IT OUT?
The information that Gov. Hill would to-day send the name of Dr. Seneca D. Powell to the Senate for confirmation as Health Officer of this port, to succeed Health Officer Smith, was furnished last night by a man who is usually well posted on important political moves. 
--------
440-> OUR NAVAL ORDNANCE.
One of the gratifying proofs of the progress of naval Construction in this country is that, although many more shipyards are now building war vessels for the Government than were so employed a few years ago, the guns are ready for them in good season. The Washington factory turns out their batteries promptly and methodically, with its enlarged experience. 
--------
441-> TWELVE INNINGS PLAYED; A VERY CLOSE GAME BETWEEN NEW-YORK AND PITTSBURG. THE GIANTS, HOWEVER, MADE ONE OF THEIR CHARACTERISTIC DASHES AND SETTLED THE CONTEST -- BOSTON AND BROOKLYN VICTORIOUS.
New-York gained slightly on Chicago yesterday. Anson's men were beaten in Boston and the Giants won on the Polo Grounds. The latter contest was a close and interesting one. For eleven innings the result was in doubt, but in the twelfth the Giants made one of their characteristic dashes, scored three times, and won. 
--------
442-> THE THEATRICAL WEEK; " LA DAME DE CHALLANT" AND THE ACTING OF BERNHARDT. MISS REHAN MAY BE SEEN THIS WEEK AS LADY TEAZLE AND VERA, THE RUSSIAN WOMAN -- ARMINIUS AND THE LOST LEGIONS AT THE THALIA.
By all means see Sarah Bernhardt as la Comtesse de Challant. No person who values the art of acting, who is capable of feeling the emotional thrill that great acting engenders, should miss that memorable performance. Go to mediaeval Italy by way of the Standard Theatre and see the romance and intrigue of that era illumined by genius. 
--------

Seven years of honest operatic art ended yesterday. The record of those years is one of which any city may well be proud. It is one of which any body of stockholders in an opera house ought to be proud. That our stockholders are not burdened with a sense of its glory may be inferred from their readiness to cut it short because the general public refused to approve their novelties. 
--------
520-> GOV. HILL'S FEEBLE PLEA.
Having committed the blunder of refusing to recognize BULKELEY as "the Executive" of the State of Connecticut in the case of the requisition for the burglar FARDON, after having previously recognized him in making requisitions for fugitives from justice in Connecticut, Gov. HILL could not honor the requisition for the horse thief COLBERT without putting himself in a ridiculous plight. 
--------
521-> INDIAN RESERVATION COURTS.
The Indian Appropriation bill has among its provisions an item for the so-called "Courts of Indian Offenses." The Judges in these tribunals are Indians exclusively, and in some cases there are other court officers who also are Indians. It may surprise many people to learn that these courts are in operation at nearly thirty agencies and that there are nearly one hundred Indian Judges regularly employed. 
--------
522-> TANNHAUSER IN BAIREUTH; THE PERFORMANCE NOT UP TO EXPECTATIONS. A BRILLIANT SCENIC DISPLAY, BUT OTHERWISE NO BETTER THAN SEEN IN NEW-YORK -- THE FESTIVAL TO BE HELD ANNUALLY HEREAFTER.
BAIREUTH, Bavaria, July 22. -- To many Baireuth pilgrims the chief interest of this year's festival has centred in "Tannhauser," (Paris version,) as this is the first one of Wagner's four operas, ("Rienzi," "Dutchmann," Tannhauser," and Lohengrin,") as distinguished from his seven music dramas, (the Nibelung Tetralogy, "Tristan," "Meistersinger," Parsifal,") that has been sung at Baireuth. 
--------
523-> MR. M'CLAVE WAS PERTURBED.; HIS BROTHER COMMISSIONERS POKED FUN AT HIM YESTERDAY.
Commissioner of Police John McClave takes the poolroom exposures in THE TIMES as a personal matter, and yesterday he plainly showed that his Tammany skin was pierced. When approached by a TIMES reporter for a bit of information, he said bitterly: "Say anything for THE TIMES? No, Sir! THE TIMES has treated me disrespectfully, and it will get no information from me." The troubled chieftain turned on his heel and hurried into his room: 
--------
524-> PRICES TO FOREIGN BUYERS.
We hope our high-tariff friends will not overlook a letter written by Mr. A.B. FARQUHAR and read by Col. McCLURE of Philadelphia at Kennett Square, Penn., on the 2d inst., in the course of a debate concerning tariff duties. Mr. FARQUHAR is the Chairman of the A.B. Farquhar Company, Limited, whose great factories are at York, Penn. -- one of the largest corporations engaged in manufacturing agricultural implements. 
--------
525-> ON THE CINDER PATH.; CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES OF THE LONG ISLAND AMATEUR LEAGUE.
The first championship games of the Long Island Amateur League were not very successful. Only a few hundred spectators were present, and the events, as a rule, were poorly contested. 
--------

SARATOGA, July 22. -- The Summer meeting of the Saratoga Racing Association begins to-morrow with a good card and a good lot of horses, the Western and Eastern horses meeting here for the first time to-morrow. Racing will begin at 11 o'clock as usual. The entries and weights for the several races are as follows: 
--------
527-> CASES EASILY MADE OUT.; NO TROUBLE TO GET EVIDENCE AGAINST POOLROOMS.
At the Tombs Police Court yesterday afternoon Anthony Comstock proved that it was very easy to make out a case against the pool-sellers if it was necessary to do so. He had three of the men who are under protection up there, and Police Justice Taintor held all of them for trial in the Special Sessions under $500 bail. 
--------
528-> NO STANDARD OIL MAN WANTED; TOLEDO CITIZENS PROTEST AGAINST JUDGE DOYLE'S APPOINTMENT.
TOLEDO, Ohio, March 5. -- There is great indignation expressed here on account of a petition, now being circulated by those interested in the advancement of the Standard Oil Company, asking the President to appoint Judge John H. Doyle to the position of United States Circuit Judge under the act recently passed by Congress. There is a strong probability of his appointment. 
--------
529-> BERGEN AND CALDWELL.; THE STARTER'S ACTION IN SUSPENDING THE JOCKEY APPROVED.
The Board of Control yesterday gave a hearing to the parties interested in the Caldwell-Bergen squabble, and at the conclusion of the hearing sent out this as the outcome of the investigation: 
--------
530-> WILL SUPPORT MR. FLOWER; BUT THE COUNTIES PROTEST AGAINST THEIR TREATMENT. MEETING OF THE SARATOGA DELEGATES AND ALTERNATES -- THE WHOLE QUESTION REFERRED TO THE COUNTY COMMITTEE.
The delegates and alternates who were sent to Saratoga by the County Democracy, and who were denied seats in the convention, met last night in the small meeting room of the Cooper Institute. No action was taken regarding the Democratic State ticket, but that the rank and file of the Counties will support it is the only impression that can be gained by talks with representative men in the organization. 
--------
531-> SWARTHMORE COLLEGE.
SWARTHMORE, Penn., Nov. 7. -- A scheme is on foot to establish a conservatory of plants, to be used in conjunction with the botanical department. Instructor Gifford has the matter in hand. The building will contain a separate apartment for tropical plants, a good assortment of which will be procured. 
--------
532-> AN ARTIST'S WIND.; IT BLOWS IN ABOUT SEVENTEEN DIRECTIONS AT ONE TIME.
Almost every one has heard the story of the painter who undertook to make a perfect reproduction of a full-rigged ship, and to accomplish his purpose invited criticism from seafaring folk. Every error they detected was rectified until finally the picture was considered perfect, and a reward was offered for any one who could find any fault in it. 
--------
533-> THE CONNECTICUT STRUGGLE.; SENATOR PLATT RE-ELECTED -- A HOT DEBATE IN THE UPPER HOUSE.
HARTFORD, Conn., Jan. 21. -- Senator Orville H. Platt was re-elected for his third term in the United States Senate at the joint assembly of the Legislature here to-day, the vote being a strictly party one. Ex-Congressman Carlos French received the votes of all the Democratic members, the figures being 141 votes for Platt and 134 for French. 
--------
534-> JERSEY JUSTICE DEBASED; DRAGGED IN THE MIRE OF PARTISAN POLITICS. THE ACQUITTAL OF RACE-COURSE THOMPSON THE LATEST SCANDAL OF THE ABBETT ADMINISTRATION -- HONEST CITIZENS DISGUSTED.
TRENTON, N.J., Dec. 20. -- The recent acquittal of "Billy" Thompson, the boss of the disgraceful year-round race course at Gloucester City, has focused public attention upon judicial methods in Camden County, and for the last week or ten days the papers of the State have teemed with editorial reflections upon the questionable basis on which justice is administered there. 
--------
535-> SENATOR DAWES'S VIEWS; WHAT HE HAS TO SAY IN REGARD TO THE INDIAN PROBLEM. MORE WHITE THAN RED MEN IN PARTS OF THE TERRITORY -- INDIAN AFFAIRS SHOULD REMAIN UNDER THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts was at the Murray Hill Hotel yesterday. He is Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, and for ten of the thirty-four years he has served in the two branches of Congress he has been a member of that committee. He has visited many of the reservations, and is acquainted with many of the chiefs and head men of the tribes. 
--------
536-> NOTABLE SURGICAL OPERATION.; BONE FROM CHICKENS INGRAFTED ON A MAN'S LEG.
SPRINGFIELD, Ill., April 20. -- In the Wabash Railroad Company's hospital here is a case of bona fide bone grafting, the human limb being supported and strengthened by bone taken from a live chicken. John Dougherty, a section hand, while working in the Chicago yards June 14, 1890, received a slight injury to his left shinbone by scraping the skin off while placing a piece of timber on the ground. 
--------
537-> THE TROUBLESOME ITATA; FEARS THAT THE PURSUIT AND CAPTURE WERE AN ERROR. A FEELING IN WASHINGTON THAT THE VESSEL CANNOT BE HELD -- ALLOWED TO PAY $500 FOR HER VIOLATION OF OUR LAWS.
WASHINGTON, July 8. -- There is a fear on the part of some of the officers of the Government that the seizure of the Itata is going to cause more trouble than was anticipated. Even those who were most anxious for the pursuit and capture have abandoned the idea that the vessel can be held. 
--------
538-> PHILOLOGISTS AT PRINCETON.; INCREASED ATTENDANCE AND GREAT INTEREST IN THE SESSIONS.
PRINCETON, N.J., July 8. -- The American Philological Association resumed its literary work this morning at 9 o'clock in University Hall.

--------
539-> AT THE NAVAL ACADEMY; RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE BOARD OF VISITORS. PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE SIX YEARS' COURSE -- SUGGESTIONS ABOUT APPOINTMENTS -- STRONG WORDS IN REGARD TO HAZING.

The scheme to improve the water route along the south side of Long Island by a canal connecting Jamaica Bay with the Great South Bay will probably now be carried to a successful issue, as the surveys recently made by the Government have shown the proposed improvement entirely feasible. 
--------
541-> RUSSIA AND EUROPE.
The European tension seems to have been very considerably relieved within the past few weeks. Just after the"Cronstadt incident" and the French manoeuvres it seemed that France was convinced that the hour for which she has been waiting twenty years had at last arrived. 
--------
542-> GEN. SCHOFIELD TO BE MARRIED.
CHICAGO, June 4. -- Announcement has been made of the approaching marriage of Gen. John M. Schofield, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Army, to Miss Georgia Kilbourne of Keokuk. The ceremony will take place June 18 at the bride's home. Over 4,000 cards will be sent out. 
--------
543-> NEW QUARTERS IN APRIL.; A COMMODIOUS HOME FOR THE NEW-YORK COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY.
The New-York College of Dentistry is soon to move from its cramped and antiquated quarters at Second Avenue and Twenty-third Street into a new building at 205 and 207 East Twenty-third Street, near Madison Avenue. For eighteen years the college has occupied the two upper floors over the De Milt Dispensary, and it has entirely outgrown the room at its disposal. 
--------
544-> ARANSAS HARBOR BUBBLE; END OF RUSSELL HARRISON'S GREAT PROJECT. A BOOM THAT WAS PRODIGIOUS WHILE IT LASTED -- FANCY PRICKS FOR "TOWN LOTS" -- NOW ACTIVITY HAS GIVEN PLACE TO QUIET.
ST. Lou s, Oct. 5. -- The St. Louis Republic will to-morrow print a history of the Aransas Harbor scheme in which Russell B. Harrison is concerned.

--------
545-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
It was a great surprise to Mr. HOAR yesterday when, on the very eve of the caucus called to arrange for the passage of the Force bill, that bill was calmly voted out of the way and the Finance bill was taken up in its place. This was the result of a suddenly-developed, but probably well-matured, coalition between the Democrats and the silver Republicans, and it was accomplished with a touch of theatrical effect. 
--------
546-> THE TROLLEY UNPOPULAR; OPPOSITION TO THE OVERHEADWIRE MOTOR IN BROOKLYN. AWAITING THE OFFICIAL DECISION OF THE STATE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS ON THE APPLICATION OF TWO BROOKLYN STREET RAILROADS.
Two important applications for permission to use the trolley electric system as a substitute for horse power on street cars are under consideration by the State Board of Railroad Commissioners. The Messrs. Rogers, Rickard, and Baker have heard a great deal of testimony for and against the trolley system, and they have promised to give their official decisions in the two cases with all due diligence. 
--------
547-> GLEASON IN A NEW ROW.; THIS TIME HE IS OPPOSED TO A BOARD OF SCHOOL TRUSTEES.
There is open war between Mayor Gleason and the School Trustees of the Fourth Ward of Long Island City. The Gleason Board of Education recently ordered that more seats be placed in the main school building in the ward. The Trustees say the school is overcrowded now, and Chairman Whitcomb told Janitor Hayes, it is alleged, to stop any one who attempted to enter the building. 
--------
548-> WASHINGTON COLORED MILITIA.; THE WHITE SOLDIERS GET TIRED OF THEIR COMPLAINTS AND CRITICISMS.
WASHINGTON, March 21. -- While the colored citizens of Washington in general, and the colored militiamen in particular, are rejoicing because the order to disband the two colored battalions of the District National Guard has been rescinded, it is not at all certain that the negro soldiers will find their future military life entirely satisfactory. 
--------
549-> THE MEANING OF MR. BLAINE.
There is something almost grotesque about the naivete with which some of Mr. BLAINE'S friends and admirers explain his strength with the party. "He opposed the McKinley bill," remarked one of them, the other day. "He was against the Force bill. He has never gone wild on pensions. He has large interests in the South, and believes in its regeneration. 
--------
550-> TWO PRIME MINISTERS.; LORD MELBOURNE. BY HENRY DUNCKLEY. The Prime Ministers of Queen Victoria Series. New-York: HARPER & BROTHERS. 1890. SIR ROBERT PEEL. By JUSTIN MCCARTHY. Same series. New-York: HARPER & BROTHERS. 1891.
The Prime Ministers of Queen Victoria have been nine in number. The Queen's reign has not been the very longest in English history; her grandfather sat on the throne a few years more than she has yet sat there while Henry III., for fifty-six years was paramount Lord of all the lands of the Engel folk. 
--------
551-> THE LADY GUIDE.
" It seems to me that if I had one dozen trimmed with really good lace, and another with tiny little tucks and cambric frills, that would be almost enough," said Millicent Earle. 
--------
552-> THOUSANDS HEAR THE GOSPEL.; THE LARGEST MEETINGS OF THE SEASON HELD AT OCEAN GROVE.
OCEAN GROVE, N.J., Aug. 9. -- The services here to-day were conducted by the leaders of the Interdenominational Bible Conference, of which Dr. L.W. Munhall of Philadelphia is the Director. The large number of arrivals on Saturday added to the crowds which usually attend the Sabbath services, and the attendance at the meetings was the biggest of the season. 
--------
553-> WRANGLING ABOUT MOVING.; MEETING OF ALUMNI OF THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW-YORK.
The Associate Alumni of the College of the City of New-York met last night at the college to consider the report of the committee appointed some time ago to look into the progress of the college.

--------
554-> PARNELL'S RUIN QUITE NEAR; ENGLISH TORY FRIENDS SAY HARD THINGS OF HIM. BISMARCK AND BOETTICHER'S BROTHER'S FAILURE -- INTOLERANCE IN RUSSIA -- STRANGE POSTAL DECISIONS -- AMERICAN WAR SHIPS PRAISED.
LONDON, March 21. -- If American readers, as can well be imagined, feel like complaining that they hear too much about Mr. Parnell, at least this consolation is open to them -- it will not last much longer. From the outset cool men had seen that it could only be a question of time when, in the course of his desperate and wild struggle for political existence, he would commit some fatal error. 
--------
555-> THE FAIRIES' HANDIWORK.
The fairies have been zealously working during the last few years to introduce their handiwork into every branch of the earth's trade. The semi-annual world's fair gotten up by the milliners is the best opportunity of bringing their goods to market, and they do not wait to be formally invited. Perhaps they have no Secretary of State to tell them when they have been slighted. 
--------
556-> AMUSEMENTS.
Mr. Frederick Paulding, an ambitious young actor, who always means well, and sometimes acts very well indeed, produced at the Standard Theatre last night a real old-fashioned melodrama said to have been written thirty years ago by his uncle, William Irving Paulding, but never before performed. The fashion in melodrama has not changed very much, and, on the whole, such changes as there have been have not improved it. 
--------
557-> A FEVER-STRICKEN BARK.; THE DISASTROUS VOYAGE OF THE ROYAL TAR FROM AUSTRALIA.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 7. -- The bark Royal Tar, from Australia, anchored off Quarantine yesterday morning, reporting fever and scurvy on board and the captain and first mate both dead. 
--------
558-> AT ODDS WITH MR. NOBLE.; COMMISSIONER MORGAN DANGER OF LOSING HIS PLACE.
WASHINGTON, March 21. -- Indian Commissioner Morgan seems to be in some danger of losing his place, and the report is believed here that the President has asked for his resignation. When he came up for confirmation in the Senate there was opposition to him, but with the assistance of Republicans and Democrats, who did not care much about the report that he was hostile to the Catholic missionaries, he was confirmed. 
--------
559-> PEOPLE WANT HONEST MONEY.; A PAPER BY SIMON STERNE AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY CLUB.
The ladies and gentlemen of the Nineteenth Century Club comfortably filled the Assembly Rooms of the Metropolitan Opera House last night and listened to discussion of the topic, "Modern Finance: Its Evolution and Its Vagaries." Mr. Simon Sterne road a thoughtful paper on that subject and deftly and forcefully punctured a good many bubbles. 
--------
560-> PLANNING FOR THE FALL.; OWNERS OF CITY PROPERTY THINK THEIR TURN IS COMING.
The greater part of the interest in real estate in last week's market was furnished in suburban sales at the lower end of Brooklyn, on Long Island, and on Staten Island. All of these sales were pretty well attended, and the prices realized were quite fair. A great deal of the property offered was bought by people residing near it, who evidently had their minds pretty well made up about its value. 
--------
561-> THAT WATTERSON LETTER.
Mr. Watterson has decidedly the advantage of Gov. Hill in the letter episode. Mr. Hill exhibited an unreasonable amount of temper when the communication was made public, and his denunciation of Mr. Watterson was coarse and uncalled for. It cannot fail to offend the South and the Democracy, whose champion Mr. Watterson has been before the public knew of the existence of such an individual as D.B. Hill. 
--------
562-> NEW PUBLICATIONS; WASHINGTON AFTER THE WAR. THE WRITINGS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON. Collected and edited by Worthington C. Ford. Vol. X. 1782-1785. New-York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 1891.
The tenth volume of Mr. Ford's edition of the writings of Washington brings the dates down to 1785 and sees the great man released from the responsibilities of office. The opening pages find him still at headquarters in Newburg and the last show him at Mount Vernon, rejoicing in the pleasure of living on his own acres and beneath his own rooftree. 
--------
563-> THE AUSTRIAN ELECTIONS.; SUPPLEMENTARY BALLOTS REQUIRED IN EIGHT DISTRICTS.
VIENNA, March 5. -- The Austrian elections were concluded to-day. The returns thus far received show the election of 58 German Liberals, 7 German Nationals, 28 Young Czechs, 9 Old Czechs, 4 Independent Czechs, 15 Catholic Conservatives, 13 Slavonians, 31 Poles, 8 Ruthenians, 2 Roumanians, (Anti-Semitics,) and 8 not classed in any party. Eight supplementary ballots are necessary. 
--------
564-> RAILROADS IN MEXICO.
CITY OF MEXICO, March 5, via Galveston, Texas. -- The concessionaires of the Torolobampo Railroad have deposited the forfeit required by law, and there is every probability that this road soon be built, as the Government is very anxious to have the line completed and has granted it liberal concesions. 
--------
565-> AUTUMN HINTS ON DRESS; FURS OF COSTLY SORTS ON GOWNS AND WRAPS. FUR-LINED CLOAKS AND CLOAKS OF GREATER LENGTH--A RECEPTION AND A VISITING DRESS--JACKETS, SKIRTS, AND COLLARS.
PARIS, Sept. 7.--Fashion hints were never so late as now. Last Winter ran into the promise of a Summer, and we are still awaiting warm days and sunshine, with the tree boughs already in their yellow leaves, and the tedious ouvrier hard at work furnace mending and chimney cleaning. 
--------
566-> THE CORRY BANK CLOSED.; CAUSED BY TOO MUCH PAPER AND SHUTTING UP OF A BRANCH.
ERIE, Penn., Nov. 7. -- The closing of the doors of the Corry National Bank to-day has astounded the general public, as the institution was regarded as one of the safest banking houses in this part of the State. A rumor that the withdrawal of State moneys had crippled the institution was found to-night, upon investigation, to be without foundation. 
--------
567-> HAMILTON COLLEGE.
CLINTON, N.Y., April 4. -- By the settlement of the Fayerweather will contest, Hamilton College is assured of $100,000, and the speedy and amicable adjustment of the matter has caused much rejoicing among friends of the institution. Coming as it will with no trust or condition, the purposes to which it should be devoted are purely optional. The inquiry has been quite general as to what would be done with this gift. 
--------
568-> THE MOLE ST. NICHOLAS.; AN OPPORTUNITY EXPECTED SOON TO OBTAIN IT FROM HAITI.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. -- The course of events in Haiti is being watched with unusual interest from Washington just now, and it can be said, on good authority, that at the first favorable opportunity negotiations for the acquisition of the Mole St. Nicholas will be renewed. The opportunity is expected to come with the insurrection which is understood to be brewing against the Government of Hippolyte. 
--------
569-> LEHIGH UNIVERSITY.
SOUTH BETHLEHEM, Penn., Nov. 7. -- At a meeting of the undergraduates held last week, an Advisory Committee on Athletics was decided upon, to act as a board for the selection of members of the various athletic teams and to aid the several Captains. The plan is as follows: The university will elect a committee to serve until June, when it must report to the students, giving such suggestions as are judged beneficial to athletics. 
--------
570-> IN THE CATSKILLS.; MORE GUESTS THAN EVER BEFORE IN THE MOUNTAINS.
KINGSTON, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- Railroad men unite in saying that the present season has been the most successful in the history of the Catskill Summer boarding region. Last Saturday 1,100 persons were taken into the mountains by the Ulster and Delaware Railroad, and on the Saturday two weeks previous the number was 1,720. 
--------
571-> FIVE SCORE AND SEVEN; MARVIN SMITH IS ALMOST AS OLD AS THE NATION. HE WAS FIRST MARRIED SEVENTY-NINE YEARS AGO AND HAS A SECOND WIFE LIVING WHO WAS BORN IN 1796 -- HE NEVER HELD AN OFFICE.
NORWALK, Conn., Aug. 22. -- Marvin Smith of Montville, should he live until next Tuesday, will be 107 years old. He was born on Aug. 25, 1784, in Montville, and has always lived there. For over 100 years he has dwelt within two miles of his birthplace. He has been twice married. His first wife, Anna Newton, who was the mother of his children, was born in 1784 and died in 1844. 
--------
572-> CLEVELAND IS THE MAN; MR. GRACE SAYS SO AFTER VISITING MANY STATES. THE EX-MAYOR TALKS ABOUT HIS TOUR THROUGH THE SOUTH AND WEST -- HE SAYS THAT WHEREVER HE WENT HE HEARD THE SAME STORY.
Ex-Mayor William R. Grace was back at his office in Hanover Square yesterday after his return from a delightful Winter vacation spent mainly in Southern California, where the climate did him a world of good. He left this city Feb. 3 with several members of his family, and returned late last week. During his trip he visited the States of Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California, and Colorado. 
--------
573-> A WONDERFUL RAILROAD; IT RUNS TO 'SCONSET AND IS THOROUGHLY ORIGINAL. THERE ARE HALF A DOZEN TRAINS IN ONE, THE EMPLOYES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE, AND THE MOTION IS LIKE THAT OF A SHIP.
SIASCONSET, Mass., Aug. 22. -- For short, the natives of Nantucket call this fanny old fishermen's hamlet "'Sconset." It is over 200 years old. It is fifty miles from New-Bedford, and is the point of Uncle Sam's domain the furthest out in the Atlantic Ocean. By swimming due east two thousand and odd miles I could reach Spain. I haven't tried it yet, but fishermen tell me so. Fishermen never lie.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21. -- The body of the late King Kalakaua was embalmed last night, and today the remains were placed in a metal casket, hermetically sealed, and conveyed to the mortuary chapel of Trinity Church, where they are guarded by a detail from the United States Army forces here. The remains will not lie in state and will not be exhibited to the public. 
--------
575-> CANADA'S WHEAT SUPPLY.; MILLERS COUNTED ON A SURPLUS, BUT THE FIGURES SHOW A SHORTAGE.
TORONTO, Ontario, May 22. -- The Dominion Government has no systematized method of collecting statistics relative to the supply of flour and wheat and crop returns in Canada, and in consequence dealers are generally in the dark as to the stock on hand, and are left to depend largely on the old-fashioned methods of comparing notes. 
--------
576-> THE PRESBYTERIAN CREED.
The slowness with which great bodies move is especially illustrated by the slowness of great theological bodies. It was generally assumed, when the Presbyterian creed, as contained in the Westminster Confession, was put into the hands of its friends to be revised, that the General Assembly to which the report of the revisers was submitted would act upon the report. 
--------
577-> QUAY AND HIS HENCHMEN.; THE SENATOR STILL CONFERRING AS TO THE SAFEST PARTY POLICY.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 6. -- After breakfast this morning Senator Quay went to the People's Bank and one or two other places where he had some private business to transact.

--------
578-> FOOD EXHIBITION IN BOSTON.; AN ATTEMPT TO BRING MAKERS, SELLERS, AND CONSUMERS TOGETHER.
BOSTON, Oct. 5. -- A great step in an art long neglected was taken this morning when the Food and Health Exposition was opened, under the superintendence of the Boston Retail Grocers' Association. The event is the first of the kind held in New-England, and will be watched with no small interest by all who wish to see the advancement of the culinary art. 
--------
579-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
President HARRISON will doubtless view with apprehension and alarm the profuse thanks bestowed upon him by the leaders of the Mormon Church for pardoning one of their number. There is, of course, no reason at all why the Mormons should now be persecuted, nor any decent pretext left for persecuting them. 
--------
580-> PROBABLY A MILLION LOST.; A.E. BURKHARDT'S FINE BUILDING AND VALUABLE STOCK DESTROYED BY FIRE.
CINCINNATI, July 8. -- A little after 10 o'clock to-night came an alarm of fire, calling a relay of engines to the great building occupied by A.E.

Goodman, banker and financier.

Many of the contractors who did work on the new aqueduct under sub-contracts with O'Brien  Clark have brought suits against the city to have the liens which they have filed against the money in the hands of the Controller, to the credit of O'Brien  Clark, declared valid, and to have the city adjudged to pay their claims out of it.

LONDON, Jan. 6. -- The Press Association of this city announces that Lord Salisbury is engaged in the consideration of the forty-page dispatch received from Mr. Blaine Dec. 30, the latest dispatch received from Washington.

--------
585-> MAY HAVE TWO GOVERNORS.; A LIVELY CONTEST IN PROSPECT IN NEBRASKA.
OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 6. -- Unless some unknown power intervenes between now and next Friday in Nebraska politics, this State is likely to have at least two Governors and two sets of State officers. 
--------
586-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
Mr. TELLER of Colorado yesterday undertook to define the position of the Republican silver Senators. He denied, with more warmth than seemed to be called for, the intimation that there had been any coalition between himself and friends and the minority Senators to lay aside the Force bill and take up the Finance bill. 
--------
587-> THE POLITICIANS BUSY.; THEY PRESENT THEIR CANDIDATES AND AWAIT HARRISON'S SELECTION.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2. -- The passage by the House to-day of the bill giving the President thirty days in which to fill such a vacancy as that caused by the death of Secretary Windom and the expected prompt concurrence of the Senate in the measure will probably extend for several days the time in which the politicians can speculate upon the chances of the numerous persons brought forward for the Secretaryship. 
--------
588-> HELEN POTTS'S SAD DEATH; IT WAS PROBABLY CAUSED BY AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHINE. SHE HAD SUFFERED FROM WEAKNESS OF THE HEART SINCE CHILDHOOD, AND THE DRUG IN THE PILLS GIVEN HER PROVED FATAL.
The body of Miss Helen Potts, the nineteen-year-old pupil at Miss Lydia Day's school, 32 West Fortieth Street, who died suddenly Sunday morning after taking quinine and morphine pills prescribed for her by young Carlyle W.

LONDON, Dec. 6. -- Discount was easy during the week past at 212 for three months and 2 for short. Money is now so abundant that it is regarded as certain that the Bank of England rate will be reduced at the beginning of the new year unless some unforeseen gold movement occurs. 
--------
595-> HELD IN LINE FOR CRISP.; THE MEN WHOM GORMAN LEADS IN THE CONTEST.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. -- The Crisp men can easily be arranged in groups under the leadership of Gorman's sub-lieutenants, each of whom is an anti-Cleveland man first, and an anti-Mills man because it is considered more prudent to attack the friend of Cleveland than it is to assail Cleveland himself, and thus provoke national indignation. 
--------
596-> ANOTHER BASEBALL WAR; THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION TO FIGHT THE LEAGUE. PRESIDENT THURMAN DEPOSED AND CHARGED WITH ACTING IN COMPLICITY WITH PROMINENT LEAGUE OFFICIALS.
At a meeting of the American Association yesterday it was decided to break away from the national agreement. This means that the sport-loving public is to be afflicted with another baseball war, the result of what the Association people claim unfair treatment at the hands of the League. When the war was raging last Summer the League people showed a tendency to make all sorts of concessions in the interest of peace and harmony. 
--------

The last election, so far as this city is concerned, showed two things that will occupy the attention of the politicians for some time. The first is that the Republican machine in this city is badly in need of an overhauling, and the second is that there are more weak spots in Tammany Hall than any one who does not follow politics closely had supposed. 
--------

Nothing has happened for some time so to stir up athletic circles in this city as did the interview with himself that Secretary C.C.

The English papers, and among them some, like the Spectator, that ought to be better informed, are still talking about some intention on the part of the United States to coerce Canada into annexation, with hostile tariff legislation.

OSWEGO, N.Y., Aug. 22. -- The David B. Hill method of carrying caucuses has been fully exemplified in this city this week.

--------
609-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title

When you try to track backward into the history of anything in common usage you will be lost in groping through the gloom of antiquity. Take bills of lading and dispossess yourself of the idea that they are mercantile implements, fashioned yesterday, or, say, only a thousand years or so ago. Man is no more suspicious to-day than he was yesterday, but he never was an idiot.

Telephone rates have already been reduced through the natural agency of competition.

Our Berlin dispatches yesterday morning spoke of the commercial alliance of Central Europe as something seriously believed in in Germany.

Good new plays come so rarely into the reviewer's vision that it would be ungrateful, indeed, to complain when an unusual number of them come together. Four worthy plays divided the professional theatregoer's attention in Easter week, and three of them were new. The result is just a trifle bewildering. The mind laboriously trained to take quick impressions gets to be like the sensitive film of the camera.

Poolroom men continued betting in their rooms yesterday as usual in defiance of the law, believing themselves safe under the "commission agent" subterfuge, and with a further belief that the police authorities are in sympathy with them rather than against them in their violation of law, just as the same authorities are with the violators of the excise laws who pay tribute to Tammany Hall, and somebody else, possibly.

DEL RIO, Texas, Oct. 22. -- The full details of the pursuit and capture of the Southern Pacific train robbers reached here to-day.

--------
668-> WALL STREET TALK.
The stock market stays becalmed. Not a thing of interest or importance happens. The Granger who has an idea that Wall Street is wicked and ought to be punished would feel quite content could he drop down into the Stock Exchange district just now. He would find there none of that famed luxury and opulence which his wild Western fancy has always insisted on gilding the speculative centre with.

669-> THE QUEENS COUNTY CONTEST.; THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SHERIFF CHARGED WITH FELONY.
Theron H. Burden, the Republican candidate for Sheriff of Queens County, Dr. John T.D.

671-> SOME SILVER POOL GOSSIP; OWENBY TALKS A GREAT DEAL BUT SAYS LITTLE. HE TELLS OF AN ARRANGEMENT TO WHICH HE CONTRIBUTED HIS KNOWLEDGE -- HE WANTS TO MENTION NAMES BUT IS NOT ALLOWED TO.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3. -- Witness Owenby, who was yesterday before the bar of the House to explain why he had not come to Washington to testify in the silver pool investigation, was on the stand for several hours to-day, and was pretty well "pumped" by the members, who have developed a great deal of curiosity to learn from men who do not appear to know anything. 
--------
672-> ONE WAY TO PAY TAXES.; HARVARD STUDENTS HAVE A SETTLING DAY IN THE DISTRICT COURT.
BOSTON, Mass., June 5. -- For years disgruntled taxpayers of Cambridge have been wont to express themselves in uncomplimentary terms in regard to Harvard College, which they say is of no benefit to the city, but, on the contrary, a drawback to its progress, occupying as it does a great area of land covered with valuable buildings upon which no taxes are collectable.

673-> HE OFFERS FIVE THOUSAND; CONGRESSMAN TURNER'S DESIRE TO BE A SENATOR HIS LETTER GOT INTO WRONG HANDS AND PROVOKES A BITTER CONTROVERSY AMONG THE KANSAS ALLIANCE MEN, WHILE INGALLS LAUGHS.
TOPEKA, Kan., Jan. 7. -- A letter from Congressman E.J. Turner of the Sixth District was made public to-day, which has caused much bad blood and may result in a permanent split in Alliance ranks. The letter was in the possession of Judge Peffer, one of the Alliance candidates for Senator, and McLellan, editor of the Alliance organ, and held until McGrath, President of the State Alliance, to whom it was addressed, threatened personal violence. 
--------
674-> IT PROGRESS SLOWLY.; THE WORK ON BROOKLYN'S GOVERNMENT BUILDING.
The present generation of Brooklynites is beginning to wonder if any member of it will live long enough to see the new Federal Building completed. So many vexatious delays have occurred since the cornerstone was laid that ordinary delays attract no attention, but now it is calmly announced that the formal occupancy of the building may have to be postponed for a year, perhaps two years.

675-> Article 6 -- No Title
ANDREA FERARA SWORDS. -- If one were to judge by the number of these blades still extant in a limited area, the great Venetian swordsmith must have done a very large export business. This thought occurred to me during the Glasgow Exhibition of 1888, where there were at least forty swords exhibited, all marked with the name of "Andrea Ferara."

676-> ROUND-UP OF POULTRY.; THE ANNUAL TURKEY FAIR IN THE NORTHERN NEW-YORK COUNTIES.
WATERTOWN, N.Y., Nov. 21. -- Following close on the annual round-up of voters in this part of the State comes the annual round-up of the turkeys, geese, and ducks that the farmers' wives and daughters were busy fattening while their husbands and fathers talked politics.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. -- The Hill-Gorman-Brice combine was busy all day trying to bring about the defeat of Mr. Mills. It pulled every string calculated to aid Mr. Crisp.

ELMIRA, N.Y., March 23. -- Ex-Gov. Lucius Robinson died at 12:55 o'clock this afternoon at his residence in Maple Avenue, this city.

PARIS, April 4. -- A cable dispatch from Chile, signed by the leaders of the Congressional or revolutionist party, announces that the 2,000 Government troops recently defeated in Antofagasta took refuge in Bolivia, where they were compelled to lay down their arms.

--------
684-> THE CHICAGO PLAYHOUSES.
CHICAGO, April 4. -- Two theatrical productions new to Chicago have been given here this week, and both came heralded as "metropolitan successes." They were Donnelly and Miller's farcical nautical opera "Ship Ahoy!" and Hamilton Aide's farce-comedy, "Dr. Bill." "Ship Ahoy!" has done a week of excellent business and will undoubtedly continue to draw large houses during the final week of its engagement, which begins to-morrow night "

685-> A LOBBY-RIDDEN LEGISLATURE.; CORPORATIONS OPPOSE ALL HOSTILE MEASURES IN MISSOURI.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., March 22. -- The Legislative session is practically ended. The lobby, which has controlled the session, left the capital on the late trains last night, and at the final sessions to-morrow there will be but a slim attendance. 
--------
686-> THE FINANCIAL WORLD.
The industrial stocks saved the Street from what would otherwise have been a week of complete stagnation. Except in them nothing was doing from Monday to Friday. They, however, maintained the vitality of the market, and at last the beginnings of a buying movement developed; signs appeared that various bull cliques were bestirring themselves again, and the market closed yesterday strong, with a hopeful feeling prevalent in respect to the coming week.

687-> THAT STEAM YACHT RACE.; OFFER OF THE AMERICAN YACHT CLUB -- THE GOVERNMENT REFUSES.
The offer by the American Yacht Club of a prize of $500 for a race between the Cushing, Stiletto, Javelin, Now Then, Norwood, and Vamoose was the principal topic of conversation yesterday among yachtsmen.

MOBILE, Ala., Aug. 23. -- The affairs in Choctaw County, where in the fanatical family of Robert Sims has come in conflict with the United States, promises to become of unusual prominence, by reason of the belief on the part of Sims's followers that Sims is the temporal manifestation of their God.

689-> A POOR CONGRESS FOR THEM.; NAVY AND ARMY OFFICERS ARE IN A STATE OF DISAPPOINTMENT.
An officer at the Brooklyn Navy Yard yesterday said that few people had as little to thank the Fifty-first Congress for as the officers of the navy.

--------
691-> ATLANTIC RACING YEARS AGO.; HOW THE CUNARDS AND THE INMANS STRUGGLED FOR SUPREMACY.
The popular interest that is taken in transatlantic racing nowadays is not in any degree less than it was thirty years ago, when the paddlewheel gave way to the screw, and when several new lines became competitors for ocean laurels. Nearly everybody has forgotten those days, but not so Thomas Schavering, who was an engineer on several of the transatlantic liners before the war, and who recalls the ships of that period with great distinctness.

694-> FARROW IS YET ON TRIAL; THE COURT-MARTIAL DRAGS THROUGH ANOTHER DAY. ADMISSIONS THAT MAKE IT LOOK LESS BLACK FOR THE LIEUTENANT -- WORDY TILTS OF OPPOSING COUNSEL ENLIVEN PROCEEDINGS.
The trial of Lieut. Edward S. Farrow, Twenty-first Infantry, by court-martial was continued yesterday at the Army Building. It lasted from 10 o'clock in the morning until 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Col. Bacon, the attorney for Lieut. Farrow, said that he was in for fun, and he had it. He engineered any number of oratorical contests with Judge Advocate Birkhimer, and had an even share of the honors.

695-> RAUM INTENDS TO STICK.; VERY CIRCUMSTANTIAL STORY FROM WASHINGTON TO THE CONTRARY.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7. -- It is asserted by Pension Office employes, who are sure that they know, that Pension Commissioner Raum is practically out of office, and that an order was made by the Secretary of the Interior and with the approval of the President, making First Deputy Commissioner Davidson Acting Commissioner in place of Green B. Raum, suspended, and pending the appointment of his successor.

696-> THEY STAND BY DR. BRIGGS.; THE SEMINARY TRUSTEES WILL KEEP HIM WHERE HE IS.
The Union Theological Seminary Trustees took action yesterday which seems to indicate that a complete severance of its present relations with the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church is not far distant. In the language of one of the Trustees after the meeting was over, "the Union Seminary has stood by its guns.

697-> CAMPAIGN NEWS IN BRIEF.
At the meeting of the Police Board yesterday it was ordered that in the police stations election night the returns be publicly announced as they are received by the officers in command, and that all the needed facilities be given to newspapers and news associations for the collection of the returns.

LONDON, Oct. 23. -- From all parts of the provinces come reports announcing that a very large amount of damage has been done by the floods. In many cases the waters are still rising.

The meadows in that locality are already submerged to the depth of four or five feet.

The unveiling of the statue to Mr. J.S.T. STRANAHAN in Prospect Park, which took place yesterday, called out sincere and well-deserved tributes to that gentleman. It is not usual to pay honor to a living man in this way, but there is ample reason for the exception in this case. In a very important sense Prospect Park is the work of Mr. STRANAHAN.

TRENTON, N.J., Feb. 4. -- Gov. Abbett has brought about a novel and interesting legal situation in regard to the borough election at High Bridge, in Hunterdon County, held yesterday. It was with the view of heading off that election that the repeal of the Borough act of last year was rushed through both houses and into the Governor's hands yesterday.

703-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The statement that the Prince of WALES has been engaged in gambling with sharpers is a more formidable menace to the British Constitution than the announcement that the Lord Mayor of London has been plagiarizing. Still, this latter assertion, of the correctness of which there seems to be no doubt, is calculated to cast a gloom over conservative Britons, and to cause them to inquire what the country is coming to. 
--------
704-> NIEDRINGHAUS'S TIN WORKERS.; HIS IMPORTATION OF LABOR REFERRED TO THE GRAND JURY.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 23. -- The importation of Welshmen by the tin-plate patriot Niedringhaus to work in his rolling mills has been taken before the Grand Jury. From statements made by all persons concerned it appears that several members of that august body are desirous of investigating the matter, but District Attorney Reynolds does not appear so anxious to push the work. 
--------
705-> ON TRIAL FOR CONSPIRACY.; HOW RICHARD D. YOUNG TRIED TO RUIN HIS WIFE'S REPUTATION.
PATERSON, N.J., Feb. 3. -- A very peculiar trial is in progress here. In October, 1889, Richard D. Young, a wealthy dealer in perfumes in New-York City, arranged with Melano C. Reichardt, an employe of his, to drive from Montolair to Paterson with Mrs. Young, stop at the Hamilton House, and try to get Mrs. Young into such a compromising position that Mr. Young would have cause for a divorce.

There is no name, except Washington's, that is more familiar to Americans in connection with the Revolution than Patrick Henry's. He is known to us all as the orator of that great struggle -- great in its consequences, if not in its actual proportions -and no other has given to the memory of his countrymen phrases so intimately associated with independence.

--------
708-> MIDSUMMER M'KINLEYISM.
The McKinley papers continue to mislead their readers concerning the consumption of tin, the metal, in this country, the effect of the now tariff upon the production of the metal, and other kindred subjects. Their purpose is to make their readers believe that there can be no market for the metal here except in tin-plate factories.

709-> FOR MILITARY RIFLEMEN.; A WEEK OF SHOOTING ON THE NEW-JERSEY STATE RANGE.
An interesting rifle competition has been arranged to be held, under the auspices of the New-Jersey State Rifle Association, at the State Rifle Range. Sea Girt, beginning on Monday, Aug. 24, and closing the following Saturday. It is proposed to make this an annual event, and, if it is carried out on the lines laid down by the projectors of the scheme, it can hardly fail to be very popular with military riflemen. 
--------
710-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
While the British naval experts admit that this year's manoeuvres in the North Sea have been valuable as showing that less is to be apprehended than was generally supposed from the attacks of torpedo vessels, and also as illustrating the gratifying promptness with which the great armor-clads can be mobilized, some of them complain of the unsatisfactory character of the exercises as a whole. 
--------
711-> AMASA LYON & CO. INSOLVENT.; ANDREW J. NUTTING APPOINTED TEMPORARY RECEIVER.
Amasa Lyon  Co., a corporation manufacturing umbrellas at 684 Broadway, has become insolvent and unable to meet maturing obligations, and Judge McAdam of the Superior Court has appointed Andrew J. Nutting of Brooklyn temporary receiver on the application of the Trustees, who declare that the business has been unprofitable since the organization of the company, and future prospects do not justify hope or expectation of any profits from the business.

The scheme to unite the great railroad systems of the West and the Southwest under one general management is making some progress. The financial departments of the Union Pacific, the Atchison, the Missouri Pacific, the Southern Pacific, the Central Pacific, and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company are preparing detailed statements showing the condition and the earning capacity of their respective properties. 
--------
715-> FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF COMMERCE.
Our wise and esteemed contemporary, the Journal of Commerce, looks upon the strifes of politics with the dispassionate judgment of a non-combatant, but it is by no means a disinterested observer. It has decided opinions of political action and party policy, and it seems to us to be best pleased with those issues and contests that least disturb the world of commerce.

716-> PRIESTS PROTEST AGAIN; CONTEMPT SHOWN BY TAMMANY FOR THEIR WISHES. ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO BE MADE TO PLACE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THE OBJECTIONS OF CATHOLICS TO THE STADLER AND SCHAAFF BILLS.
The manner in which the protest sent to the Assembly by the Catholic clergy of this city against the Stadler bill was received by Speaker Sheehan has stirred up the Catholic laity of this city. The breach between Tammany and the Catholic clergy occasioned by Tammany's advocacy of the Staler bill is now wider than ever.

717-> NOT ONE VOICE FOR HILL; IN SOUTH CAROLINA THEY DERIDE GOV. DAVID. ONE NEWSPAPER PRINTS HIS PICTURE AS A PART OF A SHOE DEALER'S ADVERTISEMENT -- MEN WHO WILL WORK FOR CLEVELAND AND REFORM.
CHARLESTON, S.C., April 5. -- Much amusement has been caused recently in Democratic circles in South Carolina by the assertion of the Hill supporters that a strong sentiment in favor of the Senator-Governor's Presidential candidacy had been developed in the South. There is no doubt that during the last three years systematic efforts have been made in this State to work up a Hill boom, but they have received little or no encouragement.

720-> SOCIETY IN BALTIMORE.
BALTIMORE, March 7. -- Not since the early Fall has a week passed so quietly for society. Entertaining seems indeed to have at last completely given way to at least a semblance of orthodox Lenten observance. With the exception of two musicales, one given by Mrs. Robert Garrett and the other by Mrs. Tyson, on Monday evening, nothing disturbed the torpor into which gayety has temporarily fallen.

721-> A PARK FOR PRINCETON.; THE UNIVERSITY TO HAVE MAGNIFICENT GROUNDS LAID OUT.

There was a very odd fire in the laundry in the basement of Mrs. Rosa Hyman's house, 48 East Fifty-eighth Street, at 5:30 o'clock yesterday morning.

--------
723-> FARMING BY INDIANS A FAILURE.
CHICAGO, July 24. -- Capt. E.L. Huggins of Gen.

CANTON, Ohio, Sept. 23. -- The MacQueary heresy case is at last ended. The reverend gentleman has given up the contesting of the Bishop's sentence, and accepted the alternative of resignation.

--------
727-> STILL IN A DEAD-LOCK.; NO NOMINATION FOR JUDGE MADE BY FIFTH DISTRICT REPUBLICANS.
UTICA, N.Y., Sept. 23. -- The Republican Judiciary Convention for the Fifth District resumed its session here this morning. The twenty-fifth informal ballot showed no material change from the vote of yesterday. On the twenty-eighth ballot Wright of Oswego increased his vote to 13, or six less than a majority, but on the thirty-eighth ballot he dropped to 6, and on the forty-third temporarily disappeared from the contest. 
--------
728-> AN INDICTMENT OF RUSSIA; HER SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO DEFORM A PEOPLE. THE JEWS, DWARFED MENTALLY BY DEPRIVATION OF EDUCATION, ARE WEAKENED PHYSICALLY BY BEING DENIED THE RIGHT TO WORK AND DRIVEN INTO PEST HOLES.
LONDON, Oct. 29. -- The ascending progress of the Procurator of the Holy Synod, M. Pobiedonostseff, in influence and authority, is marked at each successive stage by fresh impositions upon the Jews. 
--------
729-> DILKE'S DEBT TO STEAD.
Sir Charles Dilke's return to Parliament seems now almost assured, and he will owe his success to Mr. W.T. Stead. Had the matter been left to the Reform Club and the constituency concerned, I believe there is no doubt that such pressure would have been brought to bear upon the candidate and the caucus who has adopted him that his candidature would have been withdrawn on some plausible pretext. 
--------
730-> RETALIATION IN CONNECTICUT.; THE SENATE HAS NO USE FOR REPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDERS.
HARTFORD, April 21. -- The Democratic majority in the Senate this afternoon made short work with the question of reappointing Republicans on the Board of Trustees of the State Insane Hospital at Middletown. The Hon. Robbins Battell of Norfolk, one of the most conspicuous citizens of the State, was one of the victims of the new policy, a Democrat, William Bissell of Salisbury, being substituted in his place against the protests of Republicans. 
--------
731-> DIRECTOR LINTON HAPPY.; THE BROOKLYN PLAYERS' STOCKHOLDERS BUY OUT HIS INTEREST.
Director Linton of the Brooklyn Players' League has gained his point. His colleagues have bought out his interest in the team, the injunction suit will be discontinued, and the consolidation of the two Brooklyn nines will take place next Saturday. The stockholders in the club refuse to state how much they paid the obstinate Director, but Linton is happy, and that alone is sufficient ground for believing that he got the price asked -- $9,000. 
--------
732-> WHAT THE CASE DEMANDS.; REFORMS IN LIFE INSURANCE GROWING OUT OF THE BEERS SCANDAL.
The policy holders of the New-York Life Insurance Company are under very great obligations to THE TIMES for its courageous, determined, persistent, and fearless demands for an honest and thorough investigation into the financial condition, management, policy, and business methods of their company. The contest with the officials, which began in June last, has been a difficult and trying one. 
--------
733-> HAL POINTER DEFEATS DIRECT.; AN EASY VICTORY FOR THE TENNESSEAN IN THE PACING MATCH.
TERRE HAUTE, Ind., Oct. 7. -- The sudden fall in the temperature made it improbable that either Hal Pointer or Direct would lower the race record in the renewal of the contest between the crack pacers here this afternoon. But the case with which Hal Pointer went the first heat to-day in 2:10 14 showed that he might have beaten his own mark of 2:09 34 if Direct could have forced him for a mile. 
--------
734-> THE BROOKLYN MAYORALTY; MAYOR CHAPIN STILL PLEADING FOR A RENOMINATION. IF THE REPUBLICANS NOMINATE ZIEGLER HE WANTS TO BE HIS OPPONENT, BUT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS WILL NOT HAVE HIM.
Mayor Alfred C. Chapin of Brooklyn issued his reply to the Ziegler letter yesterday, as THE TIMES said he would do, and in it he declared that he did not desire another term as chief magistrate of the city, but that he thought he could beat William Ziegler. Then he deliberately departed from the programme laid down and demanded that he should be given a chance to run again if the Republicans nominated Mr. Ziegler. 
--------
735-> ALREADY GATHERING AT NEW PORT.; SUMMER VISITORS SETTLING DOWN FOR THE COSTING SEASON.
NEWPORT, R.I., May 9. -- The season is fairly opening, not the social season with its round of dances, dinners, and Casino concerts, but the season of quiet sojourn of cottagers at their beautiful Summer homes during the delightful days of May and June, before the gay whirl of fashionable life begins, and while the beauties of air, sea, sky, and earth can be fully and really enjoyed. 
--------
736-> AMONG BLUE GRASS HORSEMEN.
LEXINGTON, Ky., May 9. -- The weather has been excellent for training in Kentucky during the last week. It was perhaps a trifle cool, but the good track has been made much use of and fast miles will soon be reported. Each weekday morning the track is alive with the trotters. 
--------
737-> STAND OF THE BREWERS; DECLARATIONS MADE BY THE STATE ASSOCIATION. THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM SUITS THEM BEST -- HAS THE THIRD PARTY KILLED PROHIBITION -- EXCISE REFORM RECOMMENDATIONS.

Out of the 1,213 young women from private, public, and parochial schools in the city who took the examination for entrance to the Normal College during the first week of June, 624 passed. It has usually been customary to admit only those candidates who answered 75 per cent of the examination questions, but as only 400 reached that mark, the standard of scholarship was lowered to 71 per cent.

744-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
It is not surprising that the representatives of Yale should have objected to accepting the returns of the gate money for the football match on Thanksgiving Day, although, according to these, Yale's share reaches the comfortable sum of $14,425. The crowd was the greatest that has ever been seen at a sporting event in New-York. 
--------
745-> GOOD PURPOSES THWARTED.
The curious inability of manufacturers to resist temptation when they are engaged in promoting "harmony" and in reducing the cost of their goods is shown very clearly by recent events that have excited much interest in the carriage and wagon trade. Everybody has heard, of course, that the purpose of those who make Trusts is to reduce the price of goods to the consumer. 
--------
746-> E.H. RATH UNDOUBTEDLY DEAD.; HIS RELATIVES ARE ANGRY AT INSINUATIONS MADE TO THE CONTRARY.
The relatives of E.H. Rath, the Flushing (L.J.) real estate dealer who was killed and cremated in the East Thompson railroad disaster, on the New-York and New-England Railroad last Friday, are indignant over an intimation which they think emanates from the railroad company, that Mr. Rath was not killed, but is alive and in concealment for the purpose of defrauding life insurance companies which had issued policies on his life.

MINNEAPOLIS, Sept. 9. -- Minneapolis millers and commission men are up in arms over the discrimination in grain rates which the railroads entering the city have recently inaugurated in favor of Duluth. To-day Duluth obtained the same rate as Minneapolis has for all points south and west of the twin cities. That means that wheat passing through Minneapolis to Duluth pays no freight charges between Minneapolis and Duluth.

749-> GOLD FROM LONDON.; MR. GIFFEN PREDICTS A CRISIS HERE, DUE TO SILVER LEGISLATION.
LONDON, Sept. 23. -- The Rothschilds, Speyers, Lazard Brothers, and other bankers all agree in their statements that further large shipments of gold are going to America.

751-> THE CHICAGO PLAYHOUSES.
CHICAGO, March 7. -- Of the many dramatic and musical attractions in Chicago during the week just ended but two were novelties to the amusement public.

754-> SOCIETY TOPICS OF THE WEEK.
The short duration of the Winter season has had the effect of filling the early Lenten days with more of incident and interest than is usually the case. Despite the many departures for Europe and the Southern resorts, which have had the effect of thinning out to some extent even the clubs, there has been considerable of interest going on from day to day and night to night.

READING, Penn., Aug. 24. -- At Hamburg, this county, at noon to-day 701 Antwerp carrier pigeons, which were received from New-York several days ago for a grand tournament between Hamburg and New-York and surrounding cities, were released.

756-> BIG FIRE IN LOWELL.; THE WORST THE CITY HAS ENCOUNTERED FOR MANY YEARS.
LOWELL, Mass, April 5. -- The worst fire Lowell has had in many years occurred this afternoon.

Maynard  Co.'s dry goods shop were soon ablaze.

PARIS, Dec. 10. -- After the last note from the Madeleine organ all that remained of Dom Pedro was carried through the streets of Paris to the Gare d'Orleans. This final ceremony of the church was all that it should be, dignified and fitting to the situation; but it made the mistake of the previous mortuary ceremony all the more pathetic.

One of our neighbors, the Sun, is frequently moved by the appeals of its readers to discuss questions of social propriety and to diffuse the light of its accumulated wisdom for the instruction of perplexed lovers.

--------
763-> SHERMAN IN HIGH DUDGEON.; HE WILL KEEP THE APPOINTMENT OF WEBER IN MIND.
WASHINGTON, April 22. -- Senator Sherman has been recently mortified by one of the appointments made by President Harrison in the South.

ASBURY PARK, N.J., April 22. -- The statement that David D. Withers, who is the active manager and the chief moving spirit of the Monmouth Park Association, has discharged all the men employed upon that famous race track and sent the teams of working horses of the association to Philadelphia to be sold because the association had abandoned its races there for the coming Summer seems to have no foundation. 
--------
766-> TAMMANY AND THE DEAD-LOCK.; ALL THE CORRUPT INFLUENCE IN THE STATE BROUGHT TO BEAR AT ALBANY.
ALBANY, N.Y., April 22. -- The Senatorial dead-lock continues and legislative business is suspended. The Senate has abandoned all committee meetings. The Assembly has lost all interest in its work, and there is no activity or business displayed around the Capitol except by the lobby.

The accounts given by Capt. HEALY of the revenue cutter Bear and Agent JACKSON, who has general charge of education in Alaska, of the plans for introducing the reindeer into that Territory are rather encouraging.

770-> THE NEW ERA'S DEAD.; TO COMMEMORATE A GREAT DISASTER ON DEAL BEACH.

The victims were all buried in West Long Branch cemetery, with no stone to mark their graves.

771-> GOOD ADVICE TO DOUBTING VOTERS.
THE TIMES is a true leader. Its vision is clear and its present altitude is worthy of its great past. The editorial article, "Discrimination and Consistency," completely turns the tables on those independents who confuse local issues with State politics while insisting that the latter has no bearing on national affairs. This editorial article and Gov. Chamberlain's letter ought to be read by every doubting voter.

Owing to a combination agreement, between the two manufacturers of refined sugar on the Pacific coast -- SPRECKELS and representative of the Sugar Trust -- the price of sugar in California suffered only a alight reduction after the removal of the duty on the raw material, but the refiners have recently been compelled by importations to make further concessions. 
--------
773-> STRAWBERRIES AND CHERRIES.; THERE WILL BE AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY THIS WEEK.
The market was well supplied during the earlier days of last week with strawberries of good variety and of good quality, but toward the close of the week they became scarcer, with the result of increasing prices, and large shipments of Western Maryland berries for the Saturday's market. Consequently, to-day the people of this city may eat at moderate cost some of the finest strawberries grown in America.

780-> THE CONTEST IN OHIO.
Of all the State elections of the present year no other is likely to compare in importance and in political effect with that in Ohio.

It was to be expected that the "cranks" would appear at an early stage to impress their views upon the managers of the World's Fair.

BERLIN, Feb. 20. -- The Boerse was agitated to-day owing to canards announcing that Emperor William was ill.

The authorities have decided to take action in the matter and are trying to trace the fabrications to their authors. 
--------
784-> JULES GREVY.
The character of JULES GREVY could be estimated with sufficient precision from the fact that he had been twice elected President of the French Republic. In this country a re-election to the Presidency signifies very little except that the person reelected has been elected before, and the first election signifies little as to his personal character and equipment.

BOSTON, Nov. 23. -- The Cecilia Musical Organization is bringing forward an innovation in the concert line this Winter.

Nearly every man holding an appointive office in any State department or bureau is dependent upon the new Governor for his retention. 
--------
794-> THE IDLE RICH.
In a recent address by Mr. GLADSTONE he asked, apparently with entire seriousness, where in all GOD'S creation there was a place for an idle rich man. The question, of course, intimated a doubt. The most obvious reply, we should suppose, would be that the place in GOD's creation for an idle rich man, as for any other existing object, is the one where he is found.

--------
802-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The report that Attorney General MILLER is to receive a judicial appointment recurs with distressing regularity in Washington. It has always been a mystery to us why Mr. MILLER should be regarded as particularly liable to this honor.

--------
806-> SANITY AND INSANITY.; SYMPTOMS BY WHICH THE MENTAL STATE MAY BE KNOWN.
Next to insanity itself, the saddest thing in the world is the way in which the public regard it. The grossest ignorance still prevails concerning mental disease, for superstitions concerning the more complex and finer things are the last to be given up. While the idea of demoniac possession has in a measure departed, the notion of disgrace attendant on such possession still remains.

OSWEGO, N.Y., Oct. 8. -- The Hill and anti-Hill forces, who have been engaged in the bitterest warfare for supremacy here for the last three months, met in County Convention at the village of Mexico to-day for the final conflict.

WASHINGTON, June 23. -- In the light shed upon Secretary Blaine's attitude toward the efforts to save the Bering Sea seals by the full correspondence, recently published in the British Blue Book, a copy of which has just reached this city, the friends of that eminent statesmen will do well if they refrain from claiming for him any of the credit for the close-season agreement now in force.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 23. -- The great football game of Saturday has been the chief subject of conversation about college to-day, and the keenest disappointment is shown by almost every student. Yale's magnificent exhibition is unstintedly praised, and it is unanimously conceded that she far outplayed Harvard at every point.

810-> WHAT PENNOYER IS.; TRAITS OF OREGON'S GOVERNOR -- "HANK" VAUGHN'S SCHEME.
PORTLAND, Oregon, May 10. -- Oregon has received much unwelcome notoriety recently through an utterance of her Governor in regard to the reception of President Harrison. But Gov. Pennoyer is not Oregon. His conception of the duty of a State Executive to a visiting President is shared by no one in Oregon. Gov. Pennoyer is an exceptional person.

811-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
During the last three months the Board of Charities of this State has sent back to their homes in Europe thirty-five paupers who had been shipped to this country by town officers, "benevolent" societies, or relatives or friends. At this rate the number of such persons sent back during the entire year will be smaller than usual. Last year it was 165, in 1889 it was 229, and 323 was the number for 1888.

MINERSVILLE, Penn., Oct. 8. -- News reached here this morning to the effect that some of the bodies of the victims of the Richardson Colliery Mine disaster had been recovered, and the greatest excitement prevailed.

813-> "TRUE AND HONEST."; THE EPITAPH GEN. SHERMAN DESIRED TO APPEAR ON HIS MONUMENT.
PITTSBURG, Penn., Feb. 20. -- While a change of engines was being made here for the Sherman funeral train this morning, Lieut. Thackara, the General's son-in-law, explained why no general demonstration was permitted along the route from New-York to St. Louis, and disclosed some facts of interest. 
--------
814-> THE NEW ARMY COMMANDS.
The recent order abolishing the three military divisions and causing all the military departments to report directly to Army Headquarters is a natural sequence of the preliminary arrangements made a year ago, and furnishes another illustration of the skill with which the present commander of the army carries out his projects of administration. 
--------
815-> THE HARVESTER TRUST DEAD.; IT DIES OF ITS OWN VOLITION RATHER THAN FACE A FIGHT IN COURT.
CHICAGO, Jan. 9. -- Rigor mortis has seized the American Harvester Company. It was organized one month ago with a capital of $35,000, 000, and was in point of fact a reorganization of all the harvester manufacturers in the country into one company, which was in effect a trust or monopoly. By purchasing the plants of the various companies outright it was thought all legal obstacles had been avoided. 
--------
816-> SHERMAN ON LEE'S SURRENDER.
Col. John E. Marshall of this city, who was attached to Gen. Sherman's headquarters during the famous campaign which included the fight at Atlanta, the march through Georgia, and the surrender of Gen. Joe Johnston with his entire army at Raleigh, N.C., has in his possession the original draft of the order Sherman issued to his army announcing the surrender of Lee.

--------
818-> NEGROES URGED TO STRIKE.; HUMPHREYS'S EFFORTS TO INFLUENCE THE COLORED ALLIANCE.
ATLANTA, Ga., Sept. 10. -- There will be no strike of the negro Alliance men in this part of the South, but the movement came within an ace of being indorsed in Georgia. So says E.S. Richardson, Superintendent of the colored Alliance in Georgia. In speaking of Humphreys and his attempt to get the Alliance to indorse his scheme in Georgia. Richardson does not mince his words. 
--------
819-> BROOKFIELD TO BE PRESIDENT.; THE SLATE FOR OFFICERS OF THE REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMITTEE.
The Chairmen of the various Assembly District Republican organizations, or rather the Executive Committee (that is to be) of the Republican County Committee, met last night in the Cumberland and made arrangements for tonight's meeting of the County Committee which will be held in Nilsson Hall. All the districts were represented. James A. Blanchard acted as proxy for William Brookfield of the Twenty-first. 
--------
820-> THE BOARD OF ARBITRATION.
The State Board of Mediation and Arbitration has not commonly been considered by rational persons as a valuable addition to the machinery of the State. It was added at the instigation of "Labor," and it has commonly shown its regard for its creator by taking the side of Labor in all disputes, insomuch that Capital has declined to submit any disputes to its adjudication. 
--------
821-> A SURPRISE IN THE SHOE TRADE.; MORTON F. COPELAND FAILS AND TRIES TO AVOID ATTACHMENTS.
The failure of Morton F. Copeland, wholesale dealer in boots and shoes at 92 Reade Street, was announced yesterday morning and caused a genuine surprise.

DALLAS, Texas, July 25. -- At 12:40 this morning a fire broke out in J.B. Cowan's wholesale liquor house on Commerce Street, opposite the Grand Windsor Hotel, wherein were stored, it is estimated, about 700 barrels of whisky. A few minutes later flames burst through the roof, and at the same time they seemed to fill the inside of the building. 
--------
824-> AN AVARICIOUS DEACON.; IT IS HE WHO KEEPS MR. CORBIN FROM BUILDING A RAPID TRANSIT LINE.
Owing to a disagreement between Austin Corbin and "Deacon" William Richardson, the people of Brooklyn stand a pretty good chance of having no rapid transit at all on Atlantic Avenue. The residents wanted a depressed road, and fought long and hard for it, but could not induce the Rapid Transit Commission to provide for one. Corbin and the Long Island Railroad were too powerful, and they got a charter for an elevated structure. 
--------
825-> CLARKSON ACCEPTS OFFICE.; HE CALLS AN EARLY MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
CINCINNATI, April 23. -- At an executive session of the old and new Executive Committees of the National Republican League, held late last night, President Clarkson was empowered to appoint a sub-committee of nine members, who shall have the same powers as the Executive Committee, except as to fixing the time and place of the next meeting and taking action on the matter of the incorporation. 
--------
826-> A CRY FOR GOOD WATER.; THE PEOPLE OF WEST BERGEN DENOUNCE THE LOCAL POLITICIANS.

ST. LOUIS, April 23. -- Lon V. Stephens, Treasurer of Missouri, whose alleged interview with ex-President Cleveland has caused so much comment, has returned from New-York. In reply to a question, Mr. Stephens said: 
--------
828-> INDEPENDENTS IN THE CONTEST.
Mr. MATTHEW HALE'S letter to THE TIMES is an instructive and useful contribution to the discussion of the issues of the campaign. It is a contest in which the conscientious voter encounters many perplexities. It calls for a candid measurement of candidates and principles. It demands an unusually patient inquiry as to the facts, for full information is beyond question the voter's best safeguard against mistakes. 
--------
829-> AT THE ONION'S SHRINE.
CLEVELAND, March 7. -- There was a time in Ohio when the onion was not only recognized upon its own merits, but men banded themselves together in its honor. The eminent Abolition leader, Joshua R. Giddings, was proud to be a member of the Onion Society that flourished upon the Reserve in those days when men ate according to their likings and cultivated what they ate.

Now that the long controversy over the New-York monument at Gettysburg is at last settled, there may be leisure to consider what shall be done to honor the soldiers of the State who took part in the battles around Chattanooga. Congress has established on the field of Chickamauga and the approaches thereto a national military park which is to be to the West what the Gettysburg military park is to the East. 
--------
831-> ART AT THE SALON'S SHOW; ARRANGEMENTS MADE FOR THE COMFORT OF VISITORS. FAMILIAR NAMES AND THE WORKS THE ARTISTS SEND -- NAMES NOT FAMILIAR -- HINTS AS TO THE HONORS OF THE YEAR'S EXHIBITION.
PARIS, May 6. -- The first glimpse of the Salon is a pleasant one and a vast improvement upon the old routine. An evident care for decoration has led to a new and more logical hanging of pictures; the lights is softer and more harmonious, and the atmosphere is certainly less oppressive. The first large room, once called the Salon Carre, seems to be particularly bright and pleasant. 
--------
832-> MR. LOWELL PASSES AWAY; THE POET AND DIPLOMAT DIES AT HIS ELMWOOD HOME. DEATH COMES TO HIS RELIEF AFTER WEEKS OF SUFFERING -- HIS LAST CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS FOR THE COMFORT OF THOSE AROUND HIM.
BOSTON, Aug. 12. -- James Russell Lowell died early this morning at his home at Elmwood, Cambridge. Exactly what caused Mr. Lowell's death is not at present known, but it is understood that gout brought on liver trouble and led to other complications too great to be resisted by a man of Mr. Lowell's age and feebleness. 
--------
833-> JEFFERSON DAVIS'S FIRST WIFE.; SHE WAS GEN. ZACHARY TAYLOR'S DAUGHTER -- A CORRECTION.
Recently an article appeared in your valuable journal headed "Proud of His Family."

ADA, Ohio, Oct. 8. -- "The meeting of the Governors" will be a long-remembered event in the history of Ada and Hardin County. The little town of Ada was in gala attire to-day in honor of the great event. By noon there were over 5,000 strangers in the place, and although great enthusiasm was manifested by both parties, the rivalry was a friendly one and entirely devoid of unpleasant incidents. 
--------
836-> VACANCIES IN THE ARMY.
During the present year the appointment of young men from civil life to Second Lieutenancies in the army, which, save for a single exceptional instance, has been discontinued for a very long time, will be renewed and carried to a remarkable extent. The reason is to be found in recent legislation which resulted in the retirement of scores of officers on the active list, in addition to those affected by previous laws. 
--------
837-> CHARACTER IN WRITING; THE CHIROGRAPHY OF SOME AMERICAN COMPOSERS. PERSONAL TRAITS INDICATED BY SIGNATURES AND FLOURISHES -- ANALYSES WHICH ARE FLATTERING AND OTHERS WHICH ARE NOT.
Handwriting is often an index of character, though it does not follow that a graceful penmanship necessarily betokens a graceful life or that an uncouth scrawl denotes a disagreeable disposition. Perhaps no class of persons handle their pens more characteristically than composers of music, and it may be interesting to note the penmanship of some of America's musical geniuses. 
--------
838-> THROUGH A BURNING TRESTLE.
BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Oct. 24.--A train of thirteen cars loaded with coal was wrecked on the Columbus and Western Railroad near Goodwater this morning. As the train rounded a curve within a few yards of Hatchett Creek the engineer saw the trestle approach to the bridge on fire. It was too late to stop, and he pulled the throttle open in an attempt to cross by sheer force of speed. 
--------
839-> SUNDAY BALL PLAYING A NUISANCE.
Gangs of young men flock into Westchester County every Sunday to play baseball, and in several sections of the county prove a nuisance to residents. At Mount Vernon Stephen B. Odell has a hotel and a park containing three diamonds for the baseball players.

840-> THE DOWNFALL OF FONSECA; A DECISIVE REVOLUTION IN RIO JANEIRO. LED BY THE NAVY IT FORCES THE DICTATOR TO RESIGN THE PRESIDENCY -- GREAT EXCITEMENT BUT NO BLOODSHED REPORTED.
RIO JANEIRO, Nov. 23. -- A deputation of naval officers waited on Gen. da Fonseca to-day and stated that his acts as Dictator had created profound dissatisfaction among the people of the country, and that if he refused to accede to the popular request for his resignation they would not be answerable for the consequences. 
--------
841-> THE WILMINGTON ELECTION.; A DEMOCRATIC PROTEST AGAINST HILLISM IN POLITICS.
WILMINGTON, Del., June 7. -- Complete returns of yesterday's election in this city show that the Republicans have elected their entire city ticket by majorities ranging from 436 for Mayor to 919 for City Treasurer. They have also secured control of the City Council by a vote of 8 to 5, an exact reversal of the present political complexion of that body. 
--------
842-> OBITUARY.
The death is announced in Paris of Theodore Deck, the great ceramist of France. He died at Sevres, in the little pavilion -- with rooms of gold, satin, and velvet, filled with vases painted in manganese violet and eel yellow colors, lacquers, netsukes, and swords of Japan -- so hospitable to American visitors at the Manufacture Nationals de Porcelaine, of which he was for fourteen years the administrator.

844-> WHAT THE CASE CALLS FOR.; FIRST AN INVESTIGATION AND LATER SOME NEW INSURANCE LAWS.
The policy holders of the New-York Life Insurance Company are under great obligations to THE TIMES for its determined, persistent, and fearless demand for an honest investigation into the financial condition, management, and business methods of their company. There must not be any whitewashing. If there is, it will not only destroy, sooner or later, the great corporation involved, but shake public confidence in life insurance as a beneficent institution.

845-> RESPITE FOR THE SEALS; AT WORK ON THE AGREEMENT FOR A CLOSE SEASON. IT MAY DO GOOD IF THERE IS NO MORE DELAY -- HARRISON OBJECTS TO A COMMISSION FROM THIS COUNTRY --BLAINE'S WRONG STATEMENTS.
WASHINGTON, June 7. -- President Harrison and the State Department people are hard at work preparing the agreement for a close season for the seals in Bering Sea, so that the document may be all ready for the signatures just as soon as the Seal Fisheries act finally passes the British Parliament. The greater part of yesterday, up to a late hour last night, was spent by the President in this work. 
--------
846-> MARINE CORPS REORGANIZATION.; MANY CHANGES PROPOSED AND TO BE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. -- Major P.C. Pope, Capt. R.S. Callum, Capt. D.P. Mannix, and First Lieut. T.C.

848-> THE ITATA BUSINESS.
According to the dispatches from San Francisco this morning, the United States war steamer Charleston sailed from that port on Saturday morning, provisioned and coaled for a long voyage, "and instead of going outside to try her guns, as was the general supposition, it is stated she has gone in pursuit of the Chilean steamer Itata, with orders to capture her."

Some of the McKinley papers made wry faces last Spring when they were asked to swallow certain paragraphs in the new Tariff bill, and the protests made by them before they were whipped into line are interesting now because of the admissions which are involved. The Boston Journal said on April 2:

850-> HOW VOTERS ARE MADE.; THE JUDGES AND THEIR SCHOOLS OF NATURALIZATION.
The most tiresome duty that the Judges of the Superior and Common Pleas Courts have to perform is the naturalization of the thousands of foreigners that wish to become invested with the rights and privileges of American citizenship -- especially just before election time. When naturalization is going on the court room is turned into a school room. 
--------
851-> VERDICT FOR THE MAYOR OF HUDSON.
ALBANY, N.Y., Feb. 5. -- In the action of the people against Henry L. Gregg and Thomas F. Hannon, the judgment of the Court of Sessions convicting defendants of misdemeanor is reversed and judgment given for the defendants on demurrer. The opinion is by Judge Mayham. The defendants are the Mayor and an Alderman of Hudson.

852-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
There seems to be no room for doubt now that the Administration is seriously considering the policy of coining the bullion bought under the act of last July into standard dollars. We say "seriously," but we are sure that none of our readers will suspect the Administration of considering the really serious feature of such a policy. It is, nevertheless, well to keep that feature in mind. 
--------
853-> SECRETS OF CORRUPTION TOLD.; HOW SOME FAT CANADIAN CONTRACTS WERE SECURED.
OTTAWA, Sept. 10. -- The investigation into the irregularities in the State Department, including the Printing Bureau, was resumed to-day. To-morrow or Tuesday the opposition hope to bring the charges home to J.A. Chapleau, Secretary of State. To-day's proceedings were lively. C.A. Danserau, Postmaster at Montreal, in the witness box said he knew Senecal very well.

854-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The grotesque ignorance of our language, laws, and institutions shown by many applicants for naturalization is amusing in a sense, but when we consider the sure consequences it is rather a dismal joke. In our news columns this morning is described the case of a would-be citizen, between whom and the Judge of the Court of Common Pleas the following colloquy took place: Judge: "Who makes the laws?" 
--------
855-> IT WILL BE EARNEST WORK; GETTING READY TO OUST THE BATTERY PARK SQUATTER. A MEETING TO BE CALLED OF THE CITIZENS' COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED -- CHAMPIONS OF THE PEOPLE -- A SMUGGLED PETITION.
It is pretty well decided that the Committee of One Hundred appointed at the Battery Park mass meeting in July will begin work in earnest in about a week. Sufficient replies have been received from members of the committee in regard to the advisability of an early meeting to warrant those who issued the circulars making this inquiry in calling such a meeting as soon as arrangements can be conveniently made for it. 
--------
856-> CANADIAN COPYRIGHT LAWS.; MINISTER THOMPSON'S REPORT TO THE GOVERNOR GENERAL
OTTAWA, Ontario, Aug. 25. -- Sir John Thompson to-day presented an important return in reference to the correspondence between the Canadian and Imperial Governments in reference to the Canadian copyright laws. The bulk of the return is composed of the full text of Sir John Thompson's memorandum to Lord Knutsford written in London in July of last year. 
--------
857-> THE CABLE STEAL AGAIN; PROSPECTS OF THE BILL PASSING THE SENATE. A REPORT THAT TAMMANY HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR ON THE "GROUND FLOOR," AND THAT GOV. HILL'S OPPOSITION HAS CEASED.
ALBANY, April 7. -- The Cable bill is almost certain to pass the Senate. Any one who witnessed the proceedings last night and again to-day could have seen that, whenever the occasion required, votes enough could be summoned in the upper house to rush the discredited measure to the Governor, who, the lobby claims, stands ready to affix his signature to it. 
--------
858-> IN AND ABOUT THE CITY; VIOLA STILL A MYSTERY. A QUEER CALLER UPON THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
The identity of "Viola Greylock," the young woman who attempted suicide at the Grand Central Station on Monday afternoon, is as much a matter of speculation as at first. She positively refuses to tell anything about herself or her friends. 
--------
859-> A STRIKE AND BOYCOTT.; ENGINEERS AND FIREMEN OF THE ST. LOUIS BELT LINE STOP WORK.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 10. -- The difficulty between the Belt Line and the Brotherhoods of Locomotive Engineers and Locomotive Firemen culminated this morning in the declaration of a strike and boycott, which is likely to be far-reaching in its effects. 
--------
860-> GROCER HOPPER DISAPPEARS.
PATERSON, N.J., Dec. 23. -- J. Copper Hopper, a well-known young grocer at 137 Main Street, has disappeared, leaving debts behind him to the amount of about $30,000, of which $12,000 is due to New-York firms and the rest to his grandfather Samuel Hopper, who now lives in Georgia, whither it is supposed the grandson has gone. The assets amount to about $3,000, covered by a bill of sale to Samuel Hopper. 
--------
861-> OUR FORCE NEAR CHILE.; THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS DOES NOT APPEAR.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- The Navy Department officials still maintain a mysterious silence in regard to all preparations for a move on Chile, but inasmuch as every day's delay puts the navy in better shape for the contemplated demonstration in Chilean waters, there is little doubt that the President's message to Congress was held back partly for this reason. 
--------
862-> GEOGRAPHIC NAMES.; PLAN ON WHICH THE GOVERNMENT BOARD IS PROCEEDING.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23. -- The President to-day transmitted to the Senate the first annual report of the Board on Geographic Names, to which is referred all unsettled questions arising in the departments concerning the orthography and nomenclature of geographic names. The decisions of the board are accepted by the departments as the standard authority in such matters.

863-> A SCORE OF FIREMEN HURT; FLAMES CUT THEM OFF ON AN ELEVATOR ANNEX ROOF. MINNEAPOLIS BUILDINGS DESTROYED -THE LOSS NEARLY $200,000 -- EXPLOSIONS FOLLOWED BY GREAT BURSTS OF FLAME.
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Sept. 24. -- In the magnificent harvest festival parade of yesterday, one of the most admired displays was that of the City Fire Department. Within less than twenty-four hours after that parade the city has been threatened with great disaster, and only after the most daring efforts of the department, and after serious injury to several of the brave firemen, was the threatened disaster averted. 
--------
864-> NEW-YORK STATE ALLIANCE.; DEMANDS FOR TAXATION OF MORTGAGES AND UNIFORM SCHOOL BOOKS.
HORNELLSVILLE, N.Y., April 23. -- The sixty delegates who yesterday began the first State Alliance meeting and devoted their time to listening to various speakers got-down to business to-day. Yesterday afternoon National President L.I. Polk presided and last night he made a public address advocating the free coinage of sliver. He was on hand again this morning. 
--------
865-> NO BOOM FOR ABBETT.; BUT THE NEW-JERSEY PICNICKERS WERE ALLOWED TO LOOK AT HIM.
Gov. Leon Abbett of New-Jersey was "in the hands of his friends" at College Point, L.I., yesterday. The occasion was the second excursion of the season given by the Dennis McLaughlin Association of Jersey City, and one of the chief objects of the outing was to advance the political standing of Gov. Abbett. According to the man who furnished dinner for the crowd there were 1,802 persons present. They came from Jersey City.

WILMINGTON, N.C., May 11. -- The steamer El Monte of the Morgan Line, from New-Orleans to New-York with a cargo of cotton, put into Southport at 9 o'clock this morning with the cotton on fire. The fire was discovered when about 100 miles south of Southport. The burned cotton will be discharged at once and the ship will probably proceed on her voyage to-morrow.

LONDON, Oct. 24. -- Winter began in Russia on Thursday with the first sharp frost. Living men cannot remember any other year in which this simple announcement meant what it does now. There are literally millions of human beings, at the furthest within a six days' journey of London, to whom this frost comes as a sentence of death by starvation.

869-> THE WASHINGTON SALE.; RELICS DISPOSED OF BY THE AUCTIONEER YESTERDAY.
PHILADELPHIA, April 23. -- The same party of book dealers, private buyers, and bibliophiles who for the last two days have been doing some sharp buying at the auction rooms of Thomas Birch's  Sons, were again on hand this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, when Auctioneer Henkles commenced the sale. Among the interested lookers-on was Mr. Benson J. Lossing, the historian. Mr. Lossing was accompanied by Mr. Ferd J. Dreer.

The Senate Committee on Cities appears to have finished its inquiries into the Dock Department yesterday, but it can hardly claim to have investigated the administration of that department. Yesterday's proceedings were practically a debate upon the policy of dock management, turning chiefly on the question of public and private ownership of the water front.

871-> YOUNG CLAY SENTENCED.; THE KENTUCKY FORGER MUST SPEND-EIGHT YEARS IN JAIL.
LEXINGTON, Ky., April 24. -- Matthew Hume Clay, the young forger who signed his aged grandfather's name to notes so freely last year in Winchester and Paris, was to-day sentenced to eight years in the penitentiary.

DETROIT, May 25. -- Devotional exercises were conducted this morning by the Rev. Franklin E. Miller of the Jersey City Presbytery. The first matter to come up was that of the proposed new seal of the General Assembly. The vast majority of the ministers of the Church never saw an impression made by the old seal, but now they are very much interested in the new one. 
--------
873-> A FOREST CLUBHOUSE.; THE SUMMER HOME IN PIKE COUNTY, PENN.
Horace Greeley, who used to make stump speeches in this region, always said Pike County was "noted for its Democrats, rattlesnakes, and bad whisky." Things have changed since Horace's day, and while some Democrats and "rattlers" still remain, plenty of Republicans can be found here, and the whisky one gets in this well-provisioned clubhouse is as good as one could wish for.

874-> CONTINENTAL FREE TRADE; THE REAL ISSUE IN THE COMING CANADIAN ELECTIONS. PROF. GOLDWIN SMITH CLEARLY OUTLINES THE PRESENT CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN DOMINION POLITICS -- WILL RECIPROCITY BE STRANGLED?
Americans, especially those who are interested in trade relations, may wish to know the meaning of the election contest in Canada, to understand the conditions under which it takes place, and to be prepared for estimating the significance of the result. I am so far qualified to inform them that I have never belonged to either of the party organizations, and am thus unbiased by the mere struggle for power.

875-> PRESIDENT GAGE TO RETIRE.; HE WILL HOLD OFFICE ONLY UNTIL APRIL AND GO INTO BANKING.
CHICAGO, Jan. 24. -- Lyman J. Gage will retire from the Presidency of the World's Columbian Exposition in April. Under no circumstances will he accept the office for another term. Within a few weeks Mr. Gage will succeed S.M. Nickerson as President of the First National Bank. He does so on condition that all of his time be devoted to that institution.

876-> FINE HORSEMANSHIP.; EXHIBITION RIDING WHICH PLEASED A GOOD MANY SPECTATORS.
There was a very pretty display of horsemanship at the Belmont Riding Academy, St. Nicholas Avenue and One Hundred and Twenty-fourth Street, last night at the first "Christmas tree ride" at that institution. The exhibition drew to the academy more spectators than could be comfortably accommodated. The building has been arranged for the use of those who go there to sit in the saddle rather than for mere lookers on. 
--------
877-> ART NOTES.
A very singular fact is noted by the American Architect with regard to its traveling scholarship, of which the second holder, Albert Kahn, has just left for Europe. It appears that only one competitor has ever appeared for the two architect scholarships of Boston in a given year. It is true that the idea is a novel one and has hardly time to have spread far, even among architects, who, presumably, read this able periodical.

878-> A DEMOCRATIC HOUSEWARMING.; MR. CLEVELAND WAS THERE AND WAS CHEERED -- HILL WASN'T.
The new home of the Democratic Club, at 617 Fifth Avenue, was properly "warmed" last evening. Grover Cleveland was there and Lieut. Gov. Jones stood beside him as he shook hands with the thousand or more gentlemen who pressed forward to exchange a word with him. Gov. Hill might have had the honor of receiving with the ex-President had he not seen fit to decline an invitation to be present.

LOS ANGELES, Cal., Feb. 21. -- The "burst boom" of Los Angeles has become proverbial. The boom was unparalleled in its inflation; its collapse was overwhelming. For months men and enterprises sank, tottered, or led a precarious existence. There were persons who predicted that the City of the Angels had received a death blow.

It is due to Secretary BLAINE to say that the official papers laid before the Dominion Parliament by the Governor General confirm what had already been admitted unofficially, the good faith in which Mr. BLAINE had warned the Canadian Commissioners, before they left Ottawa, that their visit would be useless, because the President wished to postpone negotiations until Autumn.

881-> JUST WHAT EVERYBODY EXPECTED.
The law of Directors' responsibility makes no advance in the case of the New-Haven Railroad Directors. In default of evidence that Mr. DEPEW and Mr. BRAINERD and Mr. ROCKEFELLER and their associates personally participated in the issue of orders that the cars of the New-Haven Road should be heated by stoves, in violation of the law of this State, the court directs the jury to hold them guiltless of any misdemeanor.

FOSTORIA, Ohio, Feb. 21. -- The appointment of ex-Gov. Charles Foster to the office of Secretary of the Treasury is naturally accepted by the people of this part of Ohio as only one move in the natural order of things, as he has been for so long the central figure in the world of Fostoria that her citizens do not see why he should not be a central figure in the world at large. 
--------
883-> THE BIG JUMP IN CORN.; CHICAGO BROKERS TREATED TO A SURPRISE YESTERDAY.
CHICAGO, Dec. 9. -- The advance in year corn to-day, from 48 5/8 cents to 60 cents, is proof of a corner of some kind, although not necessarily proof of a manipulated corner. There was one story to the effect that this year manipulation was being engineered by Cudahy, and that the people caught short were the Patten-Bartlett-Frazier-Andrews-Coster-Martin combination, which made it so uncomfortable for shorts in November.

MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND HUMAN ENDURANCE. -- We occupied an entire day in passing from the lower to the upper station of Cotopaxi. The labor was not severe, and the effects could only be attributed to our inability to accommodate ourselves to reduction in atmospheric pressure to as low a point as 16,500 inches.

885-> THE CARS NOT HEATED BY STOVES.; OFFICIALS SAY THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY THE ENGINE'S HEADLIGHT.
NEW-HAVEN, Feb. 21. -- General Manager Tuttle, Superintendent Shepard, and the other officials of the Consolidated Road insist that the burning of the wrecked car in the tunnel Friday morning was not due to the overturning of a stove or heater. The cars are heated by hot water forced through pipes under the seats from a patent heater.

888-> WHAT THE VAMOOSE CAN DO; MR. HEARST'S STEAM YACHT LET OUT ON THE HUDSON. SHE GIVES THE MARY POWELL A COLD SHOULDER TWICE, RUNS AWAY FROM THE NEW-YORK, AND HOLDS HER OWN WITH A PASSENGER TRAIN.
If the Vamoose, the little steam racing yacht built by the Herreshoffs and owned by W.R. Hearst, the young San Francisco millionare, is not the fastest craft afloat, then Norman L. Munroe's little Norwood must prove it. The Vamoose yesterday ran all around the fast steamer Mary Powell, on the Hudson River, and ran alongside a passenger train on the New-York Central Railroad from Yonkers to Hastings. 
--------
889-> FASSETT IS COLLECTOR; HE ASSUMED THE DUTIES OF THE PLACE YESTERDAY. THE ANSWERS MANY LETTERS, MEETS HIS SUBORDINATES, AND THEN ASKS ABOUT HE IS EXPECTED TO SIGN.

--------
892-> HOW IT HELPS POOR MEN.; THE M'KINLEY TARIFF ON SILK AND COTTON SLEEVE LININGS.
The Secretary of the Treasury has recently ordered a new classification of what is known to the trade as silk-striped cotton Italians. This stuff is used for sleeve linings. Importers say; that the operations of the tariff as to no other article better illustrate the iniquities of the new law. Many hundred thousand dollars' worth of these Italian goods are imported every year. 
--------
893-> NO LONGER A HILL BOOMER; A KENTUCKY CONGRESSMAN'S EYES ARE OPENED BY HIS CONSTITUENTS.
Saturday evening, March 7, 1891, the Hon. Asher G. Caruth, who represented the Louisville (Ky.) district in the Fifty-first Congress, and has been re-elected, arrived home from Washington.

--------
894-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The remarks of the Marquis DI RUDINI upon the relations of the Kingdom of Italy to the Papacy were perhaps objectionable as being superfluous. Nothing has lately occurred to make timely any official restatement of those relations, unless it be the disorderly conduct of the French pilgrims, the treatment of whom by the Pope left nothing to be complained of by the Italian Government. 
--------
895-> NO MORE PEARLS FROM WISCONSIN.
The pearl fishing craze in Wisconsin, which was at its height in numerous rivers a year ago, seems to have ended as speedily as it came. Pearls were found in the clams in many rivers, but none of any particular value was found except in Sugar and Pecatonica Rivers, in Southern Wisconsin. Not only has the stock of pearls been exhausted, but the clams have been practically exterminated.

NEW-ORLEANS, July 25. -- Gov. Nicholls and his friends have already opened the Gubernatorial campaign, although the election will not be held until April, 1892.

Lovers of art in Rome will be gratified by the announcement that the Italian Government has prohibited the proposed sale of the Borghese collection of pictures and statuary for the benefit of the creditors of Prince BORGHESE.

The body of Levi L. Brigham, who since 1868 had been a member of the Union League Club, was found yesterday morning in the water off Stillwell's Club House at Gravesend Beach.

--------
905-> MONEY FOR THE POOR.
A correspondent, who asks us not to publish his letter, writes us to ask why, in our judgment; "the use of both gold and silver, at a proper ratio, would not be at once safe for all interests and to the great advantage of the debtor class now cruelly oppressed by the enhancement of the value of gold." 
--------
906-> MUST NOT SELL THE REGISTER.; AN INJUCTION ISSUED AGAINST PRESIDENT JOHN H. WALLACE.
Owners of trotting horses throughout the country will be interested in learning that Judge Ingraham of the Supreme Court yesterday issued an injunction restraining John H.

It contains a large amount of valuable information which it will be well for voters to take into consideration:

The proposed Game and Fish bill which has been presented to the Legislature by the commission to codify game laws is giving general satisfaction to the fishermen in this city, if the comments heard in the tackle stores and haunts of the angling fraternity count for anything.

--------
916-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Adolphe Deckle, alias A.D. Meteline, who was employed as a gold plater by E.G. Bratmar, jeweler at 47 Cortlandt Street, yesterday was arraigned in the Tombs Police Court and held in $1,500 bail on a charge of having stolen a gold brick valued at $1,000 from his employer.

Chairman Walker, Commissioner Midgely, and President R.R. Cable of the Rock Island Road have reached Chicago from New-York, and all speak hopefully of the future of the Western Traffic Association, and seem to think that the promptness with which Jay Gould acted upon the decision of the Commissioners in the case of Traffic Manager Leeds will have a most salutary effect. 
--------
921-> OIL AS FUEL FOR SHIPS.
It is a great advance toward the employment of petroleum instead of coal for generating steam in the boilers of marine engines to find that the question is now nearly reduced to one of cost. When it comes absolutely to that point its use for some branches of navigation will be assured. 
--------
922-> TO PREVENT CHINESE RIOTS.; PROMISES MADE BY THE PEKIN GOVERNMENT RECEIVED WITH DISTRUST.
LONDON, Sept. 25. -- The following is a summary of an official Pekin cablegram, received Monday and handed to the Foreign Office authorities Tuesday:

925-> UNFAVORABLY CRITICISED.; WHAT IS SAID OF THE VERDICT OF THE PARK PLACE JURY.
The verdict rendered by the jury that sat for nine days trying to determine the cause of the terrible Park Place disaster is provoking a great deal of unfavorable comment. It is to the effect that the verdict amounts to nothing, and that the time of the twelve experts who sat on the jury and of the public officials who conducted the inquest might just as well have been spent fishing in Jamaica Bay. 
--------
926-> P.T. BARNUM.
There is hardly an American now in the vigor of life who can remember when the name of BARNUM was not familiar to him, and there are very few Americans who do not feel that they owe him a certain debt of gratitude for brightening their lives or the lives of their children. It is really wonderful and unexampled, the career that closed yesterday.

The officers of the Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Street Railroad Company explain that the reason why that road was not put in operation nearly a year ago, when it was substantially completed, is "because of their inability to make any arrangement for the use of the tracks of an existing railroad company whose cars are run in Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth Streets, between First and Second Avenues." 
--------
930-> VARIOUS BALL GAMES.; VICTORIES GAINED BY THE NEW-YORK AND BROOKLYN TEAMS YESTERDAY.

CHICAGO, Aug. 26. -- The Pacific Short Line will be offered for sale at public auction next Tuesday under foreclosure proceedings by order of the United States Circuit Court.

Since our last notice of this colossal work four volumes have made their appearance. The same promptness that has become familiar to all observers heretofore has characterized them.

This means that about four volumes have come out each year.

CHICAGO, March 26. -- The local speculative position in corn for the last sixty days has not been appreciated by many people.

ALSACE-LORRAINE, 1890. -- The German gendarmes make traveling rather a troublesome process. The whole country seems under police surveillance. It literally bristles with spiked helmets. There are policemen everywhere. You come upon them at every turn, armed as if for war with a rifle on their shoulders and a bullet in the barrel -- fierce of aspect, and ready to bully you as only German gendarmes can bully.

--------
953-> TUFTS NEW DIVINITY BUILDING.; THE CORNERSTONE LAID WITH APPROPRIATE SERVICES.
BOSTON, Oct. 25. -- The cornerstone of Tufts new Divinity Building was laid to-day. The coldness of the day served to keep many away and made the services somewhat brief.

Joy, President of the Trustees, and the Hon. Newton Tabbott, Treasurer of the college.

LONDON, Oct. 10. -- A very large number of people surrounded Walsingham Terrace this morning when the casket containing the body of Mr. Parnell was taken from the house. Inside the house there was an affecting scene. The grief of the widow was most intense, and it was with difficulty that she could be persuaded to allow the coffin to be taken away. She was utterly unable, through prostration, to accompany the body to Dublin. 
--------
955-> VERY NOVEL RAPID TRANSIT.; MR. HENNING WILL ADVOCATE HIS GRAVITY PLAN.
The scheme exploited by Mr. Benjamin S. Henning of shooting people under and across the East River through a tunnel with sharp inclines at either end by the force of gravity and the assistance of a cable clutch has been expanded by the projector into the Henning Rapid Transit Company, with the object of filling the long-felt want of quick communication between the lower end of Manhattan Island and Westchester County. 
--------
956-> CHINESE REBELS ROUTED.; THE EMPEROR ENGAGED IN LEARNING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
LONDON, Dec. 10. -- Dispatches from Pekin state that owing to the delay that has occurred in getting the Mongolian tribes together, the plan of Li Hung Chang, the Viceroy, to surround the rebels has not proved a success.

--------
957-> CALIFORNIA'S GREAT FUNNEL.; HOW ITS WATERS ARE COLLECTED AND CARRIED TO THE SEA.
The State of California in one respect is wonderfully like great bisected funnel. Nowhere on earth is there just such a system of water-flow and outlet to the sea. All the run of her waters is ultimately westward and through one single channel, the pipe or spout of the funnel. The upper portion of the funnel has a long and curious narrow rim -- in other words, its gathering bowl is strangely steep and shallow.

Ariadne's thread is required to lead us through the maze of the tariff in its relations to the woolen industry. The industry is so complicated and comprises so many subdivisions that without a rigidly-systematic treatment of the most important branches the space of a few letters would barely suffice to give an adequate idea of the importance of the subject.

PARIS, June 30. -- The fashion news being very slight in spite of the elaborate descriptions of the special publications, one has leisure to gossip about other things, and Paris, usually given over at this season of the year to the cirque d'ete and to the Neuilly foire -- of which I shall have more to say presently -- is most interesting to the lounger. 
--------
961-> BATTERY PARK.
It is hardly conceivable that the Park Commissioners of this city, with one ignoble exception, should have any other desire than to restore the beautiful park which overlooks the bay at the lower end of Manhattan Island to the people for their exclusive use as a place of healthful recreation, provided it is demonstrated to them that both the law and popular sentiment are against its further occupation for railroad purposes.

It was 3 o'clock yesterday morning before the annual meeting of the Metropolitan Association of the Amateur Athletic Union came to a close, after a continuous session of seven hours.

990-> COTTON FIRES.; CARELESS TREATMENT CAUSES SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.
I observe in your paper of July 20 and in many other papers articles upon the "Mystery of Cotton Fires," which are becoming more and more frequent, especially on shipboard.

American cotton is treated more barbarously, more unsuitably, more wastefully, and more dangerously than any other great staple of any kind -- or than any other kind of cotton in the world.

George Jones, in the course of his long and creditable career, did two pre-eminent acts of service to his time. One was his part in exposing the Tweed Ring and arousing the public to the enormity of its stealings. That alone will cause this city to honor his memory with a lasting sense of gratitude. Its recognition will be a part of the duty of American historians.

1026-> JOAQUIN MILLER'S SON.; HELD UNDER HEAVY BAIL -- HIS STORY OF HIS LIFE AND WANDERINGS.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 10. -- Harry Miller, the young son of Joaquin Miller, the poet, who was arrested on the charge of holding up the mail stage in Mendocing County, has been brought here. He claims that hunger drove him to the crime. He said: 
--------
1027-> BASEBALL BREVITIES.
Hugh Duffy, Morgan Murphy, John Fitzgerald, "Hardy" Richardson, John Stricker, Paul Radford. Thomas T. Brown, and John O'Brien yesterday signed contracts to play with the Boston Reds of the American Association for the season of 1892. Brown will receive an increase over last season's figure.

1028-> COLUMBIA COLLEGE.
The appearance of the Columbian is awaited with considerable anxiety by the students. It should have been issued about Christmas time. Yesterday it was rumored that the paper was actually in press. 
--------
1029-> THE FUTURITY STAKES.; PROBABLE STARTERS FOR THE RICHEST RACING PRIZE OF THE YEAR.
Assistant Secretary Rorke of the Coney Island Jockey Club last evening announced that the list of starters for the Futurity Stakes of $75,000, to be run on Saturday, would probably be made up of the following, the weights to be carried being figured up to last evening: 
--------
1030-> LOUISE MARY EUSTIS MARRIED.; THE HAPPY BRIDEGROOM IS THOMAS HITCHCOCK, JR., OF THIS CITY.
BOSTON, Aug. 27. -- Cross Road Cottage, at Beverly Farms, the charming Summer home of Mme. Celestine Eustis, was the scene of a notable gathering this forenoon, the occasion being the marriage of Mr. Thomas Hitchcock, Jr., of New-York and Miss Louise Mary Eustis of Washington, D.C., granddaughter of W.W. Corcoran. Contrary to general expectation the wedding was very unpretentious, all display being dispensed with. 
--------
1031-> A NIGHT FULL OF TORTURE; ALL CAUSED BY THE BASELESS FABRICATIONS OF A DREAM. THE STORY OF A MAN WHO LOST A LEG, FOUND A WIFE, MET GREAT MEN, AND SUFFERED VARIOUS ILLS WHILE LYING IN HIS OWN BED.
They were talking of dreams and several persons had told dream stories more or less interesting. Finally somebody called on Mr. Jarvis to tell his dream story. 
--------
1032-> MR. BLAINE'S DIFFICULTIES.
The task assumed by Mr. BLAINE of promoting reciprocity while adhering to the non-intercourse policy of the Republican tariff increases in difficulty with every new effort required. "Carrying water on both shoulders" is in politics something that the supple Secretary has time and again shown himself capable of, but "riding two horses" is only feasible when the animals are going in the same direction. 
--------
1033-> THE JUNTA'S WORK ENDED.; IT SURRENDERS ITS POWERS TO THE NEW CHILEAN CONGRESS.
LONDON, Nov. 11. -- A dispatch from Santiago this afternoon brings the intelligence that the Chilean Junta is prepared to surrender the executive authority it has exercised since Balmaceda's downfall to the newly-organized Congress. 
--------
1034-> GOLDWIN SMITH IN ENGLAND.; A TRIP TO ENGLAND. By Goldwin Smith. New-York: Macmillan & Co.
People may differ from Mr. Goldwin Smith, but the clearness of his style and his excellent English are at once conspicuous. He has a capital way of settling things, and seems pleased when he can so put them in direct opposition to your otherwise conceived opinions, and it may be generally conceded that Mr. Goldwin Smith is quite often as right as wrong. 
--------
1035-> THE WEST IS FOR BLAINE.; IF A.L. CONGER OF OHIO HAS GAUGED ITS SENTIMENT PROPERLY.
BAR HARBOR, Me., July 26. -- A.L. Conger of Akron, Ohio, a near relative of Senator Conger and Postmaster Conger, and a manager of Republican conventions for years past, arrived here yesterday and called on Mr. Blaine. The call was quickly returned by the Secretary and his son Emmons, who sent some time in conversation with him. 
--------
1036-> THE BROOKLYN SITUATION.
There is a somewhat curious condition of things in Brooklyn, owing to the action of the Republican City Convention, which at the last moment placed in nomination Mr. WILLIAM ZIEGLER. This gentleman's appearance in the public affairs of our sister city has been extremely interesting, but is of recent date.

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Aug. 13. -- A Unalaska correspondent writes that in a cruise in the vicinity of the seal islands, one British war ship had seen and warned one sealer, the Pheasant five, the Mohican five, and the Alert two, besides those warned by the Thetis. Many of these had to be fired on to make them halt, and only one schooner succeeded in getting away. 
--------
1038-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
If the Board of Aldermen is going to express itself upon the propriety of having Battery Park occupied for railroad purposes, the time to do so is manifestly before and not after the Park Board has acted upon the question before it. The object of such an expression should be to accomplish something in behalf of the public, and it will be of no use when the question has been decided. 
--------
1039-> THE SHERMAN AMENDMENT.
The principle of Senator SHERMAN'S amendment to the Copyright bill has received considerable support from the feeling that a free-born American should have the right to fill his library with editions of his own choosing; that if he prefers fine and costly English editions his preference ought not to be obstructed by the law. 
--------
1040-> A BURIED COMPLAINT.; FLATBUSH INSANE ASYLUM TROUBLES ARE TO CONTINUE.
The overcrowded condition of the Flatbush Insane Asylum, where 1,400 patients are crowded into a space intended for 900, and where even the damp cellar has to be used to accommodate the unfortunates, was the subject of an official complaint to the Kings County Board of Supervisors yesterday. 
--------
1041-> CURRENCY BASED ON GOLD; THAT METAL THE ONLY TRUE MEASURE OF VALUES. FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN MR. WINDMULLER AND MR. PLUMB ON THE PENDING FINANCIAL LEGISLATION -- THEIR POSITIONS.
Under date of Dec. 30 last Mr. Louis Windmuller of this city wrote Senator Plumb of Kansas a second letter criticising Mr. Plumb's position on the silver question. To that letter Mr. Windmuller received the following reply: 
--------
1042-> OPPOSITION TO TAMMANY.; PROSPECTS OF THE COUNTIES AND THE VOORHIS FACTION COMBINING.
Before this week is over the plans for a combination of the County Democracy and the Voorhis Democracy may nave developed sufficiently to indicate what sort of an anti-Tammany Democratic organization there is to be in this city in the near future. Despite the denials of certain County Democrats, it is pretty well settled that advances toward such a union have been made by the Counties as well as by the Voorhis people. 
--------
1043-> CITY AND SUBURBAN NEWS
Five thousand dollars will be spent for plants and flowers in decorating Madison Square Garden for the big masquerade ball of the Arion Society, Feb. 20. From 900 to 1,000 picturesquely-arrayed characters will be grouped on the numerous floats which will form the pageant with which the ball will be opened. The artists having the affair in charge promise that in brilliancy it will far surpass any similar event ever given in this city. 
--------
1044-> THE ALLIANCE IN VIRGINIA; IT PROPOSES TO CREATE A RAILROAD ISSUE. CANDIDATES TO BE PLEDGED IN ADVANCE TO PASS A COMMISSION BILL -- THE CORPORATIONS PREPARING TO MAKE A BIG FIGHT.
RICHMOND, Va., July 12. -- The conference held here Wednesday by the Hon. J.T. Ellyson, Chairman of the Democratic State Committee, with the leading members of the Farmers' Alliance was intended to pave the way to a thorough understanding between the leaders of that organization and those of the Democratic Party about the issues of the coming legislative campaign. 
--------
1045-> THE MARYLAND ENCAMPMENT.; ABOUT 1,500 MEN RECEIVING MILITARY INSTRUCTION.
LORELEY, Md., July 12. -- This was the first big day of the encampment of the Maryland National Guard, and thousands of people came from Baltimore and other points to see the sights and enjoy the occasion. It is one of the largest encampments in the history of the State, the total number of men being about 1,500, under five commands. 
--------
1046-> HENRY GETS HIS INJUNCTION.; THE BOARD OF ELECTRICAL CONTROL RESTRAINED FROM MAKING A CONTRACT.
Taxpayer Edward Henry's application for an injunction to restrain the Board of Electrical Control from making any contract with the Empire City Subway Company, Limited, for the construction of subways, and from taking any action toward relieving the Consolidated Telegraph and Electrical Subway Company from any of its obligations under its contract until the same should have become ineffectual, was granted yesterday by Judge Truax of the Superior Court. 
--------
1047-> DRIVEN OUT BY SPANIARDS.; THE CAROLINE ISLANDS OUTRAGES -- REPARATION TO BE DEMANDED.
BOSTON, Jan. 10. -- Among the letters received at the Mission Rooms here concerning the destruction by Spaniards of our mission buildings in Ponapi, one of the Caroline Islands, is one from Miss J.E. Fletcher, who says, in reference to the assertion of the Spaniards that the missionaries had incited the natives to revolt: 
--------
1048-> BOSTON IN ITS ELEMENT.; IT IS TO HAVE A SHORT SEASON OF THEOSOPHY.
BOSTON, April 25. -- Boston is about to enter upon a peculiarly congenial week. The town is already supposed to be able to discriminate finely between matters pertaining to the esoteric and to the exoteric undertaking, and moreover to define to a hair the various phases of occultism that attract the attention of the enlightened. 
--------
1049-> LIFE INSURANCE EXPENSES.; SOME DIFFICULTIES FOR WHICH MR. BEERS IS RESPONSIBLE.
Although the question of reducing expenses has been agitated among life insurance companies for several years, the public discussion of the affairs of the New-York Life Company has brought the matter forward as one of the most important in that field. THE NEW-YORK TIMES, in its search for criticisms against that company, has made charges of excessive expenditures which, if true in the form presented, would reflect seriously upon all the companies. 
--------
1050-> PLATT AND THE REFORMS.; LITTLE TO HOPE FOR IF HIS CANDIDATE IS ELECTED.
I had a letter in preparation in regard to what, to me, seems practical as to the duty of those who, with myself, so ardently desire real ballot reform, when my attention was called to the able letter of Gov. Chamberlain in this morning's TIMES. He expresses my own ideas so much more forcibly than I possibly could that it seems superfluous for me to furnish it. 
--------
1051-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Of course, the Republican meeting in the attractive Madison Square Garden, which is well worth seeing when there is no charge for admission, was a large one, and there was considerable display of party enthusiasm, but the speaking was of a singularly ineffective order. Mr. WARNER MILLER did not seem to feel at home, and his address was a painfully labored effort. 
--------
1052-> Editorial Article 2 -- No Title
The agreement for a close season for sealing in Bering Sea is said to be ready for signature, and the British Minister at Washington has the assent of his Government to its terms in advance. It is likely to be promulgated to-day, and with as little delay as practicable the revenue cutter Corwin will start for Alaska with such supplemental orders as the agreement makes necessary. 
--------
1053-> LEAGUE AND MACHINE.; WHAT MAY BE BEHIND THE ELECTION OF MR. BLANCHARD.
The election of James A. Blanchard to succeed William Brookfield as executive member of the delegation from the Twenty-first Assembly District to the Republican County Committee is a rather significant move. Mr. Blanchard is a T.C. Plattman. He is also the executive member from New-York State in the Executive Committee of the Republican League of the United States. 
--------
1054-> THE BERING SEA ORDERS; BLAINE'S FAILURE TO CARRY OUT ELKINS'S WISHES. THE SEALING COMPANY'S RENTAL REDUCED TO CORRESPOND WITH THE NUMBER OF SEALS ALLOWED -- THE BRITISH MINISTER'S GOOD WORK.
WASHINGTON, June 9. -- Within the next twenty-four or forty-eight hours Mr. Stephen B. Elkins and the other business friends of James G. Blaine in the North American Commercial Company will undoubtedly learn that their backer in the Cabinet has definitely failed to secure for them the coveted chance to kill all the seals they could find this year.

BUFFALO, May 12. -- The festivities arranged for the visit of ex-President Cleveland have come to a close, and to-morrow morning he will return to New-York on the limited express. 
--------
1056-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
It is very strange that Mr. CLEVELAND'S visit to his old home at Buffalo should cause Gov. HILL so much distress. He was invited there to attend the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the German Young Men's Association, of which he used to be a member, and the opening of a new house of a Democratic club that bears his name.

The completion of those plans for "harmony" in the steel-rail trade to which we recently directed attention has been delayed for some weeks by slight differences of opinion as to unimportant details, but now the end of discussion has been reached and a final settlement has been made. The resultant condition was thus described in the Commercial Bulletin's market report of yesterday: 
--------
1058-> AWARDING PUBLIC MONEYS.; APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE PARK DEPARTMENT AND "CITY RECORD."
The Board of Estimate and Apportionment considered the estimates of the Park Department yesterday. Last year's appropriation was $907,863.32. The amount asked for 1892 was $1,074,545, and the amount appropriated was $963,150. Commissioners Gallup and Tappen had some trouble in convincing the board that policemen's salaries should be raised from $1,000 to $1,100 per year. 
--------
1059-> COLUMBIA COLLEGE.
The 'Varsity crew and tug-of-war teams will go into hard training to-morrow. Capt. Metcalf of the crew is confident that his men will be quite as speedy as any crew found at New-London next Summer. Some of the old oarsmen in college, who have rowed on the 'Varsity or their class crews, are Metcalf, Robertson, Norrie, Beekman, Mellen, Chrystie, E.P. Smith, Prince, McKee, and Tuttle. 
--------
1060-> A GROWING ART CENTRE; THREE NOTABLE COLLECTIONS IN WASHINGTON. THE PAINTINGS AND SCULPTURE FOUND IN THE CORCORAN GALLERY -- SELECTIONS IN THE MENDONCA AND WAGGAMAN COLLECTIONS.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. -- The Corcoran Art Gallery stands next in importance among American collections of art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New-York. But the distance between these two institutions is considerable. Local pride and the rich gifts of its open-handed citizens have contributed to make the Metropolitan Museum superior. 
--------
1061-> HOW WALKER GOT CONTROL; THE ORDER WHICH PUT HIM OVER ALL OTHERS. ON THE PLEA OF RELIEVING THE SECRETARY OF UNNECESSARY LABOR HE MADE HIMSELF THE AUTOCRAT OF THE NAVY.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 27. -- The evil complained of in the order relating to correspondence between officers on shipboard and the Navy Department lay in its application while Acting Admiral Walker was Chief of the Bureau of Navigation. The order has never been revoked, but it appears not to have led to any usurpation of authority by the present chief of the bureau. 
--------
1062-> THREE PROBABLY DROWNED.; THE SAD ENDING OF A BOATING PARTY FROM NEW-HAVEN.
NEW-HAVEN, July 26. -- Grave fears are entertained that Hugh Dailey, for many years Prosecuting Attorney of this city and one of the most prominent Republican politicians in Connecticut, has been drowned with two companions in Long Island Sound.

1064-> LIVELY TIMES AT LENOX.; MANY FASHIONABLE PARTIES AND DANCES -- THE BOAT PARADE.
LENOX, Mass., Sept. 12. -- Everything this week has seemed to conspire for the enjoyment of the large number of city people summering in the Berkshires. The clear, cool weather, with the mercury ranging from 50 to 70, has been delightful. The week has been full of entertainment of all kinds. There have been tennis, boating, driving, parties, two elegant balls, and a score or more of dinner parties.

1065-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
From a political point of view, which is the only point of view from which it is a legitimate subject of public comment, the marriage of Mr. PARNELL comes too late. Of course, in the view of the Catholic Church, the marriage is not properly a marriage, and PARNELL has already discovered that the Church is a power to be reckoned with in Irish politics. 
--------
1066-> EMPLOYES MUST BE VOTERS.; ATTEMPT TO MAKE A STRONG POLITICAL MACHINE IN ST. LOUIS.
St. Louis, June 26. -- Another move was made to-day in the direction of converting the municipal Government into a political machine for Noonan. Action was taken by Street Commissioner Murphy that is causing a great deal of comment. Murphy is nothing if not loyal to Noonan, and it is this loyalty that is responsible for to-day's action. 
--------
1067-> OVER A HUNDRED DEAD; THE TERRIBLE DISASTER AT SPRING HILL MINES. TWO BODIES SO BADLY MUTILATED THAT THEY HAD TO BE REMOVED IN BAGS -- THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT UNKNOWN.
HALIFAX, N.S., Feb. 22. -- The first shock of yesterday's fearful disaster at Spring Hill Mines, which dazed and bewildered the people by its startling magnitude, has given place to-day to grief, despair, and gloom. The enormity of the disaster is beginning to be realized. The loss of life exceeds that in any other mining disaster in Canada. It is placed at 117 men and boys. 
--------
1068-> BEERS'S NEW LIBEL SUIT; THREE-QUARTERS OF A MILLION DEMAND OF "THE TIMES." THE NEW-YORK LIFE ASKS FOR TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE PUBLICATION AS A MATTER OF NEWS OF THE BANTA CHARGES.
The New-York Life Insurance Company finds very little business on its hands in these piping times of popular distrust of its management, and for this reason it may be pardoned for seeking employment in bringing playful suits for libel against THE TIMES for publishing the news. Yesterday the company, through its attorneys, sent the summons in its second suit against THE TIMES. 
--------
1069-> THE CONQUEROR SEIZED.; MR. VANDERBILT'S YACHT NOW IN POSSESSION OF THE GOVERNMENT.
Richard Barry, a customs official, boarded the revenue cutter W.E. Chandler yesterday afternoon and went to Stapleton, S.I., to take possession, in the name of the Government, of the steam yacht Conqueror, belonging to Frederick W. Vanderbilt. 
--------
1070-> THE ALLIANCE SURE TO WIN.; IT CAN DEFEAT INGALLS, WITH ELEVEN VOTES TO SPARE.
TOPEKA, Kan., Jan. 26. -- To-night the Alliance has gone into a Senatorial caucus with the determination to settle upon a candidate if it takes till morning. Every candidate has been required to give his pledge to abide the result of to-night's meeting, and each Alliance member of the Legislature has taken an oath to vote for the caucus nominee. 
--------
1071-> THE NEW WRAPS.
" Are they pretty?" That is woman's first question about hats, wraps, and gowns at the beginning of every season. Naturally, too, since her own beauty depends so entirely upon them. Cynical and heretical? No, because the woman does not live so beautiful that bad dressing will not obliterate her beauty for the general eye, while every one knows that elegant gowning will make the homeliest woman pleasant to look upon. 
--------
1072-> SHALL THE CATHEDRAL BE ROMANESQUE?
Architects are so dependent on the persons or corporations who are their employers that it is impossible for them to move in advance of the average of culture among the people. Draughtsmen, glass stainers, painters, and even sculptors, can break a path by following the promptings of their own genius and wait for the ruck of amateurs to overtake them and their meaning.

The Assembly Committee on Taxation and Retrenchment yesterday reported favorably, by a vote of 6 to 5, one of the Tax-Revision bills, that introduced by Mr. KEELER of St. Lawrence County, but it was attacked with so much vigor by Gen. HUSTED and others that it was recommitted. 
--------
1074-> JEWELS THIEVES SECURED.; THE STORY OF THE ROBBERY OF MR. PEABODY'S TRUNK.
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Dec. 11. -- To-day's developments in connection with the diamond robbery of which A. Peabody of A. Peabody  Co. of New-York was the victim show that the robbers got about $18,000 worth of jewels. The men who committed the robbery were James Weakley and Joseph McNevin, members of what is locally known as the "Gratiot Street gang." 
--------
1075-> SIGNIFICANT LOCAL ELECTIONS.
Town and city elections ought to turn upon questions of local administration and the character of candidates for local offices and to have no political significance, but so long as the nominations are made by political parties and these contend with each other for the control of local affairs, this will not be the case. 
--------
1076-> PHILADELPHIA, 3; BROOKLYN, 1.
PHILADELPHIA, April 25. --The Phillies won their third straight game from Brooklyn this afternoon by a little lucky hitting in the seventh inning, when they secured two runs after two men had been retired. Both pitchers were in prime fettle, and each was accorded admirable support. O'Brien and Collins were each fined $10 in the fourth inning for talking back to the umpire. 
--------
1077-> AN EXAMPLE FROM GERMANY.
Some weeks ago we directed attention to the action taken by the combination of German rolling mills. A meeting was held at which "it was stated that the prices for rolled iron had sunk below the price of imported rolled iron, duty paid," and "the result of the deliberations was an advance of the prices for rolled iron to 130 marks per ton." 
--------
1078-> THREE OFFICIAL REPORTS; DISCUSSING THE CAUSES OF THE PARK PLACE DISASTER. THE FIRE MARSHAL, SUPERINTENDENT OF BUILDINGS, AND ACTING CHIEF EACH HAS HIS SAY -- THE EXPLOSION THEORY SUSTAINED.
The Fire Commissioners have received official reports on the Park Place disaster from Fire Marshal Mitchei, Superintendent of Buildings Brady, and Acting Fire Chief Reilly. They all state that the catastrophe was the result of an explosion, though there is that in Superintendent Brady's report which clearly indicates that even while he wrote of an explosion he had the theory of the collapse of the building through overweight in his mind. 
--------
1079-> A TEXAS TRAGEDY.; THE BULLET MEANT FOR A RIVAL KILLS A DEAR FRIEND.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Nov. 11. -- Near Lagarto, an isolated little town in Live Oak County, one night last week occurred a very peculiar murder. Antonio Vera and Sebastian Torres, well-to-do Mexican ranchos, loved a girl named Chiquita Flores. Vera first met Chiquita, courted her, and was to marry her when the Fall crop of cattle was sold. 
--------
1080-> MILITARY INSTRUCTION IN COLLEGES.
The recent action of Congress has increased from 50 to 75 the number of army officers who may be detailed to schools and colleges as instructors in military science and tactics, so that the aggregate both of army and navy officers who can hereafter be so assigned will become 85. There are indications from applications already filed that places for many of the additional number authorized will soon be found. 
--------
1081-> LECTURES TO TEACHERS; PROF. BICKMORE TALKS ON INTERESTING SUBJECTS. LOWER EGYPT WAS THE SUBJECT OF HIS DISCOURSE AND INCIDENTALLY THE SOURCES OF THE NILE -- ROUTES OF AFRICAN EXPLORERS.
Prof. Albert S. Bickmore gave the first of the Autumn course of lectures to teachers yesterday under the auspices of the State Department of Public Instruction, at the American Museum of Natural History in Central Park. The course will consist of ten lectures on geography and zoology, illustrated with stereoptican views. Prof. Bickmore said yesterday he would give some of the results of his travels in Labrador during the past Summer.

1082-> BEATEN BY A SINGLE RUN; THE BROOKLYN PLAYERS FAILED TO HIT A NEW PITCHER. CASSIAN, FORMERLY OF THE NEW-BRITAIN CLUB, PROVED AN ENIGMA TO THE BRIDEGROOM BATSMEN, AND THE PHILADELPHIAS WON.
PHILADELPHIA, June 26. -- The Philadelphias surprised the local public to-day by defeating the Brooklyns. They won their victory principally through the efforts of Cassian, a youngster from New-Britain, Conn., who occupied the box and performed capital work. He also made one of the hits which helped the home team to win. Cassian was put in on trial, and if he keeps up to-day's work he will certainly be a fixture on the team. 
--------
1083-> POLITICAL NOTES.
The Christian Inquirer, one of the leading Baptist newspapers of the country, says: "The uppermost question in society is that which relates to the destruction of the huge octopus, the saloon. Attention is turned to it just now with new interest, because the Republican party has given up its abortive attempt to handle it. 
--------
1084-> AFFAIRS IN SAMOA.; A WAR BETWEEN THE FACTIONS LIKELY TO BREAK OUT.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 26. -- Among the passengers on the steamer Mariposa from Samoa was the United States Land Commissioner, H.C. Ide, who was sent down to Samoa to straighten out the land titles in conjunction with the English and German Commissioners. Mr. Ide was compelled to resign his position on account of illness in his family. Speaking of the affairs in Samoa, he said:

1085-> ANOTHER BIG STRIKE.; CLOAK MAKERS AND CUTTERS QUIT WORK IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS.
About 1,000 cloak makers, cutters, finishers, and pressers, who worked for the firms of Julius Stein  Co. of 507 Broadway, and Freedman Brothers of 332 Canal Street, went out on strike yesterday in obedience to the orders of the Consolidated Board of Cloak Cutters and Operatives. Several cloak cutters in the employ of Benjamin  Caspary, in Broome Street, also struck.

1086-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Four per cent. tax certificates of the city of Brooklyn, running three years, ought to be a good investment; but Controller JACKSON'S advertised offer to sell $1,000,000 of the certificates brought bids for only $300,000. Two weeks ago $800,000 of 3 per cent. Brooklyn bonds were offered for sale, and not a single bid was received. 
--------
1087-> WHAT IS THE ALLIANCE ISSUE?
It is growing more and more uncertain what the real basis of the third party movement is to be by the time the national campaign of next year opens. It has been supposed that such a movement, if it is to acquire any considerable volume, would proceed from the Farmers' Alliance, but it is difficult to say what the distinctive issue of that organization is. 
--------
1088-> MOURNING IN BRIDGEPORT.; HONOR TO THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT SHOWMAN.
BRIDGEPORT, April 8. -- On every side to-day there is evidence of mourning for the death of P.T. Barnum. In nearly every store window and in banks and offices may be seen a likeness of the kindly face of the veteran showman, draped in black. Public buildings are draped in mourning and flags are displayed at half mast all over the city. 
--------
1089-> AN AUDACIOUS PROPOSITION.; THE BOARD OF EDUCATION PROMPTLY SQUELCHED IT.
There was a meeting of the Special Committee on Legislation of the Board of Education, of which Commissioner Randolph Guggenheimer is the Chairman, recently, the usual dull routine of which was relieved by an inquiry into one of the most audacious bills ever introduced at Albany. It was Assemblyman Martin's bill to amend the law relating to the election and tenure of office of the New-York City Superintendent of Schools and his assistants.

1090-> CLEVELAND THE RIGHT MAN.; OWEN SCOTT TELLS WHY HE SHOULD BE NOMINATED.
ST. LOUIS, Aug. 27. -- Mr. Owen Scott of Bloomington, Ill., a prominent politician and member of Congress for the Fourteenth Illinois District, speaking of the Presidential possibilities for the coming election said:

The customary Summer visit of the North Atlantic squadron to Halifax has been made this year by a very modest force, consisting only of the Philadelphia and Petrel, under Admiral GHERARDI. They will remain but a few days in the Dominion port before proceeding to the annual delectation of Bar Harbor by their presence. 
--------
1093-> A PUZZLE FOR THE ALLIANCE.; THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONER PROBLEM IN NORTH CAROLINA.
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Jan. 11. -- The political see in North Carolina has been disturbed for the past six months by the Alliance men's opposition to Mr. Vance's return to the Senate, and now, since this opposition has abated and Vance's hopes have been inspired by the unity in the ranks of the hayseed Legislature for him, another obstruction has fallen in the way of the onward march of this farmer delegation. 
--------
1094-> A CONTRAST.
Our London dispatches yesterday morning reported the impression that prevails among observers of European politics that the tie binding the members of the triple alliance is so far loosened that it may be regarded as practically severed, and that the three great powers of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy are seriously considering a general reduction of armaments. 
--------
1095-> OHIO DEMOCRATS' PLANS.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 9. -- The caucus of Democratic members of the General Assembly has decided to push the Buchanan bill providing for the choice of Presidential Electors by Congressional districts. Two Democratic Senators, Howe and Lowery, oppose it, and it is believed it will not pass. 
--------
1096-> THE GRAND DUKE IN FRANCE.; CROWDS CHEER ALEXIS ON HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS.
PARIS, Aug. 13. -- The Grand Duke Alexis has left this city for Vichy. The enthusiasm evoked by the visit of the brother of the Czar has lost none of its force by the personal contact of the Parisians with the tall, fine-looking Russian Admiral, and upon every occasion when he has shown himself to the public he has received greetings that have amounted to ovations. 
--------
1097-> BROOKLYN'S BIG WARRIORS; LIGHT THROWN ON THE INNER SIDE OF LOCAL POLITICS. " BOSS" M'LAUGHLIN'S CHOICE FOR GOVERNOR -- DISSATISFACTION EXPRESSED WITH THE REPUBLICAN STATE TICKET -- M'GUIRE'S CHOICE.
The recent conference between Gov. Hill and Hugh McLaughlin at which, it is now generally known, the latter offered to mortgage the future actions of Kings County for several years to come, and the former had to confess that he could not prevent Roswell P. Flower's nomination if he tried to, has left the Kings County Democracy way out at sea. The leaders evidently don't know what to do except to denounce Hill. 
--------
1098-> PRICES FOR AUTOGRAPH LETTERS.
Some idea of the value of autograph letters and manuscripts may be gathered from the new catalogue of Messrs. J. Pearson  Co. of Pall Mall. For a gossipy letter of Jane Austen's, four closely written pages, 10 10s. is the price. Robert Bloomfield has been almost forgotten, and one of his letters can be had for a couple of guineas. 
--------
1099-> THE CAMPBELL ROBBERY.; ST. LOUIS DETECTIVES BELIEVE THAT IT NEVER TOOK PLACE.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 11. -- The detectives have been at work on the mysterious robbery of the residence of Banker James Campbell and have found some very queer developments. 
--------
1100-> THE MANIPUR MASSACRE AVENGED.; TWO OF THE LEADING INSTIGATORS PUBLICLY EXECUTED.

It were unprofitable to philosophize over the methods of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. And it strikes us that the manner in which he decks his stories, rather than the spirit of them, has attracted the attention of reviewers.

1121-> THE SUB-TREASURY PLAN.; ALREADY EFFECTUALLY KILLED IN MISSISSIPPI.
NEW-ORLEANS, La., July 27. -- The action of the Mississippi Democratic Convention at its meeting on July 15, when it pronounced so strongly against the Sub-Treasury scheme, appears to have killed that measure in the State.

There is nothing in the newspaper literature of the day to compare with the" round unvarnished tale" which THE NEW-YORK TIMES told on Friday last of the honorable life and public services of its founder, George Jones. The beauty and force of the narrative were heightened by its perfect simplicity, and must have made a good impression upon a thoughtful and discriminating public. 
--------
1177-> REVENUE MARINE REFORM.; A NEW ORDER PRESCRIBING UNIFORMS OF OFFICERS.
WASHINGTON, June 11. -- About the 1st of July a general order will be issued by the Secretary of the Treasury directing all officers of the United States Revenue Marine to provide themselves with the regular navy uniform.

Judge Bartlett, in the Supreme Court Brooklyn, yesterday granted a writ of certiorari directing President Howell and the New-York and Brooklyn Bridge Trustees to review the proceedings which resulted in the dismissal of Bridge Policeman Warren Foster.

--------
1180-> THE CORTLAND NORMAL.; MORE TROUBLE CAUSED BY A RESIGNATION -- PROF. HOOSE'S POSITION.
CORTLAND, N.Y., Aug. 28. -- The State Normal School will open Wednesday next. It will not be without trouble. This trouble was augmented to-day by the resignation of Bruce Smith of the local board. This, with the death of Henry Brewer, leaves two vacancies in the board. Mr. Smith has resigned solely because the other members of the board influenced Superintendent Draper to remove Principal Hoose. 
--------
1181-> HER POINT OF VIEW.
A New-York woman, who came to town from her suburban boarding place one day last week to look for an apartment, had an experience whose recital may be a caution to other flat hunters.

ASHEVILLE, N.C., Feb. 8. -- It is safe to say that no one can form a deception of "a mountain town" that does not in some respects resemble Asheville. It answers that description in every respect. Situated in the heart of the mountain region of Western North Carolina, near where the Blue Ridge and Appalachian Ranges meet, the dweller in it sees mountains wherever he looks. 
--------
1183-> IDENTIFIED AT LAST.; THE CROTON SUICIDE WAS MARIE EUGENIE JOSEPHINE.
The identity of the young woman who was found drowned in the Hudson River at Croton on Saturday morning a week ago was established last night when two young women went to the undertaking establishment in Tarrytown while Coroner Sutton was holding his inquest in the case. They asked to see the body, and said they had just arrived from New-York.

1184-> CANADIAN TORIES ALARMED; INDICATIONS POINT TO A BIG LIBERAL VICTORY. THE GOVERNMENT RELYING FOR SUPPORT ON HER MAJESTY'S LOYAL SUBJECTS -- THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILROAD COMES OUT FOR THE PREMIER.
OTTAWA, Feb. 24. -- Indications for the past week point to a Liberal majority of 15 or 20 for the entire Dominion. The Conservatives are working themselves into a frenzy over the alleged treason of the Liberals, and to-day's disclosures by Sir John with respect to the correspondence between Congressman Hilt and Mr. Edward Farrer, editor of the Toronto Globe, and Mr. Erastus Wiman show the extremities to which the Government have been reduced. 
--------

Efforts to reorganize the Amateur Athletic Union were made yesterday at the Astor House in this city, at Philadelphia, and at Detroit. To-day at Boston efforts to this end will be continued, and it is hoped, especially by the smaller athletic clubs throughout the East, that soon this great organization will comprise associations of clubs instead of the clubs themselves. 
--------
1187-> THIS WAS NOT FOOTBALL.; IT LOOKED MORE LIKE A PRIZE FIGHT -- CORNELL MEN ANGRY.
CHICAGO, Nov. 27. -- Assistant Manager Baldwin of the Cornell team was very indignant at the way Galbraith of the Cornell team was beaten by some one on the All University team on Thanksgiving Day. Galbraith was hurt in an encounter with Alford, the left half back of the All University team. Baldwin said, in speaking about it: 
--------

WEST POINT, N.Y., Nov. 7. -- The Military Academy football eleven, with their substitutes and a score of enthusiastic officers, left to-day for Annapolis, where the annual game of football between the two academies will be played to-morrow.

The ribbons over the stallion were held by the redoubtable Budd Doble. The first quarter was made steady and firm in 0:36 1/2. 
--------
1191-> WATER METERS PREVENT WASTE.
What is to hinder regulation of the water supply by controlling the consumption and preventing waste? As a stranger, visiting this city from time to time. I have been amazed at the immense waste of water from defective or wornout plumbing. Other places have a bountiful supply of water without waste by simply measuring the water, like gas, to the consumer. 
--------
1192-> EARTHQUAKE IN JAPAN.; LOSS OF 300 LIVES AND MUCH PROPERTY AT OSAKA.
LONDON, Oct. 28, -- Dispatches were received here this evening from Japan announcing that there had been an earthquake at Hiogo, and the rumor was current that a great amount of property had been destroyed and that the loss of life had been considerable. The telegraph wires are down beyond Hiogo and Osaka. 
--------
1193-> ART NOTES.
Notwithstanding objections on the part of members of the Chamber of Deputies, who called attention to the fact that Greece claims all original statues and other works of art found on her soil, the $100,000 demanded for the purchase and excavation of Delphi were voted by 341 members against 61 in the negative. It looks very much as if the proverbial astuteness of the Greeks had not failed them in the case of Delphi. 
--------
1194-> NEWS OF FOREIGN NAVIES.
Since the unfortunate mishap to the Serpent, the following order has been issued to commanding officers of her Majesty's ships: "One Lieutenant or sub-Lieutenant and (in ships bearing them) one midshipman shall be directed to take the requisite observations, work the reckoning, and determine the error of the standard compass daily when at sea, independently of the navigating officer.

PAUL, Minn., Nov. 13. -- It is learned that the conferences that have been going on here for the past twenty-four hours between the Democratic Mayors of St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Stillwater, and the Alliance leaders of the First Second and Fifth Minnesota Congressional Districts had for their object the laying of the groundwork for Democratic fusion on Presidential Electors and the State ticket next year. 
--------
1197-> AMUSEMENTS.; THE GRUNFELD RECITALS.
The second recital of Alfred and Heinrich Grunfeld at the Madison Square Garden Concert Hall last evening, was attended by a large and generously-disposed audience. After a second hearing, it is possible to arrive at something like a definite conclusion in regard to the merits of those two musicians. Together, they are a combination in which there is much merit, for their mastery of ensemble playing is full and instructive. 
--------
1198-> SPENCER TELLS HIS STORY.; HE AIRS HIS GRIEVANCES AGAINST THE CIVIL SERVICE BOARD.
The committee of the Twenty-first Assembly District Republicans which is going to examine the workings of the Civil Service Examining Board at the Custom House held another meeting yesterday in the office of Charles A.

--------
1200-> LOOK OUT FOR FORGED CHECKS.; AN UNSUCCESSFUL EFFORT TO SWINDLE TIFFANY & CO.
BOSTON, Oct. 12. -- Worthless checks have reached this city purporting to have been signed by E.V.R. Thayer of Boston, payable to C.W. Page of New-York and indorsed by Page. Mr. Thayer has had no dealings with any such person, and his name is forged. Tiffany  Co. appear to have cashed one for $300 and Knox Brothers one for $50.

1201-> DAVID B.'S LITTLE FEELER; THROUGH HIS EDITOR HE DISCUSSES THIRD-TERMERS. HE JABS HIS PEN INTO THE SCALEMAKER OF BINGHAMTON AND SPATTERS HIM WITH INK -- SOME "PRE-CONVENTION TALK" WHICH WILL AMUSE THE CHILDREN.
ALBANY, June 11. -- To-night the Governor, through his newspaper organ, indulges in what he terms "pro-convention talk." He starts off with the declaration that "there is a strong probability, amounting almost to a certainty" that the Democratic ticket will be successful, and then remarks that it is not to be wondered at that much speculation should have been indulged in as to who the Democratic candidate for that great office will be. 
--------
1202-> A MONTH OF BRIGHT STARS; PLANETARY FORECAST OF THE HEAVENS FOR JULY. FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR ASTRONOMICAL STUDY -- NOTABLE THINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN -- MORNING AND EVENING TWINKLERS.
July is the month when outdoor life is found most attractive, and those who take pleasure in the study of the gem-studded heavens will find many favorable conditions beneath the grand sky roach under which to pursue their observations. The planets, the moon, and the Summer stars make the July nights, whether at seashore or mountain resort, as beautiful as a dream. 
--------
1203-> POLITICS AND INSURANCE.; MARYLAND FRATERNAL SOCIETIES TO OPPOSE CANDIDATE POE.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 27. -- A movement from an unexpected quarter has been begun against John P. Poe, the Democratic nominee for Attorney General, and unless it is checked it will probably bring about his defeat in spite of the fact that he was nominated unanimously and was considered one of the strongest men on the ticket. 
--------
1204-> ABOUT TO CONSOLIDATE.; ST. LUKE'S HOSPITAL AND THE HOUSE OF REST FOR CONSUMPTIVES.
Ever since last Fall negotiations have been going on between the representatives of St. Luke's Hospital and the House of Rest for Consumptives at 1,831 Anthony Avenue with a view to a final consolidation of the two institutions. Monday night such action was taken by the Trustees of St. Luke's Hospital that to bring about consolidation there is now only necessary favorable action by the Trustees of the House of Rest.

In the Jefferson Market Police Court yesterday, Capt. R.H. Bowman of Los Angeles, Cal., appeared against R.D. Mountdore, a banker and broker, of 510 Fifth Avenue.

PEEKSKILL, July 28. -- Everybody was ready to turn out at revielle this morning, for the night had been cold, so cold, in fact, that four and five thicknesses of Quartermaster's Department blankets proved insufficient for comfort. The early company drills in skirmish exercises warmed the men up, however, and sent them to breakfast at 7:30 o'clock with ravenous appetites. 
--------
1209-> BLAINE'S SCHEMES IN HAITI; FLATTERING COURTESIES TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC. HIPPOLYTE IS RECEIVED ON BOARD THE PHILADELPHIA WITH DISTINGUISHED HONORS -- WHAT THE SECRETARY SEEKS.
PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 14. -- Were it not for the constant presence of the United States naval squadron on this coast and for the ever-changing crop of rumors arising therefrom, Haiti would sink back into the merited obscurity from which it emerged two years ago, when Uncle Sam condescended to take an interest in a so-called revolution which was really only a local squabble for plunder. 
--------
1210-> THE NEW BERTHIER RIFLE.; IT IS NOW MANUFACTURING IN FRANCE FOR USE BY CAVALRY.
The new Berthier rifle, now being manufactured in France for the cavalry and which, it is expected, will be issued to some extent for naval use, is, in general principle, the American Lee gun.

--------
1211-> SOCIAL LIFE IN THE ORANGES.; AN AMATEUR MINSTREL PERFORMANCE AND OTHER EVENTS.
ORANGE, N.J., Dec. 12. -- The second season of the Orange Athletic Club Glee Club was opened Wednesday night with a minstrel performance in the large tennis building at the rear of the clubhouse in East Orange.

One of the features of the day was Edward Hanlan's exhibition. 
--------
1214-> CONSOLIDATING THE METROPOLIS.
The commission created last year to inquire into the question of uniting New-York and Brooklyn and their immediate surroundings into one municipality has been rather slow in announcing the result of its studies. It seems to have only got so far as to formulate a proposition for its own consideration, and it is doubtful if it will be ready to make a definite report to the Legislature at the present session.

--------
1218-> Editorial Article 5 -- No Title
The proceedings had yesterday at the breaking of ground for the Grant Monument were appropriate and impressive. Nevertheless, the status of the project is not creditable to the city or to the country. It is nearly six years since Gen. GRANT died. The monument to his memory ought now to be well advanced in construction, and ample funds ought to be available for its completion. 
--------
1219-> A BASIC STEEL BANQUET.
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 12. -- A banquet was given this evening at the Read House to celebrate the commencement of the manufacture of basic steel in this city.

CINCINNATI, Sept. 13. -- Vera Ava still remains either the heroine of a romantic episode or the victim of a cruel outrage.

Dr. Bonnell of New-York, who knows Dis Debar, saw Miss Vera Ava, called on her last evening, and said: "This is not Dis Debar." 
--------
1222-> PRINCETON'S CANE RUSH.; IT WAS A QUIET AND ORDERLY AFFAIR AND NO ONE WAS HURT.
PRINCETON, N.J., Nov. 13. -- The annual cane spree between the freshman and sophomore classes was held Thursday night on the campus in front of Witherspoon Hall. This is an old-time custom and does not savor of the roughness of the general cane rush as it is held in other colleges, but it is more a trial of strength and skill, in which the better man wins. 
--------
1223-> THEY MUST HAVE A SUBSIDY.
The McKinley newspapers continue to tell their readers that bar tin could not now be produced at the California mine if there had not been inserted in the McKinley act a paragraph imposing a duty on imported bar tin two years hence. To them every part of that act is sacred, and no one but "an enemy of his country" can question the wisdom of a sentence or a word in it.

The tenth annual convention of the Church Temperance Society met yesterday at Annex Hall, 16 Fourth Avenue.

If the Twenty-first District Republicans who are investigating the Civil Service Examining Board of the Custom House obtained any comfort from yesterday's, hearing they must have found it in something which did not appear on the surface. As on the day before, Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt did not let the investigation lag.

A gentleman who signs his communication "A Looker-On in Vienna" writes to THE TIMES to complain in forcible but courteous language of the remarks made in this column last Sunday about the stockholders of the Metropolitan Opera House.

1270-> NATIONAL GUARD GOSSIP.
The week's stay of the Seventh Regiment at the State Camp of Instruction, which closed yesterday, will go on record as a red-letter event in the history of the organization.

--------
1278-> BRITISH MARINES.; THEY ARE CONSIDERED THE MOST USEFUL MEN ABOARD SHIP.
Your article entitled "Everybody Should Work," in which are suggested methods by which the marines in the United States Navy should be turned to better account, leads me to a brief description of the services of the marines in the British Navy. 
--------
1279-> NEW-JERSEY'S RIPARIAN RIGHTS.; THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ABBETT'S BOARD DO NOT AGREE.
The United States authorities are hauling Gov. Abbett's State Riparian Board over the coals for an invasion of territory they have no right to go upon.

Abbett's State Board wanted to gobble up the reefs at deep water in the name of the State and sell them for commercial use. 
--------

--------
1281-> A FINE RECORD FOR TRINITY.
HARTFORD, Nov. 14. -- Trinity closed a very successful season to-day by defeating the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 22 to 0.

A large crowd witnessed the game, and every good play was fully appreciated. 
--------
1282-> DOUBLED ON HIS TRACKS; GOV. ABBETT AND HIS SUBSERVLENT STATE BOARDS. IT SUITS HIS PURPOSE TO UTILIZE THE SAME MACHINE THAT HE VIGOROUSLY DENOUNCED WHEN IT WAS RUN BY THE REPUBLICANS.
TRENTON, March 29. -- Gov. Abbett's attempt to direct the management of local affairs from the State Capitol through the agency of his elaborate system of State Commissions has served to revive the recollection of his memorable fight against legislative commissions in the early seventies. The Republicans had secured control of the two houses and had redistricted the State so as to make a Democratic majority in the Legislature a political impossibility. 
--------
1283-> Article 3 -- No Title
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Dec. 12. -- The storm which raged here yesterday has somewhat abated. A review of its work places the loss at about $15,000.

1285-> WORK FOR ARTIST-ARTISANS.; MR. STIMSON ON THE NEEDS OF HIS INSTITUTE.
Your editorial article of a few days ago frankly and kindly put the query whether this institute was to continue. As the date draws near for a decision, will you kindly allow me these few words, which, from my somewhat public record and the publicity of the interest, seems only appropriate? 
--------
1286-> A GERMAN OPINION OF BEERS.; MR. BANTAMS CHARGES PRESENTED TO FOREIGN POLICY HOLDERS.
The affairs of the New York Life Insurance Company continue to occupy the attention of business circles and of the public press in New-York in an extraordinary manner. The State Superintendent has not yet published any reported concerning the investigation, and it is said that the investigation has not yet been completed. 
--------
1287-> CLINGING TO PLATTISM.
A good deal of party infatuation has been exhibited in the Republican interpretation of the significance of the recent elections. The plain fact is that national issues entered largely into the contests in the several States, and in a general way the people passed judgment upon the relative merits of the party policies involving those issues, but in each State the result was affected in a greater or less degree by local causes. 
--------
1288-> ENGLAND'S GREAT BLIZZARD; SEVENTY LIVES AT LEAST LOST OFF THE COAST. AN UNKNOWN STEAMSHIP WRECKED OFF START POINT -- THE RAILROADS STILL BLOCKADED BY SNOW -- A SEVERE FROST FOLLOWS THE STORM.

1290-> TOM GOULD, LICENSED THUG; DESCRIPTION OF THE RESORT WHERE WOGAN WAS KILLED. BEYOND QUESTION THE WICKEDEST PLACE IN NEW-YORK -- A VERITABLE DEN OF THIEVES -- ROBBERY ITS CHIEF SOURCE OF INCOME.
If the killing of John J. Wogan by Joseph Selling should have for one of its effects the closing of Tom Gould's infamous "den" at Sixth Avenue and Twenty-third Street, there would be much in that fact to mitigate the crime of the murder. 
--------
1291-> PHILADELPHIA'S CHURCH FIRE.
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 26. -- The origin of the fire at the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity still remains a mystery. This afternoon the church was visited by a large number of people, most of them belonging to the congregation. The altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary presented a wrecked appearance, while the high altar was badly damaged. 
--------
1292-> THE EAST RIVER SUICIDE.; W.D. MADIGAN IDENTIFIES THE BODY AS THAT OF HIS SISTER.

--------
1293-> HOLIDAY PARTY GOWNS.
The gowns prepared for the holiday festivities are distinguished by their exquisite coloring. Layers of colored tulle over satin, puffs and frills of chiffon, glittering spangles colored like the transparent fabrics which they adorn, soft ruches of silk, berthas of showy lace, brocade and satin ribbons in belts and sashes and Watteau falls, delicately tinted satin brocade, gayly striped moire, costly fur, all contribute to the general effect of wonderful coloring. 
--------
1294-> NO FURY LIKE AN ARTIST SCORNED.
A cable from Vienna which purports to give a bit of news regarding the purchase of MILLET'S "Angelus" coming from VASSILI VERESTCHAGIN, the Russian artist, bears its own refutation with it. Mr. VERESTCHAGIN is made to say in the Neue Freie Presse of Vienna that the sale of "The Angelus" was fraudulent. 
--------
1295-> UNDER THE SUBSIDY BILL; LINES WHICH THE GOVERNMENT WISHES TO HELP. MAIL LETTINGS BY THE POSTMASTER GENERAL UNDER THE POSTAL AID BILL -- A LIST OF THE LINES WHICH HE SEEKS TO ESTABLISH.

--------
1300-> THE CATHOLIC CLUB'S NEW HOUSE.; A HOME THAT ANY CLUB MIGHT BE PROUD OF.
The future home of the Catholic Club of this city is nearly ready for occupancy. It is a building which, in exterior appearance and interior arrangements and furnishings, would commend itself to any club in the city, and in location it is certainly equal, if not superior, to any other clubhouse here. 
--------
1301-> TWO THOMAS MONAGHANS.; A CURIOUS WILL CONTEST PENDING IN THE SURROGATE'S OFFICE.
The hearing in a will contest in which are involved some curious features was begun yesterday before Surrogate Ransom.

The coming test of ship armor, which is to take place on the new naval ordnance proving grounds at Indian Head, will be of great interest and importance in several ways.

Tuesday evening the first subscription concert of the New-York Philharmonic Club took place in the Casino. 
--------
1305-> PARNELL'S MANIFESTO.
Mr. PARNELL'S tours of this country apparently have not had the effect of impressing him very deeply with the intelligence of its inhabitants, either American or Irish-American. If they had had this effect he would scarcely have ventured to issue "to the Irish People of America" the address that is transmitted by the cable. 
--------
1306-> Editorial Article 1 -- No Title
Most unfortunately the news that Santiago is greatly excited over a report that the Chilean Legation in Washington has been attacked by the infuriated citizens of this Republic invests with an aspect of farce an otherwise serious and unpleasant international situation. It is not surprising that the Chilean Junta should disclaim responsibility for the murderous attack on the sailors of our men-of-war.

OTTAWA, Ontario, May 30. -- Tenaciously still does the veteran Premier of Canada hold to life. Last evening it was officially announced that he could not pass the night.

Jay Gould and Russell Sage are unique among the millionaires of this town in having new or no club affiliations.

It undoubtedly is the dull season in amateur photography, but no one would suspect it who, on a fair Saturday afternoon, watches the young men and women who pass into the Park or ascend the stairs of the elevated stations with their little boxes jauntily secured by straps thrown over the shoulders. They are starting out on picture-taking excursions.

The first few warm days of Spring bring special delight to the amateur photographers.

It is noticeable that the recent riots in China seem to have started from a source like that of the former ones in Corea -- the spreading of a rumor among ignorant people that the missionaries were killing the native children in order to "make medicine" of them.

1392-> THE PENSACOLA'S JOURNEY.; NO UNEASINESS FELT IN WASHINGTON ABOUT HER SAFETY.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15. -- As the result of the publication of a letter from the Pensacola, in which that vessel was declared to be unseaworthy, the families of officers and others on board her have felt much uneasiness since she sailed from San Francisco for Honolulu last week, and a number of inquiries as to her condition have been made at the department. 
--------
1393-> PHILLIES AND CHICAGOS ONE EACH.
PHILADELPHIA, May 30. -- The Phillies practically won this morning's game from Chicago in the first inning, when they scored 3 runs on Hamilton's base on balls, Anson's fumble of Delehanty's grounder, Thompson's single, Myers's out, and Clements's double. Delahanty made the rankest kind of a muff of Ryan's fly and 2 runs came in. Pfeffer's base on balls and singles by Wilmot and Hutchison gave Chicago its third run in the ninth.

ASBURY PARK, N.J., Aug. 15. -- The crowd of Summer visitors has taken complete possession of Asbury Park, much to the delight of the hotelkeepers and merchants, who are expected to make enough money in three months to keep them for the remaining nine months of the year.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 28. -- The Rev. Thomas Hill, D.D., LL.D., S.J.D., President of Harvard College from 1862 to 1868, died at Waltham, Mass., on Saturday, Nov. 21. The following obituary, which appeared in a recent issue of the Crimson, is interesting:

ATLANTIC HIGHLANDS, N.J., July 16. -- The members of the Catholic Church of St. Agnes, recently erected in this town, proposed to hold a fair early in August for the benefit of the church, and the Rev.

--------
1399-> CINCINNATI LOSES TIME TO BOSTON.
BOSTON, May 30. -- Staley had the Cincinnatis completely at his mercy this morning, and after Holliday's home-run hit in the first inning they could do nothing with him. The Bostons batted freely and fielded fanitiessly. Slattery roused the crowd by a one-handed catch while running at full speed. Radbuern and Clarkson were pitted against each other in the afternoon game. The former was given quite an ovation.

1400-> HENRY F. COXE INSANE.; THE YOUNG INVENTOR PLACED IN A LUNATIC ASYLUM.
PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 15. -- Henry F. Coxe, the young Philadelphia inventor, who attempted to commit suicide by cutting his throat in the woods at Glen Summit, Penn., Thursday night, is now an inmate of Kirkbride's lunatic asylum, hopelessly insane.

1401-> OUR GREAT GAME FISH.; THE BLACK BASS AND WHERE AND HOW IT MAY BE CAUGHT.
In a recent article in the American Angler of this city on "Hints on Black Bass Fishing," Dr. James A. Henshall says that the black bass has become the most important game fish in America. It is distributed all over the country and a man by traveling may fish for it practically the year round. Dr. Henshall says:

1402-> GRIDIRONS AT SQUANTUM; PROSTRATE BEFORE A RHODE ISLAND CLAMBAKE. A WASHINGTON CLUB THAT LIVES CHIEFLY TO DINE ENJOYS THE HOSPITALITIES OF TWO PROVIDENCE GENTLEMEN AND STILL SURVIVES.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 1. -- Seven times a year, and always in the Winter, Spring, and Fall, a queer flag is flung to the breeze in Washington. To him who sees it for the first time it may suggest piracy, but to those who know it the black gridiron on a white field is suggestive only of good cheer and innocent merriment. This cross-barred and severe-looking flag is that of the Gridiron Club.

1403-> Editorial Article 4 -- No Title
There has been a strange disposition shown by the officers of the New-York Life Insurance Company to treat the Merzbacher defalcation as a mere business incident, and not a very serious one at that, inasmuch as they think it will involve no permanent loss to the company, instead of regarding it as a crime in which the public has a higher concern than any one who may have suffered a mere pecuniary damage.

1404-> THE FRUITS OF PROTECTION; STARTLING DEPRECIATION IN OHIO FARM LANDS. THE COST OF ALL IMPROVEMENTS WIPED OUT AND THE SELLING VALUATION DECREASED -- A DECLINE IN AGRICULTURAL POPULATION.
CLEVELAND, Aug. 15. -- The work of the State Decennial Board of Equalization is completed, and the people of Ohio and the country have a chance to study the changes in realty values in Ohio in the last ten years. This board is the final court of adjudication in the matter of property valuation for the purposes of taxation in the State.

1405-> WONDERS OF TIME'S WHIRLIGIG.; MEN THROWN OUT AS PAUPERS BECOME SOLID CITIZENS.
In an old book of records of Sharon Township, Medina County, Ohio, one of the flourishing counties of the Western Reserve, is found the following order given by officers who were styled "Overseers of the Poor." This is only a specimen, one of many of which include women as well as men: 
--------
1406-> HER POINT OF VIEW.
The goldenrod is blossoming in the field and by the country wayside, and in town the merchants are advertising the first Fall dress goods -- two infallible signs that midsummer is past. To-day is high-water mark at the Summer resorts -- from now on the season rapidly wanes -- and people are beginning to think of the homecoming and making plans for Autumn and Winter activity.

1407-> BACCARAT STILL THE TALK; THE PRINCE AND A POSSIBLE SUIT FOR DIVORCE. ENGLISH VIEWS OF CUMMING'S MARRIAGE -- PARLIAMENT AND THE BALKANS -- LIBERALS SUPPORT THE EDUCATIONAL BILL. BY THE COMMERCIAL CABLE FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.
LONDON, June 13. -- Nothing has happened during the week to depose baccarat from its proud place as the leading issue in the minds of the British public. Although these dispatches from the beginning have laid stress upon the inevitable political and social consequences to the Prince of Wales as the most important thing about the whole case, these consequences are already far graver and wider in scope than could have been anticipated.

1408-> THE THEATRES IN SUMMER; MUSICAL AND DRAMATIC TOPICS IN PARIS. TSCHAIKOWSKY TO COME TO AMERICA AGAIN WITH A CHOIR -- GOSSIP OF THE LOCAL STAGE -- THEATRICAL NEWS FROM CHICAGO.
LONDON, June 13. -- The Sullivan interest, not to say clique, offended because Augustus Harris did not choose Sir Arthur to compose the music for "Kenilworth," has been mollified by the fact that the Queen has "commanded" that the "Golden Legend" be performed at the Royal Albert Hall on July 9 at a concert to be given in honor of the visit of Emperor William of Germany to England.

1410-> MR. BRICE'S ELIGIBILITY.; A FORMER CASE WHICH SENATOR SHERMAN OUGHT TO REMEMBER.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28. -- The plan which Senator Sherman suggests to the Chairman of the Republican State Central Committee of Ohio as the one most likely to lead to an investigation of the eligibility of Senator-elect Calvin S. Brice brings to mind the parallel case of Adelbert Ames, Senator from Mississippi from April 1, 1870, until he resigned in 1874. 
--------
1411-> NEWS ABOUT RAILROADS; RICHMOND TERMINAL SAID TO HAVE BOUGHT MONON. CHICAGO DISPATCHES SAY THAT CALVIN S. BRICE HAS COMPLETED THE PURCHASE OF THE LOUISVILLE, NEW-ALBANY AND CHICAGO ROAD.
According to the news from Chicago yesterday the Louisville, New-Albany and Chicago (Monon) Road is to pass into the control of the Richmond Terminal.

WESTPORT, Essex County, N.Y. June 30. -- One of the most disgraceful appointments made by the Harrison Administration is that of Edwin B. Low as Postmaster in this village. It was opposed almost solidly by the respectable Republicans of Westport on the ground that Low's reputation for honesty was bad and his habits so intemperate as to render him totally unfit to discharge the duties of the position. 
--------
1414-> HIS PET SPANIEL KILLED HIM.; AN INDIANA FARMER THE VICTIM OF HYDROPHOBIA.
FORT WAYNE, Ind., June 30. -- A clearly-defined case of hydrophobia is that of Reuben Drew, a prominent farmer, seventy-six years old, who died in convulsions at his home, eight miles west of Fort Wayne, yesterday, after terrible torture. 
--------
1415-> THE NEW LINE TO BRAZIL.; A NUMBER OF PROMINENT NEW-YORKERS INTERESTED IN IT.
Preliminary steps have been taken toward organizing the Brazil and New-York Steamship Company, which proposes, if its plans are brought to completion, to set in operation a line of vessels between this port and Brazil. Editor A.H. de Paula Coelho of the United State of Brazil, whose scheme for developing trade between the two countries was outlined in THE TIMES about a month ago, has interested several American capitalists in his scheme. 
--------
1416-> THE CHICAGO PLAYHOUSES.
CHICAGO, Aug. 1. -- Though there has been nothing new in the world of music and the drama, already may be heard the sounds of preparation for the coming season. Monday night the first "Fall opening" will take place at the Grand Opera House, when Thatcher's Minstrels and Rich and Harris's farce-comedians will offer "Tuxedo," in which minstrelsy and farce-comedy are combined. 
--------
1417-> NAMED AFTER GALVESTON.; THE FINEST REVENUE MARINE STEAMER IN THE SERVICE.
BALTIMORE, June 13. -- The new Revenue Marine steamer Galveston will be ready for an official trial, it is expected, in the course of the coming month. The Galveston is the handsomest revenue cutter yet designed for the Government. In general appearance she resembles a fast torpedo gunboat cruiser. She is 195 feet in length, with lines as clean as a racehorse, high freeboard, without a break from the bow to the stern. 
--------
1418-> REPENTANT FOR HER CRIME.; MARGARET LANE MAKES PARTIAL AMENDS FOR HER DISHONESTY.
PITTSBURG, May 15. -- There was another interesting step in the case of Margaret Lane, the wealthy woman who, several days ago, confessed to having stolen a watch at Cleveland in 1874, for the theft of which John B. Gassaway, an Allegheny druggist, wrongfully served two years in the Ohio penitentiary.

1419-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
Now that President WAGSTAFF of the bridge promises to study the problem of better accommodation for late travel, there is another point of interest to those who use the bridge cars at night that we should like to see him take up. It is the special kindness that seems reserved by the train hands and guards for drunken loafers, and those not always men at that. 
--------
1420-> THEY ARE ALL VOTERS.; NONE OTHERS NEED APPLY FOR CITY WORK IN ST. LOUIS.
ST. LOUIS, June 30. -- The political machinery at the City Hall seems to be getting into first-class working order. Street Commissioner Murphy is carrying out his idea of politics in office to the letter, and no alien or non-voter can escape, unless he is satisfied to indulge in a little deceit. 
--------
1421-> CHANGES IN THE PULPIT.; RESIGNATIONS OF MINISTERS AND NEW APPOINTMENTS OF PASTORS.
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., March 14. -- The Rev. Dr. R.W. Van Schoick, Presiding Elder of the Wyoming District of the Methodist Episcopal Church, has accepted the appointment of pastor of the First Methodist Church of Albion, Mich. Dr. Van Schoick formerly served in the itineracy as pastor of Methodist churches at Norwich and New-Berlin and other points in Central New-York. 
--------
1422-> HOW TO CATCH THIEVES.
The history of all great crimes proves that the difficulty of convicting and punishing a thief increases in geometrical proportions with the amount stolen, and that when the amount reaches to millions conviction is impossible without the aid of public opinion aroused by the persistent and long-continued efforts of an unbuyable press. 
--------
1423-> PRINTERS CONTEST FOR PRIZES.; ANNUAL PICNIC AND GAMES OF THEIR BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION.
The eleventh annual picnic and games of the Printers' Benevolent Association were held at Sulzer's Harlem River Park yesterday. There was a large crowd in attendance and the affair proved a grand success. In the afternoon the games were contested. In past years the amateur athletes of this vicinity were allowed to compete, but this was not the case yesterday. 
--------
1424-> BURGLARS IN PETTICOATS.; TWO RESPECTABLE WOMEN PLEAD GUILTY TO THE CHARGE.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., July 29. -- Burglars in petticoats are the latest novelty, and the two Milwaukee women who undertook to practice the profession were flat failures. Both burglars are respectable married women. Mr. and Mrs. James Robinson live at 112 Sixth Street. Mr. Robinson is a railroad engineer and was out on the road Monday night. 
--------
1425-> FORESTRY AND MORALS.
It is scarcely to be expected that the forestry associations, however strenuous their efforts, will be able to make way against the tide of progress which is rapidly converting the timber lands of this country into farms and city lots; but it is not unreasonable to hope that the tendency toward the substitution of slate and metal roofing for the pine shingle of our fathers may be at least temporarily cheeked if not altogether overcome. 
--------
1426-> THE CONVICT LEASE PLAN; IT HAS RESULTED IN SERIOUS TROUBLE IN THE SOUTH. A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE TENNESSEE LEGISLATURE CALLED TO ABOLISH THE SYSTEM -- DISSATISFACTION AMONG THE GEORGIA MINERS.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., July 29. -- Gov. Buchanan to-day announced that the Legislature would be called to meet in extra session Aug. 17, and that the whole penitentiary question would be referred to the body, including the regulation of the penitentiary, the erection of a new State prison, the removal of the main prison from this city, the management by the lessees, and the regulation of convict labor. 
--------
1427-> MR. WHITE'S TERMS.
It is announced that Mr. ANDREW D. WHITE, after consultation with his friends and family, has telegraphed to Senator HISCOCK that, while he is not a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor in the sense of seeking it, yet he will accept it if it be offered to him unanimously and if the platform shall be such as he approves. 
--------
1428-> Article 7 -- No Title
THE GRINGO. -- There is a popular delusion to the effect that the Chileans call themselves "the English of South America." No one within the memory of man ever heard them do so, and the statement seems to have had its birth in the self-flattering imagination of some Anglo-Saxon writer. 
--------
1429-> ELEVATED ROAD ACCIDENTS; TWO HAPPENED YESTERDAY ON THE SIXTH AVENUE LINE. A DERAILMENT AND A REAR-END COLLISION -- PASSENGERS BADLY SHAKEN UP -- THE RESULT OF SOMEBODY'S GROSS CARELESSNESS.
There were two accidents on the Sixth Avenue elevated railroad yesterday. One was a derailment and the other was a rear-end collision. Both narrowly escaped being attended by loss of life. The derailment was without explanation. The collision was apparently due to gross negligence. Each served, in its own way, to illustrate anew the constant and imminent danger to which travelers on the elevated roads are exposed.

1430-> GIANTS DEFEAT QUAKERS; AN INTERESTING GAME IN PHILADELPHIA YESTERDAY. HEAVY BATTING ON BOTH SIDES, BUT THE NEW-YORKS WIN BY SUPERIOR FIELD WORK -- BROOKLYN TAKES A GAME FROM BOSTON.
PHILADELPHIA, May 1. -- Five pitchers took part in to-day's game, and the New-Yorks won after an interesting struggle. Clarke was injured in the opening inning, and O'Rourke was called in to catch. He couldn't hold Rusie's fast delivery, and Welch was put in. Later on Welch couldn't check astreak of heavy batting indulged in by the home players, and Mt. Staten Island Sharrott relieved him. 
--------
1431-> CONGRESSMAN HOLMAN'S VIEWS.; HE SAYS HARRISON WILL BE RENOMINATED AND DEFEATED.
CHICAGO, July 29. -- Congressman Holman of Indiana, who is here, declares that Harrison will be renominated, and that it is absurd to think of Elaine as a candidate. 
--------
1432-> HOME CAPITAL CROWDED OUT.; FOREIGN INSURANCE COMPANIES INTRENCHED IN CALIFORNIA.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 29. -- The retirement from business, within the last year, of four of the insurance companies organized in this State, and the recently-rumored possible retirement of two or three of the remaining local companies, are causing sensational talk and speculation among home underwriters, as to the probable future of the insurance business. 
--------
1433-> RAISING THE BOODLE CRY.; FORAKER'S MANAGERS SAY THE SHERMANITES ARE USING MONEY.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 14. -- The managers of ex-Gov. Foraker's Senatorial campaign gave out last night some information calculated to produce a sensation and put the friends of Senator Sherman in a new, if not pleasant, position. It is charged that for some time past it has been known that influences have been brought into the contest suggestive of boodle, but that heretofore nothing could be learned calculated to justify the making of the charge. 
--------
1434-> SOLD UNDER FORECLOSURE.
KANSAS CITY, Mo. April 29. -- A special to the Star from Topeka, Kan., says: "The Chicago, Kansas and Nebraska Railroad was sold this morning by the United States Marshal to satisfy the mortgage of $26,000,000 against she company in favor of the United States Trust Company of New York. The road was bought by Edward W. Sheldon of New York, facing for the trust company, for $25,232,000, he appraised value of the road. 
--------
1435-> A BUSY WEEK FOR THE AMATEURS.; INTERESTING EXHIBITIONS OF THE WORK OF THE PHOTOGRAPHERS.
Amateur photographers have had a most busy week and have fairly reveled in photographic things. The joint exhibition of the Boston Camera Club and the New-York and Philadelphia Societies of Amateur Photographers in the Fifth Avenue Art Galleries, Fifth Avenue, near Thirty-fourth Street, has attracted a large number of photographers, artists, and those who are fond of looking at pictures.

1436-> BROWN UNIVERSITY.
PROVIDENCE, R.I., May 30. -- In the game at Springfield last Wednesday with Trinity, Brown won -- 5 to 4. The nine played the University of Michigan on Lincoln Field on Thursday, winning that game by a score of 5 to 2. The nine is now in quite a crippled condition. Sexton will be unable to pitch any more this year. 
--------
1437-> Editorial Article 3 -- No Title
The transfer of the custody of the official election returns of Connecticut from the Legislature to the Governor, who has properly no concern with them, would not be a matter of much consequence, apart from its utterly unlawful character, but for the suspicion that there is some crooked design in it.

1438-> FORTUNE SMILES AT LAST.; SARAH CASSIDY OF PORT JERVIS MADE RICH BY HER BROTHER'S WILL.
MIDDLETOWN, N.Y., April 29. -- Sarah Cassidy, a respectable Irish servant girl at Port Jervis, started for Portland, Oregon, to-night, to claim a handsome fortune left to her by the will of deceased brother.

1440-> PENNSYLVANIA SNAKE STORIES.; THE SCHUYLKILL VALLEY OVERRUN WITH VENOMOUS REPTILES.
READING, Penn., June 13. -- Snakes seem to have overrun many parts of the Schuylkill Valley this season, more than they have done probably since the first settlements were made by the pioneer colonists. Blacksnakes are the most plentiful, but a large number of copperheads and rattlesnakes and some other varieties have also made their appearance. 
--------
1441-> EIGHTY-ONE YEARS OF JOURNALISM AT HARVARD.; PAPERS THAT LIVED ONLY A FEW MONTHS AND THOSE THAT HAVE LASTED FOR YEARS -- INTERESTING NEWS FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 30. -- Harvard is so eminently the leader in college journalism that a brief consideration of the development of this art with her cannot fail to be of interest to the general reader. Many obstacles obstructed the growth of journalism at the university, and one and another earnest effort to establish magazines and papers failed from lack of support. 
--------
1442-> MR. MURTHA'S PLAN.; HE HAS DISCOVERRD A WAY TO "BEAT" THE CIVIL SERVICE LAW.
There are ten or twelve men now employed in the Brooklyn City Works Department who have never passed a civil service examination, and yet they were appointed under a section of the civil service regulations. This seeming anomaly means that the local dispensers of patronage have discovered a way to "beat" the civil service law in a limited manner.

There has been more activity among the boat clubs in the vicinity of New-York this Spring than in any corresponding period in years. The reason for this seemingly new life in boating circles is simple. Never before has there been such a promising season in prospect at this time of the year, and consequently such a great Incentive for amateur oarsmen to train for coming events. 
--------
1446-> FOREIGN THEATRICAL GOSSIP.
LONDON, May 30. -- The event of the week has been the one hundredth performance of Sullivan and Sturgis's "Ivanhoe" at the Royal English Opera House. This performance took place on Monday last.

PHILADELPHIA, May 16. -- A party of the university's mechanical engineering students has been away this week on a New-England trip under the direction of Prof. H.W.

Prince GEORGE of Greece shows good sense, on his own part or on the part of somebody else, in assuming an incognito as part of his traveling outfit in this country. It would have been churlish, of course, for him to repel a demonstration upon the part of his fellow-Greeks in Chicago, but he has at least escaped the awful hospitalities of Aldermen.

The proceedings at the recent convention of the Republican League of Massachusetts in Boston had a very exhilarating effect upon the Boston Traveller.

--------
1453-> PITIABLE UNIVERSITY DONS.
Speaking generally, a university don abroad is a pitiable sight. He knows neither German nor Italian, and even when he professes to know French he has only to risk a few phrases in that language to show conclusively that he does not. In a few years he forgets his Greek entirely, and would mind it difficult to read an easy Latin book without a crib.

There are indications that Gov. HILL is getting "rattled" in his effort to play bigger politics than he has been accustomed to. A month ago it was assumed that he would do as he pleased with the Democratic majority in the Legislature, but now it looks very much as though he would not be able to handle it just as he pleases.

In its destruction was involved a loss of property that will aggregate a round quarter or a million dollars. The fire was caused by an explosion of benzine vapor in the shop of a tailor.

1463-> A "LAWYER COP" IN COURT.; TO HIS DISGUST THE JUDGE DECLINES TO TAKE THE LAW FROM HIM.
Officer Michael Mahoney of the West Thirty-seventh Street Station has a penchant for argument that has earned for him the title of the "lawyer cop." What he does not know about the law he thinks is little and worthless. Officer Mahoney has a great antipathy for street peddlers. He arrests them whenever he gets a chance, and makes it his business to get the chance often.

Mr. Chittenden's recent magazine papers on topics connected with the Administration of Lincoln have called forth many requests for their expansion.

Important developments in the affairs of the Union Pacific Railroad are expected this week. A meeting of the recently-appointed financiering committee, of which J.

ALBANY, March 14. -- A resolution calling for the final adjournment of the Legislature not later than April 30 will probably be introduced in the House next week. It is possible that April 23 will be the date fixed upon by the Democrats, who are desirous of winding up the session sooner than the Republicans did last year, in order to make a little political capital.

It appears that the Philadelphia Press was assisted by the Albany Journal in the benevolent work of enlarging Mr. NIEDRINGHAUS'S tin-plate factory in St. Louis during his visit to this city. "Already the St. Louis Stamping Company," says the Journal, "is engaged in the manufacture of tin plate and giving employment to 350 persons."

1468-> A WIDE THEATRICAL FIELD.; THE MANY ENTERPRISES CONDUCTED BY MANAGER CHARLES FROHMAN.
New-York may fairly claim to lead the world in the theatrical, as in many other lines of business. The most extensive enterprises ever undertaken in the way of furnishing amusements for the public have their headquarters here, and the biggest of them is under the sole control and direction of Charles Frohman, brother of Daniel Frohman of the Lyceum Theatre.

Mr. E.M. Reed, Vice President of the New-York, New-Haven and Hartford Railroad, yesterday denied emphatically the report that that road and the New-York and New-England were to be consolidated. He declared that such a scheme had never been brought to the attention of the Directors of his road, and that, so far as he knew, no petition for power to consolidate will be presented to the Legislatures of this State, of Massachusetts, or of Connecticut.

Emillio Rabasa, one of the most distinguished political leaders in Mexico, passed through the city to-day on his way to New-York, where he will spend about ten days.

1475-> CHARGES AGAINST A JUDGE.; HE IS ACCUSED OF RENDERING A DECISION IN FAVOR OF GAMBLERS.
ST. LOUIS, July 30. -- The controversy growing out of the decision of Judge Claiborne that the law closing the poolrooms is unconstitutional has assumed a decidedly sensational phase. Charges and countercharges are made that would lead an unenlightened person to think there was not an honest or decent man in public office or in the legal profession in the city.

Apparently Mr. HARRISON'S Administration prefers that whatever is scandalous in its experience shall be investigated by the Democratic House. It has been accumulating a number of tasks for that body that will be taken up, we may be sure, with entire alacrity, with as much impartiality as such work usually commands, and with opportunities for making party capital for which the gentlemen in power are to be thanked.

1477-> AN OLD ENGLISH CUSTOM; HOW POPE NIGHT IS CELEBRATED IN PORTSMOUTH. IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE GUNPOWDER PLOT OF 1605 -- FORMER FIERCE HOSTILITIES BETWEEN BANDS OF BOYS.
PORTSMOUTH, N.H., Nov. 14. -- It is believed that this is the only place in the United States where the old English custom of celebrating Pope Night is continued yearly in remembrance of the discovery of the plot of Guy Fawkes to blow up the Parliament House in London, with the King, Lords, and Commons, on Nov. 5, 1605, in revenge for the penal laws against Roman Catholics.

1478-> A COFFEE ADULTERANT.; THE MARKET BECOMING FLOODED WITH A COUNTERFEIT BEAN.
PHILADELPHIA, April 29. -- Counterfeit coffee is the latest addition to adulterants. It is a manufactured bean, identical in appearance with genuine green or roasted coffee, and dealers in this city have recently been flooded with it. It is almost impossible to detect the fraud with the eye: It is apparently a hard-baked composition, molded by machinery in the same manner as druggists' pills.

1479-> DANGERS OF SMALLPOX.; TWO CASES IN THIS CITY TRACED TO THE STEAMER WAESLAND.
When the steamer Waesland was on her way from Antwerp to this port a child of one of the steerage passengers was taken ill with smallpox. The child was isolated as far as possible under the circumstances, and some of the steerage passengers were vaccinated. As there were 808 in the steerage, it was almost impossible to vaccinate all, as there was not enough virus on board.

1480-> POLITICAL NOTES.
The Chicago Tribune believes that political careers should begin early in life or not at all. This it said referring to the candidacy of Gen. Palmer for the Senatorship.

1483-> HOW A DISTRICT WAS LOST.; THE MISTAKE MADE BY CHARLES S. BAKER'S OPPONENTS LAST YEAR.
ROCHESTER, N.Y., Oct. 14. -- It has been a source of wonder and dismay to many Republicans in this State and at Washington that at the last election of Congressman this district was lost to the Republicans, although Charles S. Baker had carried the district twice by something like 5,000 majority, once defeating the very man who has now been elected on the Democratic ticket.

1484-> Editorial Article 6 -- No Title
As reported, the result of the Newark election Tuesday is 199 plurality for Mayor HAYNES, who was elected two years ago by a majority of over 1,200. If the 273 Democrats who professed to be opposed to ring rule, but who persisted in voting for an "independent" candidate, had cast their votes for LEHLBACH, he would have been elected, and the power of the corrupt "bosses" would have been broken.

The Brooklyn Union League Club held a very largely attended meeting last night and, after electing ninety-one new members, started in to discuss a proposition to establish a cafe and to permit the sale of liquor in the club on Sunday.

The revelations made in the course of an action against an insurance company at the pre sent Manchester assizes have forced into the public notice as hideous a traffic in human life as ever disgraced a civilized country. Gambling in lives has in many Lancashire towns, but chiefly in Blackburn, long been a lucrative occupation.

CHICAGO, April 13. -- It is a sorry outlook for the meeting of the Advisory Board of the Western Traffic Association, which takes place tomorrow.

In the course of the coming week the relative merits of the much-discussed forty-six-foot yachts ought to be pretty well settled. Tuesday the Atlantic Yacht Club will start the Summer's fun between the new candidates for honors. The Nautilus, Mineola, Uvira, Sayonara, Gloriana, and Jessica have been entered, and others will doubtless be on hand when the preparatory gun is fired at 10:30 A.M.

DENVER, Col., Dec. 14. -- The fact that Dr. Graves was in a very disturbed state when he arrived in Denver was testified to by three witnesses for the prosecution to-day. These witnesses were Mrs. Worrell, Jr., her mother, Mrs. Carrier, and her grandmother, Mrs. Allen.

ITHACA, N.Y., June 13. -- Within the last few days the prospect of Cornell being successful in the coming races has taken on a far brighter aspect. Two weeks ago Courtney found that his men were not living up strictly to training rules and were getting in bad trim. He had to give them a severe reprimand, and this general stirring up was not without its effect.

When Michael F. Dwyer paid $25,000 for Potomac at the closing-out sale of the racing stable of the late August Belmont a great many people thought it was an injudicious purchase. "Potomac will not stay over a distance of ground," said these doubters, "for the St. Blaises will not train on." But Mr. Dwyer apparently know what he was doing.

ATLANTA, Ga., Dec. 28. -- The two men who are just now being most severely criticised by the press of the State are Gov. Hill and Speaker Crisp. Somehow the impression has gotten out that these names, for good or ill, are entangled. The recent pardon of Supervisor Welch by Gov. Hill is regarded as too flagrant for even party loyalty to extenuate.
