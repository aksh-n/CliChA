157-> Cary Grant and Irene Dunne Play a 'Penny Serenade' at the Music Hall -- 'Blood and Sand,' With Tyrone Power, at the Roxy -- New Film at the Globe
When you go to the Music Hall this time, take along a couple of blotters and a sponge. In fact, if you are prone to easy weeping, you might even take along a washtub. And don't be disturbed if your neighbor, unprovided, drips and splatters all over you. For this time the comic muse very frequently gives way to tears. This time Cary Grant and Irene Dunne, whose previous cinematic marriages have been more or less on the frivolous and nicely indecent side, are so blissfully and properly united that it takes a tragedy to threaten briefly to tear them apart. This time the new picture is Columbia's "Penny Serenade."When you think about it coolly and dispassionately—and after an interval of at least an hour—you can't help but feel that somebody has slipped a fast one over on you. Maybe it is Producer George Stevens, who has put together a film which employs not one but six or seven of the recognized sob-story tricks. Maybe it is Miss Dunne, who originally succumbs to one of the most severe cases of galloping nostalgia we have ever witnessed on the screen. And maybe it is Mr. Grant, that worldly and jocular chap, who shamelessly permits a tiny tot to play "Home, Sweet Home" on his heart-strings. The thing is you never suspect these people are going quite so soft on you until—bam!—they are wallowing in sentiment and your eyes are leaking like a sieve.But that's the way it is. From the moment that Miss Dunne sadly turns on the old gramaphone and, to the plaintive strains of "You Were Meant for Me," the scene fades back to her first meeting with Mr. Grant, you may recognize that you are in for a reminiscent wrench. Then, as she successively replenishes the music box with such nostalgic tunes as "Just a Memory," "Missouri Waltz," "Poor Butterfly," "Blue Heaven," etc., right out of a book, you follow the couple as they marry, suffer countless little woes, buy a country newspaper, adopt a baby and finally lose the child they love so much.And slowly, without being aware of it, you drift with them and the film from brittle, sophisticated comedy to out-and-out softy stuff, from the quixotic plighting of their troth at a New Year's Eve party to the first fearful bathing of baby in the familiar new-parents comedy vein. And then you are sniffling and gulping as little daughter takes part in her first school play and you know that the teacher's promise that she can be "an angel next year" is irony. Somehow, it all goes down, despite a woefully overlong script—all but Mr. Grant's recalcitrance after the little one is gone. It's hard to believe that a man could treat his ever-loving wife so wretchedly, at a time when both would be drawn even closer together by grief. And their sudden joyful willingness to adopt another child is open to doubt.But some very credible acting on the part of Mr. Grant and Miss Dunne is responsible in the main for the infectious quality of the film. Edgar Buchanan, too, gives an excellent performance as a good-old-Charlie friend, and Beulah Bondi is sensible as an orphanage matron. Heart-warming is the word for both of them. As a matter of fact, the whole picture deliberately cozies up to the heart. Noel Coward once drily observed how extraordinarily potent cheap music is. That is certainly true of "Penny Serenade." PENNY SERENADE, screen play by Morrie Ryskind; based on the story by Martha Cheavens; produced and directed by George Stevens for Columbia Pictures.

352-> At the Music Hall
The Music Hall is going back on a spun sugar diet this week with "That Uncertain Feeling." Whipped up by those master confectioners, Ernst Lubitsch and Donald Ogden Stewart, it is so light that were one to breathe on it, it quite probably would vanish. But enough's enough and "That Uncertain Feeling" is just too much candy. The more's the pity because, as a pinprick satire on psychoanalysis, the film gets off to a fine start with Stewartian witticisms crackling on all sides. But if Mr. Stewart sets out to prove that psychiatry is not the newest thing under the sun, he also manages to show that neither is his script greatly different from all the husband against wife melees of which, heaven knows, we have had a plenty of late.Mind you, it has hilarious moments, especially in the early sequences when the dialogue has edge. In telling the story of a charming housewife who develops hiccups after six years of wedde life, Mr. Stewart treats the neuroses lightly. He sends his lady to a psychoanalyst where she confesses that her husband's boorish sleeping habits annoy her greatly, for she, it seems, is sleepless. That worthy, after profound deliberation, comes to an important conclusion; wake up the husband! The means appear shortly in the bumptious person of Burgess Meredith who remarks "pfui!" to quite defenseless paintings, insults everybody, and is the greatest pianist in the world—when alone. From then on the film becomes just another history of marital fisticuffs with the husband, of course, the winner.If the point is made to Mr. Stewart's satisfaction, it isn't to ours. Nor does Mr. Lubitsch's legendary "touch" give it great impetus. Here and there, the director's hand is shown quickly and deftly as in that fantastic dinner party where the husband flatters his foreign guests with a phrase of welcome and launches the assemblage in a torrent of Hungarian. But for the most part there is too much dialogue, too little camera witticism; too much Mr. Stewart and not enough Mr. Lubitsch. With the exception of Merle Oberon, who still has something to learn as a comedienne, the cast is excellent. Melvyn Douglas, the perennial husband, carries his role impeccably; Burgess Meredith gives a highly comic portrait of a contemptuous artist among philistines, and Alan Mobray is a blandly foolish psychoanalyst.But the fact is that this sort of frivolous fluff is extremely perishable. Though "That Uncertain Feeling" starts out fresh as a daisy it does wilt considerably in an hour and a half.

For this low-budget Universal picture, which is like a hundred others off the line, is no more than a routine program-filler, no stronger than its weakest cliché, about a free-and-easy old-time flier who teaches at an aviation school and discovers—at the fearful climax, naturally—that his most neglected pupil is his own son.Edmund Lowe and Frankie Thomas play the father and son, respectively, and William Gargan, Frank Albertson and Peggy Moran make what little they can of other wooden roles. But no matter how low your standards, "Flying Cadets" still won't rate a passing grade. FLYING CADETS, original screen play by Joseph West, Roy Chanslor and Stanley Rubin; directed by Erle C.

663-> 'Adam Had Four Sons' at the Music Hall -- Comedy at the Capitol -- Interesting Drama at Palace
Another tale of self-sacrificial devotion extended through the years is again occupying the screen of the Radio City Music Hall. And, similar to "Cheers for Miss Bishop," which made way for it yesterday, Columbia's "Adam Had Four Sons" is heavily charged with sentiment. It lays stress on the simple virtues and wrings the tender heart. It even is comfortably set in bygone days for nostalgic effect. But, unlike its immediate predecessor, the current attraction has, at least, a weak but workable dramatic core and it is blessed with the talented Ingrid Bergman in the leading and only significant role.This time the self-effacing heroine is a gentle and affectionate foreign girl who comes to live with an American family back about 1905 and be governess to the family's four sons. She sticks by through the death of the mother, the financial failure of the father's business and eventually through a sharp domestic crisis provoked by the unfaithful wife of one of the lads. And, in the end, she marries the father, whom she has obviously loved all the time. It is, if you are interested in origins, taken from Charles Bonner's novel, "Legacy."Miss Bergman, as the governess, does manage in a restrained and understanding performance to convey the devotion of a woman for the boys whom she helps to man's estate and from her alone does one catch a sincere emotional response. But Warner Baxter plays the father in a routine, surface way; none of the several young actors who play the boys stand out above the rest, and the norm lacks distinction, indeed; and Susan Hayward so coyly overacts the romantically unlicensed mischief-maker that often she is plain ridiculous. On the whole, "Adam Had Four Sons" is an antique tear-jerker — one of those dramas all dressed up in old clothes which never gets anywhere. ADAM HAD FOUR SONS; screen play by William Hurlbut and Michael Blankfort; from the novel, "Legacy," by Charles Bonner; directed by Gregory Ratoff; produced by Robert Sherwood for Columbia.

1422-> At the Rialto
As an inducement to get Maria Montez out of street clothes and into a sarong Universal has slapped together a few palm-thatched huts, larded a script with Polynesian double-talk and made "South of Tahiti," now at the Rialto. We suspect that whoever named this tropical holiday must have been purposely vague. Certainly the paradise, invaded by Brian Donlevy, Broderick Crawford and Andy Devine, as a trio of brawling pearl hunters, is like nothing on land or sea. The chief, for example, speaks fluent English, picked up from a passing white tourist; tribal ceremonies for the induction of young boys into the prerogatives of manhood resemble something Albertina Rasch thought up, and Miss Montez —another Eve, no doubt—is buddies with all the beasts of the jungle.All this, of course, is an excuse to show that Miss Montez has a figure not inferior to Dorothy Lamour's. But after the script writer has reached his wit's end half a dozen times and finally winds up matters by putting the Messrs. Donlevy, Crawford and Devine into flowery party dress, the excuse not only wears thin—it evaporates. SOUTH OF TAHITI, screen play by Gerald Geraghty, from an original story by Ainsworth Morgan; directed by George Waggner; released by Universal. At the Rialto.Bob . . . . .
